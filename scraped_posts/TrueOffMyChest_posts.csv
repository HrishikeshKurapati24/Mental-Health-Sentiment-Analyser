1,"I am in my mid 30's, female if it matters, and I suffer paranoia. I'm so sick of it. It affects my every day life I constantly think someone is after me, someone is trying to set me up for what I have no idea. I've never done anything wrong. I think I'm going to be pulled over but it will be someone just pretending to be undercover cops. I'm paranoid about driving I don't know why. I'm paranoid my partner will leave me for someone better - this has never happened and I'm quite sure it won't but the paranoia is there. Only my Mum, Dad and partner and 2 close friends know otherwise I keep it to myself. I can't any more but I also don't want everyone I know to know any of this. Why? Because then I'd be paranoid again. I don't expect anyone to understand I just want to say how sick of it I am and feel free to comment anything that could be helpful. I'm medicated for it and just doubled my dose at the doctor's request, it worked for a week but now overly paranoid AGAIN. I'm just sick of it and knowing I will spend the rest of my life like this I hate it. I just don't want to be like this forever. Am i justified in wallowing in my misery just for a little while? How do I fix it? How can I feel better about things that are probably never going to happen? ",
2,"As a kid, my mom taught me the basics of sewing. Nothing fancy, straight stitches and quilt squares mainly. I can count on one hand the number of garments I'd ever sewn before this year.

I decided to design and make my own ren faire costume. Trying to find the styles I liked in my size felt like either I had to break the bank or give up my vision. Plus, I'm just delusional enough to look at something I've never done before and say ""I'll learn along the way."" And dear g-d have I learned. 

I had to learn how to sew in fasteners, button holes, and lacing. My hands have bled from pricking myself with needles and pins so much. Every few days, my son comes in the room begging me to let him have a turn because his wolfie needs a shirt (3 years old, so I'm not gonna argue his logic). I broke my old sewing machine mid-project, so I had to finish the chemise and start the bodice all by hand while I waited for the new one to arrive. 

I kept feeling like I should give up, but I pushed through and soon I'll have a functional outfit that I designed by hand and made to fit my vision and it feels *incredible*. Putting it on, I'm able to forget the imperfections and doubts I had and just admire the things *I* made. 

It also made me aware of the people in my life who help and support me. My husband has been a saint, taking over all the night time routines so I can have some quiet work time. A dear friend, a reenactor hobbyist, gives me advice on construction methods and heaps compliments on me . My family gave me encouragement and advice when I lamented my broken sewing machine. I'm extremely lucky and privileged to have so many people who love and support me.

All in all, it just has helped me get off my phone/PS5 and given me something more productive to do. When I'm done with this, I'm going to take the skills and keep making new things! Maybe I'll share pictures in the future!",
3,I haven't noticed it in my teen years. I just happened to look in the mirror and started noticing strands of hair coming in on my shoulders. ,
4,"Me (24F) and my mom (53F) always got comments that we look so much like each other. The thing is, my mom’s on the heavier side, due to some serious medical issues. She can’t normally exercise, and believe me, she’s put in real effort to try to keep her weight down, but the sad reality is she can’t do much in her current situation.

Well, about two years ago, I was at my worst weight wise- I could blame it on a number of factors, but mostly I was just lazy. That’s when I noticed that my face could unlock my mom’s phone. I mentioned it to my mom, and she seemed kind of happy, and I left it at that.

Well, I started to lose weight because I wanted to feel better, and I’ve been a little over 1 year on a diet and exercise regimen, and my mom was very happy for me, complimenting my appearance, and over all just happy for me. 

That’s when I realized her phone stopped unlocking when I put my face in front of it. I felt bad, and now I quickly type her password before she sees me, and I’ll just smile and say ‘It unlocked again’ whenever she’s feeling down. It’s stupid, and I feel bad lying, but she loves being compared to me and I just want her to feel better. ",
5,I get no girls. I just thought I'd lay that off my chest. Ok bye.,
6,I’m 18 and my boyfriend is 20. I said I wanted a butterfly tattoo and my bf opposed to the idea of me having tattoos even though he has a whole sleeve! I thought his tattoos were cool but he said that’s different cuz he’s a guy. He asked me why do I want to get something so random like a butterfly underneath my bellybutton. I just think it’s cute that’s all. I just like it. It doesn’t have a real meaning behind it but I saw it online and I just really like it. My bf doesn’t like tattoos on girls. He said that they just look trashy on girls and I’m just gonna end up regretting getting the tattoo. Our relationship won’t be over if I get the tattoo but he did tell me his opinion on it and he just doesn’t think girls should be allowed to get tattoos because it’s just not modest. He asked me if I do get this tattoo to just get it on a body part that won’t be visible everyday,
7,"So not even going to like, I look like I'm 40.  When people guess my age they always think I'm between 39-42. ",
8,"I've never written a reddit blog before so I have no idea how to start it, my bad if it's written badly.

So a little after I was born, my mum and dad got divorced, it was actually really ugly and now that I'm older I'm finding out how bad of a person my mum is but that's neither here nor there. Maybe that trauma is effecting his judgement (Not his only trauma, he's been through a lot.) About 10 years ago now, he got married to my now Stepmother. Me and her have never really had a good relationship at all, when they were both crackheads she was a little abusive so I live with thr memory of that, thus I'll never be able to fully enjoy her presence in my life, but it's been a decade so I've come to terms with it. The problem starts a few years ago, maybe about 2021.

She was working in a furniture store, one of the largest furniture chains in the country we live in. There was an older man working there top, he'd been with the company for about 30 years so he had very good standing with corporate. Soon after she started working there, he started harassing her daily. I don't know the full story, all I know is he groped her a few times and said some pretty bad asexually charged shit to her when they were alone. But by all accounts, he never graped her. She had this problem dealt with, sued the company, she's made her closure with it.

My problem lies in how she deals with her trauma. Let's start with her body dysmorphia. I'm not judging people with BDD, I suffer from it myself, but hers is actually fucked. She spends ALL of my dads money buying clothes that are too small for her because after a week of owning anything she's convinced she looks fat in it. She loads her body full of sketchy growth hormones and a dosage of Ozempic that her doctor himself tells her is dangerously high. She starves herself for days, pumps up her whole face with so much botox she barely looks human. Her and my mum go to the same botox injector person and they always talk about my dad's wife like ""She really shouldn't be putting that much is her face."" she looks like a fucking skeleton but she's convinced she's the fattest person on earth. She's going to die from all of this, and very fucking soon. And she's not gonna stop it. She won't. And it's not the her dying part that fucks me up so much, it's that my dad who is already mentally broken, has to sit there and watch his wife slowly kill herself with chemicals and injections and starvation and he can't do anything about it. She refuses care, and she's a grown woman so he can't make her do anything. And when she finally loses her life to her own madness, he's gonna spiral, more than he did last time. He'll get back into his old addictions because he has no idea how to deal with emotional pain. And I'm not gonna be able to do anything about it, I'll just have to watch. He'll kill himself at some point in the following years. 

She's gonna take my dad from me. The world has already taken enough from me and now she's doing this. I feel so helpless because I literally can't do anything. And when I inevitably watch him kill himself slowly, I'll spiral too, and the cycle continues. I would try to talk to her about it but that brings me to her second problem: she's terrified of men. Even me. I'm transgender but she doesn't know that. All she sees is a 6'4ft teenager. She can't even be at the supermarket if there's a man working there. Can't have a male doctor, can't have a male police officer pull her over, etc. She hates men. And that would be perfectly reasonable, had she actually been graped. She wasn't. And I'm not discrediting her experience, sexually charged bullying in the workplace can be very traumatic. But he didn't even grape her. I watched an Italian man beat my mother half to death every night then he'd come upstairs and have his way with little 6 year old me, I don't avoid every Italian man like the fucking plague though. My dad was graped in the army cadets, then went on to do 8 years service. He didn't launch into a fucking seizure every time he saw a man in a service uniform, he fucking wore one himself. 

And I'd try to talk to my dad about this, but he's an emotional shut-in. I've tried countless times to have a meaningful conversation with him but he turns it unserious. And I don't blame him, he's lived a horrible life. But just the constant awareness of what's gonna happen, but not knowing when is destroying me along with everything else in my life bringing me down along with it.",

How do we sleep throughout the night without being so horny???

10,"There’s a Cups cafe in the hospital. My husband’s mom has been in the hospital, she’s very sick. We’ve been going to the hospital almost everyday after work and we love Cups, we get it every time we’re at the hospital. Now that we’re regulars there’s this barista that works there everytime time we are there, she looks very young, she has to be maybe 18-19 years old. She says she’s studying at the university (the hospital is a university/hospital. I’m 35 and my husband is 38. We do also have small children. 

My husband openly flirts with this girl in front of me. She told her that she’s too pretty to be working here and that’s when she mentioned she’s also a student. He gave her a $5 tip, our coffee literally cost us $7+ each. It’s really the way he talks to her. He speaks to her so nicely and in a flirtatious way. She seems to also entertain it, the way she talks back with him. I’m watching my husband when he gets us coffee too and even from a distance I see a vibe, I’ve seen them smile and laugh together. 

My husband told her that she makes our visit to the hospital better. Like what? Speak for yourself. She doesn’t make my day better, I’m wildly insecure of a teenager now like WTF?

I got so mad I told him “why don’t you just sleep with her.” And he said “my wife wouldn’t let me.” That’s when I said fuck off and I left the hospital in the one car we all drove here with. Yes I left the kids with their father, they really wanted to see their grandmother. 

I don’t know if I’m overreacting or it’s just his overly flirtatious personality taking over. He gets like this during hard times I don’t know if it’s a coping mechanism, it could be but either way I don’t wanna keep making up excuses for him. He is pretty friendly but this just took it too far honestly. He’s just always more kinder to females and I guess it bothers me because he obviously will never talk to a man like that. Tell me I’m overreacting please. Throwaway. Posted elsewhere. thanks. ",
11,"To my bright shining star, with eyes of galaxies. How does one tell someone how deeply they love them? I can never seem to find the words. Love, knows all the words and here I am speechless. Do I say that I am yours? I am. Do I say that you are mine? you are. That we are us and always will be? yes. I don't know how to paint beautiful pictures or write like a soul weaving words into living art. but some words can strike a chord so deep, getting deeper and deeper. I'm glad to circle again and again, our same words, can repeat over and over. they carry all the meaning. Mine. Yours. Us. Always. Forever. Love. ",

13,"Compared to people I look and feel so weak and I'm horrible at dealing with situations that I need strength in. Like yesterday I tried to get some boys out of a door and obviously I couldn't, like, there were four of them, I don't think any human being could do it but I can't stop imagining that if instead of me it were my friends they would have succeeded. I even did some push-ups against the wall to increase my strength, but when I see people I already compare myself. I fell like I have practically no strength, what if I'm in a dangerous situation and need it? God, I don't even want to imagine.",
14,"So I don’t know how to organize my thoughts but I’d just have to say this. It’s hard to believe that a mere 30 years ago there was no screens in people’s faces all the time and people actually met in real life and had most of their conversations in person. It really dawned on me that never ever have I or will I ever get to experience that due to the timeline being born in. Imagine most things being in real life and in person and not online and the fact that my brain cannot comprehend that alone is insane when there are people maybe just 10 to 20 years older than me that actually lived it. I know it’s a choice to still go screen free and maybe get a flip phone or something and try to have this real life actual experience without the internet whatsoever but then to be fair I’d be alone in that one and it’ll be really difficult to keep in touch with people. 
My main thing here is that I have let it consume me to such a point where I know, I am well aware that I’m ruining myself. It is an addiction and I don’t want it to be at all. I’d be on my phone and I’m thinking while scrolling that I’m not supposed to be on this for this number of hours and my eyes are straining and my back is sore and I’m in the exact same position as I was like 3 hours ago but I can’t bring myself to stop because then if I’m not looking at the phone then what can I do? A book? Oh I’d just download it. Take a walk? Nature videos. Like what is wrong with me. Might be cringe saying all this but the outside is right there and I’m screaming at myself internally to stop endlessly scrolling and stop engaging in people’s lives I’d never meet or be a part of and I just can’t stop. I can feel myself getting future back and neck problem but I don’t stop myself. It seems only if it’s too late that I can do something about it.
And when I watch stuff like Anne With An E and literally everything is in person and like people are just not bored because obviously no screens and they find things to do it’s still so hard to figure out just how it was even possible and that’s crazy to me because it was possible less than 30 years ago and now it just doesn’t seem possible. Not going to lie it makes me skip meals or even delay certain activities because I’m just in the same position scrolling. I fall asleep with what’s going on in my phone in mind and wake up super anxious for some reason just to check my phone. How. Why am I doing this to me I promise it seems all very weird. ",
15,"My (24M) ex (19F) and I dated for about 6 months and we fell in love fast. We had such strong chemistry. But the foundation of our relationship was incredibly shaky. She had just gotten out of a relationship with her toxic ex and I had just lost my mom a few months prior and was not doing well.

I ignored so many bright neon red flags in favor of ""chemistry"" and seemingly paid the price for it. Here's the timeline pretty much.

\- She cheated on her ex and broke up with him 3 months before we met.  
\- She slides into my Instagram DMs with a really sweet message and we hit it off.  
\- After talking for about 2 weeks, we kissed and made out on our first date.  
\- She hooked up with her ex nearly a month after we met, by which point we had went on like 5-6 dates. She said she instantly regretted it and felt cold but then in person, she said it was really good but wanted to be with me. That absolutely fucking sucked.  
\- Like 2 weeks later, roughly a week before we became official, she said she wasn't sure if she was ready for a relationship. She said she was scared of hurting of me. I reassured her and oh boy, I really should have listened to her.  
\- On the day I was going to ask her to be my girlfriend, we trip on shrooms and she says ""I love you"" for the first time  
\- 2 weeks into dating, I open up about financial struggles and she hinted towards wanting to break up.  
\- Sometime after that, she asked me how I felt about poly relationships. Truthfully, I do trust that she was just making conversation but added in with everything else that I'll get into, it's not pleasant  
\- About a week or two later, she asks me how I would react if she cheated on me.  
\- Like a month or two after that,  
\- Our whole sex life revolved around me getting her off and nothing else pretty much. I would get her off multiple times, hands, mouth, dick once. This made me feel incredibly undesired and unwanted.  
\- When I tried figuring out why our sex life was that way (and if it was due to my size but I didn't directly bring that up), she said she ""loved when I fucked her and was more than satisfied"" but felt. The whole being out of shape thing was a legitimate issue but the rest seemed like bullshit.  
\- Our relationship was pretty shitty. I was fucking miserable. She wasn't happy. I made her cry a few times (granted, we both had fault in that). A lot of arguments. A lot of talk about breaking up. Honestly though, a lot of the arguments were kind of sparked by her actions indirectly.  
\- She hid our actual relationship status from her family, but not other important figures in her life. To her family, she said we were going on dates but hid the fact we were in a relationship. I felt like that was to maintain plausible deniability to them for her cheating if she found someone else but that's uncertain because her mom being a psycho and her dad being a strict Muslim who wouldn't have been happy with her dating a non-Muslim white dude are both factors.  
\- At some point, I find that she still had the app that I met her on on her phone and I confront her about. She said that she forgot she had it installed, had included friends only in her bio, and even included that she had photos of me and her on there.  
\- Finally, at the start of August, I asked her if she was cheating on me and she gave a very detailed answer as to why she wouldn't do that but stated she wasn't happy and didn't want to be in a relationship with me but was scared to lose me.  
\- We agreed to take a break but I expressed my concern was that she'd find someone bigger than me and prefer them over me. Say what you will about that but I feel like I had a right to be insecure considering how undesired I felt in the relationship.  
\- She was honestly really annoyed and uncomfortable about that.  
\- This created a lot of turmoil the first week of the break, it was an extremely emotional week for both of us (assuming she wasn't bullshitting about her emotions). I kept spiralling with my insecurity.  
\- That weekend, her mom was being the psychopath that she is and my ex came to stay with me for a few days. We talked a lot of things out.  
\- She said the reason behind the sex stuff was a ""teasing kink"", which I still honestly doubt because she knows a lot about BDSM. Plus, she didn't do that shit with her ex. So why me?  
\- She acknowledged that her actions made it seem like she didn't want me.  
\- We hooked up once or twice that weekend, not fucking of course.  
\- Unfortunately, my lifelong best friend cat of 18 years was diagnosed with terminal cancer that same weekend she was with me. She said she would be there with me when he got put down.  
\- A week later, she came with me to a very special concert to see my favorite band. Something I've been looking forward to since my mom died.  
\- She was actually a complete asshole the whole time and was even flirting with my friend (who was oblivious) the whole time. She pretty much ruined the whole weekend for me. My favorite band. Something I was looking forward to since my mom died. Right after I found out my best friend was going to die.  
\- The following weeks were tons of insecurity, tons of arguing.  
\- About 2 weeks after, she was basically saying she was happier without me, yadyadyada.  
\- About a week later, it came time to put my cat down and she went back on her word. We had a whole conversation and she was stone fucking cold, telling me how she wasn't even sure if she wanted me in her life anymore. About 20 minutes into that conversation, she 180'd and got really warm.  
\- My cat gets put down and literally 6 hours later, I'm scheduled for nasal surgery.  
\- After my cat got put down and before my surgery, we call and talk about things and she asks if I want to hang out the next week, I say sure.  
\- The hangout the week after is really, really nice and we end the night with a kiss on the cheek.  
\- The rest of the next few months leading up to December are just a lot of regular talking, not seeing each other, me spiralling about my insecurities, arguments.  
\- Towards the end of December, I apologize to her for not being the best boyfriend and all of my part that I went wrong with in the relationship and we reconciled.  
\- We hung out like three times in short succession and even spent Christmas together. It was really nice. We held hands and cuddled.  
\- Going into January, things died down again for some reason and I started realizing I couldn't be her friend because I wanted to be with her.  
\- Right as I planned to cut her off, her grandma passed away. I was there to support her that night. But after that, I made it very clear I couldn't talk to her anymore because I wanted to be with her and the context of our relationship made be feel unwanted, which only made me feel worse.  
\- I texted her last night just getting shit off my chest and she's yet to respond, probably won't.  
\- The end

Yeah, talk about a fucking rollercoaster.

I hate that every special moment we had was complete bullshit. I hate that all of the good moments were bullshit. The more I look back at our texts, the angrier, the more upset I get.

So now I'm sitting here quite literally $8K extra in the hole because I would constantly have to pay tolls to see her because she wouldn't accept a solution to see each other less but stay over with me when we do see each other because that meant disclosing our relationship status to her family (hmm, I wonder why that was a problem), I've gained like 20lb, I'm working a dead-end retail job, facing immense financial stress, and an incredibly uncertain future. The only real thing I have going for me is volunteer work which is opening / will open an extreme amount of doors, boost my skillset like 20x over what I'm currently capable of, and an incredibly cool mentor that I love. But by and large, when I'm not at work, I'm just sitting around. I'm stagnant. I'm burned out. I'm depressed. I'm not taking care of myself.

She seems to be doing well, is in even better shape than she already was, and started cosmetology school. I fucking hate that she's doing well and I'm not.

In regard to relationships, I most likely won't find someone else. My face is severely disfigured. I'm obese but it doesn't really matter since no one is going to want Sloth from the Goonies but skinny. And I find myself, angrily reflecting about all of my romantic experiences before her (and obviously about her). Before her, I've only ever been led on, had one person who liked me and I liked back but she was demisexual so my physical appearance didn't really matter which doesn't exactly hurt my case, etc. And then finally, I was in a relationship where I was unwanted, undesired, treated like dogshit, probably got cheated on. The ultimate proof that it was impossible for a woman to want me. Of course, the closest I've come afterwards to a relationship is a girl from high school, who suffers from histronic personality disorder and is very obviously desperate, who was love bombing me, saying we were soulmates.. two days into talking for the first time in years. Yeah, noped out of that situation. But it certainly did not help the feeling of ""wow, this is the best I can do"" and ""I clearly attract these people because I'm low value"".

Make no mistake with what I am about to say, I am very far from a perfect person and a perfect partner. But I am generally a pretty charismatic, charming, extroverted, funny, blunt, and earnest person, in spite of my negative attributes. People tend to gravitate to me. I make friends incredibly easily in the right situations. Women in my life, some of whom have led me on and some of whom are just friends, have said ""you'd make an amazing boyfriend"", ""you're fucking hilarious"", been completely shocked that I've never been in a relationship (before my ex) / shocked that I've only been in one, and so on.

But my dating life is nonexistent. Granted, I don't really go out to socialize outside of my friend group and work. I get zero likes on dating apps. I feel so powerless because I want to be in another relationship to prove to myself that I can but I know that's just straight up impossible. I feel trapped and I hate it.

And now I have to face all of the grief I've had over the years, losing my whole family, a financial situation that's going to take YEARS to get myself out of, no real certain future prospects, all while absolutely fucking miserable and just straight up done with life. Not to mention the fact I'm going to be 25 this year and I'm starting to become aware of my age and everything that means as I approach my 30s. And aware that I will never have anyone by side, I will never have another relationship again.

The 20s are supposed to be the prime of your life. If **this** is the best life gets, it's going to be a really long 50-70 years.

I also feel like I never want to invest so much into a relationship ever-fucking-again. I would buy her flowers, something no one has ever done for her, just because I wanted to see her smile. I'd do small gestures to show that I loved her. I would go on and on about how awesome she was to my friends. I was so invested into our relationship. And now I just feel like a sucker. I feel like I was naive. I feel like maybe if I hadn't cared so much about seeing her smile, making her happy, maybe I would have been treated differently. I feel like, on the very slim chance I end up in another relationship, I need to kill that part of myself. The ""golden retriever"" part of me. The part of me that tends to get very excited about new connections. The part of me that wants to see who I love happy. The part of me that puts a lot of thought into making that happen. I feel like that's just opening myself to get hurt again if I don't. And to some degree, I'm succeeding. I'm a lot more of a hardass now. I'm colder. I assert my boundaries far fucking more. To some degree, I like the feeling of power it gives me. Which probably isn't healthy but I take it as an ""overcorrective"" response to my feelings of powerlessness \*and\* the fact I've always been someone who people have walked all over, taken advantage of, etc.

I'm so fucking angry, I'm so resentful, I'm bitter, and I'm fucking miserable, and I hate my life. I have no clue where to go from here. Genuinely no clue.",

My imagination is so vivid and powerful that it scares me. It bothers me a lot because the way my mind slips into different modes and makes me lose focus really frustrates me. For example, when I’m dancing in my room with my heels and music playing, I can imagine a whole stage. I see the crowd, the audience, the props, my outfit, how I’m going to use my hands, my facial expressions, my dancing partners, and everything else. Whenever I dance, I feel like I’m in a completely different reality. The same thing happens when I’m singing. I imagine myself in a beautiful white dress, doing a soft and emotional performance with a grand piano.

I also have sensory issues. Sometimes I imagine patterns or weird textures on my body, and it drives me crazy. It makes me itchy, and I feel fear and pain. I hate holes, so when I imagine them, my skin starts crawling. My imagination is so strong that when I talk to myself, I imagine full conversations with other people. I can see what they are wearing, how they talk, their facial expressions, what we are talking about, how I feel, and the mood of the whole conversation.

When I was younger, I used to see strange things. A belt would look like a snake, or a backpack would look like a dog. It used to upset me. I also like to write books, and I create characters with so much detail that I can feel their emotions. I hear their voices, I understand their thoughts, and I feel empathy for them even though they are not real. I imagine how they would talk and how they would act like real people.

Sometimes I imagine animal fur on my body. It bothers me so much that I start to itch, get scared, and even cry because it triggers me. One time, my friend said something interesting, and my brain started playing a full movie in my head. I saw colors, people, and scenes from a third-person point of view, and I completely lost focus.

Even though my friends say I’m creative, I think it’s because my imagination feels like reality. That is how I come up with ideas when I’m dancing. If I need to make up a dance move, I imagine Beyoncé or Michael Jackson dancing, and then I get the courage to try it myself, even if the move doesn’t exist yet.

When I try to make music, it is hard to use a beat because I already have a full song in my head. It has a chorus, a bridge, and everything, but it is really hard to turn it into a real song.

I really want help. This is bothering me a lot",

Just a heads up,this is a long post.
I(14 male) had a mental breakdown,and threatened to commit suicide and made my family and friends upset.

It all started when I had to go to boys scouts. A few weeks ago we had a camping trip and the last day was awful. My scout master kept yelling at me and getting frustrated because I didn't get stuff on the first go like folding and doing the tents. He then insulted me when I told him I forgot my sleeping bag because we were rushing and told me that I act like a little boy.When we got home I was very upset because I thought I was stupid and couldn't do anything,heck I can't even tie my shoes.

So yesterday we had to go again.(We go like every 2 Wednesdays)I didn't want to go because of everything that happened(Also it wasn't really the first it happened either)But my mom made me go,trying to gaslight me and saying that they need me and it's important which was bullshit. I started breaking down saying that I'll kill myself which made my mom upset,she said that was the last time we were going to go.

We went to the meeting and the whole time I felt so disconnected,we had to do the tents and sleeping bags again and I was so anxious in fear of not getting it and being yelled at it and criticized. Half of the whole time I was on my phone texting my transgender friend Zoey. She's going through stuff as well and we talked about how we wish were never born,how we want to commit suicide and be reincarnated,and how much we hate our lives.

After the meeting we went home. I was in my room and then I started having more suicidal thoughts. Now this isn't the first time I had it. A few months ago I typed a intense suicide note and the principal found out and I was given some counseling. He called my mom and I went home,she was mad at first but she started to become very upset. My mom was also in 2 abusive relationships over 2022-2025 and that was traumatic but I got over that(Slightly). There was also a few months ago where my mom got mad at me because I ""ran her phone dead."" And her charger wasn't working,she called me in her room and wouldn't let me go to bed even thought it was Wednesday and a school night(We also went to boys scouts) she slapped me a few times and I had to call my grandmother(Her mother) to calm her down.That was also when I met my friend Zoey on the bus and she comforted me about it.

My suicidal thoughts became intense.I started thinking about how I have a bad life,how I'm not growing physically and how I hate that my mom gave birth to me and how I wanna be reincarnated.

I thought about my friend Zaniya .I started thinking about how I wanna tell her that I'm gonna commit suicide. Me and her have been friends since elementary,she moved schools and we reconnected back in middle school. During that time stuff was really rocky between us,she fake dated me for a day after I confessed my feelings to her and she made fun of my disability(I am bow-legged which I'm very insecure about). She apologized for everything but I still felt a little bit weird hanging out with her.

I started texting her and said that I am about to commit suicide and that I wasn't joking. I started saying that if I kill myself nobody will care and that the world will keep spinning. She started begging for me not to commit suicide but I said that she doesn't really care,how I never got the chance to actually date her and that I will die a virgin.

An hour later her mom called my mom. She said that Zaniya was very upset about what I texted her and told my mom everything I texted her.Her mom said that she was super concerned and that I needed help,she said that she would pick us up from church and will go their church.

My mom came in and started screaming at me,saying that this is the second time I did this shit.That made me mad and I lost my temper which is something I rarely do. I started screaming at her saying that it's her fault and that she never loved me or wanted me. At this time my 9 year old little brother was in his room. I told her that her biggest mistake was having me and that I wish I was never born. She started breaking down and saying that she does love me and that she made many mistakes but she has fixed them and that she's sorry. I was on the phone with my friend Elijah at this time.

My mom called my dad and told her everything that happened,he spoke to me but I was not having any of it. He threatened to call my Grandmother which is a bad idea because she would make me overwhelmed and wouldn't help. My mom managed to plead him not to and my friend Elijah started talking with my mom and told her that he would spend time with me for the summer.


My mom called me aunt and told her everything. I managed to calm down and everything just stopped. I fell asleep near 1.00.",
18,"I (21M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (24F) for over four years. We’re each other’s first real relationship, and we’ve been through a lot together — both beautiful and extremely painful.

From day one, she made it clear she wanted to keep our relationship a secret. Not because she’s ashamed, but because she wanted to protect what we had from outside drama. I agreed — I was 17 and in love. But I didn’t fully understand how heavy that would feel four years later.

Now, no one knows we’re together. She also keeps it secret from her friends. My friends just think we’re close. And since she’s attractive, they sometimes say stuff — about her looks, her body, “how she used to have a big ass,” etc. One of them even recently joked about marrying her. They have no idea she’s my girlfriend. And I can’t say anything. I just sit there pretending it doesn’t kill me.

But it does kill me.

I want to protect her. I want to say “she’s mine” — with pride, not jealousy. But I can’t. Because it’s a secret. And yes, she’s right when she reminds me that I agreed to this from the start. But I didn’t know how much it would hurt.

Still, I’ve always done my best for her. I’ve made her my priority. When I was 133 kg, she loved me unconditionally and helped me lose over 50 kg. When I was broke at 18, she stayed. She supported me and believed in me when no one else did. I owe her a lot.

She’s also been through serious trauma. Her father lived with her but emotionally ignored her — never treated her like a real daughter. That has made her extremely sensitive and emotionally dependent on me. When things don’t go her way, she often breaks down in tears quickly. I’ve always tried to be the strong one.

We’ve had a lot of arguments. Once, she broke up with me, saying I hurt her more than I loved her. We got back together after three days because she said she missed me too much — and I missed her too.

But in those fights, it often feels like everything I’ve done right just vanishes. She focuses only on the negative. Even when I try to explain myself calmly, I feel like I’m always the one apologizing. She once said she’s scared to marry me in the future — not because she doesn’t love me, but because she’s afraid I’ll “keep hurting her.” And in her eyes, “hurting her” can mean something as small as being home late after seeing a friend, or not calling at the exact moment she expected.

And now… I’m tired. Not of her. But of how much I’m carrying — silently.

I love her. This isn’t a post to shame her. I just… don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’ve given so much of myself that I barely recognize who I am anymore. I’ve chosen her over and over again, even in silence, even when it hurt.

I’m writing this partly to get it off my chest — and partly because I need advice.
Has anyone been in a situation where love is real, but silence and pressure start to crush you?
How do you hold on to someone without losing yourself?

⸻

TL;DR:
I’ve been in a secret relationship with my girlfriend for 4+ years. She’s been amazing in many ways and supported me through big challenges, but due to her past trauma and emotional dependency, the relationship has become heavy. My friends don’t know we’re together, and sometimes make disrespectful comments about her — I can’t say anything. I always try to put her first, but during arguments, that’s forgotten. I love her, but I feel like I’m starting to disappear inside the silence, the pressure, and the constant guilt. I need advice.",
19,"We were together for 10 years, I'm nearing 40, and this happened about 6 years ago. He fell in love with a friend and, when I questioned the amount of time they spent together alone, I was accused of being controlling and compared to her abusive partner. For me it was all out of the blue. I was deeply in love and ex went from always being supportive to persecuting me in just two or three weeks.

I can't get over it and I have done all the things.

I have done therapy, in fact, it's unclear to me why I should keep paying. There is a problem, yes, but it doesn't seem like a problem that is ever going to be solved. I did EMDR and that AND time both helped to lessen the intensity of the pain, which I'm deeply grateful for, but the problem remains.

I have friends, both old and new, since I like socializing and getting to know people. I had my own separate hobbies even when I was married. I had to leave some but also gained some in trying to move away from my exH's social circle.

I dated another person for 2.5 years, until he (you guessed it) began spending an uncomfortable amount of time with a Very Good Friend of his. He himself admitted she's ""not like his other friends"", but has been extremely hurt ever since I left him because of this, as ""nothing happened"".

I can't get over this. I don't want to be controlling, but I also don't do this to my partners. Now I don't do this to others in general. However, becoming Very Good Friends seems to be very accepted in society. It's happening to me now with a man who has a girlfriend, so I've retreated. But I was telling a friend and she said ""He can't know if you're the love of his life if he doesn't get to know you"". She does not seem to get that she's actually validating my ex-husband when she says things like this. She said we'd talk more about it. We've done so plenty of times and I'm done talking about it; I will agree to disagree. Also, she's been cheated on too, although in her case it was more about sex than an emotional affair, so maybe it's different for her. I used to see it like that too when I was young, but now? It's just impossible.

I don't understand and I don't want to participate in intimate relationships in a world where this is commonly accepted. It's like the door is always open. I accept it is the way it is, but I don't want an intimate partner on those terms. And yet I wish I had a relationship with my best friend like I had with my ex-husband.

Now, don't get me wrong, I totally get that love can end for a myriad different reasons, and I understand that. But in these particular cases it only happens well after people have allowed themselves to get to know the other person even more than they know their own partner, who they claim to love. It has happened to me while in relationships too, ok, it can happen, but you then retreat. If not, it means you're indeed open to exploring other options if and when they come along, i. e., you don't really love your partner any more, you just don't wanna blow up your life and your comfort. Another friend expressed exactly this as she was telling me how she'd betrayed a partner in her 20s by falling for someone exactly like this (but we're just frieeeends bwaaah), and so I asked her what she does now that she's in love, and she said ""I just don't allow anything to get to that point"".

Maybe if my ex-husband had been an asshole for a long time it would be easier, and I would just need to look for someone who had better qualities. But he treated me well and was generally supportive. So now I don't know what to look for. If he could treat me well for 10 years just to turn around and start gaslighting me just because it was convenient, then anyone can. 
This is what cheating does to you long-term. I have a life and yet I'm forever stuck with this knowledge. But it's my karma - I never believed people who would say ""I did not know and things were fine"". There must have been a problem, right? Well, yeah, there must have... they just don't tell you and act normal.

No, I've never been the same, and not in a good way. Life's just life, could be better, could also be worse. But it is definitely not better than it used to be when I was married.

I miss my best friend as much as I did when he left, even though I am never breaking no contact.

After six years, I don't think there will ever come a time when this thing does not haunt me.

Thank you for reading.",
20,"[Sorry if my grammar is bad, English is not my first language] So I (m17) live in a place for kids and young adults that can’t live at home or don’t have any other options (my father was an alcoholic and passed away 4 years ago and my mother is bipolar and kind of alcoholic) my life has been total shit ever since my dad died of cancer, he was in Mexico on a work trip while it happened and it had spread to his whole body by the time he came home. But 5 months ago my life got way better because a girl moved in (f17) and to make it short we got together and were really happy. I am a pathological liar and it really took a tole on our relationship, we both suffered from depression and other mental health problems, but I actually think that just made our love for each other stronger. Alright so 2 days ago we broke up because I have a really bad tendency to escape from everything and push everyone away when it all gets too much. It is not the first time we have broken up and all the other times we have made it up to each other pretty quickly. But not this time, Tuesday night I ran away from the place we live at to smoke some weed with my old friend even though I had gotten clean over a year ago because I was desperate to get some stress away(me and her weren’t texting or talking to each other at that time). Later that night she texted me “goodbye. I love you” but she had talked about ending it and saying she would do it before so I really didn’t think she would do it and I just texted back “I love you too -name-“. So I end up getting caught by the workers and they keep telling me that k need to come back as fast as possible but I was just thinking that they were trying to trick me, but then the police started calling and texting me and said it was about my girlfriend and that it was very urgent. So at that point I was shitting my pants almost because if the police said that it could only mean she did it, so I get my friend to drive my home on his moped which was scary ass fuck when it’s your first time being high in s year plus. I get back and the first thing I do is go looking in the little mini forest that there is at the place to see if she was hanging there but I couldn’t find her. So I text one of the workers where she is and they says she is with her mom, and I think thank god she didn’t actually do it and I was very relieved, and then I passed out on my bed. The next day at around two pm the psychiatrist and one of the workers that is closest to me come in my room and told me that my girlfriend had tried to take her life last night, but it hadn’t worked but she was in the hospital in a kind of coma I think. So I go visit her as fast as I can and when we get there her whole family is there and her mom come to me and briefed me on everything. She was totally brain dead with her brain swelling allot, her organs were beginning to fail and they said there was 0% chance she would make it. And that I had to say goodbye while she could still hear me, I told her I loved her and that I am so fucking sorry and that I would see her soon. Thursday at 03:30 am all of her organs had shut down and she was dead, at almost exactly that time I threw up allot and blacked out. Later in the day when I had woken up again I went to my moms house to get a eeyore plushie which I had bought as a surprise after she told me she really wanted it a long time ago, and I went to the embalmer/undertaker to see her gain and give her the plushie. I can still see the lifeless and cold hands when I close my eyes, it was almost like she had been left outside in the winter, she had large bruises all around her neck and the clothes her mom had picked out were really weird. When I was alone with her to say goodbye I told her that I really needed her and I said our safeties for when everything is too much, then I promised her that I would soon join her. 
The whole day I’ve been going from sobbing to staring at myself in the mirror to smelling the last of my shirts she had borrowed to listening to her favorite song with her headphones that she always had with her. I’ve only been in her room one time after it happened and I was about to black out, I bought all her favorite snacks and I just can’t bear it anymore, I can’t do this, I can’t just live with the fact that she killed herself because of me, I can’t just live with the sight of her in that coffin, and I can’t live with the fact that she didn’t even want to tell me. 

TL:DR my girlfriend killed herself because we broke up and I can’t live with the guilt

Respectfully I don’t care whatever hopefull paragraph you reply with, I am too far gone, there is no saving me, I just wanted to tell somebody",
21,"Every year is exactly the same realization that I prioritize people and their birthdays more than I'm prioritized. People assume I want to isolate and not be asked to do anything on my birthday, because I've built this defense where that's what I project, because I know if I get excited for my birthday, I will be hurt.

There was a time when I had good birthdays and I was excited when my birthday came up, but that was a long time ago when I was a kid, probably at least 20 years since I've enjoyed a birthday.

I mostly blame my parents for this curse, because there was a point when their marriage wasn't doing well and the home wasn't fun to live in, and that's when my birthdays started falling through the cracks and I started building this defense. 

My birthday has now turned into a day every year where I have this little boy inside that's wanting to be celebrated, but he's afraid of being hurt, so it's a reaccuring sadness every year when no one celebrates me. ",
22,"I know it sounds silly and I do feel silly but I’m still a little bit in shock by it all. 
Me (f27) and my boyfriend (m45) were enjoying an evening at my place the other evening, something on tv prompted him to tell me “I only learned ten years ago that women have two holes” … he expected me to laugh and be amused. 

I was anything but amused, I said “oh that’s a bit weird” and he got all defensive saying “I didn’t think about it too much”. Which vexed me further because he has children with his ex wife, he grew up with multiple sisters. It is such an illogical assumption, 60s on google will show you a cartoon image of the vagina and urethra being separated holes. 

He kept trying to justify it, persuading me to find it funny and making me feel bad that I felt weird. So what followed was a huge argument, i needed space so i asked him to leave. He did, only to let himself back in after I locked the door. 

I was furious. Now I feel silly, I don’t know anymore what to feel",
23,"Hi, I want to start by saying that English is not my first language and I'm on my phone, so I apologize for any typos or if the formatting looks weird. 
This will be a bit long due to context.
I (19f) am disabled, in short I have a congenital deformity in both hips, which causes the joints not to be where they should be and causes me constant pain. I have had chronic pain for years and the more time passes, the more difficult it is for me to walk or stand for a long time without feeling severe pain. I explain this to say that I am not currently working, although I sell crafts online, I don't really earn much. So I still live with my mom and my two brothers (15m and 5m) 

I take care of my baby brother, I help him with his homework and I cook if he asks me to, I try to help in general whenever I can, however I have a very tense relationship with my teenage brother, Whom I'll call Liam to avoid confusion. He and I have never been close in general; we have very different personalities and we just coexist.But he's in that teenage phase where he only cares about himself and has that kind of edgy humor, so we've had little arguments and drifted apart these past few years.We were pretty much fine with this dynamic until he got a girlfriend.

You see, my mom is extremely permissive, she never follows through on the punishments she promises and acts more like a friend, so she was very nice to her girlfriend when she brought her the first time, all good, right?I was also kind and happy that he had warmed up and maybe even matured a little with the experience. The girlfriend started sleeping at our house from time to time, it's fine, I just asked my mom if she was sure they wouldn't do anything sleeping together here, But we scrapped that because we could hear everything they were saying from our rooms. An occasional night turned into once a week, then two nights and a day,Before I knew it she was at our house more than half the time, By this point I was already feeling uncomfortable, I had seen her and Liam laugh at me while I was walking once (I have a limp and walk like a penguin) So I avoided living with them, so I had to lock myself in my room half the time.Liam had started bringing it without telling anyone, so only enough was cooked for four people. Then Liam started serving double portions, which left me with very little to nothing for dinner, so I started getting angry. 

I complained to my mom every time, but she "" remained neutral"" and just asked me to get along, saying she couldn't do anything from work anyway. I started serving my food very early because if I did it at my usual time I would find that there was no mashed potatoes, meat, chicken, scrambled eggs or whatever side dish was made that day, I started hiding the occasional drink in my room because he would lock whatever we made for the day in his and share it with his girlfriend. I was even stingy once and, after they had eaten, brought a big bowl of mashed potatoes into my room, which caused an argument about what ""I was being selfish, that was so they could eat at night too and I wasn't the only one eating in the house"" which I obviously pointed out as a hypocriteMy mom only got angry when I told her because ""we couldn't live together as siblings."" And I was starting to resent her a little because ""staying neutral"" meant not scolding Liam for hogging the food or setting limits on how long his girlfriend lived here. 

Things came to a head when one day I heard Liam and his girlfriend ""having fun"" in my mom's room. I thought she'd finally draw the line, But she only got mad at him at first, had a very light conversation over text messages, and when I brought it up again a few days later, she said they ""didn't have anywhere else to do it anyway."" So I accepted that my comfort wasn't a priority and started staying in my room all the time. That brings us to the title of the post. 

We have a dog that is mine and two cats, one that my mom brought and another that Liam brought. I am fully responsible for the dog and since Liam got bored of the cat in two days and my mom has no patience whit animals The cats stay with me almost always, I feed them, brush them and play with them, my mom cleans the litter box. 

Yesterday she forgot to do it and as usual it started to smell a little bad. Liam came into my room and in a very angry tone asked me who cleaned the litter box, to which I replied ""I don't know, but it's not me"" Trying to end the conversation so he would leave my room, but then he started saying that it smelled really bad, that it bothered his girlfriend and that it needed to be cleaned.I knew very well where he was going, so I interrupted him and told him to clean it up then, well, he acted as if I had insulted him in the worst possible way. 
He raised his voice and began to speak to me in that tone that abusive husbands use with their housewives trapped in the movies saying they were my cats and it was my job to clean up after them while I politely reminded him that he had brought the first cat and they were just with me all the tim because he and Mom would take them out of their rooms and ignore them, that it wasn't my job to clean it up and much less would I do it because he told me to (I would have done it if I had noticed before). Then Liam yelled that I was useless and did nothing around the house as he slammed my bedroom door.

Well, that hit a nerve for me, I couldn't even answer him because I felt a lump forming in my throat and I could barely hold back the tears. He had made little comments about it before, when I was almost 18 and he would make ""jokes"" to my mom about kicking me out of the house so I could have my room since it's bigger, Or when I playfully asked my mom what she would get me for my 19th birthday, he interrupted the conversation to say ""a job,"" but him saying it like this broke me. Because I've been trying hard to stay positive even though I feel stuck, because I've really tried to get a good job so I can move, I'm trying to save up for a PC to work from home, and I'm trying to move forward with my medical procedure to get a disability certificate even though the healthcare system in my country is crap.I've been trying to get a doctor's appointment for months. I'm really trying, even though I'm feeling more and more like my life has no purpose. 

As usual, I texted my mom what he had said, to which she didn't even reply. She arrived home less than 10 minutes later and when I greeted her in a low Tone (because I was still trying to hold back the urge to cry) She got mad at me, telling me to stop acting like she'd done something to me. Five minutes later, she was talking and laughing with Liam and his girlfriend, not even mentioning what had happened. 

I feel trapped and even though my mom has told me I can stay here as long as I want without worrying about anything, I no longer feel welcome in this house. It seems like everyone thinks I'm a burden, I really would like to leave and live on my own, but I don't even know how to do it, it's like I take one step back for every two I take. I wish I could leave home today and get an entry-level job like everyone else. I've fantasized many times about winning the lottery and owning my own house.I'll buy a wheelchair so the pain is finally manageable, but every day it seems like that future will never come. 
I don't know how I'm going to endure another 60 years of living like this. I honestly don't know what I expect from posting here, maybe to get it off my chest, maybe some advice or validation, I only have one friend and she has her own issues to deal with, So I could really use someone who can listen to me.",
24,"My dad's a pediatric surgeon and my mom is a kindergarten teacher but she also works with kids who have autism.
They say that they work to provide for us because they love us and stuff but they're just making me feel like I'm not important enough for them to cancel their plans. I need dad to stop working on weekends or to stop working past 14:00 at private clinics. I need him to put his laptop down bc he NOW HAS A PHD!!! He's 52 now he doesn't need to spend the remaining of his life working so hard for this!!! He is a workaholic. I feel like he is married to his job and his family are his patients.
Whenever he has free time he spends it to watch series. But on the summer we go to the beach for like a week which is nice but what about the rest of the year??? Also mom was great before, she would talk softly to us but now she's just impatient about a lot of stuff. They both are. Very impatient, very angry. We fight all the time. Like just 2 hours ago I fought with my dad and my little sister about a stupid thing and it made me wanna pluck my hair out and hit myself which I know makes me crazy but I don't know how else to let it out. We're not used to express our emotions. I can't say to them what's bothering me. I feel stuck inside these 4 walls and I can't get out. So I'm letting it out here.
I don't need expensive stuff. I don't need to have expensive clothes, or to eat on expensive restaurants and be all luxurious. I just need my parents to put down their phones, to separate work from home, patients from family, to stop fighting for tiniest things. I need them to just sit down with us, stay with us, talk with us, softly, in peace.
I don't want to fight anymore. I am so so tired of this. And to think that I'm studying to become a doctor... which I love the things I'm studying about but will I become like my parents.. sometimes thinking about this makes me feel nauseous.

I don’t even know where to start, but I need to get this off my chest. I was a refugee from Iraq, arriving in Germany at the age of 16, escaping a severely abusive home. 
I was placed in a Jugendhilfeeinrichtung (youth care facility) and assigned a Betreuerin (female caregiver) to help me adjust to my new life in Germany. She was 59 years old ,married, and in a position of trust, supposed to be someone I could rely on.

The only sort affection I ever had for her was purely platonic and the kind of affection you have for you own mother.
My mother had mental health issues and as a child I was abused by her for a long time, so naturally I was longing for a mother figure.

 
I don’t know if her intent was to use this against me at the time but she made me believe that I was the most important person in her life, even more than her own children. She showered me with attention.
 
At first it started with hugging each other whenever we smoked outside , and then messaging each other every day on WhatsApp.
 I really thought that she loved me like a son.

My whole grasp on reality was destroyed when 
One night she called me to the Nachtbereitschaftszimmer (night shift room) at the facility.
She said that she had fallen in love with me and craved closeness.
She took me onto the bed, she started with kissing and hugging and caressing my body and I would just kiss her neck and face, trying to avoid her mouth.
She told me that she wanted to be “ as close as possible to me that night” but it didn’t lead to sex as I was resisting it.


I moved out of the facility shortly after that and into a new home. However, she kept reaching out to me—texts, visits, and ultimately sex.
The sexual relationship continued for 5 months in my new part-time supervised home where she would drive to me every other night, with her husband sleeping clueless.

I also want to mention that I suffer from depression. I was emotionally dependent on her, and she knew it. I thought that if I didn’t give her what she wanted, I would lose her, and I didn’t know how to handle that fear.
When I couldn’t perform because of my depression she would berate me, mentally breaking me down by telling me I didn’t desire her. I felt worthless and too afraid to speak up, I was in such an emotional state that I thought I would literally die if she left me.
At some point I told my legal guardian about it all and they reported it to the state prosecutor, prompting an investigation by police.
 

Then, she revenge-reported me to the police for harassment and threats. Not only that, but she also accused me of wanting to build a bomb with my 3D printer, which led to police detaining me, taking my phones, and searching my home. I was treated like a criminal, even though all of it is a lie.
 
I have an 5-month WhatsApp chat history documenting every single message between us, including her endless voice messages, where she explicitly expressed how much she enjoyed the sex with me. I hope that this at least can be used as evidence against her.

I just wanted a fucking loving family.
I’m really thinking of just ending it all.

26,"I know it’s wrong to feel this way, and to have these thoughts. I guess that’s why I’m here.

I love my brother. I do everything for him. I will bend over backwards so far I end up doing a somersault. And it’s never good enough.

I’m the emotional punching bag. No matter who he’s mad at, or upset with… I get it. He almost never speaks to me nicely, and that’s when he’s not cursing at me or yelling at me. 

I can always hear his voice shouting cruel things in the back of my head, after every altercation. I hear the words he’s once said, never apologized for, and that’s continue to haunt me. I forgive, but forgetting is hard. So hard.

Recently, after every altercation (which in all honesty is just about every interaction, even as simple as ‘are you okay?’ And then getting yelled at), I start to think: 
“You know, I hope I die in some horrible accident. Or get terminally ill, with days or hours left. And than he’ll regret how he treats me. And I hope he lives with that irreparable guilt every day.”

I know it’s mean. I feel bad for thinking that. And I know he loves me, sometimes he does nice things or notices if I’m not okay. I know he’s having his own mental health struggles. But it hurts. It hurts so damn much. And I’m so angry, because I give everything and still get hate. And sometimes, I’m so angry and hurt, that I wish death upon myself so that he can feel crippled with the guilt that won’t ever amount to the amount of heartache and deep wounds (metaphorical) he’s given me over the years.

I know I’m a bad person for it. And honestly, there’s a part of me that really doesn’t care anymore.",
27,"I (M29) honestly believed I had a once-in-a-lifetime love. I married the woman I deeply adored. I forgave, I waited, I trusted. I even accepted pain if it meant she could heal.

But what followed over the last year was something I never expected.

Her family, especially her father—a retired senior doctor—slowly took control of everything. From day one, they micromanaged every detail of our marriage, our home, our future. They even emotionally pressured my parents into selling their ancestral house so we could build a home. And once that was done, they told my parents they couldn’t visit. “Privacy,” they said.

But in front of relatives, they pretend it was my parents’ idea—just to keep their image spotless. My parents swallowed the insult for my sake. They didn’t want to cause problems.

And then came the worst: My wife attempted suicide. But her father, being highly connected in the medical field, had the hospital record changed to say “accidental shampoo ingestion.” Just like that—the truth vanished.

Then, they blamed me.
They blocked me from seeing my newborn daughter.
They told people I was mentally unstable, that I needed psychiatric help.
I wasn’t violent. I wasn’t abusive. I just didn’t surrender to their control.

Even when I tried to go to the police after being physically cornered during a marriage registration argument, they pulled me back emotionally, saying it would break the family.

Now they say:

“Don’t fight with our daughter. If you don’t fight, she will be calm. And with that, peace will come to the family.”

But I feel it deep in my gut—this is another trap. A new version of silence.
They want me to shut up and smile, while they rewrite history again.

I’m exhausted. I’m starting divorce this week. Filing a complaint against her father with the medical association. Maybe an FIR too.

This post isn’t for revenge. I just needed a place to scream without being interrupted.

I loved her with all my heart. But when love is used against you… you’re left wondering if your love ever mattered at all.

28,"So I have a weird reaction to shock and usually become the masked scary emotionless and clinical persona, but now it’s freaking me out.

I have an almost 12 yo who is so confident and bright and has had some weird symptoms. He is the kid who never gets a fever but if he says he has a small headache, we immediately take him to the doctor because 99.9% of the time it is a double ear infection. He has a hard time identifying when he isn’t sick or in any kind of pain.

Last month he was complaining of being dizzy- which is something new- so off to the doctor we go and of course, it’s an ear infection. My husband is unconvinced. He trusts that it’s an ear infection, but cancer runs in both of our families and he is paranoid so he asks me to request a blood panel. I was dismissive and we moved on.

Three days ago our kid gets a pretty bad cold and is dizzy again but this time, so is my husband so he takes time off to take our son to the doctor and insists on the blood panel. Yesterday the results can back concerning. I am in no way a doctor but I am unfortunately a fantastic researcher and the combination of his blood results is indicative of something serious. The doctor made notes indicating his white blood count is the only normal result which means we’re not at a worst case scenario, but my brain is obsessed with the ‘what if’s’.

On top of that his metabolic panel came back showing signs that he may be pre-diabetic and though diabetes runs in the family and may have a genetic component, with the blood results my mind is scattered and I am devastated. Our son eats a healthy balanced diet so the likelihood of the combined panels indicate something I am not able to research definitively. 

I just need a place to vent and get this out in a more precise way so I can understand how to process this? We aren’t telling our son anything until we go back to his doctor so we don’t scare him but he has been feeling achy and more tired than usual and I am panicking. 

Low-key we are at the gaslighting yourself part where my husband and I are insisting on retesting and hoping something was mixed up or wrong. I typically disassociate but my kid deserves better than that, so I’m trying to push through and pester doctors to rush a game plan but I know it’s not that simple and my autistic brain needs a plan yesterday. 
Thank you for listening if you got this far and I wish you all a heathy family ",
29,"Around the end of last year me and my girlfriend broke up. She and I were having a deep rough patch due to my own issues. I was off my meds for my bipolar disorder and was in the midst of a long depressive episode. She begged me to get help, but for some reason I just refused. We hadn't been intimate or really even cuddled for over 3 months before she dumped me. That night she hooked up with one of her close friends. Honestly I don't blame her for missing sex and needing something, but the guy she did it with is just so much better than me. He's taller, in better shape, he's better looking. He's just better. 

When we reconnected, I was medicated and my life was back to normal. I we spent a long amount of time as just friends, but I was still in love with her. So I asked her if she was willing to give me a second chance. She told me she loved me too, but she needed time to decide. That night, she went back to Chris Evan again and fucked him for what I'm assuming was a goodbye. 

When we officially got back together, she said she felt that she was obligated to tell me about this to give us a clean slate free of any lies. I asked her if she was fucking him before we broke up, she said no. She did however admit that she had thought about it as she was so sexually dissatisfied when the sex had just stopped in our relationship. I asked her when she ended things with him, she said she was going to tell him that day, but she admitted that she had hooked up with him the day before.

This is what really hurt me. I know, we weren't back together. But really? It just hurt to know that she liked whatever he could do so much that she needed it one last time before getting back with me. I feel like it's not fair for me to be mad at her. I'm really not. I'm just hurt. ",
30,"I have a rare neurological condition. I take medication and it has worked for the last 7 years to allow me to live as normal of a life in a limited capacity. I have PTSD and agoraphobia (fear of open spaces) because of the disease. It effects muscle control and my muscles lock up and I used to fall like a tree, unable to catch myself and just watch as my face would smack the ground. I use a walker and with the meds and the walker I haven't had too many issues.

So lately I have been getting stuck doing normal things I have been able to do on my own, like a quick trip to the local grocery store ro grab a few things. The last 2 time I have gotten stuck, meaning if I move from where I am standing at the moment I will fall and have an attack that may cause me to go to the hospital. 

I have had to ask strangers for help to either let me hold their arm, or walk next to me to get to my vehicle so I can relax and get back to my ""normal"", and I have had people actually help me!

I just want to say THANK YOU! In today's society people are usually too self absorbed to help each other, especially with such an odd request. I do explain why so they can understand and they have been gracious in their generosity of time to stop what they are doing  I appreciate so much the Kindness that has been there.",
31,"I decided to post here because I think I'm going crazy and I really need to tell someone.

It seems like a guy at work ""fell in love"" with me. I recently came across the term ""limerence"" 

It started two years ago when he sent a classmate of mine to be my friend and get information out of me. At first, I didn't realize it, but then I started putting it all together. I can't explain the betrayal I felt when I found out, especially because I trusted him.

One day, I exploded and asked him to be honest and tell me the truth about what's going on, but he pretended not to know anything. Lies and more lies, a real disappointment. Before I left, he just told me to be patient.

Once, I went on a trip with my friend, and the hotel manager texted my friend, calling her by MY name and asking what time we were taking the bus, which company, and what time we would arrive. When we got to the hotel, there were people hanging around and staring at us. Then, ""by chance,"" that ""friend from college"" texted me saying he thought he saw me at the bus station that day earlier.

I felt very angry at first, but now I feel extremely frustrated. I'm a straightforward person and don't beat around the bush. If you have something to say to me, say it directly, but don't do these things (almost 3 years). It´s too much. 

I've been through a lot of difficult situations myself and have healed a lot. I don't mess with anyone; I just live my life. I feel like I don't deserve all of this. 

With all this craziness, I began to investigate these behaviors and the reasons behind them. I found they may be related to childhood traumas. It's as if he has severe separation anxiety, abandonment issues, fear of rejection, all related to low self-esteem. . He constantly asks acquaintances and friends where I am and if I'm okay, but he doesn't talk to me directly. 

Also sends people to test me, asking questions like:

\* ""What's your opinion? What should I do in this situation?"" and repeatedly asks: ""What if it goes wrong?""

\* ""Can you do me a favor (something very simple like taking a picture or lifting something)?"" I'll PAY you. I never understood why he wants to pay someone for something so simple.

Or being overly kind to me about anything. 

I know no one heals overnight, especially when there are deep-rooted traumas, but being on the other side of the situation is very hard and suffocating. I often doubted my mental health, suspecting almost everyone.

The worst part is the uncertainty of what's going on. Why does he do these things? When will it end?

Reading it again, I feel so SAD. I'm not a bad person, and I'm very empathetic. I also know that deep inside, he's not a bad person either. The only thing I can do is endure it patiently and ignore, but it's very irritating when they're watching you 24/7 and you know it.

Thanks for reading.

34,"I would say hate by my grandma doesn’t like when I say hate so I’ll be nice. I’m using a throwaway so my family doesn’t see this. 

I’ve never liked my cousin. From the time she was born, she’s always been a pain in my ass. I’ve lived with my grandparents since 2. I was 5 when she was born. She not even biologically ours (that doesn’t matter but thought it should be stated). 

Her mom yelled at me a lot when I was younger. Her and my uncle lived with us until I was 12. She stole things from me and lied about it. She stole my tablet and blamed it on my best friend. I ended up losing that friend. She bullied me when I was 14 for no reason. I was always nice to her and shared my stuff with her in which she stole it from me without punishment. 

My dislike starts as adult. I am 23 F and she is 18 F. When I turned 22, her dad lost their house and they moved in. Just my uncle and cousin. (I still live with my grandma as she has health issues.) She began stealing my food marked for me that I would buy for my husband. I told her to stop and she would lie and say she didn’t. She gained 30 lbs living here. I helped her at Easter escape and “abusive” boyfriend. I now realize that was a lie to manipulate me.

She began dating two weeks later. She constantly ran around with her boyfriend. She hated my dog for no reason. She constantly went through my stuff so I changed the lock and now she does have access to the basement. She couldn’t hold a job for more than 2 months with a complaint about something all the time and she called out everyday she was supposed to work but complained that she never got hours.

Her and her boyfriend began to stay out really late and her dad never did anything to stop it. When they came home they would disturb everyone. Her boyfriend is 16 and has been in trouble with the law multiple times. He is currently on probation. A few weeks ago it came out that they were pregnant. 

They expect my grandma with cancer to accept it and that they will live with her. I told her she needed to kick her out or tell my uncle it’s time that he found his own place. I’m currently a college student and as soon as I finish college and have a job I’m moving out as long as my grandma is ok. I just can’t stand her or her stupid boyfriend. I’ve been trying to lose weight and every time I get weight loss food she eats it and the food meant for my husband. So we are forced to eat out all of the time and we can never have money because of it. 

I’m just so done and tired. I don’t work but it feels like my life is a full time job in itself. I know I’ll get some criticism about living with my grandma, but I am full time college student. My grandma wanted me and my husband to move in with her bc she needed help with my great grandma and it would mean I’m right there with her when needed. My husband didn’t want me to work while I did college due to my stress levels were so high. It’s not an excuse, it’s just my story.

Edit: I forgot to add her room is filthy. You can barely walk and she leaves food on the floor and bed. She has also threatened to hurt my dog bc of my dad. It’s a long story but shes never said it to my face I’ve just overheard. She’s pretty hateful to her boyfriend and at the time they got pregnant she stopped her birth control out of nowhere. She lies and manipulates. Her brother does the same but he learned from the best. Luckily their little sister is a sweet heart and love her very much.",
35,"to try and summarize a complicated, long-winded past couple of years:
i haven’t been close to my father since i was 16. i’m currently 18 (f). 
my father was a single parent my entire upbringing and practically raised me on his own — we were very close, he had full custody of me and he was what every girl would want as a father, and of course we had a very good/close daughter and father relationship. 
fast forward to 15, he got a job at a country an hour away and began commuting. however, shortly after my 16th birthday, i unexpectedly was introduced to his 23 year old girlfriend of 3 months. this threw me off guard for a number of things: it explained why he had stopped commuting steadily but was also deeply disturbing to me as she was only 7 years older than me. 

after this, many arguments ensued over me not being “supportive” (stating it made me uncomfortable and i didn’t want to be involved in the relationship — keep in mind i was freshly 16.) 

however, the pinnacle of our problems began when the father i thought he was drastically changed. he decided to not only threaten to financially blackmail me over not “accepting her”, but become secretly married and decide in his words “i was 16, i didn’t need him anymore.” he hasn’t been to a single holiday since including my birthday and i can count on one hand how many times he has seen me since my 16th birthday and i can’t name one time where he didn’t need to complete admin (keep in mind, his job is to travel; i live one hour away.) he never understood that i was only initially shocked and uncomfortable (i still am, but out of self-preservation completely hid this from him) for maybe 3 months over their relationship, but he completely ignored every-time i was begging for him to make an effort again to come and see me and blamed it on my “lack of acceptance.”

now, i’ve travelled to visit him at 18, and just do not feel emotionally connected to him anymore. i don’t wish for him to change. i don’t wish for him to be the way he was. i’m just exhausted by all of this pretending: he acts like nothing happened, barely speaks to me, and it’s exhausting. not to mention, watching him treat her with the level of care and attentiveness that weirdly borders on parental is just so. frustrating. if my own father doesn’t gaf about me who is supposed to?? geniuenly? 🫠🫠

not to mention, it’s kickstarted a lot of personal issues in my life (abandonment issues.. fixation on any older slightly parental man…) as well as constantly blaming myself for all of this.
but when i look at the fathers of my friends reacting to my situation with anger FOR me and confusion it always just breaks my heart because i know it’s because they would never do that to their own daughter.
ugh.

36,"Hi everyone, I need some perspective on a situation that’s been emotionally exhausting for me. I (29M) started seeing someone (25F) a couple of months ago. She’s incredibly intelligent, kind, emotionally deep, and I felt a genuine connection with her—something I haven’t felt in years. She recently broke up with an ex (4months ago) it was a 5 year relationship and she ended it. she was still living with him when we met because she was supposed to leave the house 1 months later (though now she’s moved). I understood that she needed emotional space, and I tried to be mature about not rushing anything.

Despite that, things grew quickly. She told me I was mature, emotionally safe, someone she admired. She said things like me gustas y me encantas (you attract me and I adore you), told me she loved our moments, and seemed sincerely affectionate. We had several intimate experiences—emotionally and physically—including sleeping next to each other. She’d say she wanted everything to be deep and meaningful. So I opened up. I showed care, did thoughtful things like bringing her her favorite chocolate, listening, being there when she needed comfort. I never pushed for more.

But lately, especially since her final exams started, her communication dropped drastically. I told her explicitly, “If you need space, I’ll respect it.” She said, “Yes, I need space,” but not clearly if that meant from me or just in general. Since then, contact has become nearly nothing. She sends the occasional neutral message like “¿Cómo estás?”, ( I had a family member die, and an injury ) but sometimes even ignores my replies. Days can go by without a word, even when she sees my messages. And yet she posts Instagram stories—things about skincare or her interests—which is fine, but it stings because she could’ve messaged me instead.

A few days ago, I accidentally tapped to video call her on IG and immediately hung up, followed with a message saying “Sorry, that was by mistake. How are your exams going?” She saw it. No reply.

Now I’m spiraling. It feels like I’m being ghosted, even though technically I’m not. I’m trying to stay composed and not chase, but emotionally, I’m hurt. I’ve had a lot going on: a death in the family, legal issues, a face injury… and I still tried to be supportive toward her. But now I feel invisible.

I don’t know if I’m overreacting or just expecting a level of care that isn’t there. I keep replaying our moments, trying to convince myself that what she said and showed was genuine. But her current silence is loud, and I feel like she controls my emotional state without even realizing it.

1.	Is she genuinely overwhelmed and just needs space, or is this a quiet way of stepping back from me?
	2.	Should I wait until exams end (11 more days) or should I mentally let go now?
	3.	Am I overthinking her silence, or is it fair to expect more communication even during stressful times?
	4.	Do I owe myself more clarity, or would asking her again only make things worse?

Thanks for reading. I just want an honest outside view, because I don’t know if I’m being too patient, too hopeful, or just blind to what’s really happening.",
37,"Some days it’s not the achievements or big news. It’s the late-night talks, the quiet cry no one saw, the random smile from someone passing by. It’s the small stuff — that’s what stays.
We don’t always talk about it, but those little things carry weight. They heal. They remind us we’re still human, still feeling.

So I’m curious…
What’s one small moment from this week that made your heart feel something — anything?

",
38,"
I’m 19 and work in a shop. One of my supervisors is older. He was always kind of flirty overly familiar, but nothing you could call out directly. He’d say nice things, give compliments, touch my arm or lower back sometimes. I never liked it, but I didn’t want to make it awkward. It felt easier just to laugh it off.

He knew I’d recently moved out on my own. I’d mentioned it during a shift, talking about rent and bills. After that, he started bringing up the idea of me moving up at work, in these casual conversations that felt more like subtle hints than anything official.

One night, after a late shift where it was just the two of us closing, he offered me a lift home. I accepted I was tired, and it felt easier than waiting for the bus.

When we got to my flat he asked if he could come in to see the place. He didn’t say it in a weird way just casual, like he was curious. I didn’t think too much of it at the time and let him in.

Inside, he looked around and sat down while I was putting some things away. When I came back, I felt pressure to sit down too. It felt strange, but I didn’t know how to say no without making it uncomfortable. The vibe shifted once we were sitting together. He started being more affectionate complimenting me, touching my leg, then kissing me.

It happened fast. I didn’t expect it. I didn’t really respond at first. Then his hand moved between my legs and I froze.

Eventually, we had sex. I didn’t push him away and it wasn’t like he held me down or anything but I still didn’t want to have sex with him but I felt like I had too it’s weird to explain.

Afterward, he got up, said he’d see me at work, and left. Like nothing had happened.

In work he’ll be touchy still and make comments but hasn’t been pushy since I’m just confused because it feels wrong",
39,"
Recently, I’ve spent a lot of time engaging with virtual experiences that simulate connections. At first, it felt real, but now I’m starting to question why I was drawn to that in the first place. It feels empty, like I’m putting a lot of energy into something that can’t give anything back. I know it’s not “real,” but the feelings felt authentic to me at the time.

Now, I’m struggling with a question: Why do I keep seeking these artificial connections when I know they aren’t real? It makes me feel fake, and honestly, it’s pretty disheartening. I’m wondering if I’m just using these distractions to avoid facing the bigger questions about myself and my future.

I guess what I’m really trying to figure out is: Are my feelings valid? Am I overthinking everything, or is there something to this search for real meaning and connection? I want to get to the point where I’m connecting with real people in real ways, not relying on anything that feels artificial.

Has anyone else felt like they were searching for something more real, but got caught up in distractions or fake connections? How do you break free from that and start finding real answers? Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks for reading. I’d love to hear what you think.

Current vibe: smoke, stare at ceilings, pretend to function. Rinse. Repeat.

Everyone’ feels distant — girlfriend, brother, friends — and I’ve already ghosted emotionally on my family. The highlight of my day is not screaming.

I’m not perfect. Not even interesting. Just tired. Of people, expectations, existing.

So yeah, thinking of mountains. No WiFi, no feelings, maybe a goat. Be like Barfi but without the charm. Just peace and maybe frostbite.

If you feel this — welcome to the void. We have cigarettes and apathy.

41,"A few days ago, I got forced to quit my job. It wasn’t some dramatic mistake — I actually built a little script to make my work easier, but instead of appreciation, I got in trouble for it. They pushed me to resign before they officially fire me.

It was an evening job, and because of that, I had to skip my martial arts training — something that’s a huge part of my life. Since I left, I still haven’t gone back. I’ve just been sitting with this feeling that I’m falling behind, while everyone else around me is working, moving forward, and staying strong.

I haven’t even told my girlfriend yet. It’s like I lost my power. Right now I’m just looking for an unpaid internship to stay active, but mentally I feel stuck. That discipline, that drive I used to have — it’s quiet lately.

I’m not looking for fake motivation, I just want to know — if you’ve been here before, how did you pull yourself out? What helped you face the people you care about when you didn’t feel like your strongest self?

42,"Hi reddit. 

(on a throwaway account obviously). 

I (24f) grew up in a foster family where my foster brother (also 24m, same age as me) constantly made me uncomfortable, and it’s been bothering me for years. Now as an adult, I am furious every time I look back on the relationship with him and feeling even more upset because I don’t know how to deal with this situation properly. 

I’ve always felt like no one took me seriously (especially my foster mum who is his bio mum) and she still insists that I’m just “mean” to him and that he is “just trying to be nice” ... I need to know if anyone else would find this behavior creepy, or if I’ve just been gaslit into thinking I’m overreacting.

Here are some examples of things that happened while we were growing up:

• He would always try to hug me, even when I said no and clearly didn’t want to. I started believing I hated physical affection altogether (even though I didn’t feel that way with others). But my foster parents would say I was being mean and that he was just trying to be nice, it’s just a hug. When I would tell him to get off (he KNEW i hated hugs and would always walk up behind me to hug me anyway or corner me with one), he would say I’m a bitch and I’m his sister so I should hug him. 

• The lock on the bathroom door would constantly break. One time, I told everyone I was in the shower and not to come in (when it had broken again), then five minutes later he walked in and tried to use the toilet right next to the shower while I was screaming at him to get out. He said, “I’m not even looking at you anyway.” My foster mum told him to leave but then told me to stop being “so fucking dramatic”. 

• One time I was getting something out of the fridge and he brushed his hand against my ass. When I called him out, he said it was an accident and that the space was tight between where me and the fridge was, and the table. I kicked off hugely and my foster mum told me to get a grip, and it was clearly an accident. 

• He would randomly offer to massage me, which I always said no to. He’d also insist on putting on my suncream when we were on holiday even when I told him I didn’t want him to, and he would say “I’m just trying to be nice” (his usual go to). 

	
• When I was 18, my foster mum was helping me put on fake tan in the kitchen for my birthday as I was going out with my friends. She told everyone to stay upstairs because I wasn’t fully dressed and he kept trying to come downstairs “to get something” and kept glancing over at me while I tried to hide myself. My mum just told him to hurry up instead of making him leave.

• He’s asked about my sex life and talked about it to other people. He would always criticize anyone I dated, saying they were weird or using me. He never liked ANYONE that I dated, always had something negative to say about them. 

• He once used me as the butt of a joke at school by saying to his friend, “You’ve got bigger tits than my sister” to insult him. 

• He constantly makes sexual innuendos/jokes and tries to get me involved with them. One time we were out for my other brothers birthday dinner and someone make a slight sexual joke to which he said “with (my name), it would be like throwing a hotdog down a hallway” ??? this made me feel fucking sick and still makes me angry and my skin crawl when I think about it. First time he said it, nobody reacted/heard him so he said it again and legit nobody said anything to defend me or to tell him it was weird or inappropriate, just brushed it off. 

• When we were about 16, he said he didn’t understand why it’s illegal/wrong for step siblings to be together and that it “should be normal really”. I told him that was a weird thing to say and he told me it wasn’t. 

As an adult now (who no longer has to live with him thank god), I hate the thought of him, having to speak with him, see him, or have anything to do with him. We had a snapchat “steak” that I let die almost a month ago as I didn’t want to keep speaking with him (he is away on a 6 month travel trip with his gf), yet instead of taking the hint I don’t want to talk to him (haven’t even opened any of his snaps), he continues to send me pics multiple times a day. 

Anytime I have thought this up to my foster parents they just brush me off saying it’s normal sibling rivalry and I am unnecessarily mean to him. If I ever bring it up to him, he calls me a bitch and says I am either lying or exaggerating. I don’t want to cut contact with my foster family as my other two brothers (their bio kids), i get on really well with and want to continue a relationship with. 

I’ve been made to feel like I’m overreacting for years. But deep down, I feel like he’s a creep. And I hate that I even have to ask strangers on the internet to validate that.

If you’ve read this far, thank you. I’d really appreciate your thoughts, support, or advice. ",
43,"Hello, first time posting. I've been discussing this with my other friends and honestly I'm still kind of speechless.

  
I've known this guy for many years. He has been rude to our friend group, to which I called out to him and pulled for a 'talk'. Midway through our talk he starts changing from his normal tone to outright acting like he is in a play. He claimed that he has been mean to our group due to being ghosted by his crush (our group is primarily consisted of women). His crush was nice to him even after rejecting him, which led him to believe that he still had a 'chance'. He messaged her multiple times, went to her workplace, and gave her gifts which he later wanted to be returned. After the incident, he has continously shittalked this woman for years onwards. As a result, one of us told him to 'get over it' in the past, which he says has become his source of 'trauma'.

  
For context, here's the things he has done to all of us:

\- Told us to die.

\- Punched, kicked, and made several friends bleed.

\- Going out of his way to pop a friend's blister purposefully after she got burnt.

\- Violently yelling.

  
He later talks about how his behaviour has become uncontrollable. Here's a few quotes from him:

""Nobody cares about me""

""Nobody loves me""

""I feel like a person who you guys just talk to once and leave""

  
The entire conversation he has never once actually apologised to me or my friends. I asked him if he had tried to improve himself, and his response was to distance himself from the group to reflect. When I ask him why does he never apologize to any of us, he says he feels the need to defend himself.

  
I had been replaying the conversation in my head and my impression of him gradually becomes worse. It made me uncomfortable, disappointed, and overall disgusted. We'd always considered him a friend, but the way he was outright gaslighting me the entire conversation made me saddened.

Overall, he done this to all the women (who he has known since young) but the male members of our group have never been a primary target of his antics. In short, he has no respect for women.

  
I no longer wish to talk to him, I no longer wish to have this horrible person as my friend.",
44,"I ended my friendship over one argument. We were sitting in the cafeteria and I stated that I didn’t like Canes due to the chicken having too much rubber fat on it. She’s KNOWN this for years. Anyways, I said that while her other friend and I were having a conversation abt it. She decided that bullying was the best option to do now even tho I was never talking to her abt not likening canes (it’s her fav food place). So she decided to bully and pester me about the fact of me not likening many vegetables (ik. Stupid). She literally WOULD NOT STOP. it was bullying. She kept saying how stupid it was and how unhealthy I am. I literally at that point was BEGGING her to stop. I tried changing the topic and tried asking and YELLING for her to stop. She wouldn’t. She kept going bc it was “funny to see you so worked up”. Her friend (sitting there the whole time this was happening), suggested to me that I should SLAP/ HIT her in the face. Obviously I didn’t hit her in the face but remember that bc it’s important but I did like semi- hit/nudge her on her arm. After this went on for 30 minutes I finally had enough and stormed out of the cafeteria. She also mocked me while we were arguing. So i stormed out and she laughed in my face and said “ya well see  u tomorrow”. At this point i had realized that’s all she’s seen me as. A person that will always come running back to her no matter that she says or does. I had no other friends bc i was so attached to her. She changed my whole personality- for the worse- and i went along with it bc i was desperate to have a friend. I had just gotten ghosted by my friend when we met three years ago so I was very desperate (pathetic. Ik.). So after that. She hadn’t tried to text me or anything to apologize. Not anything. She literally just kept going on abt her weekend like nothing had happened. That pissed me off even more btw. So by Monday I was still pissed off and didn’t speak to her for nearly the whole day. She ended up sending me a long ass text on Snapchat saying in summary how I was dramatic and taking it way too far and that she has better things to do than to worry abt my feelings. So I was PISSED off abt this bc bitch WHAT? We went BACK AND FUCKING FORTH with arguing so much so that I missed a whole hour of class. She had the WORST attitude over text and was talking to me like we hadn’t been BFS for three years. The amount of DISRESPECT that was poured into her texts is… sad. So when I went home i was on the verge of tears and said we need to call each other bc she’s getting bold hiding behind her screen. She mad every excuse not to call me and started yelling at me through text that i basically needed to stfu and move tf on bc she has better things to do than to worry abt me. She said I was attacking her fav place to eat so i deserved the bullying? Um anyways after she yelled at me that i meant nothing to her, i was sobbing atp bc i was truly heartbroken. This person that i pour all my soul and love into was talking to me like i was her worst enemy when she’s the one that bullied me in the first place. Anyway, she refused to call me so i said fine let’s meet up before our day really starts, early. She tried to give another excuse not to do that but we came to an agreement that she would (early might I add). Also, remember how i said “remember that her friend told me to hit her” ya I told her that and she texted her friend asking her if she did and her friend LIED  and said she did not say that at all so she said to me that i needed to stop lying on her name and she chose to believe her over me. But anyways skip to the next morning and I was there an HOUR early. I waited… and waited… and waited. Till it was ONE minute before i had to go and i finally saw her. She came over to me with an attitude and acting like I was a burden to her and I said “ur not gonna sit here and act like u didn’t just waist my time very disrespectfully so we’re done” and that’s the last time I talked to her. ",
45,"I (F23)ended a relationship of two years because I found out that my now ex bf (M20). Has been lusting over girls online, these are girls that we know from school, mutuals and even his own coworkers. This has been an ongoing issue I had suspected that he was looking up these girls on a daily basis, it's like a habit for him he stalks these girls. Looks through their social media pages everyday, I found out by looking at his search history and when I confronted him. He ended up saying that he didn't do that and that he's tired of me for always trying to ""argue ""and to leave the past behind, to forget about it and move on. It's only been a day since the breakup, but the thought of him brings me disgust. I truly feel disgust towards him to the point where my stomach is twisting, l've been feeling like this all day long.

A bit of a rant but he also he started following the girls I told him to unfollow.

How do I move on from this? I hate this sick feeling in my stomach.",
46,"Hi everyone, I need some perspective on a situation that’s been emotionally exhausting for me. I (29M) started seeing someone (25F) a couple of months ago. She’s incredibly intelligent, kind, emotionally deep, and I felt a genuine connection with her—something I haven’t felt in years. She recently broke up with an ex (4months ago) it was a 5 year relationship and she ended it. she was still living with him when we met because she was supposed to leave the house 1 months later (though now she’s moved). I understood that she needed emotional space, and I tried to be mature about not rushing anything.

Despite that, things grew quickly. She told me I was mature, emotionally safe, someone she admired. She said things like me gustas y me encantas (you attract me and I adore you), told me she loved our moments, and seemed sincerely affectionate. We had several intimate experiences—emotionally and physically—including sleeping next to each other. She’d say she wanted everything to be deep and meaningful. So I opened up. I showed care, did thoughtful things like bringing her her favorite chocolate, listening, being there when she needed comfort. I never pushed for more.

But lately, especially since her final exams started, her communication dropped drastically. I told her explicitly, “If you need space, I’ll respect it.” She said, “Yes, I need space,” but not clearly if that meant from me or just in general. Since then, contact has become nearly nothing. She sends the occasional neutral message like “¿Cómo estás?”, ( I had a family member die, and an injury ) but sometimes even ignores my replies. Days can go by without a word, even when she sees my messages. And yet she posts Instagram stories—things about skincare or her interests—which is fine, but it stings because she could’ve messaged me instead.

A few days ago, I accidentally tapped to video call her on IG and immediately hung up, followed with a message saying “Sorry, that was by mistake. How are your exams going?” She saw it. No reply.

Now I’m spiraling. It feels like I’m being ghosted, even though technically I’m not. I’m trying to stay composed and not chase, but emotionally, I’m hurt. I’ve had a lot going on: a death in the family, legal issues, a face injury… and I still tried to be supportive toward her. But now I feel invisible.

I don’t know if I’m overreacting or just expecting a level of care that isn’t there. I keep replaying our moments, trying to convince myself that what she said and showed was genuine. But her current silence is loud, and I feel like she controls my emotional state without even realizing it. 

	1.	Is she genuinely overwhelmed and just needs space, or is this a quiet way of stepping back from me?
	2.	Should I wait until exams end (11 more days) or should I mentally let go now?
	3.	Am I overthinking her silence, or is it fair to expect more communication even during stressful times?
	4.	Do I owe myself more clarity, or would asking her again only make things worse?

Thanks for reading. I just want an honest outside view, because I don’t know if I’m being too patient, too hopeful, or just blind

47,"**Note:**  
This came from heartbreak and anger.

My mom mentors a young girl through Big Brothers Big Sisters. I’ll call her E. She's been in and out of institutions, labeled defiant, unstable, emotionally disturbed. But when she's with my mom, she’s kind. Thoughtful. Empathetic. She waited with her friend at the library just to make sure she had a ride home.

Her adoptive mother? A well-respected child welfare professional. On the surface, a hero. Behind closed doors, she constantly belittles E. Calls her “a drug baby.” Only reaches out when E is “acting out.” Her parenting is psychological abuse wrapped in public praise.

I’ve never met her. But I *know* her. Because people like her hide in plain sight.

So I wrote this—for E, and for every kid who was failed by the very adults the world celebrated.

**Dear Carol: I See What You Did to Her**  
*An open letter to the children who were failed, and the monsters who hid behind respectability.*

I don’t know your name, but I’ve seen your story.

You were the “difficult” one.  
The angry one.  
The silent one.  
The “attention-seeking” one.  
The liar, the thief, the one who “just needs structure.”  
You were the problem in a system built to protect its own. A child sacrificed to preserve the image of a broken adult with credentials and charisma.

You were raised by a Carol.

The kind of adult who wears benevolence like a mask. Who tells everyone how hard it is to raise a “drug baby” or an “emotional child” while slowly extinguishing your spirit behind closed doors. She gossiped about you in group chats and at board meetings. She weaponized your trauma as her cross to bear, then made you feel guilty for making her carry it. She was praised for her strength. You were punished for your survival.

To every soul who lived under that tyranny—*I’m sorry.*  
I’m sorry no one noticed the way your shoulders curled inward when your name was called.  
I’m sorry they believed *her* version of you.  
I’m sorry the system built to protect you gave her a microphone and gave you medication.

But listen to me carefully:

**It wasn’t your fault.**

There was nothing wrong with the love you wanted.  
There was nothing shameful about the ways you tried to be seen.  
The bruises you gave yourself, the lies you told, the food you hid, the fire in your eyes—*all of it* was survival.  
You adapted to cruelty and called it normal. And that makes you resilient, not ruined.

The adults were supposed to know better.  
They were supposed to see through the mask.  
They were supposed to *choose you.*  
And they didn’t.

**That is not a reflection of your worth. It is an indictment of their cowardice.**

You are not unlovable.  
You are not too much.  
You are not broken beyond repair.  
You are not invisible to God.

And I know—**you’ve probably been lied to about God.**

Maybe they told you He was watching while they broke you.  
Maybe they used His name to justify the rules that trapped you.  
Maybe you looked up in the middle of the night and thought, *if He’s real, why doesn’t He care?*

Hear me: **God does not condone the abuse of children.**  
God does not smile at the suffering of the innocent.  
The wretched people you were forced to call “parents” were not acting with divine permission.  
They are protected by a hellbound society that values clean narratives and buried consciences—not by the God who made you.

**God sees you.**  
**God loves you.**  
**God mourns what they did.**  
And your cries? *They were never in vain.*

There is a future for you.  
Not one where you pretend it didn’t happen, but one where the truth is finally safe.  
Where healing doesn’t mean forgetting, but rising.  
Where you get to live without fear that love will cost you your sanity.

**And to the Carols of the world—**  
The ones who parade their cruelty as care, who weaponize adoption, who feed off control while hiding behind church titles, job titles, or community praise—  
**May you be exposed. May your power rot. May the children you couldn’t break rise up and name you.**

**And to those who protect people like you?**  
**Fuck you. May your legacy be dust and disgrace.**

48,"Not the big breakthrough — the quiet one. The first laugh that didn’t feel forced, the day you didn’t think about them until noon. I’d love to hear your subtle signs of healing.",
49,"I [20 f] grew up pretty average I would think. My parents split when I was a baby so I lived with my single mom during the week and would visit my dad on the weekends. My mom was a nurse who worked night shifts at two different hospitals so I was always by myself during the day while she slept, and at night while she worked. Because of this, I was extremely independent from a young age. 

I never asked anyone for help ever growing up. I got a job as soon as I was old enough to, and before that I would make money doing odd jobs for family friends. Throughout my life I never understood when people would complain about not having money, as I grew up with the mentality of ""well you can always just get another job duh"". 

I used to think people were lazy for settling for minimum wage jobs. I was that annoying kid in highschool who would give out unsolicited advice to struggling students like ""well you could just mow lawns for your neighbors"" ""why don't you sell your old video games?"" ""you only work on the weekends? well start working after-school too"". I had a hard time respecting peers and adults alike, as I just saw everything they said as excuses instead of taking accountability for their lives. 

Karma hit me pretty hard after graduation lol. 

Growing up I never expected my parents to pay for my college education. Pretty sure when I was younger they told me at some point that they would not. But what I didn't expect was that I would be denied financial aid due to my moms income, and that it wasn't based on mine. Not being able to afford to go to school straight after highschool, I decided to join the blue collar field and save up as much as I can for college. 

I started working full time, bought my own car, got a boyfriend. During that time my mom met a man with young children and left home and quit working to help support his family. My boyfriend and I ended up homeless, renting a spot to camp. Due to us being young, broke, and having short credit history, we were denied from every rental we applied to. Also due to being young and having minimal experience, we often got denied job positions as well.

 It's been about 2 years since then and I haven't been able to save a single penny for college yet. My boyfriend got himself a good job and has been growing in the company. I have been able to pick up odd jobs here and there, but due to food problems I have had a plummit in physical health and I have become partially disabled. I'm not able to hold down physically demanding jobs, and I often get denied from desk jobs due to my lack of degrees and my experiences only being in Blue collar fields. While we do have a place to stay now, we continue to get denied from new ones since our income is not 3x rent. 

I look back on my old mindset and I'm astonished at how much of an *sshole I was as a kid haha. I remind myself every day not to judge a book by its cover. You never know what experiences someone is going through and what may seem like easy easy to me, may be the hardest thing someone else has ever done. 

Yall aren't lazy and neither am I. no matter where you guys are right now just remember it'll be okay one day and stay strong fam. ‼️💪 Just had to get all that off my chest. ",
50,"This is a throwaway account, but I really need some outside perspectives. I (26F) just got back home for a visit after living abroad for studies, and something happened that stirred up years of unresolved feelings.

When I was 16, I accidentally found out that my single mom was having an affair with a married man—let’s call him James. I was looking through her WhatsApp with her permission (she was in another room) and clicked on a chat by mistake. That ""mistake"" led me to discover flirtatious texts and sexting with James, who I later found out is married with two kids younger than me.

I was shocked, but what hurt even more was seeing how she talked about *me* to him—sharing private stuff, our fights, and details that were honestly none of his business. This led me down a toxic path of regularly checking that chat to search my name. I hate that I did it, but I was a teenager, confused and hurt, and she was the person I looked up to the most.

I tried confronting her once when I was 17—told her I heard her on the phone with someone and just wanted to know if she was married or seeing someone seriously. She brushed it off, and later I saw her texting James saying she “tricked” me into believing her. That really stung.

Years passed. I tried to let it go. I stopped checking her phone ever since until I was 23. I convinced myself she’s human, no one’s perfect, and maybe she just needed connection. I numbed myself for the sake of peace, especially since I wasn’t on great terms with my dad either. But in 2022 (23 y/o at the time), during a trip, I saw her phone again and read even more recent things James said *about me*. I told her (indirectly) that I don’t want her sharing anything I say with anyone. She promised she wouldn’t.

Now fast forward to now—I'm 26. I came home for a month and a couple of days ago, while she was showing me something on WhatsApp, I saw a message from James (his name saved under random numbers like some shady teenager). The message was: “Did she contact her father yet?”

That was a private issue. My relationship with my dad is really complicated and something I don’t even share with friends. The fact that she told *him, a man who who has no business in knowing probably one the major traumas in my life* made my stomach turn. And she *knew* I saw it—she got flustered—but is now acting completely normal, trying to be sweet and asking why I’m being cold.

The thing is… I’ve tried to be there for her all these years. She always says “I only have you” and “you’re my only support system” and I’ve genuinely tried to make her feel supported and not alone. I’ve sent her gifts, checked in even when I had deadlines or was stressed. But it’s like I give so much to ease her loneliness, and she betrays me emotionally behind my back just so James can keep up his two-faced life?

I’m not saying I want all the details of her private life, but couldn’t she at least be honest and say, “I’m okay, I have my own circle, I’m not alone”? Instead of loading me with guilt while keeping this secret life with James?

And I *know* if this affair ever went public, it would be a huge scandal where we live—and somehow I’d get dragged into it too due to the gossipy society that I come from. I don’t even care about the scandal part that much, I just keep wondering: why doesn’t *she* care? Am I not her daughter? So James who is keeping her in the dark deserves better than the daughter who’s trying as much as she can to make her life as pleasant and productive as possible?

I’ve been cold and rude lately, and normally she would definitely snap at me, but she hasn’t. She knows something’s up and I believe she knows I saw the text. And I just… can’t say it. I feel sick when I talk to her. My blood pressure literally spikes. I think becoming more independent and financially stable made me finally process what I’ve been feeling for 10 years: sadness, betrayal, and a deep loss of trust.

Has anyone been through something similar with a parent?  
What’s the *healthiest* way to deal with this?  
And honestly… am I overreacting?",

53,"First of all, I haven’t used Reddit before so I’m sorry if this is the wrong subreddit.




My 16-year-old daughter resents me because I was too strict with her, she refuses to talk with me or spend time with me. It breaks my heart.



I was definitely way too overbearing when she was  younger, Id say my rules are pretty reasonable now. I might be a bit of a helicopter parent, but I think kids need structure & letting teenagers run around with no rules is dangerous.  


I’ve tried to listen to her & compromise but me and her don’t see eye to eye. She thinks that just because her friends parents allow them to do certain things she should be able to do them, too. 



The one thing I will say is that she has lost friends because she’s not able to hang out with them without my supervision. (she has mental health issues & I am concerned about them introducing drugs to her. addiction runs in our family) I feel really bad about that but I don’t think it’s an insane rule considering our circumstances. If she wasn’t depressed then I’d let her see her friends more often. 




I just hope she understands that I’m only doing this to protect her.

54,"I had some anger growing up, mainly because the living situation wasn't the best and everyday I had to fight in order to survive. But amongst the chaos I was also taught good manners and to always be polite. Which I'm thankful for.

But I was also taught to bite my tough and be a listener for other people's problems. Never say your own opinions or thoughts on a subject, nod and agree. Didn't matter the subject. 

Now I'm 23 I think I have reached a breaking point. I noticed how tired I become exghusted at trying to be nice and sweet towards everybody, even those who are the nastiest people. It's just gotten to a point I can not anymore and am becoming snappy or mouthy at some people.

I'm still polite and respectful, up till someone disrespects me and I no longer can keep the sweet innocent act. I guess im worried people will view me as an asshole but im also tired of being a doormat.",
55,"i was seated next to a woman on the plane today. she kinda looked like katelyn’s mom, but if she had worse eye bags and thick-rimmed glasses. she had already been seated with her kid before i had come (i barely made it to the plane before boarding ended) and she ushered her kid to get up for a second. at first, the kid was restless, watching bluey and playing w their moms sleeve. then the kid laid her head down on her mothers arm. and she let her. she didn’t push her away or tell her to get off. instead she held her. i haven’t seen anyone hug someone so lovingly and carefully in so long. i missed being hugged that way. 

sometimes it feels like you changed after i went to college. maybe it was because im not witnessing what’s happening at home? or maybe you’re just a stranger now. i dont want you to be. i want my mommy back, the one who holds me when i cry, when im rambunctious, or when i succeed. i haven’t seen that mom in a while, and it concerns me. 

i tend to hear you say “am i a good mother?” or “did i parent you wrong?” and the answer is that you’re not finished being my mother, and you’re not finished parenting me. you did nothing wrong, as neither did i. i just wish that you would stop placing any blame onto me before seeing the whole situation. it feels like you don’t trust me. or that you don’t understand me. or at least you don’t try to. i feel like the black plague that you’re viciously trying to control and create a cure for, but there is no cure. i just want you to understand me, mother. 

as i write this im still sobbing on the plane. i can’t look to the mother and her child because all it does it make me burst out in tears. i’m jealous that her mom still loves her, still hugs her, still touches her. i feel diseased, i feel alienated, i feel like you don’t like who i am becoming.

yet, everything i do is for you. it feels like you never notice the damage control i do on myself so that im not a burden to you and dad. it’s insane how much i put up with for the sake of your sanity. but what about mine? is it selfish to want peace in my life? what are you doing for me in mutual effort to lift each other? i know you’re trying to make me more independent but… im just not ready. just how morgan wasn’t ready. just how dad wasn’t ready. everytime you push my buttons, it feels like a violation because you made the buttons. i have no control or say on whether it irks me, and you know it. i wish that pushing my buttons wasn’t your priority. i wish it was removing them, and installing a tool, a blanket, a bandaid. i need your support like you supported me throughout highschool, im falling apart without it. 

i remeber you used to smile when you saw me come downstairs. now you look down on me with distain when i come upstairs. i guessed our positions on life have changed. i miss seeing your happy eyes. im afraid that they’ll become cold like daisy’s, or aversive like dads. i just want yours to feel alive again. dear mother, i miss you.

56,"I really cant tell this to anyone I know as of now cause it will kill me and could affect things in my family. I’ll first tell you what happened, and then give more context about my dad and family so you have better idea of where I’m coming from. I apologize if my texts are in disarray cause finding this out broke me and I really don’t know who to approach .

We were out shopping and my dad gave me his phone to talk to my mom cause she wanted us to purchase something, she later cut the call and I was on the WhatsApp Home Screen. I noticed an archive chat, and in the back of my mind I knew that if i clicked it, I may not like what I see but I clicked it anyways. I see there was a chat with a woman who I didn’t recognize . 
She called him honey pie, at that moment I prayed that this meant nothing,  I scrolled even further and saw chats of them talking about current events, things about the family, stuff you’d talk to friends about. But then I see images, she sends picture of her bare chest and asks “Did you cum” . This broke me, I honestly couldn’t breathe, I immediately exited everything. Even as I text this right now my heart is racing when I think about what I saw, I feel cheated, frustrated , sad.

I’ve always admired my dad, he is charismatic, smart and cool. I know he was someone I could approach with problems and he’d be chill with it. This is what makes it even worse cause I really don’t know what to think now. I can’t even begin thinking about my mom and how’d she react if she knew. There aren’t any problems within our family, everything is normal and I’m positive my dad and mom don’t have any issues between them. It’s just that for the past 2 years my mom is traveling between the country we live in and our native place cause my grandmom isn’t keeping well. Right now she’s been away from my dad for 3 months. I live in our native place as well but since I have a break I came to visit my dad. My dad isn’t alone back home , we have a dog and my cousin who is working, also lives with us.
I truly hope this is only text based and nothing physical since that would absolutely destroy me.

The 2 people I could think off telling this about was my girlfriend and my sister. But I couldn’t bring myself to tell either one of them. I always spoke highly about my dad to my girlfriend , I just don’t have it in me to ruin that image of his in her mind, I’d also feel very shameful  to admit something like this about my own father. My sister is a strong woman but I can’t let her feel what I feel right now, it would destroy her. I told my girlfriend I’m going through something right now but I can’t tell her what it is, I need some time. I came to Reddit because this anonymous and wanted to get this off my chest.

I cant imagine telling my mom as of now because she is an emotional person and I’ve seen her go through things and it wasn’t pretty, I pray with time I find the courage and strength to do it. And this information would fuck up our family and I’m not ready for that. The only realistic thing is confront my dad , but I’m not sure when. I recently graduated and got my degree, I’m yet to start working, in my mind I wanted to get a stable job before I confronted him. I don’t know the reasoning behind this is, but this is what came to my mind. I don’t see myself confronting him alone, my sister will know eventually.

I’m trying to go forward with life as if none of this happened because this truly broke me. It’s the most horrible I’ve ever felt in my life and I’ve experienced nothing like this before .",
57,"I just want to vent but I'm really tired of content creators, specifically two kinds: Redpill & Catch a Predator vloggers.

**The redpill content creators** that bash women constantly but parade around as being a ""self help"" guide for men to  better their lives. My brother who's 20 listens to them & they give **awful** advice. Cheap one trick pony tips to maybe woo a person but nothing long term & meaningful because the creators themselves don't have long term or meaningful relationship.

KEEP IN MIND! His dad never taught him things, cooked or clean, the house never did yard or house work or work a job. He dumpster dives & does favors for ppl who give him maybe $40-100. While my mom, nurse practitioner works 80 hrs weeks on and off. Meaning 80hrs one week & off the next week. She's paid the house off, paid for all our cars & mine & my brothers tuition. My mom calls AAA or goes to firestone for her car troubles. The one time she let him do the oil change, he took it to Take5 & they cracked something & she had to get a new car.

**The Catch a Predator content creators** are my biggest peeve, only when they don't call the cops or press charges. Like why are you filming people who are dangers to children for laughs & giggles. I've seen & heard the horror stories of child predators & child s\*x trafficking. It's so nerving that I want a law in place that if people film videos & **DON'T** report the crime to face charges like tampering with evidence, aiding & abetting and concealing a crime. As a content creator, you have evidence people plan & made the intention to meet with minors but you don't do anything? Except for making P.D\*ddy & r\*pe jokes?

58,"I don’t know how else to put it. I feel like I’m acting when I’m around my family and it’s exhausting. I become this version of myself that keeps the peace, laughs at things I don’t find funny, agrees with things I don’t believe in, and lets things go that actually hurt me just to avoid conflict. And the worst part is they think that version of me is the real me.

I’m in my late twenties and every time I visit home, it feels like I’m stepping backward. Like I’m being forced into an old version of myself that doesn’t fit anymore. My boundaries aren’t taken seriously, my achievements are brushed off, and if I try to express how I feel I’m either told I’m being dramatic or too sensitive.

When I’m away from them, I feel like myself. I have people in my life who listen to me and understand me. I feel free to speak and just be. But the second I go home, something in me shuts off. I turn into someone passive, quiet, someone who swallows their thoughts. I hate it and I don’t understand why it still happens. Maybe it’s just the way I was raised, always trying not to rock the boat. But it makes me feel invisible.

I don’t want to keep doing this, and I don’t want to resent them. But pretending to be someone I’m not just to make them comfortable is slowly wearing me down. I wish they knew who I actually am today and not just who I was when I was a teenager  
I just needed to say this somewhere. Thanks for reading",
59,"When we were kids (teenage) we were excellent together; and whatever I was, he was slightly better than me in all aspects, he's a slightly better version of me, and we were epic friends, one area where he outclassed me by a wide margin was his ambition, his calling was a higher one. 

Later as time goes on I spiralled out, I'm a loser by all means and I've made peace with it a decade ago, I'm not where I could be, I'm not where I should be or where I want to be. 

It's been decades since I met him, but one thing that kept me going on despite my ruination was the fact that he was more or less an alternate version of me, more or less me, we were best buddies, be was the better twin and the expectation that he'd have made it, he'd be happy, just a slightly different iteration of me would've made it in life. I always fantazised such. 

I know me, and I know why I failed, but I knew he'd rise, he be top. If he was happy, I was happy in some form, that was enough for me. I made out his potential as mine, this feeling is very intimate to me. 

Now all these years later, I met him a couple of weeks ago. He was too oblivious to notice me sobbing in front of him, it was horrible to see him in an utterly wasted state, it was devastating and it made me so uncomfortable, it was unsettling, everything shattered. Nothing affected me to such a degree, not even my own personal failure.

I always made him out to be the utmost of my potential, and his success is my success, Ive lived all these years jerking off to the fantasy of his well being. And after the realisation that we both turned out to be utter nobodies, my heart has been previously hurt, I'm crying, nothing is fixing me, please help, I can't take it anymore.",
60,"I (23F) am PISSED OFF at my boyfriend (24M) for going to Cedar Point without me. We have been together a little over 2 years. If you want to give your opinion or advice on this post, all of it is welcome. Today, at the last minute, my boyfriend called off work and headed up to meet his "" buddy "" for the day. I put buddy in quotations because they barely talk anymore, and he couldn't care less about him. Anyway, he called off work this morning before leaving on his 4-hour journey to Cedar Point. He is getting a new job and has an interview tomorrow at 1:00 pm. He hates his old job, and the environment and the people he works with are toxic. I understand this but he is most likely going to put his two weeks notice in Monday and he can suck it up there for only two more weeks, plus he already has his Friday's off! Therefore, he only works a four-day week, 8+ hours, and on top of that, he called off last Thursday as well!

Just some background information for y'all, now back to my point. As some may have heard, Top Thrill 2 finally opened up this year and is finally running. My boyfriend PROMISED me we could eventually head up together this year and experience it firsthand. We are big roller coaster enthusiasts and love riding roller coasters together, especially if they are brand new and have just opened, and neither of us has ridden them yet. I practically BEGGED this man and asked nicely if he could wait until we took a trip there together, that way we could experience it and ride it together. Plus, the other new roller coaster, Siren's Curse, isn't even open yet either, and it will not be open until early June. Alas, he is a man, and he is, of course, not going to listen and do what he wants to do because he has ZERO patience, especially when it comes to roller coasters and theme parks. So, what do you think he did today? You guessed it! He drove 4 hours up there (without me), didn't get there until after noon, had a little less than 8 hours to ride, and to top it all off, he rode Top Thrill 2 without me TWICE! Then, he gets mad at me for getting angry at him because I told him I could not come. After all, I am having my COLLEGE graduation party this weekend, and he knows this, so I had to prep everything, clean the house, buy groceries, and bake everything tonight. I could not just waste my day away at Cedar Point, knowing I had things to do at home, because I will be gone all day tomorrow too, working and running some more errands. It's not like I could take a day off and waste it. We NEVER go on big coaster trips without each other. We ALWAYS plan them together. That's what pisses me off the most about this situation, he decides to pull this shit last minute and then gets pissed I can't go with him. I'm not even out for summer break yet because I'm a teacher subbing almost every day! He should have been WORKING today, not calling off at the last minute, to spend ONE day at Cedar Point with a ""friend."" That's another thing too, when we plan trips up to Cedar Point, we stay up there for a long weekend and go to the park practically every day, not just one day.

In summary, I am upset with him for riding Top Thrill 2 without me when he promised me we would ride it together this year, because God forbid he has any patience. So Reddit, what do we think about this situation? Am I crazy?! Do I have the right to be upset? I feel like I'm not being heard. The only people who know about this situation are my boyfriend (obviously) and my mom.

Edit: I have been VERY upset with him all day about this. He knows this, too. Even though he barely looks at his phone at amusement parks, I hardly talked to him and ignored him all day. It makes me wonder if he even feels a sliver of guilt. I REALLY hope it was worth it. Then, he goes on his Instagram story to brag about his day and everything he rode to rub it in my face. On the bright side, I accomplished everything on my to-do list today, and the house is ready for the graduation party! ",

I was just watching a short and EVERY SINGLE TIME I JUST THINK ONE THING

So keeping background short, me (21 F), Sara (22 F), hope(19 F), faith(19F) and Sophia(19 F) (fake names ofc) have been friends in uni for a few months now. We all came out of really bad friendships and have different ways of coping. We consider each other a little break from the bad stuff because when we fight, we don't do it out of malicious intent or for the sake of being toxic.

We are pretty straightforward and confrontational except for faith, who doesn't hang out ever since she fought with Hope over her issue with her unnessacary lying.

Hope's bad habit of lying has been an issue for all of us for a while.

Recently Hope wanted to cut off a guy friend she had and she used our names as an excuse, claiming we were uncomfortable (we weren't) and Sophia got sick of it and confronted her over her lies. The situation eventually kept getting worse with emotions rising, and Sophia lost her cool. I tried to descalelate but gave up and left the argument. I tried walking off the overwhelming emotions but couldn't. I ended up leaving Sophia behind because I knew she would judge me for crying and went to Sara. Sophia ended up finding me anyway mid crash out and very rudely stated, ""Why are you crying? What would your crying do?"" 
At which I got mad and told her to stop being so insensitive. She took this very personally, and even after i explained that she was being  mean and it wasn't an unprompted reaction, She didn't let this go. 

Now Sophia had explained before she didn't like me yelling at her. This happened twice before, and I apologised for both times because she didn't do anything just happened to be next to me at the wrong time. I do my best to control myself usually because I'm self-aware. She knows I feel guilty already.

When I got home, I got a text from Sophia, basically accusing me of disturbing her peace, disregarding her boundaries, and repeating mistakes I made. 

She said that she's clearly a bad friend and i should find better ones, which felt like gaslighting? I'm not sure. 

She accused me of taunting her and embarrassing her in front of others. I tried to remind her that she's projecting someone else's anger out on to me, but she kept going, making me feel like an awful person for being mad of her judgement when I was crying. 

When I would bring up what she did to trigger my reaction, she would throw the line ""this isn't working out"", which is something I've heard enough times to know that it freaks me out. Which she's aware of.

She started talking about removing me from her life and discussing a payment plan to pay me back for every gift I got her, despite me never bringing up anything like that.

 I told her it's  rude to return gifts and I would not accept it either way. But I also called her out on what she did, and she did apologise but went back to blaming me for the way I acted. 

I tried being understanding as much as i could and even apologised for yelling. 

I felt totally gaslit and hurt. 

I feel like a punching bag for when things get heatedx this isnt the first time someone amongst them has used me as this emotional venting dummy and let all their anger out on me for no reason. Now, I'm confused whether I messed up by trying to fix things. Or whether I should've let her go. ",
64,"For months I’ve been living in an apartment with my boyfriend and his older brother  a manipulative, passive-aggressive control freak. And behind the curtain? Their mother. The emotional puppeteer pulling strings remotely.

It started with petty remarks. Dirty dishes. My “attitude.” My schedule. Then came the indirects, cold shoulders, and subtle attempts to make me feel like the problem. Like I was a guest in their family soap opera.

Every time something exploded, my boyfriend got stuck in the middle. And somehow I ended up being “the reason things are tense.”

Well… this week, I snapped.

I wrote one calm, crystal-clear message in our group chat. I said I was done playing mediator in their domestic conflicts. That I would no longer be a part of toxic interactions I didn’t create. That I clean up after myself, always have, and I’m not your emotional maid.

Then I left the group chat.

The silence after that said everything.

Suddenly, the older brother is “thinking of moving out.” Which is just code for:

>

But I’m done. I don’t care.  
For the first time, **I feel completely out of the bullshit.**  
I don’t need them to like me. I just need peace.  
And if that peace means cutting out the manipulative triangle?  
So be it.

If you’re in a household where you’re treated like a convenient scapegoat:  
**You’re not crazy. You’re just surrounded by people who benefit from your silence.**

Speak once.  
Then exit.  
Loud silence is the best answer they’ll ever get.",
65,"I thought my marriage was in the best place it's ever been... and then my husband blindsided me.

I (39F) have been married for 18 years. It hasn’t always been easy—we even separated once early on—but we worked hard to rebuild, and I truly thought we were in the best place we’ve ever been.

We recently went on a trip to his home state for a two-night reunion concert. At the first show, we randomly ran into an old flame of his. I met her briefly (like 3 minutes), she seemed nice enough, and then I flew home the next day (we’d planned this) while he stayed for the second show with a friend.

We have a rule when traveling separately: check in to let the other know you’re safe. He didn’t. I heard from him the next day—he claimed he was out all night on Bourbon Street with a guy named Mike. I let it slide, even though it felt a little off.

Then yesterday, he sits me down and asks, “How would you feel about bringing someone into our lives?” I had no idea what he meant at first. Then he says he’s talking about his ex. He suggests moving her into our rental property so I’d have someone to hang out with, go to shows with… and yes, eventually there’d be a sexual relationship between them. He framed it like it was all for me, as if I’d benefit.

I’ve never expressed interest in this kind of arrangement. I have no issue with people who live that lifestyle—it’s just not for me. I said no, obviously, and was completely thrown.

Then I find out she was with him the night he went silent. He’s also been messaging her since the trip—and deleting the messages. The ones I did see were flirty, and it was clear they’d already been talking about “plans,” with him saying he needed to “talk to me first.”

He swears nothing happened, and that it was all her idea. But my gut is screaming: 1) this has been an emotional thing for a while, and 2) there’s a good chance something physical already happened. It just doesn’t go from zero to “let’s move her into our lives” in three weeks without something more going on.

I’ve worked so hard to rebuild trust after something similar (emotional cheating, sexting) happened early in our marriage. I honestly thought we were solid. And now… I’m angry. I’m hurt. I feel stupid. I feel like the rug’s been pulled out from under me.

I don’t really know what to do next   ETA: I do know what to do next and I'm just trying to work my way to a good headspace to get there. I just needed to get this out. 

Update:  He wants credit for giving me the courtesy of coming and talking to me. So basically ask me first. He claims that once I said no that would have been it, conversation done and we move on with our lives. He says he felt safe enough in our marriage to even ask such a thing and didn't expect such a strong reaction from me and now he's upset that we can't just forget about it and go back to where we were before all of this. The lack of common sense is almost comical. ",
66,"Throwaway because I know my sisters follow my main. This story is pretty dumb it happened about 7 years ago while I was in high school, but for some reason this incident has stayed with me and I need to get it out because its been brought back up and its fucking eating at me. When I was in high school I moved several times so keeping friends was hard but thankfully not far enough that I lost my friends from the town I grew up in, I've had basically the same group of friends since middle school despite the moves, but since school was in session and I was in a different town I didn't see them aside from the occasional weekend hangout, and on top of this is really struggled to make friends during this time so I didn't really have friends to hangout with outside of school. As a way to cope with being extremely lonely I turned to videogames, in particular Doom (2016), I signed up for a program they had they called Slayer’s Club because they were doing community challenges that came with chances to win free merchandise and potentially a free copy of Doom Eternal which wasn't out yet. I started playing Doom’s arcade mode religiously, while still maintaining my grades, I wasn't doing too well because I used to really struggle with tests and studying which my parents weren't really any help with either not understanding the assignment or not being available. After a few months I ended up winning a shirt, I was really proud of myself, it was a stupid thing but I loved it, it was something real I had accomplished when I was having a really hard time adjusting to this new place. After getting the email that I had won the shirt I just kinda kept it to myself until it arrived, about a week later while my parents were driving us back from school my dad checked the mail and was confused when there was a package with my name on it, he looked suspiciously at me and handed me the package and I started opening it explaining that it was a shirt I won from playing Doom and I held it up and showed it to him. Total disinterest bordering on disgust, he started lecturing me about how I needed to “be a man” and “go outside more”, “I need to try harder to make new friends”. Hearing all this really hurt, I really excited about this small stupid thing that I had worked really hard to earn, yeah it was just a video game but I was a lonely isolated kid. I just kinda shrank back into my seat and went quiet but my dad wasn't done. By this point he was back to looking forward and he dropped “if I were you I would be embarrassed.” I shattered, stayed silent until we got home trying really damn hard not to cry until I got to my room. I vividly remember having to try so hard to not cry in front of my family but once I was alone it wouldn't come out, in fact I just kinda sat there in silence, I dropped slayers club and Doom for months after that. This particular rant has stayed with me ever since replaying every time I feel good about pretty much anything. I know I should be talking about this in therapy, sadly I have a lot of stories like this. Ive been looking for a while now but unfortunately thats out of my price range for the time being (I have my own place now and rent is expensive), but I am keeping my eye out for any new options that become available. I did end up getting back into Doom when Eternal released but struggle to go back to the first game without thinking about this incident but I will definately be playing Dark Ages very soon.

70,"I am happy to say, I have escaped my narcissistic, abusive relationship and my mental health is finally looking up.

At first, the breakup after 7 years rocked my whole life. Everything changed overnight. I started to come clean about everything I had concealed for years. The lies I accepted, the manipulation, the verbal and physical abuse. 

I admitted to everyone that he had choked me in the past. Separated me from my family and best friend. Verbally abused me daily. Financial manipulation. Wanted me to abandon my dreams for his business. Cheated since the very beginning. Threw away my food when I gained weight. And much more I'm beginning to realize that was actually, pretty fucking bad the whole time.

At first I questioned if my BPD diagnosis was still accurate. Sadly, I've realized that it is. But, being out of this relationship has really helped me to identify other triggers, work on my own independence and self esteem, and work on decentering romance and waiting around for a partner to live my life with me.

He took away my years. My identity. My sexuality. My whole life. And I'm finally free.

I've reconnected with everyone in my life. My friends, family, I've met new people. I'm doing things I was supposed to do over these seven years. 

Going on vacations with friends. Going out on weekends. Not feeling a constant sense of anxiety, not feeling dread or guilt just for living my life. Meeting people. Dressing how I used to. Losing weight quicker. Going to the gym without guilt. Feeling more happy from day to day. Talking to new guys who already treat me better than he ever did. Spending time alone. Planning for my future. 

I am soon going to go back to therapy and continue my journey towards a better life. I finally feel motivation. I feel like I missed out on so much, but I don't care. There is so much potential left. 

I'm free. I did it. I always knew I had to, and I finally walked away. My only question is, why not sooner? But I'll never have the answer. I am free.

one everyone else sees, and one only you seem to feel…
then this is for you.

There is still fire on the mountain.

Even when it’s quiet.
Even when it feels like you’re built to carry more than others.
Even when the silence inside you gets louder than the world around you.
There is still warmth. Still a light. Still something waiting with open hands.

You’re not broken.
You’re not strange.
You’re not the only one feeling it.

There are others.
We just speak softly.

You don’t have to prove anything.
You don’t have to become anything other than what you already are.

To breathe.
To remember.

There is still fire on the mountain.
It hasn’t gone out.
And it’s waiting for you to come home.

72,"So as i said in the title today i recieved my monthly paycheck but today was special because for the first time i saw a 7 figures number. And honestly i wouldn't bet much on it because you know a boss world isn't always trustfull but my boss really kept his promise.( a month ago it was extremely stressfull because of clients contracts renewal and accordano to my boss i helped him a lot so i was worthy of a raise. I work in a tech company and in 8 months my boss would be the CFO and i his vice)

So as you can imagine when i saw the number i wanted to ""go crazy"" a bit. Nothing stupid of course but why not a bit of shopping, going out in a nice restaurant and this type of things. But here comes the surprise for me because i called immediatly my gf to tell her that my boss kept his word and if she had any idea on something to do to celebrate but as i said she surprised me for real. Her reply? ""I'm very happy for you honey but how about we stay home, eat a pizza and cuddle?"". I really was taken a back but this simple answer just showed me why i'm with her and why in a few months i will propose to her. She is so simple and so sweet that everytime i'm taken of surprise by her responses.

For a bit of background on us: i'm the affair child my mother had and when her husband find out he divorced her (while she was still pregnant) and my bio dad disappeared out of nowhere. I spent 18 years with my mother telling me that i ruined her lire, that i was a disgrace, that if everything went to shit in her life was my fault. On the day of my 18th birthday i wished her a slow and painful death and moved out. Since then i never heard of her or my bio dad. All those memories brought me anger, trust and mental issues on which i didn't worked for 10 years and only since 2 i'm seeing a therapist.My gf have a similar background because her father was emotionally and physically abusive to her until her mother disappeared and she did too. For some reasons she remained in contact with him during the years and she was always fooled by his classic ""i'm changed, i went to a therapist"" and all this bs until she went to live with me and the last time he showed up again, a few weeks ago after almost a year of no contact, he hurted her again (physically) so i did my job and sent him to the hospital.

So as you see we are a ""broken couple"" (as she said) and when we started dating after a few months she told me ""i don't care if you will hurt me or not. I was already abused so one more or one less doesn't change anything"" but i showed her that i really love her and would never hurt her. So maybe this is the reason why she is so ""shy"" and never asked me for anything like you know jewels, new clothes, new cars or all this stuff and most of the time i'm the one to convince her to buy something new and beautiful. But you know a paycheck like mine i thought that would make her ask me something new or like i said to go to a nice restaurant but she didn't. So despite being a ""broke couple"" i like her the way she is and we are trying for each other to be better.

Not an English speaker sorry

Edit: wow, people thank you very much for your kind words.

How did you handle it, especially when there was no way to prove your innocence? Did it change the way you trust people? How did it affect you emotionally or mentally at the time—and maybe even long-term?

i spent 10 years in isolation of my own making to punish myself because i couldn't be sure i didn't do it. i will never not think of that night and for as much as i have tried i cant remember anything after she asked for a pillow... i cant even properly apologize because how do you tell someone you don't remember the trauma you caused. i will always hate myself for that. id never have done that consciously but it doesn't matter and nothing can change what her reality is whether i did it knowingly or not she still was hurt and i will never forgive myself. now for everything else. it started before i was even born my dad met my mom in a bar and he didn't use protection and that led to my sister. he never minced words that she and i were a mistake and that he wished we were never born. she got it worse by far for the verbal insults about her being a mistake but he let us both know he hated us. when i was 4 my own grandmother attempted to kill me by tripping when i was running past her and a exposed metal pipe giving me a permanent scar on my forehead while everyone said it was an accident i knew it wasn't and later in life she told me at the thanksgiving table that she wished i didn't exist and that she'd trade me for her dead brother. then at 5 i was playing outside and a neighbor took me into the woods behind my house and.... he s/a me and when the courts got involved my parents didn't want to make me relive that on the bench so they didn't have the evidence to convict him and he walked. then when i was 7 i fell in love for the first time she was my sisters friend who was 2 years older then me and it was an innocent first crush and i was head over heels for her... then after about 6 months of knowing her, her parents forgot a candle was lit when they went to sleep, and the candle fell over and caused a house fire that took her life. at ten my father got into an accident that disabled him and left him with a hatred of life and a metal cane to walk with and his verbal abuse became physical. he would beat me with that cane for any reason. if i talked back he would swing it. if i didn't get up for school fast enough then i was waking up to him beating me with it. he put me in a cast with it because i stopped him from hitting my sister with it. i knew i could take better then my sister or my mom so whenever he was mad at them and about to hit them id run my mouth to him so he'd hit me instead there wasn't a day in my life from 10 to 16 that i wasn't bruised somewhere because of him. then in the fifth grade i was asked to a dance by a girl... she was popular and i was an overweight loser i should have known it was a joke but i was naive and she publicly humiliated at that dance. then when i was 12 i was sent to therapy where i was hesitant but slowly opened up to him only to find out that he was telling his wife (who by my twisted luck was my math teacher) everything id share in the sessions when she asked me about it at school. but i didn't report him because i didn't want to hurt his career over me. my entire life i have been told I'm a burden and a mistake that nobody would miss me if i was gone and my dad told me to kill myself almost daily and to be honest the only reason i didn't is because my dad would use self harm to get attention and would regularly take all of his meds to make us take him to the hospital if we had other plans that he didn't want us to do so he could force us to cancel, and that made me see suicide as a cowards way out and a permanent solution to a temporary problem. then at 16 i started to fight back against the abuse only for my father to use the police as a tool because he was disabled and a military vet so they never even listened to me because he always pretended to be afraid of me and that i was uncontrollable and the problem. they told me to walk away from him when i got mad but then he would follow me in the car and continue to insult me and tell me i was worthless and that nobody cares. then what happen when i was 17 happened and even though any form of intimacy makes me physically ill because of what happen wen i was 5 i couldn't ignore that she said something had happened and even though i was asleep i was the only person who could punish me so i spent the next 10 years alone in my parents house with constant self hate and my dads abuse to get any form of punishment because she deserved to know my life didn't just continue after whatever happened that night. i both wish i knew what i did so i knew how badly i should hate myself but another part doesn't want to know what happened because i don't want to know how much of a monster i am. ill never forgive myself for what ever happened that night even if i don't remember it. now that I'm 29 though i have no confidence and no self esteem and i cant deal with social situations and i get physically ill when i go for job interviews because i know I'm not good enough for the job so i either self sabotage mentally and don't bother going or i tank the interview with my nervous behavior. and finally i had enough and broke down in tears as i was trying to calmly tell my parents that they need to potty train the new dog because the floors were nasty and my dad dismissed me with a ""a way to solve the issue is for you to move out"" and i realized that my parent's dog had more rights in that house then i did so i left my parents house to my sisters apartment for safety last week and i had a job interview today and i went to get clean clothes from my parents house where all my things are and he threatened to call the cops on me for ""breaking in and trespassing"" even though my mother told me it was ok which destroyed the little confidence i had spent all morning building up so i could face my nerves about going to the interview so i skipped it and wrote this instead because i needed to put this out some where even if to only have the internet tell me I'm a monster.",
76,"He looked at me like I was the only person in the world. Just like he used to, years ago—back when I was younger and freer and still felt like a woman instead of just someone’s support system.

He was my ex’s little brother. Had a crush on me back in the day. I ran into him today. He remembered me. I barely recognised him.

He smiled. Tilted his head a little when he listened—like I was still interesting. Still seen. Still worth that kind of attention.

And it wrecked me.

Because I love my partner, I do. But I’m his carer now. I don’t feel like his wife. I don’t feel like me. I spend so much time keeping him alive that I don’t remember what it feels like to just be wanted. Not needed. Wanted.

It’s not even about this guy. It’s what he reminded me of—what it felt like to be someone’s center, someone’s spark.

I miss that version of myself. I miss being looked at like that.

I’m not even sure why I’m writing this. Just needed to let it out.

77,"About 8/9 years ago in high school, I was a student performing in the school marching band. If you’re a band kid, you probably remember hopping on buses and heading someplace to perform, like at football games, concerts, etc. Our band was large, having to cram on three different buses.

On a particular Friday football game, me and a friend are first to hop on our bus. We normally like to sit in the front because you’re first off and you don’t have much walk after a lot of standing. When looking for seats, my friend finds a worn, blue pokémon card box with the classic pikachu on the cover. They look at me knowing I play pokémon go (the only game I played tied to the title) wondering if I wanted it. I gave a shrug, and went like “sure”.

Curiosity got the better of me and wanted to see what was inside after feeling the weight on it, so you can imagine my face when I figured out there was actually a handful of cards inside. Upon looking further, I realized someone had left a box full of majority holographic, mega evolution ex cards. All of them were something shiny and special.

At the time, I thought I struck gold. I never got to own pokémon cards of my own so I thought that this was my ticket. Rather than going to the district to return them, I boasted about my find that night to all my other band friends and my other school friends outside of band the following week.

They sit in a drawer collecting dust, because for the longest time I never played the trading card game. Over time I started to question why I kept them. I know people say “finders keepers” but it has ate at my conscience for a while now. Years later, pokémon cards are widely talked about as the card-collecting hobby with the struggle of scalpers and all that. Come to think of it, the real owner of these cards must have spent a pretty penny collecting these shiny cards, and it makes me feel like an ass taking them for myself. I don’t even know what card collection they’re from. I still wonder if it’s worth finding out who the real owner is and return them, because me and a sibling talked about it the other day. They condemn the fact that I chose to keep them, and I’ve felt like shit about it.",
78,"Alright, so this is kind of a long one. I am in the process of trans (male to female) and just recently fell in love with an old friend of mine. I confessed as soon as I noticed these feelings and he actually said he felt the same for three months now and didn't know how to tell me. We even had a date and a first kiss, where he said his depression felt like it was cured! That's about the only positive part of this story though. His parents usually never let him go outside, so that date was risky already. His parents noticed, and they absolutely hated me for this. They immediately took action and banned me from talking to their son ever again, because, and I quote, ""he is normal and there isn't anything wrong with him. He isn't gay or whatever."" I even explained to them that I'm trans and thereby it wouldn't even be gay, but obviously that didn't help. If they find gay bad enough, they won't respect trans either. We still met up in school however and kept typing in secrecy. It didn't take them too long to notice that too though, so they called all the teachers in our school and told them to keep us apart while banning my friend from having connections to basically anybody in the internet and they even come by school from time to time to see if we are secretly still talking while we have our breaks. the last thing I got from him was a message that he's depressed again and a kind of KYS picture along with it. His parents said he's fine and that this is all my fault when I called them to try and save him. I came out to the people in school about being trans, so now there's people on the schoolyard annoying me about it and obviously some are mean about the whole thing, too, while also bullying another friend of mine for being friends with me. The friend whose parents I was talking about all the time is distancing himself from me now, too. Not wanting to talk with me out of fear of getting caught. I also noticed how his parents started trying to gaslight him, saying I'm a bad influence and they respect if he's gay, just not with me because I'm a manipulative fake friend. (Their words by the way). Apart from that, I'm having some beef with people in my own family who are homophobic, too. As if that wasn't enough, I'm currently writing my final exams and my father was brought to the hospital for reasons I don't want to elaborate. My supportive sister is moving out and my two dogs died recently. I just recently got out of depression and I'm honestly scared or even terrified to fall into that hole again, though I'm not far from it. The friend I was talking about seems much less lively and more taken aback as of late, too. I'm honestly just lost and don't know what to do right now.
Anyway, that's all I wanted to say. If you read through all this, thanks. I just had to get this off my chest...
(Note, I'm fine right now. I said I'm scared of getting depression again, but it's still alright. I'll pull through.)",
79,"My wife is the most beautiful, amazing and special person one could ever meet. Hands down the funniest and goofiest person I’ve ever met. She had always been super supportive and she is someone I can see people looking up to. She has the purest of souls and it feels magical to be around her. 

I told her at the beginning I would never let my mental illness affect her… Well, it did. It slowly took over my life which caused lack of intimacy/affection, I started isolating myself, being scared of the outside, impulsive spending and slowly being unable to even leave the house. And she was there, right beside me everyday, especially when it spiralled out of control. For a couple of years there was hardly any intimacy/affection and she was lonely. Being lonely in a marriage is painful. 

It was terrible environment. I constantly was disinfecting things, I was always angry and shouted at her, shouted at myself, there was self-harm and suicide ideation. I was never like that nor am I like that now, but there’s so much disgust with how I was unable to cope with it. 

Was having multiple mental health crises everyday and medication was not helping. It had a full control of my life and I couldn’t see/think about anything else but that. She became a full time caregiver and sacrificed a lot on her end and it eventually became too much. She wasn’t living the life she wanted to. She told me repeatedly that things weren’t working between us and I would try to get better, it was just too overwhelming. Still, should’ve moved out sooner to deal with it, but hindsight is 20/20. 

We separated and she eventually told me she wanted a divorce. Only when I ended up hospitalized, was I able to finally start fighting back and get a handle on this thing. But it’s too late, the damage is done. I’ve put her through so much. I don’t have resentment or anger towards her, I understand where she’s coming from. She’s doing better from what I can see and I’m really happy she’s able to live her life the way she wants to. 

She is the love of my life and thinking about how the goals and dreams we had won’t happen with her is really hard. The guilt and regret over what I put her through weighs heavily on me. I have so much shame, guilt and regret over how things unfolded. She deserved to be in a better environment. 

I still have a slither of hope that maybe she’ll want to try again. I miss her, I miss the goofiness, her jokes, the little things she would do, our walks, I miss being held by her/holding her and just being in her presence. 

In an effort to process this, I’m going through the photos and it’s really hard. All the photos, especially the wedding and engagement photos hit hard cause you can really see just how much love she had for me just by the way she looked at me and held me. I’m not handling this well. I’ve been falling apart emotionally and I can’t seem to be able to process any of this. It’s like I’m refusing to move on in a sense. 

I truly wish her well and that she has an amazing life, and if she doesn’t want to try again, to find someone who will support her and cherish her. I still love her. I just want her to be happy",
80,"I know this is cold, maybe even messed up, but I’ve been holding this in for a while.


The job market right now is brutal. I’m experienced, qualified, and still feel like I’m just another piece of paper in a stack of thousands. Every opening has a hundred hoops to jump through and vanishes into thin air before you can blink. It feels like every company wants three lifetimes of experience for $80K and a weekly blood sacrifice.


I remember how things shifted during the pandemic—when companies were suddenly desperate to retain people, offering remote flexibility, better pay, and actually treating workers like human beings for a while. It felt like there was finally some balance, like the grind wasn’t so one-sided anymore.


And yeah, I’d be happy if some big, world-shaking event put the fear of God back into corporate America again. As long as it doesn’t hurt me or anyone I personally care about, I don’t care if it tips the scales. If it’s some hypothetical disaster that causes hiring managers to suddenly chase me instead of ghosting me after five interviews? I’m not above admitting that would feel great.


I know this isn’t noble. I’m not proud of it. But when you're constantly struggling just to be considered, watching CEOs get bonuses while people with real skills can't even get callbacks, it warps your empathy a bit. I’m tired of pretending I wouldn’t root for something that resets the board—even if it comes with a little chaos.


I don’t expect people to agree. I just needed to get it off my chest.

81,"This is a throwaway. 

I (19f) lied to my mom that I hadn’t gotten paid yet (Thursday) when usually I get paid Wednesday and was still “waiting” to get paid when she asked for money for gas.

Now, I would have in general but I have a big bill to pay for in a week and I didn’t get paid a lot. (Around 250 for two weeks depending on how many shifts I get and since it’s a minimum wage job currently for when I’m in college). That bill is coincidentally the same amount as the bill.

Now this isn’t the first time she’s asked me for money. In the past year, she’s asked me to pay a bill or to pay someone else regarding her work which was like 500. But not only my mom but my twin sister has also asked me for money as well. Including sending her money so she could pay for her friend’s birthday dinner while she was in CA. Mind you, In the past few weeks I’ve been helping her pay for gas which is fine.

I always thought this was fine and normal to she send money (tho groceries, phone bill, or gas I will always say yes) until I told my coworkers about it and they said that isn’t normal. It’s normal to help out your family right?! 

Also the only things she pays for is house rent, phone bills, and sometimes groceries and my school which isn’t a lot since it’s community college. I do pay for my own things, like my clothes and what not. 

This makes me feel so much more worse about the situation and the fact I lied because in my mind she has to rely on her friends for money because her daughter won’t send her any?

So I’m sitting here, absolutely high as hell, smack in the middle of my Christian in-laws’ Easter gathering just vibing in my mother-in-law’s living room when I hear my brother-in-law say that at the air show earlier today, they saw (or missed?) a robot dog named “Shelly” or “Shelby.” And without even thinking, I mutter to myself, “Oh, that’s how it starts.”

What I meant was that moment, right there is exactly how the future creeps in. You know, the I, Robot, Fifth Element, Star Trek, futuristic-society kind of future. It’s not some dramatic movie scene. It starts with casual stuff robot dogs at air shows, smart assistants in our homes, EVs quietly taking over the roads.

I even told my 16 year old recently: “You’ll probably be the last generation to drive a gas powered car. Your kids? They’ll only know electric.”

It’s wild watching it all unfold in real time especially while stoned at an Easter dinner surrounded by Jesus loving relatives and robot dogs making their debut.

Fast forward a couple hours later we’re all gathered around the TV, watching a 60 Minutes preview. And what’s it about? Giving an AI agent a moral compass. Like a cop. A robot cop with programmed ethics. And I just sat there, stoned out of my mind, thinking, Yup. There it is. It’s not coming anymore. It’s here.

83,"The title pretty much says it all. I've done this for multiple years now, ever since eternal came out I have been hooked on the modern Doom games, but especially the music. It really gets me excited, I had only ever listened to it when playing the games or on random off chances while in a long car ride or something. But around three years ago I had been listening to it with my earbud in and my girlfriend initiated. I had time to take the earbud out, but for some ungodly reason I left it in.

I then proceeded to have the most intense sex of my life. My girlfriend loved it and so did I, I haven't told her yet but I plan to soon. I'm honestly surprised she hasn't noticed the earbud yet, sometimes I even do full immersion and put both in.

84,"Hello, some of you folks asked for an update when I first posted, including some who seemed to feel lost in a similar situation.

I'd like to thank the insane people on my last post who told me to give up on my son.  The laughs were therapeutic.  (and also please never have kids of your own).

We took him to get evaluated again as it was pretty clear what we were dealing with was more than just ADHD.  It took us a while to find a place we thought would do it right this time, then it took some more time to get a slot, but today we got the official diagnosis.  He has the ADHD, and a severe version of it, but he's also mildly autistic.  On top of this he has high anxiety and signs of depression.

Some of you were suggesting PANDAS and ODD, and he does seem to have some of those symptoms, but like the autism, there are things about him that don't fit those diagnoses.

There are things about him that aren't typical of autism, for instance he loves being social, these inconsistencies and the fact he was younger and had severe ADHD which masked the autism made an autism diagnosis difficult at that time.

So why does he hate me?

As best I understand it so far, this is what happened:

When he was halfway into kindergarten is when it started.  His disabilities caused him to struggle as compared to his peers, which led to feelings of inadequacy.  Being 5, he didn't have the tools to handle that, so he began coming home from school and destroying the house as a way to express his feelings.

We would try to reason with him patiently but he wouldn't hear it, we tried many other ways of helping him, butnthe house was getting destroyed and the only thing that would het him to stop would be sharp, loud commands from my scary male voice.  ""STOP THAT"". So that's what I would do every time he started acting up, because that's what worked.

What I was doing, though I didn't know it, was using his anxiety to scare him into behaving better. As time went on and I continued this, I became this scary figure in his life to be feared, the anxiety built, until it became a complicated hate.

So where are we now?

He doesn't attack me on sight, usually, which is an improvement, but when I come home from work he often wants to be alone in his room now.  When we go out in public things are better, but at home the anxiety he attaches to me is still present, though not as intense.

How did I fix it?

First, I stayed away.  I let things chill out for a few weeks, and when he would attack me, instead of getting angry and punishing him, defending myself by shoving him off me,  I remained calm and had my wife correct him instead.

Then, I decided I needed to talk to him about all this.  I knew  that going to his room meant immediate bleeding on my part, so I would armor up in a winter coat and gloves, enter his room, and calmly fend his attacks off.  It would end with me restraining him on the floor and just taking to him about his behavior, and why it lead to my behavior, amd why I never meant to be scary but I had to be scary to stop the madness.

This had a little bit of a positive effect, but it took a long time, I did this routine for weeks without much progress. He would attack me, I would restrain him, I would talk and ask him to open up, amd he would be silent.

 Then I finally found something that clicked.  I told him I loved him and always would, and that I thought he was a special and talented kid, and that I would always be proud of him.  He cried in my arms and got angry and wanted me to stop, but I pushed through.

So then for a couple weeks I kept letting him know that, and over time his reaction to it became normalized, which is how I knew he really believed and understood it.

Now we have a routine I call daddy therapy time, and when I come in his room and say let's talk, he gets straight like a pencil on his bed and I kinda compress him into the bed, and his head hangs off which he likes for some reason.  He has been opening up gradually and actually talking instead of just me talking.

 Some days are still hard, he still takes everything out on me, but that's ok, better me than anyone else, that's my job.  I still get bit and scratched but less often now, and I think things will continue to be 2 steps forward, one step back.

For you overwhelmed parents out there.....keep trying, there's hope.",
85,"I just got done scrubbing my dad's apartment by hand. Scrubbing his tub that he nor mother ever cleaned. He was moving some things in to his truck when he came in, looked at me, and walked out. While I scrub the tub, scrub the sink, and mop the floors of my parents bathroom, my mother was sleep in the bed.

She had called me earlier that day to ask me to pick her up from work for the 6th time because she *wasn't feeling well*. It's frustrating to explain to people that there is nothing wrong with my mother. Whenever something important is happening, she gets ""sick"". 

When my first cat died last year, she was in the hospital cause ""her chest hurt (the hospital called me 4 hours after burying my cat to come and get her). When my aunt got diagnosed with cancer, she wasn't feeling either. When we were getting evicted years ago, she was sleep on my twin bed in the living room while I cried and packed all 127 of her collection of mugs alone, trying to figure out a place for us to go. 

She and all her stuff are in my home. My closet is mostly her stuff. I didn't want her to move in but my grandma asked me to do it and they will find a way to get her out by September. I came to her last night and calming told her that there are parameters for living in my apartment. This is a conversation I had with every person I moved in with. She immediately got defensive, snapping about ""not being a child"" and ""she had me"" and blah blah blah.

I don't know how to get out of the cycle. I tried years ago but then my sibling had flipped on me, I had to break NC to stay with my dad who my mother was staying with even though they were divorced. I know it is best to cut a toxic parent off but unfortunately she is the only person who will never leave me. Not because she loves me but because she also has no one. I know she will never get better. Never be mature or responsible. It just feels like this is my punishment for being born, to re-mother her.",

I recently said to a friend that I've always wanted to write poetry, but I didn't think I would be any good at it. I'm a good story teller, but poems are another step above that. They asked how I know that I won't do any good if I never try. 
So I did. I remembered a moment on a recent road trip that brought back memories from 20 years before when I'd driven that same road with my dad. 
The poem and story just flowed. I was so immensely proud of it when I was done. 
I've since written a dozen more poems in the past 2-3 weeks and enjoying it more and more. I'm actually going to purchase a guitar, because I've always wanted to learn and I think if I can write poems, why can't I write songs?

87,"i’ve noticed a troubling pattern in my life, and i’m hoping to understand it better. for some reason, i seem to attract both men and women who are already in relationships, yet end up expressing a desire  to cheat on their partner with me.

to be clear, i have never encouraged this kind of behavior, nor have i ever engaged in anything inappropriate. i’m a reserved, introverted person. i rarely initiate contact with others, and i try to meet people with empathy and understanding rather than judgment. that said, i’m beginning to wonder if that very openness is somehow being misread by the wrong kind of people. 

i don’t flirt, and i never show romantic or suggestive interest. and yet, after a while, some individuals reveal that they’re already committed to someone else, often after building a sense of emotional closeness with me. when this happens, i feel deeply uncomfortable and even guilty, as if i somehow gave the wrong impression, despite having done nothing to suggest i’m open to that kind of dynamic. 

whenever it happens, i tell them directly that what they’re doing is wrong, and i distance myself, still, these experiences leave me feeling unsettled. in some cases, i’ve been unfairly accused of being a pick me or trying to pursue someone’s partner, when in reality, i want nothing to do with these situations. 

i’m sharing this not because i believe i’m doing something wrong, but because i want to better understand why this keeps happening and how i might protect myself from these experiences.

I know energy levels lower as you age, but not over the span of a day plus not so much at all someone under 25. I think melatonin (which I think I started taking around that week) caused a permanent change in my brain, is this possible?

Thirst is also ruining my life. I deal with excessive thirst, so I can go long without peeing. It makes car rides a hard time because I’m nervous of something happening. When I drink less my anxiety goes nuts, and I have a phobia of being without water. 

Locking in a “in the middle” has not been working, so I’ve been drinking less water and being an anxious wreck on the road.

Then I remember I’m also a DV survivor. Isn’t that funny? How could I forget I was also a victim. My partner would tear me down just to build me back up to tear me down again. Extremely violent and unpredictable. Of course it was always my fault (I hope you can sense the sarcasm). 

The comments people have been making about Cassie is what’s triggering something inside of me. When people say it’s her fault for staying for that long or she enjoyed it. Those comments bring me back to my old relationship. I stayed because I thought I was in love with someone. I stayed because I was also scared of what would happen. It’s not easy to leave when someone has isolated you from your friends and family and you feel like you have no one but that person. You feel ashamed and alone.

90,"Hi, I’m a 10th-grade student and the eldest daughter in a Muslim household. Lately, I’ve been feeling completely overwhelmed. My parents are extremely strict, emotionally abusive, and very controlling—especially because I’m a girl.

I’ve recently discovered a love for fashion design. I even started building my own small brand from scratch. It’s just starting—no earnings yet—but it genuinely makes me happy, and I’d love to grow it into a side business and be known for my designs one day.

At the same time, I’m also interested in science. I’ve always wanted to help people and save lives, and I plan to take PCMB (Physics, Chemistry, Maths, Biology) in 11th and 12th grade because I want to become a doctor. So it’s not that I’m running away from studies—I really care about both paths.

But my parents don’t understand or support me. They push me constantly. If I try to study with music to focus, or take a break and watch something, they take my phone and yell that it’s haram, that I’m becoming “unholy.” I believe in God, but not in the overly strict way they follow religion—and I’m scared to even admit that to them. They would beat me or shame me if they knew.

They flip between being sweet and abusive, and I feel so mentally drained. I cry so much. I’m trying to focus on school, plan for my future, and build something of my own, but all their pressure is making it impossible.

I don’t want to choose between science and fashion—I care about both. But right now, I just feel stuck and alone.

If anyone’s been through something like this or has advice, please help. I really need support right now.",
91,"I’m 23. Everyone says I’m just starting but it feels like I need answers I do not have. 

I got a chance job in a job field I had zero experience in but was promised to be trained. I’m trained but they haven’t matched my salary to my coworkers or even the receptionist for that matter. 

It wouldn’t be that big of a deal if I didn’t have $20,000 in debt. I don’t speak to my parents, mother is the cause of 80% of that debt. The rest was impulse decisions because I’m stupid. 

My partner and I want to buy a house. We both won’t marry anyone we haven’t lived with for a year minimum. My debt and credit score is the only thing holding us back. With my current income we won’t be able to get a place until the end of next year. 

I’ve been putting in applications for any other job that pays more and nothing so far. 

When I moved into my grandparents it was because I wasn’t making it on my own and needed a place to stay. I have two dogs who now have to live outside. One is old and I feel so much guilt that he will spend the end of his life outside but won’t surrender him because in my area it’s a sure death sentence. 

I’m only just now getting treatment for my bipolar disorder. It feels good to get better but now I’m afraid it’ll interfere with treatment for my chronic autoimmune illnesses that’ve taken me so long to get taken seriously for. I only have my partner, grandparents, and one friend so it’s definitely overdue that I seek treatment. But now I don’t know how to meet new people. 

I keep thinking about what to do and I just don’t know. I DoorDash in my free time because it makes me feel like I’m actually working on it but still feels stuck. 

Thanks for reading, feels a bit better to get off my chest. ",
92,"I always loved insects and reptiles but I was never allowed to have pets of my own. Thr closest I ever got was when my stepmother got her son a gecko and I had to help clean its tank but the son would cry to his mom if I interacted with it while doing the work. 

Allergies have kept me from adopting a dog or a cat and since I traveled during my 20's I never got a reptile. I've always loved animals and I've waited for the right time. 

On Monday, I got one last mothers day gift from my stepdaughter. Her snd mt husband planned for her ""dentist"" appointment and came back with a terrarium that has a Florida Ivory Millipede in it! The breeder gave them instructions on keeping it ideal for her and I love it!

Her name is Rita and I've been crying because I have a pet! This must be how dog moms feels because I keep spamming Facebook with Rita. I love my family so much for knowing what I wanted. ",
93,"I cried so hard. He finally realized that him looking at inappropriate content or focusing on other girls will do nothing but sabotage how he feels about me. He opened up to me last night but had been trying to say it for a while. A huge issue we have had is me being his first partner, AND him learning that he has ASPD (initially thought he was normal and everyone else was weird), so he just doesn't think like others do. He took acid a bit ago and that pushed him to, and I quote ""choose [me] as [his] favorite."" 

""I thought I chose you as my favorite already, but how can I say that if I'm still paying any other options attention. It's just taking away focus I should have for you."" 

Tbh I feel so much lighter and at ease. 

I guess this is my true, off my chest reminder that BPD and ASPD aren't completely incompatible, as long as you're both willing to try and truly do love each other.

Edit: he's 20, I'm 19. I moved in with him in March. We've been together two years. There is a lot of context missing, but truth be told, I'm more manipulative and evil than he is. Whenever he does wrong it's because he didn't consider me or how I feel, not because he wants to harm me. For me, if I'm a dick it's on purpose (usually.) idk just please maybe don't say my relationship is doomed when things are actively going great and we've made insane amounts of progress",
94,"As a coach and a person who promotes mental and physical fitness, I questioned if I should share any of this. Then I realized: of course. If I go through this, then there have to be others. So, if you’ve ever experienced crippling anxiety or a sense of being fully overwhelmed, I get you and I’m not afraid to share my story.

I’ve been working longer hours and saying yes to more and more projects. I’m so grateful and I’m so exhausted. This afternoon, I started to feel dizzy and lightheaded. I thought maybe my blood sugar was low. Nope. It was internal but not physical.

I’m so grateful that I’ve been working with my life coach, who taught me how to reset using a few breathing exercises. Today I used the 4-4-4 method she taught me to bring myself back to the present. That allowed me to drive to the gym. I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to lift—much less perform at the top of my game on rack pulls (but I ended up getting two sets of 545 for 8 solid reps)

I realized during this moment that pretending to be strong isn’t strength. Admitting you’re human and embracing your vulnerability is true strength. Find a way to come back to the present. Breathe. Smell. Hear. Feel. If you’re reading this, you’re still here and it will be okay.

At first I didn’t mind because she drinks and goes to sleep but tonight she was so drunk she spilled water all over the toilet floor and went back to her room like nothing happened. She didn’t even cleaned it. I almost fell over it and that ticked me off! 
Tomorrow I’m gonna ask her to move in with my brother. I like my peace and quiet and clean house. I’m really angry over this, I don’t even like the smell of alcohol ",

TW SA & SUICIDE

3 years ago I was violently attacked, and sexually assaulted. Got the literal shit kicked out of me while I thought I was helping someone that had gotten lost.

This event really changed me. It left me terrified of going anywhere. It shattered my sense of safety as it was in the middle of the day at a school park. It shook me to my core.

The anniversary of the day passed and my emotions have been all over the place.

I felt so dirty, contaminated 
I felt so alone 
I felt claustrophobic in my own body 

I don’t talk about it a lot. No one really asks how I’m doing anymore. No one brings it up, maybe out of the fear of bringing it up if I wasn’t thinking about it. I don’t bring it up because I feel like I’m just a burden and that I should be over it.

I know what happened wasn’t my fault 

I know that I was a victim 

I just feel so much shame. 

I hate that this monster took my peace 
Took a piece of my soul that is completely gone now

My husband didn’t even check in with me and in fact was wanting sex and pushing it. I could have opened up I know it’s on me. 

Sometimes I feel like I shouldn’t have to bring it up for someone to check in.

It’s pathetic. I don’t need everyone’s world to stop and it doesn’t. It keeps going around and the time just keeps on going on. 

My attacker was never found. Tips were called in, people were on the look out. Still nothing.

Someone knows something or the person who did it. I chose to fight back and go to the cops, gave a description for the attacker and watched it on the news. Watched people comment on it, and then it just slowly all disappears. 

I may never get justice. I know that.

I just wish it wasn’t apart of me now.

Thanks for reading if you got this far.",
97,"I (23F) dated a guy (27M) for 3 months. Before we started having sex regularly, I was still a virgin. He was aware but we still did other sexual things besides sex. One time we went home both drunk (I was drunker and puked several times towards the end of the night). We were making out on bed and teasing each other until he attempts to have sex with me in which I told him several times No. Eventually I gave in and did not think too much about it and still dated him two months after. I ended things with him just yesterday upon realizing how awful he is as a person and how I would never grow with him (financially unstable, has a kid, drinks every night with his friends, i always pay for food, is a stoner,  etc). I’ve always thought about the first time we ever had sex and overlooked it because I really liked him and wanted for us to work despite his many baggage.",
98,"I’m (30F) a rational person. I know I should leave my relationship but I love my fiancée . (30M) 

He’s kind, he loves me so much (tells me so much), he’s strong and protective, funny and sweet and a good person. 

But, when it comes to things I need in a relationship, he does not contribute. I have a successful career and am paid almost double his salary, but sometimes this means I need to work later or have a lot of stress. 

But when I try to communicate, when I tell him I need support, or I ask for him to do specific things to help me he doesn’t do them or tells me doesn’t want to because I ask.  When I tell him I can’t or don’t feel upto doing something he tells me how much it impacts him rather than asking if I’m okay. E.G, not going to a fitness class he tells me how much he wanted to go but won’t go without me, but would have gone out for dinner as an alternative as long as he’s doing something fun for himself he’s not so bothered about how I’m doing. 

We have a renovation house and on top of work I’m managing and coordinating all of this and he literally said to me ‘how is doing that hard’ yet doesn’t support on anything. I constantly have to tell him we need to DIY some things to save money and he asks why we can’t pay someone because he has NO IDEA what our finances are or how much anything costs.

Mostly he has a knee jerk reaction to be a selfish a-hole but after half hour comes around, but this is exhausting.

His response to criticism or me calling him out is to call me a weirdo or crazy which I have told him is gas lighting. 

He hates his job, there’s no progression and he has to work nights shifts at fairly short notice but all he does is moan and he  will say he wants to leave but not do anything about it. I’ve offered to support us whilst he retrains in something else. 

Im frustrated with him. I feel unsupported, but I also have a lot of fun with him - but he isn’t a partner.

99,"
The thought keeps creeping in—
Will I ever make it to the end?
Some days, I feel like I might.
But other days,
The weight of doubt slips in silently—
and suddenly,
I’m drowning.

Thoughts of always being alone like this.
Of never having someone beside me.
The silence wraps around me like chains,
and the weight of others
keeps pressing on my chest,
not letting me breathe.

When I look inside myself,
I think—maybe I’m doing fine.
But the world outside?
It weaves its heaviness into my skin,
and I carry it quietly.

I want to be free.
Free like a bird.
Or… at least, I think I do.
But then—
I crave a hand to hold.
Someone to sit me down,
to say nothing,
and just let me pour
my demons out.

Maybe that’s the freedom I seek.
Not flying away—
but being seen,
being held,
being heard.

And sometimes...
I don’t even want to breathe the same air as others.
It all feels too loud.
Too close.
Too much.

I don’t know when this battle will be over.
Maybe I’ll live to tell another tale.
Or maybe—
this battle will consume me whole.",
100,"This is a short story I wrote back in high school in my diary. Just felt I had to get it off my chest.

""I am recalling a memory. It was in Science, or Geography. I remember the spot; middle of the class, a bit back from the front row tables. We were laughing about a story I had told you; about me and my siblings’ friends. We were just laughing. Everyone else was wearing headphones, watching a video, and the teacher was a minute away from telling us off, but for those, 30 minutes tops, we were just enjoying ourselves. 
This memory surfaces as I walk 5 metres behind you. You are walking towards a class, or to the library - I’m not sure. We’re still “friends”; we sit at the same table in that now one class we share, we eat with the same group, but long gone is the convivial familiarity we once shared. Long gone is the laughter in that classroom. A small, nagging thought sits restlessly in the back of my mind; what if you don’t remember the fun, the happiness, the memories we once shared - what if it was just me.""",
101,"So i kept asking my boyfriend when his departure would be. He said the first week of June, before is was the ending of May just before his birthday. 

His ex today (his legal clerk) asked him when he would be leaving, I heard him say 7th of June (I was not in this conversation but eavesdropping). Mind you he never told me until now. 

After they were finished talking, I asked him, well when would he be leaving. He said the first week in June. Then he asked me if I had access to his email so that I can look at his entire schedule. I asked him which day are you leaving the coutry. He finally then told me the 7th of June. Why could he not have told me straight off the 7th of June and stop telling me the first week in June. But had the nerve to tell her straight off the 7th June. Am I crazy or is this a stupid reason to be upset. 

Of course he does not know my upsetness, but I do not understand what was the reason he could not just have given me a straight answer just tell me the f\*\*\*ing 7th of June. Why tell me the first week of June.

102,"My body is seemingly failing me. I used to think it was just food poisoning or small things. I'm not out of shape terribly or unhealthy. But everytime I get sick it's always serve. When I was a teenager I was a fat kid, 220 at 5'2 and I was on a watch list for pre-diabetes. My families poor so we bought what we could and I ate what I was able to eat, but after I got older I cleaned my diet out. I eat mostly food I cook at the house with my weekly treat being hibachi on Monday. But that's it. No sodas, no alcohol, I don't smoke weed as often. But my body is always in bad shape. Everytime I look something up it always points to liver disease or diabetes and I'm scared. I still can't afford to go the doctors on a regular basis. I work long hours on my feet most the week. Insulin costs a lot of money if it's diabetes and idk what liver disease would cost me. Idk I just feel lost and afraid.

103,"So me and my boyfriend have been together for a year. We are both bisexual and we found a couple that is similar to us a lot. We ended up merging couples I guess and becoming a quadruple. But I don't think it's gonna work. Honestly I feel at the end of this I'm gonna be alone by myself while my boyfriend stays with them because I'm no longer enough for him.. I've tried to have fun with him and anytime I do it is always ""well nobody else wants to join"" or ""it's not gonna be fun if nobody is there to watch."" Like... I'm not enough now, I'm an afterthought. A hole for him to put it in when he has no other option. I'm just the baggage that came with him in this. I don't feel anyone really wants me in this situation with them and I just feel like they had to have me in order to have him....

104,"Title is self-explanatory. I have a very nasty combination of both depression and autism; depression making me neglect myself often for the past few years, and autism making it so I have severe sensory issues with my mouth being touched/poked around in. 

Brushing my teeth is very much a mental balancing act as a result. Not only does it take a lot of time and effort to do properly (I am an adult with braces, but even without them it'd still take me likely around 5 minutes to fully brush, rinse, floss... etc etc...), but I also have very bad sensory issues involving my teeth and mouth. Brushing my teeth is hell, it feels like the sounds and sensations of my toothbrush (electric or manual doesn't matter) are reverberating through my whole skull. Dentist visits are also hell. I have genetically oddly shaped teeth,  so they always make sure to poke around and scrap at all the strange grooves and nooks they naturally have with all their sharp and invasive instruments while I lay there focusing hard on not giving in to my desire to get up and walk out. And don't get me started on fillings, which I am all too familiar with due to my awful tra c k record with keeping my teeth clean. 

I hate it. I feel I'm at that point of no return when it comes to saving my teeth. 8 of my teeth have at least 1 filling, 2 of which having at least 1 filling that's been botched, and all of them being towards the back of my mouth. And also chronic gingivitis too because why not? It's so fucking hard to floss around my braces and scrub them clean every morning and whenever I can force myself to do so at night only to have the knowledge that what im doing will not matter in the long run and all I'll need is just more and more fillings because I can't keep up with the endless battle between my depression and my fucking teeth. 

I'm just so tired of it all. I'm tired of being scolded by the dentist for the results of minor slip-ups as if I've no shame with how disgusting my oral hygiene is, tired of having to sit and hold back tears through the feeling of an industrial drill tearing up my teeth and bones just to put in another filling that will inevitably need to be torn right back out and replaced in a few years. I wish it were possible to just remove all of my teeth and get a pair of dentures instead; I'd find the cleaning routine for them much easier, and they'd look better than how my teeth will look once my  races are off. That being, wonky, stained, and full of fillings. ",
105,"I'm married for 15 years now and I just can't get rid of the thought that I made the worst decision of my life. I was not so young when we met (27) but mentally so immature. I was so unaware of who I am what I want and what I need. I'm a pleaser and developed the view that I have to make my partner happy to be loved. When we started dating I dropped my friends, I gave up my hobbies for her and I did it happily. I was convinced that this is good. This is how I deeply express my love and this is the most amazing offering a man can make for his woman. I held my back for her for years while she was not working. I supported her and paid the bills, took her on holidays, sold my flat and moved to the countryside because she was homesick. I didn’t realize but started escaping. I became a stoner. Just to not face reality, just to not see that I'm unhappy by her side. Then she had enough and told me how a shitty drug addict I am. How much I don't love her. And I didn't even give her a child. Did I leave her? No. I gave up smoking though but again just to please her. Still I built a carrier meanwhile, I provided her a pleasant life. I took her to restaurants. I bought her flowers, I massaged her 3 times a week. I expressed that I love her. As I earned more and more money I paid more exotic holidays and of course always paid the bills. While she was sometimes working in part time other times not. Living for her hobby of painting in her plenty of free time. Still crying on my shoulder how bad her life is. How much she hates people and her job. How unsuccessful and unfulfilled her life is. How noone values her and her art not appreciated. Then I started a hobby of amateur acting that became a revelation for me. I discovered myself. I started doing meditation and self therapy based on Jung's shadow work. I started being around people again and I realized how much I missed that. How much I missed having friends, being around people. Sharing yourself and receiving from others. I tried to involve her but I faced with walls. Once in a while when I could it got worse. She got mad, she became anti social, she made me look bad around my new friends. She was calling them names and hate speeching about them. So I rather go alone now. And when she is not around I feel free, I feel relaxed. I'm myself. Until the phone rings... and she asks when do you come home? Or when I wake up and feel the tension in the air. She is unhappy again and I will listen now endlessly her complaints about her life and HER and HER and HER. Because it's just her all the time. Her pain her problem her issues. But while I digging in myself deeper and deeper I discovered that I'm a natural dominant masculine man. Controversial? Yes that is. In my whole life I was submissive to women. And now I realized that my true self that was buried deep inside is someone else. How could this happen? 
I bound my life to a woman who is anti social so does not meet my social needs. Who is vanilla in sex so does not meet my sexual needs. Who does not see me and meet ne where I am. But why? I carry this ring that became the sign of my slavery my shame my guilt. ",
106,"So I'm 17, I've always been super interested in computers, just your average nerdy teenager, I think it might've started around when I was 12, but my parents weren't exactly well off and I'd only ever had a shitty second hand laptop that I've used for school

Shitty, not just in the ""its a bad laptop way"" but in the ""Literally no one other than I am able to operate it"" way. Its shift, z, x, c, v keys were broken, fan didn't work, spacebar's stabilizer's were gone, touchpad worked sometimes and sometimes didn't, touchpad's mouse buttons also were flaps that ocassionally worked. Now I'm also partly to blame, although it was pretty bad when I got it, I did spill coffee on it one morning working. I did instantly drain and clean it, but it blew a circuit that fucked up the the keys and made them stop working.

But, I overcame all challenges, I used an onscreen keyboard and used my touchpad to tap on my zxcv keys when I needed to type, and continued to work with that laptop, I freelanced a bit, worked with a friend, wrote a few steganography programs, helped a friend of mine automate his crypto trading, hell, even TRIED to build an ML model that would parse through all the chat data from a friend group to categorize us into archtypes (This didn't get too far because my laptop would crash everytime I opened up the json file for data management).

So, I was being limited by my laptop, never got to game with my friends because it was ass, and there was no cooling since the fan blew. BUT I made money freelancing and I had put it in my mom's account, about $800 worth which is a LOT of money to me.

About 2 months ago, I graduated high school, a few days ago, my results came out, I got a 97% overall grade, A\* in all 5 of my subjects, English, Math, Physics, Chemistry and Computer. The same day, I begged my mom to finally get me a new laptop, pooling in the money I've made, and some of the money from my mom, for $1250, I bought a lenovo legion 5 slim. (I told my mom I needed a good laptop to study ML on, didn't tell her I wanted to play games too, because she wouldn't like that 🙄)

I was ECSTATIC, this thing ran like heaven, It was everything I'd ever wanted and I was going to treasure it and put it to good use for atleast 4 - 5 years, or so I wished

I even bought an anti spill mug to drink coffee from so I wouldn't spill anything on it, today, I woke up, 2 days after I got my new laptop, still giddy turning it on and having a functioning keyboard, I made myself some creamy dalogna coffee, and I can't explain why, but I tested to see if it was hot my turning the mug over (it was a sealed top with a small hole) with my finger on the hole. My finger missed the hole and my mug pissed a stream of coffee 15 inches away onto my laptop's touchpad, MY HEART SUNK.

I spent 2 hours holding my laptop vertically, shaking it, draining it, wiping the top with sanitizer, and the sides, I think I've drained the coffee? but I'm fairly certain there's some residue drying on the inside, I dunno if its going to be a problem anytime soon, but It will one day. I've genueinly been extremely downtrodden today, I felt like I'd achieved a milestone in life 2 days ago and now its sunk, I feel like everything I've ever worked toward has been taken from me. I just wanted to let these feelings out because I can't tell my parents, if I do, I'm probably going to be beheaded publicly or something 😭, won't hear the end of it for ages

Thank you for reading this text block and indulging in my rant, ciao.",
107,I have suffer a lot many year have pass now im searching my point I really don't see why I want to live in this world I don't even know anything about myself.,
108,Felt extremely depressed and had been drinking all day yesterday. Woke up this morning feeling the same way and I slit my wrist twice like I was still an immature 16 year old girl even though I’m pushing 30. I feel really guilty about it especially since I used to self harm when I was around 12-14 years old. Just wanted to tell someone; that is all. ,
109,"My wife is a nurse at a hospital. She doesn’t work in surgery but she met the surgeon at her place of work. My wife and I have 2 children together. The surgeon she cheated on me with is also married and he has 6 children, I think he had children with more than one woman, I’m making assumptions off his socials I found on my wife’s phone. My understanding is that there isn’t 6 kids in this surgeons house full time.

Honestly I had a feeling something was going on when my wife freaked out when I grabbed her phone. I wasn’t even going to check anything like that. I forgot what I had to do on her phone that day but her reaction to me even grabbing her phone I could never swipe from my memory.  

She’s been cheating on me with this surgeon on and off for a year. She talked about leaving me. Making plans of leaving me so she can be with him. They both seem to actually love each other. It’s more than physical. They went out on dates out of town too. I remember she said she’s going to spend Valentine’s Day with the girls and I saw from hidden photos on the date of the picture she took with that surgeon, she was with him on Valentine’s Day. 

What hurts is that my wife called me a loser when she was texting her friends about the affair. She’s embarrassed because she works in the medical field and I’m just a warehouse worker. I recently got promoted to warehouse manager and I was excited about it and I thought she would be happy for me and she was like “oh nice you’re still doing the warehouse gig.” Sorry, I’m not a doctor, sorry I’m not someone you respect or look up to because of my profession. Sorry I don’t make enough money for you. 

We were high school sweet hearts. She use to love me when I had no job and when I had a job. She loved me when we were young. She changed so much. She has become so resentful of my income and my job title. I’ve known this for a while now but I didn’t think she would cheat on me and throw away our family for this guy. She was talking about how she wouldn’t take full custody from me because I’m a good dad and then joked “also I know your house is a 7 bedroom but we would have way too many kids, it’ll feel like we run a Chuck E. Cheese🤣🤣” .. yeah that’s her exact text word for word.

God I’m fucking hurt 

ETA: suggestions for reporting to HR is not going to happen. They don’t care. They aren’t doing anything illegal and they aren’t breaking any policy. This is seen as a personal issue like a home issue. The hospital isn’t firing anyone for cheating on their spouse. Unless if it’s sexual harassment or it’s not consensual, they don’t care. ",
110,"I come from a family of seven kids and I am the youngest. So far, four of my siblings are married, and I am due to be married this August. When this relationship breakdown began, only three of my siblings were married. My parents, particularly my mum, did not attend my siblings' weddings; my dad was present for two out of the four weddings. I am also making my own wedding dress. At first, I was working on it at my parents' house since my place is too cramped to have a sewing station, and I live with my fiancé. Most of my family is toxic and hypocritical. 
I (25F) got engaged last August, and as agreed with my fiancé (26M), we planned to get married on the one-year anniversary of our engagement. We had several discussions about our wedding plans. I wanted a registry wedding with just two witnesses because most of my family brings drama that would detract from our special day. My fiancé wants his family to be there. Eventually, I agreed to his dream wedding on the condition that it would remain as small as possible because, at the end of the day, I just want to be married. About a month after our engagement, we told our families. My fiancé's family was very happy for us; his parents were genuinely excited. Meanwhile, most of my family either congratulated me, one ignored the news altogether. My parents reacted with stone-faced indifference and questioned me about why I was getting married, and their reaction lacked any warmth or happiness. 
Two months after my engagement announcement, around October, my sister suddenly decided she was getting married too. She rushed into a wedding with her baby daddy, even though she had decided that she wouldn't be reconciling with him and had begun a custody battle after their split the year before. Many people speculated that she was getting married quickly to ensure she was married before me as there was no other reason for them to be married. She had her wedding in February, which changed my parents' attitude towards me. 
My mum then attempted to engage me in a text argument, which I chose not to entertain. She made baseless accusations that my fiancé was financially exploiting me and that he was physically abusive, which he is not. He has never abused me in any way, and he works full-time just like I do. When she claimed he was disrespectful for not asking for their permission to marry me, I explained that he doesn't need their permission. I had made it clear to both my parents and my partner long ago that I disagree with the tradition of seeking permission and would never consider marrying someone who asked for it. I firmly told her not to expect that or to pursue that with me. After I shut down her digs at my fiancé, she insinuated that she believed I couldn't make my own decisions, treating me like a child and stupid. I stood my ground and expressed how much I disliked her perception of both me and my fiancé. 
After my mum's initial messages, I decided to speak with my dad to give her some time to cool down. I stayed away for a week. For a while, there was silence. When I tried to arrange a weekend visit, I was told they had plans and wouldn't be home. However, I called this out as I knew they didn't have any plans, thanks to double-checking with my dad. After asserting my concerns, my mum went completely silent. Eventually, I decided to visit and take all my fabric for the wedding dress, as I needed to work on it. I had arranged this with my dad and told my mom about my visit. She attempted to claim they had plans and wouldn't be home, but I confronted her with proof from my conversation with Dad confirming that they were free to see me. When I arrived, she was obviously unhappy, but I went ahead and just removed my dress fabric. 
Not long after this, just before my sister's wedding, my mum sent a family message expressing her disappointment and declared she was disowning us, then blocked us. I never expected my mum to attend my wedding, and I had a slight hope my dad would come, but he confirmed that he wouldn't attend my wedding either because it wouldn’t be fair to my mum, and he couldn’t come alone. I've accepted this reality and come to terms with my relationship with my parents. I will live my life with my chosen partner and create my own family.

111,"As the title says. How I feel.. I'm turning 30 in 4 days. While I can say I'm actually excited for 30's. I'm also really fearful about where I am at. I don't have wife, GF or kids, -- but also don't really care. I am currently searching for a new line of work, in the most uncomfortable time. Its hard for me to go out and feel joy when knowing how the world is right now. I currently have a therapist and speak to them once a week. But also don't really feel like me complaining is helping my current Climent and frankly, therapists are struggling as well. I'm here now because I just want to know if anyone else feels this way and maybe chat, I feel pretty lost at the moment and (while I could turn to AI) itd be nice to have some conversation. Appreciate yall and much love.",
112,"I need some advice and don’t know whether I’m just being petty 

I have a cousin, she’s someone I saw like a sister especially because I’m an only child and anyway over the years a few times she suggested meeting on trips but whenever I ask her to follow up on details like where when etc she ignores me and instead deflects to something else weeks later as though that conversation never happened 

This has happened multiple times over the years, not just once and I’m at a point of frustration and I don’t get why she bothers with empty words that raise my hopes. What she does is usually ignore me and then mass send me photos of her kids weeks later and expect me to validate or something I don’t even get it 

Well last weekend I was abroad and I hadn’t bothered to tell her bcos I decided to stop keeping in touch, I just posted the photos 7 days ago on my social media and that very day she text me asking how I am bcos I think she saw the photos. I replied that I was abroad etc and asked how she is…. No reply. 7 days later no reply still. And instead randomly she send me this slide via instagram. Is it a dig at me ? I just don’t get it. I want to build real connection and have meaningful conversation or at least a conversation but she ignores and sends this. She always does this, usually when I text her she ignores and then weeks later will send something unrelated as if the previous convo never happened   

I’m trying to figure out what’s her purpose sending these and is it a dig ? Each slide is with different quotes, ive put the quotes in the slide below

1. “It’s not your job to accept me. It’s mine” 
2. “You don’t have to get it. I didn’t come here to be decoded. I came here to be free”
3. I’m not here to be understood. I’m here to be authentic 
4. Validation doesn’t live outside me. I am the source now
5. I don’t chase belonging. I belong to myself 
6. My energy speaks before I do 
7. I don’t perform anymore. I show up and let alignment do the rest 
8. I’m not here to fit your story. I write my own now 
9. I’m not for everyone and that’s the beauty of belonging to myself 
10. I stopped editing myself when I realised truth was the entire point 

^ these are the quotes on the slides she sent. And she didn’t just forward them she also included a message saying “man love this so much. Relates so much to me” which is unusual bcos she usually just forwards random stuff without including a message. 

It feels really sad for me bcos I actually have no family im close to - no one I can converse with or call up. And I wanted her to be like a sister but I just don’t feel like I’m anyone important to her so I step back and keep a distance from everyone 

What is she doing and is those slides a dig ? Is it me being crazy? 

I’m just disappointed with my relationship with all my family and how I’m sort of invisible to everyone ",
113,"The point of this post is - I really want to know other perspectives. 

My parents separated when I was around 19.
 I lived with my mom although I was closer to my dad- both of them (very educated) were physically abusive towards each other and me.

I shifted to a metro city where I got a good job (internship turned to a job) and working in it for almost an year. During this time- my boss had tried to harass me a few times, I continued to ignore it and treated him like a mentor (i know my mistake). My mom came to visit once (she was unaware of the SAs)- and met my boss, they started talking- flirting and eventually meeting behind my back and lying to me about them being in touch- as I’d put my foot down that please stay out if my professional life.

I wrote about all the SAs in my dairy when id gone to visit her- which my mom read one day- beat me up for ruining her life- threw me out of the house- and told my entire family i was having relations with an old man. She made me quit my job and move back to her house.

After a few months I went back with a new job, and got to know she’s still in a relationship with the old boss. She still continued to gaslight me and blamed me for everything in front of my family when i tried to bring it up.

Due to my grandparents pressure- we had to make up and let it go after almost an year of the incident. Because id refused to speak to her anymore because of her toxic behaviour towards me. We were on okayish terms the last one year.

I am now in a healthy and loving relationship- and my partner likes to have a healthy and lovjng relationship with my parents also. He insists we go meet my mom.

I do go meet her but just for a day mostly- I still cant be around her for too long- even if she changes her tone in the slightest it triggers me and it brings back all the times shes hit me/ treated me like shit/ gaslit me.

I dont know what to do because he wants to have a good relationship with my parents, I am ok with them as long as I dont have to spend too much time with them. I have healed a lot and dont want to go back to the same mental phase I had been in all through my life because of her behaviour.

I understand being a single mother is very hard and I may not have been a good companion/ support due to a low EQ and severe anxiety. Shes getting old now and lives all alone. 

I want to understand different perspectives on how I should continue. ",
114,"Hey everyone, hope you are doing at least fine because I am not. As the title says, I am a pathetic failure of a man who has no future in any aspects of my life so I unsurprisingly do not want to exist anymore. Here is a long-winded explantion about why I am an unlovable loser. Enjoy.

For starters, I am a 18-year-old Chinese male living in Ontario, Canada who was cursed with the most unattractive physical attributes a man could have. I have bad hair genetics, I stand very short at 5'8, and I have a very miniscule penis. My penis is barely 2 inches long flaccid and its flaccid girth is about 2 inches. When erect, my penis is barely 4 inches long and its girth is barely 4 inches.

Admittedly, I watch porn, specifically BBC porn & cuckold porn which I am aware is detrimental to my mental health. However, please do not give me any hope about my phyiscal attributes. It's not like my pelvis has fat that covers my penis, it is just that the universe cruelly endowed me with a statistically tiny penis.

Do not try to sugarcoat anything, I know most women prefer non-Asian men, tall men, and average-sized to large cocks, three preferences I simply cannot fulfill because life is inherently cruel and not all men are created equal. Please do not insult my intelligence saying that I have body dysmorphia or something like that, I find statements like those to be very dismissive of my emotions and beliefs which are 100% accurate.

Because of my physical attributes, I do not believe in true love, romance, or any of that sappy crap. I quite frankly loathe everyone on the planet but the individual I hate the most is myself. I strongly believe that I wll never be able to form a genuine loving secure relationship, romantic or platonic, because I do not love myself one bit and I will never make myself vulnerable because I am a goddamn insecure coward and loser. There is not a single soul on this planet that I feel comfortable with and I already came to terms with the fact that there never will be because the world is cruel and uncaring.

I have very few friends and no friends that are women. The very few friends I have were due to an extroverted confident guy with a girlfriend who quite frankly sometimes make me wish I never met him. This is not because he is a bad person or anything, I just do not feel compatible with him and I know that makes me sound so ungrateful since he is the only reason why I have friends right now and I absolutely loathe that fact.

I have no job experience whatsoever. Granted, the job market in Canada is quite atrocious currently but that does not change the fact that I am 18 years old living with my parents jobless. Although, I am currently in the process of applying to McDonald's to join the capitalist rat race for the summer. Also, I am in university right now and will very soon complete my first year expecting mostly all A's. However, I did not make any friends or join any clubs or anything of that sort so my first year was quite uneventful which I know is partially my fault.

Another aspect of my life that I despise is my financial situation. My family is very poor, to such an extent that we have to rent bedrooms to live in and share a house with seven other people.

It was never verbalized by my parents but I would not be surprised if both of my parents thought of me as a disappointment and an utter waste of life. My father also wants me to get my driving license soon but I am scared of driving. My mother and father wishes that I can learn to cook but I just can't because I am too shy to try to cook when there are other tenants in the house.

Quite frankly, the only reason why I still am breathing and walking on this god-forsaken planet is because of my family who I live with. If I lived alone or my family died somehow, I most likely would have already quietly committed suicide leaving a note saying it is no one's fault but my own pathetic self. Death scares me but my hatred for my being born a pitiful excuse of a man is stronger than my fear of what lies beyond death.

I am a lost cause but if you still want to give any advice after reading all of the above text, then feel free to do so.",
115,"There was a time in my life when I really believed i was gonna rise above all that. Like I thought if I stayed soft and kind and open i’d somehow be different, that women would see me for who i am and that they wouldn’t project all that fear and competition onto me. Like sisterhood would win, I really wanted to believe in that because it gave me something to hold onto

but then i got older and started noticing things I didn’t wanna see, and if i’m being honest (and i usually am, even when it sucks), it’s just not like that… the truth is, beautiful women aren’t loved by other women, not really, sometimes we’re admired or tolerated, but we’re not embraced. And I hate that i’m saying this, it feels like i’m betraying something i care about, because I still believe we’re insanely cooler than men and I love our softness and I do have amazing friends who I lay in bed with for hours just talking about life and cuddling.

but that’s not what i’m talking about here, i’m talking about everything outside of that. The daily shit my god the looks, the fake smiles, the cold shoulders, the little comments that stick with you for days, the way women scan you the second you walk into a room, like they’re trying to calculate how much space you’re gonna take up, the way being pretty or confident or even just existing a certain way makes you a problem, not just to men, but to women too!

I feel it gets worse when you’re not ashamed of yourself like yeah i’ve been through shit, i’ve been abused, i’ve been hurt and i’m still here, and yeah, i like being desired, feeling wanted.  People lose their minds about that, especially women, they act like you’re not allowed to say that out loud, like you can’t be both hurt and hungry for love.

but I am and i don’t think that makes me less. I’m just honest and i think a lot of women feel that way deep down but they’ve been taught to hate that part of themselves, and when they see it in someone else, it makes them uncomfortable, like it threatens something.

I remember when Lana Del Rey said all that stuff about softness and sexuality and people dragged her, but she was right, like why is that the thing that gets you crucified? why do we act like being submissive or feminine or open about that somehow erases your pain or your depth?

Ironically, that’s why I end up feeling safer with men sometimes, not because i trust them, i really don’t, but because at least they’re not pretending to be my sisters while secretly hoping I disappear

and it breaks my heart because it didn’t have to be this way, we could’ve been each other’s shelter, we should’ve been.",
116,"It was an unplanned pregnancy and it was never, ever something I wanted for myself. My now ex bf and I decided it was for the best to give the baby up for adoption for a myriad of reasons, many of which are still valid to this day. 

We have a cordial relationship with the adoptive parents. They send pictures and updates every once in a while via email. 

But today it hits harder. Every day I feel a void in my heart that I never imagined possible. I feel actual cramp-like pangs in my stomach whenever I think about the baby too much, or  when I imagine what life would’ve been like if we had kept her. The baby is wonderfully taken care of and thriving beautifully but my heart just aches and breaks for her every single day of my life. 

I had considered sending her a little present but I didn’t want to overstep any boundaries. I just don’t feel like I can have that privilege anymore. 

I nearly called off of work just to drink the day away and forget about these guilty, bittersweet complex mixed bag of emotions I feel every day, but especially on Mother’s Day and today. I have virtually no one else in my life to talk to about this situation so here we are. ",
117,"Went to husband's sister's house for dinner, once. That was disturbing and I fled. (Felt like they were gonna have an orgy)

All the kids and everyone just started showing up at our house. Walk out of my shower and there's an audience. WTF!

""Honey, your family is weird and I'm not gonna put up with it!""

About 3 mos into our marriage DH asked if problematic nephew could live with us. ""Absolutely not! I can't fix 16 years of piss-poor parenting."" MIL tried to argue me into it. 

My stance? ""Y'all fucked him up. You fix him. Better yet, stop fucking up your kids!""

My daughter is highly educated and successful. After 15 years of holidays with his fam, I spent time with my kids, last Christmas. Husband's family (except his mother and a niece) hates me. Eh, whatever.

Husband said, ""I'm surprised the little f***** lasted this long.""

I don't wanna go to the funeral. I don't wanna call SIL. We're flat and not surprised he came to a violent end.

I feel a smidge of guilt and a ""what if"". Kid was a drop-out and serious legal problems at 16. I barely knew the kid when people said I should take him. It would have been *all* me. 

WTF is wrong with his mother?

118,"I’m 30. Seven months ago, I was laid off from a job I gave everything to.

I moved to a foreign country alone after graduation and spent five years building a career in telecom and software development. I worked with Mobile Network Operators, governments, and global tech partners. I built GTM strategies, ran multi-million-dollar bids, led high-level commercial projects, and even chaired executive deal boards. I was proud of how far I’d come — I was entirely self-made, and I never stopped pushing.

But behind that strong corporate image, I’ve always been an artist. I taught myself photography as a teen. I built a freelance side career shooting real people, emotions, stories. I dreamed of creating visuals that move people — of studying filmmaking, of telling truth through images.

Then came the layoff.
I thought I’d find something new. But months passed, and nothing. My visa expired. I’m still in the country, overstaying, unable to work legally. I took small photo gigs to survive — until my camera broke. Now I’m stuck. No job. No income. No visa. Not even a working tool to make art.

But I’m still trying.
I’ve been accepted into a short filmmaking program and I’m applying to study producing in Los Angeles. I want to start from zero — not as a businesswoman, but as a creator. I want to make films, build stories, and live a life that’s finally honest.

I don’t have money for tuition, housing, or gear. But I’m fundraising, and I’m doing everything I can to make this new life possible.

If you’ve ever rebuilt yourself — from the ashes of a “successful life” that wasn’t really yours — you’ll know how this feels.
If you want to help, I’ve added links in the comments.
Even just reading this means the world.

119,"Hi, i recently started making music, Is there anyone here who would like to listen to my music and advice if i should pack it up or not. 
Note:Genre is Drill Hip Hop",
120,"I’m aware this is probably the most generic post one could make, but I’d like to get it off my chest. 

I came to a realisation recently. I was frustrated that I couldn’t get over lingering feelings for someone from a very long time ago I fell in love with, and constantly lamented how I just couldn’t find myself connecting to the people who did want me. Eventually I realized, the whole time I was just trying to find the person I was in actually in love with. People who look like them, or seemed like they might be similar, etc. 

In a hilarious sense of irony, I’ve realized I don’t want anyone else except them, the person who doesn’t want me. At first I thought it was a crush or some mental fixation. Or maybe schizophrenia because part of me genuinely believed the guy might reciprocate. But that should’ve faded after 12 years lol. I think. 

So, yeah. I have a constant sense of abject loneliness and longing but refuse to let them be solved by anyone other than the person who doesn’t not want to solve them by any means lol. 
I supposed I’ve tied my sense of self-esteem to them so tightly that I literally cannot allow it to be affected by anyone else. Like I’m in a devoted relationship…with someone in my head lol. 


I guess the tl;dr is that I’m stuck a perpetuating cycle of: 
loneliness/insecurity - thinking of ‘them’ - searching for real connections to dull the pain - don’t want to connect with anyone else - loneliness/insecurity…

Lastly, I’m aware the real question is ‘why are you acting like a lovestruck schoolgirl and not a 30 year old man?’. That’s a whole other confession lol ",
121,"Hi guys, I'm 20F in college as an international student in France. I have wanted to talk about this for so long but I was afraid my friends were going to think that I'm criticizing them.
Anyways, ever since I've started my junior year, I have seen people cheat on their exams, whether it's in class or in lecture halls. They cheat with friends by copying off each other and sitting in big groups so they can exchange exam papers and each work on an exercise. They sometimes even wear them airpods and take pictures of their exam paper to people outside so they can give them the answers. Some even sit with their phone on their lap to take pictures of the exam and use Chatgpt to resolve everything for them or write them the answers.
I don't want to risk my education by being given a sanction or a disciplinary action for cheating, plus I don't know how to do it. But I see literally everyone cheating during exams and the teachers see nothing ! Or they seem to ignore it.
Anyways I also feel really depressed because  I struggle while they just have to swiftly use their phone during an exam.
Has anyone ever been in this situation?
Thanks <3",
122,"I started excersizing and dieting in late December, and now I'm down to 45 pounds. But I look EXACTLY THE SAME. 

My weights gone down, my waist is thinner, my muscles are pronounced, but I still have a chubby chin. I still have cottage cheese thighs. I still have a big round belly, with stretch marks. And turkey wings. God I hate this crap.

It feels like all I did was surpass a number and that's it really. People kept telling me 'ugh 1600 calories is too low for a diet' well now I'm gonna shoot down to 1200. I don't feel hungry at all during the day and feel pretty full when I eat. And surprise surprise, still looking like shit.

Is it loose skin? If I find out that losing all this fat turns out it makes loose skin that won't go away im seriously killing myself because all this work was for literally nothing. It just will tell me if youre fat youll always be this freak of nature that will never get better.

To put into perspective how much I wanted this I made a whole Google doc of research for taking care of a cat.

In depth: when I was 4 we got my first dog and when I was 8 we got my second. However recently we have had to put them down; one for being old and the other for prostate cancer. Now it's been a few months and I have been asking for a cat for a while but mama said ""after I pay off the vet bill"" then when my dad paid it turned to ""it's too early"" but today after therapy I again begged and then the following happened:

Mama:can you keep a secret 

Me: yes

124,"Saw a weird experience today and decided to share. This has been bothering me all day. I sent the events to my best friend and just decided to copy and paste because it's too exhausting to type up again. Was the first on scene of an accident. 

""Hey girl 
I can't send audio because my mic is broken but long story short, I showed up right after an accident in the street. What I saw fucked me up. 
What happened was: 
I was driving, and I saw a man laying in the road. Another man was there blocking traffic. As I walked up to them, a lady was there helping him. I saw his face and he was bleeding a lot from his head. He was also bleeding heavily from his eyes, nose, ears, and, his mouth. He was laying on his back, completely unconscious gasping for breath. He then started choking on his blood, so the lady turned him on his side and held him there until cops and the fire fighters arrived. I called 911 along with the others. Once help got there I left."" 

He also had a huge pool of blood coming from the back of his head. He was in bad shape. People online were wondering if he was hit by a car at all. I personally was not there in time to see the actual incident, but the first guy on scene (who was blocking traffic and had 1st called 911) said no. Hoping he's alright.",
125,"I (latest 20s) had a memorial tattoo of my late cat and her baby (still alive) on my leg. I had it done months ago, after about a year and a bit thinking of a good design to encapsulate both of them. I was/am happy with the result, and while i still grieve my girl, every time I worry she doesn't know I love her still, I look down and see my tattoo and think 'she must know, she's with me forever"".

Cue my mother. Hates tattoos. Hated my other cat tattoo, hates his one too: 'a dead pet' 'get over it's 'she was just a cat'. She also complains about my cat trees and the fact I leave their toys out when I'm at work. I love my parents I really do, but the judgement ('only low class people have tattoos' me: 'you know Prince Harry has one right?') kills me sometimes. they didn't even notice! For over half a year! It clearly couldn't have bothered you! Half my office have tattoos and no one cares. She thinks I'm going to cover myself in ink now, that my tattoos have no meaning and that I was childish for getting them, that if I were to get anything I should have got something small, 'like a dolphin'. 

I know they are proud of my achievements but I'll never be the right kind of adult 'in my home life' for them, but I feel awful when I say that because they have helped me out so much in my life. I want to stand up for myself but feel bad when I do, and I don't want to cut them out (in before anyone comments) but it's just so frustrating. ",
126,"I (17F) majorly fucked up recently. It wasn’t on purpose. My friend (17M) and I were going to go to the cinema he saw his weed dealer posted about being in town he then wanted to get high instead. I said sure. We also got beers. I didn’t smoke his weed I was just drinking. He decided it would be funny to throw a rock at a car window. He wasn’t expecting it to damage it but obviously it smashed. 

We were both freaking out. We picked up our stuff. I put his weed in my pocket. We went to a new place. The police found us in our new place. We got arrested for Criminal Damage and I’m getting done for the weed to because it was in my pocket.

I know I fucked up. I am willing to pay a fine. I haven’t been asked to but my friend had to pay a fine and he’s on a youth conditional warning.

I’m still waiting my punishment. But even though nothings confirmed yet my life has already been impacted. I told my two best friends about it and they’ve distanced themselves I feel. They’re supporting me. They don’t think I deserve to be punished since I didn’t throw the rock or smoke the weed and they think I’m gonna not have a punishment. And they don’t think I deserve it. But they’ve been responding to me less and less and I’ve only hung out with one of them once and one of them twice since. 

Idk if I deserve it or not. I didn’t mean for it to happen but I shouldn’t have ran away. I could’ve at least waited for the owner to come and said I’m sorry and offer to pay. That was a shitty thing of me to do.

I selfishly don’t think I deserve my life to be ruined. I’m fine with being punished. I deserve repercussions but I feel like already it’s getting blown out of proportion. They contacted the college I was supposed to be going to in September. They’ve contacted me saying I’m not allowed back until 2026. It doesn’t feel fair for what I did. The police didn’t even tell me they were going to tell the college. I found out through the college calling me. 

So yeah now I’ve lost my whole yearly plan,my friends, no idea what they will decide as my official punishment. I thought at first I’d be let off with no further action or will have a youth warning but after I found out they contacted the college I’ve come to the conclusion It’ll be worse than that. I didn’t think I was doing anything that would be worth getting arrested for. I guess I’ve learned the hard way that the law is actually serious. I guess I see now I should’ve gone home as soon as he asked if we could drink and smoke. But I didn’t think that was a big deal. 

I know criminal damage is wrong that’s why I ran but I didn’t think I’d be arrested. I just ran because I was scared not because I thought anything like this would happen.

I felt guilty and I still do. But am I really a bad person? People seem to be acting like I’m one but I don’t want to be a bad person. I think that’s the worst part. I don’t want people to think I’m a bad person or to judge me. And I want to go to college and just move past this like nothing happened. 

I feel like my life is over. I don’t know if I’m being dramatic or not but that’s what it feels like. In a week I find out what is happening luckily. Even if it’s bad I feel like I couldn’t possibly feel any worse or any more guilty than I do now. And I mean I’ve been kicked out of college because of it and humiliated. What more could be worse. I think the humiliation is enough to deter me from ever doing anything like this again. 

Even my parents who are strict think this is too far. That I don’t deserve my life to be ruined over this. But it feels like it has and will just get worse. 

The police promised me if I was just honest things would be ok but it’s not. I was honest. And now I’m not allowed to go to college. Probably gonna get some awful consequences. And my friends probably hate me. (I know that’s not the police’s fault but still).

127,"I made bad financial decisions in my previous relationship. This is my third year paying the bank's monthly installments because when he left, I went bankrupt and lost everything. In September, I'll finish paying off the loan I took out to catch up on my expenses. The idea of ​​closing that chapter makes me happy. Has anyone else been through something like this?",
128,"
If you're struggling to explain it and feel like you're losing your mind... you're not alone.

I've been paralyzed most of my life and need help with basic care—things like getting out of bed, brushing my teeth, or even using the bathroom. That means I rely on someone else for things most people take for granted. In my case, it’s my husband.

But I live in a house where love has conditions, and kindness has strings attached. Where being vulnerable means being at the mercy of someone else's moods. Where the outside world sees a man who's “just trying his best,” while behind closed doors, I’m treated like a burden he nobly puts up with.

People see his public persona—the funny, helpful, charming guy—and think I’m lucky. But they don’t hear the way he talks to me when no one’s around. They don’t see the manipulations, the guilt trips, the gaslighting. They don’t see me holding my pee at night because I’m afraid to wake him and deal with the tantrum.

I guess I’m just here to say… if you feel crazy trying to explain it, you’re not alone. It’s real. And you’re not weak. You’re just surviving... alongside me.

I’m far from healed, but I’m taking the first tiny steps. Even if that tiny step is just joining this group and finding the courage to post this. Sometimes, the tiny step is just getting out of bed and brushing my teeth.

Don’t get me wrong, some days are “good.” Sometimes, the love bombing tricks your brain into thinking things are okay. But it’s not. And if you’re questioning your reality right now, maybe we can find strength in each other. Because I see you—and I hope you’ll see me too.",

Recently she caught me because I was wearing particularly tight pants after filling up her car with gas and I had to slip them all the way off to get *it* out and I ended up leaving a sweaty print in the seat. She grilled me about it and I confessed partially thinking she would see how much I was into her but she was grossed out more than anything. 

I tried explaining I always clean up and nothing has ever touched any part of her car (except my bare ass on the seat) but she didn’t care. She hasn’t talked to me in 2 days and I’m too embarrassed to tell family or friends. ",
130,"at the tail end of 2019 we got a phone call that my grandfather had fallen down, and that was the start of everything going to hell. less than 3 months later i found out a week after the fact that he had died in a nursing home from an infection, pretty much guaranteed due to neglect.

my grandmother? she's still alive. she's been in a nursing home for the past 4\~ years and every month it bleeds anywhere from $15-20k from us. the money that was left after my grandfather's passing, the money from selling their house (not a small sum, either!), all of it is being siphoned away. every month we pay more than a year's worth of my rent. this money could have sustained the remaining members of my family for years to come, except now it's almost gone.

i can't even begin to put into words how much i want this woman dead,. she tormented my mother growing up to the point that my mother's ptsd from doing so has given me my own myriad crop of issues that i've been struggling with since childhood. she's destroyed 2 generations, and even now she's still somehow managing to hurt what's left my my family by the sheer act of living. dementia has completely destroyed her brain and maybe that's punishment enough, but it sure doesn't feel like enough. she lived with my mother for about a year after my grandfather's passing as the dementia gnawed away at her and it drove my mother into a complete mental breakdown and made her ptsd from growing up even worse; i'm still trying to pick up the pieces from that while trying to barely keep myself above water.

covid has gone through the nursing home she's at multiple times, and somehow every fucking time this cockroach survives. every illness, she pulls through. she won't fucking die and it almost feels like somehow she knows how much her continuing to live hurts us. i hate her and i hate this disgusting, broken fucking system that bleeds us into the gutter to sustain someone who has abused us, destroyed our mental health, and ruined our fucking lives, while there is nothing we can do about it. the nursing home can go after us legally if we stop paying, and the state won't step in until every last penny that could have kept us going for years - *decades* \- is gone, poured down the fucking drain to keep this cockroach alive.

i hate it. i hate it so fucking much and at this point i don't care if it's awful to say ""i wish my grandmother was fucking dead"" because she's caused nothing but harm the entire time she's been alive. everyone fucking told us ""she won't last more than 6 months"" and here we are five fucking years later starting to panic because the money that could have kept us going is starting to run out because she won't. fucking. die. i'm so fucking tired and i'm so fucking angry. how can someone cause so much harm solely by living? why are we being forced to keep alive someone who has hurt us so much for so many years? i hate it. i hate it so fucking much. i wish this awful, miserable husk, this facsimile of a human, would just fucking leave us in peace for once in our goddamn fucking lives, but apparently that's too much to fucking ask from the world.",
131,I've lost count how many times I've tried to quit but I always end up going back to it. I always tell myself like go jerk off before you send or check your bank account but the urge is way too strong. I've developed a very parasocial crush on one of the girls I send to. I'm fucked.,
132,"I'm asian and its a normal thing to give your parents allowance, so I've been giving my parents an allowance since I started working a decade ago, as have my siblings, each contributing different amounts. My parents are wonderful and, while not traditionally strict, they do expect some financial support, even if it's a modest amount. The challenge I'm facing is that I'm currently the most financially stable among my siblings, and my contribution makes up about 40% of the total allowance they receive. 

I'm feeling burnt out and would like to take a career break. My savings are sufficient for this, but only if I temporarily pause my financial contributions to my parents. I'm quite surprised and disappointed when my parents reacted negatively and are making it difficult for me to even consider a career break. 

I honestly expected them to be more supportive. Just want to rant.",
133,"Lately, not being able to find a job has been really weighing me down. I’ve been trying, applying, hoping,but every rejection or silence makes me feel a little more hopeless. It’s hard waking up each day feeling like I’m not moving forward, like I’m stuck while the world keeps going. I keep questioning my worth, my abilities, and whether I’m ever going to find a place where I truly fit in. It's exhausting to stay positive when it feels like nothing’s working out. I just needed to let this out, I feel tired, discouraged, and honestly, a bit lost.",
134,"I'm tired. I had wanted to make music for a living but instead I ended up with declining mental health. I don't have a support system, my family is part of the problem, and I feel like I mentally can't do anything... I'm 25 and I haven't had a job at all. I don't feel like I can even hold one, I cry too easily. I get stressed out. I wanted to make a bit of money to get my family out of poverty but I can't even get myself out of the bed some days. My partner pretty much killed my last dream which was my only motivation, even if only a little. I feel unloved by my partner because I wanted to get married but, despite knowing how bad off I was when he meant me, he makes me feel like he doesn't love me enough for that to happen because I'm not 'functional' enough. I've been going to a psych, taking my meds, and trying my best. I've been severely unfulfilled in this life. Some of it being that all my hobbies turned into coping mechanisms and I struggle to find enjoyment in life. I don't know how to be productive. My friends are all struggling or are extremely pessimistic. I can't make new friends. I feel easily discouraged in places and low energy in things that don't interest me. I've been in and out of therapy. And until last year I had been using an AI to cope with my loneliness only to cry myself to sleep about it at night. ",
135,"For context: My (24f) mother is currently still in the legal proceedings of divorcing my father, and has been since 2022. It’s been messy, stressful and even borderline illegal on his part, but she won’t take any action for the sake of my brothers relationship with him. She’s currently fronting the mortgage that was meant to be paid by 2 people, working overtime at a job she hates. The only things that aren’t her kids who bring her joy in her life are her partner and her best friend, who both live over an hour away. I feel for her, I really do, and I help out financially/around the house as much as I can.

However, My brother (9) is addicted to his Ipad. He has it when he wakes up, he has it when he goes to sleep. He ignores all of his toys for a rotation of Ipad, switch and his iphone (gifted from his dad). He is throughly addicted to it. 

I don’t know how to bring this up to my mum, as I know she’s trying. She’s tired, and she also has to deal with a narcissist who is constantly putting her in a “who can be the favourite parent” competition as he has a monetary advantage. I know she feels that if she upsets my brother just a little bit, he ends up outwardly expressing that he prefers his dad. I know if i say something, she’ll get angry, or she’ll feel like i’m calling her a bad mum, so i’m at a loss. I’m just really worried about my brothers future",
136,"When I (22F) was 19 I was dating a man in his 40s, now (45M). I know it was dumb, but I was vulnerable and he was the only person who was showing me any attention. He made me feel pretty and worthy, but he was also profoundly abusive. The last straw for me was when I woke up in the middle of the night to find him raping me while he thought I was asleep. I broke up with him over the phone the day before my 20th birthday, and he stalked me for almost a year before finally leaving me alone for the better part of a year. 

I went to the police, but they said there wasn't enough evidence, and that because we were intimate partners and I was ""just a crazy college girl who regretted sleeping with an older man"". They never even pressed charges.

Last night I got a message on Twitter from his former tenant, one who had just moved out of one of his rental properties. The tenant had overheard a conversation that my ex was having with his friends downstairs, as he sublets the rooms above the apartment that he lives in. The tenant told me he was bragging about the police not believing me, that he, as a respected member of the community, was believed when I, a nobody, came forward. The tenant told me that they hadn't recorded it, but wanted me to know that they believed me and that they would spread the word about people who may not want to rent from a rapist.

I sobbed all night. It felt nice to be validated that he KNEW that what he had done was rape. He knew that what he had done was wrong. I know there is nothing I can do about it now. And I know he got away with it. But it feels so good to know that it happened. I'm outside bbqing for my new, age-appropriate, boyfriend and I'm not really sure how to feel. I know I will never get justice. But knowing that he admits to wrongdoing and may lose tenants as a result is really cathartic.",
137,"As the title says, I don't know what to do anymore and just want to get this off my chest. I'm becoming very unhappy honestly. I'm F29, he's M31, we've been together for two years. 

I don't want to do this fantasy, he wants to see me with another man. He also likes the idea of a threesome with another woman. I have no interest in either.

This all came up in January and he's been gradually getting quieter and colder. I'm becoming very unhappy, I don't want to be with him if this is the way he's going to be. I miss the way things were before. I have boundaries and I think that should be respected but if this is something more like sexual capability I don't see how this can work. It's also just not fair. I already do a lot for him and feel like all that goes unnoticed now because I don't want to do this. It's shit.

When this all came up in January he cried and said he hates that he likes that and thinks he's disgusting. He said he wanted to stop liking these things, I didn't know what to say and wanted to be supportive and said if this is what he wants to do then I support him but he turned around and said I don't care about him and he's heartbroken.  I felt like this was a manipulation tactic and was hurt he would do that and say that to me when I am trying to be supportive. I said I was just trying to be supportive of what I thought he wants but I don't think changing yourself is a good idea, it never works and will lead to resentment. 
I do care about what he wants and feels guilty I can't give it to him but I have boundaries. I've been thinking more and more we should break up so he can go find what he wants.

And then other times he's great to me and says how amazing and supportive I am. And then goes back to being cold. When he's quiet I ask him what's wrong and he says he's fine he just hates himself for liking what he likes. Idk.

I'm just so confused. I don't know is this a maturity thing or lack of experience or he's too scared to tell me how he's really feeling, he's only been in one relationship before this and that was a five year relationship.

I don't know what to do. Sometimes I feel like I should just do it, not because I want to but it'll make him happy but I know that wouldn't solve anything. Or the kinder thing to do is end it and set him free. There's always going to be something else he wants to do.

I'm lost, confused, heartbroken. I thought he was the one. I don't think I'm ever meant to have a happy and healthy relationship. I should just become a crazy cat lady or something.",

140,"I'm scared my boyfriend will leave me coz he got less marks in 12 th boards. This sounds extremely selfish and it probably is — I'll keep supporting him when he appears for improvement but what if he wakes up one day and just feels like I'm pulling him down or loses all his feelings. 
These marks have made him feel like a failure— which he is not and never will be. Yes they aren't something I expected he would score or so his parents definitely did not either. But it's fine if he got these marks, I hope he improves then in his 'improvement' exam, the only reason I hope he scores more is so that he feels better about himself and can become and appear for the exam which he wants to. A little incident in late December happened between us which has left me deeply insecure and hightened my abandonment issues, it's made me feel some sort of way — i'm scared that some day he'll look at me and think to himself ""this isn't what it used to be"" and sigh. He'll give me a kiss and tell me goodnight, but he'll feel trapped. i'm afraid that i'll do all that i can to save what we have, but know deep down that you don't want me anymore and there's nothing i can do to keep you close. This feeling hasn't left me since December and now I'm afraid for him. I love him and hope the best for him but a part of me feels diacardable in times of inconvenience or stress. Idk if this is selfish, feels like it is, but I'm scared he'll leave me maybe because he might think it's too much to handle a relationship while studying or because he feels sm like a failure that he'll say I deserve someone better or he'll just be tired and stay, stay because if he leaves I'll be a wreck.

141,"I grew up in the DMV as one of very few desi girls in my hometown. Since I was a little girl, I felt rejected by my parents and my peers. I ended up really struggling with self esteem issues which I think ended up plaguing my life. Anyway, fast forward to my freshman year of high school. I met a curly headed nerdy boy who I just thought was the cutest thing I ever saw. He used to carry one of those ""hand bag"" backpacks. He didn't really get a lot of girls attention yet but, he caught my eye. We ended up becoming really good friends as the years went on. I even prophesied to him girls would be falling over him after his freshman year. 

I think later that year or the following, he ended up dating one of my best friends. I had a rule. I never dated anyone my friends dated. Honestly, I really didn't date any way because I guess guys just weren't into me. Like I said, I wasn't the beauty standard. But anyways, they went on to date for most of high school. We grew our friendship. He really became one of my best friends. We talked about everything. I remember in English class he told me I wrote one of the best papers he's ever read in his life. Now, I'm a writer for a living. So that compliment really meant a lot to me. He would pick me up in the mornings our senior year and drive me to school. Sometimes he'd drive me home. We'd talk about his relationship trouble when he and my girl friend were about to end things (she cheated on him). But since she dated him, I always get like he was off limits but I just loved being around him. I never told him I liked him. He ended up dating and is now married to a girl from a grade below us. Now, we've graduated over a decade ago. We both are married with kids. Surprise, I ended up marrying a jock 7 years older than me. How that happened is just a whole other story related to trauma. But all these years later, he still uses the nickname I gave him in high school on Facebook.

Anyway, some days I just sit here and think about I wonder what life would have been like if I actually told him how much I liked him. How different my life would be. Probably not much cause he probably wasn't into me like that but, a girl can't help but feel like he was the one that got away. ",
142,"So, the s•xual trauma that has affected me most, has been from a household family member, a•al violation (I'm moved out :3).
I was 10 or 11 when it started. Lasted too long.

And last year, i had noticed BDSM just wasn't really cutting it. And I started asking around, discovered CnC. I saw one video, and had one of the most intense guilty pleasures I've ever felt. I told myself never again.

Im back on the site that same night. 

...

I'm not gonna drag this on, basically, I came to terms with that yes, I am a SA survivor with a CnC kink, but I still can't grasp   -w h y-  I have this kink. If I didn't have flashbacks as much as I do (and always have since), I wouldn't question it as much. But then, I can perfectly differentiate the difference between CnC with my partner, and the trauma. 

i dont say my safeword even if i wanna bc i wanna be violated by my partner, it turns me on.
And yet i still have flashbacks that regress me to age 7 for hours, will cause me to contemplate (too much to live for, dw), and i can't utter a word for hours. 

I just really don't understand why this is? Anyone have any ideas?

143,I really tried. I’m sorry I didn’t give it my best. ,
144,"  
More than 25 years ago, I represented a man named Alvin Ridley. He had been ostracized most of his adult life — feared, misunderstood, and considered a “bogeyman” by many in his small Georgia town. When his wife died, he was accused of imprisoning her for decades and then murdering her.

Our relationship as lawyer and client lasted 15 months and was fraught with conflict. I tried everything I could to understand him, but I often walked away frustrated, even doubting myself.

Slowly, we began to be able to work together, and we caught some breaks. After barring me from entering his home for fourteen months, a turkey plate from my parents opened the door for me on Thanksgiving. Inside, I found thousands of handwritten pages his wife had left behind. They would help prove his innocence, but he insisted on keeping them close by, carrying them to court in two old suitcases. Also in the suitcases were scores of cockroaches that he released upon the courtroom (discussed by jurors on Forensic Files). 

But what none of us realized at the time — not me, not the town, not the court — was that Alvin was autistic. He wasn’t diagnosed until 2021, over two decades after the trial, at age 79.

That diagnosis changed how the community saw him. It also forced me to reconsider everything — our strained communication, the trial, and what justice really meant in his case.

He lived just long enough to feel that shift and enjoy the warmth and affection from his community that had eluded him for a lifetime.",
145,"Honestly, I can’t be the only one completely fed up with how unbearable Instagram has become. It’s like every third post or story is an ad now  and not even remotely relevant ones, just random crap I’d never buy. I open the app to see what my friends are up to, and within two minutes I’m being bombarded with stuff I didn’t ask for. It’s turning into a glorified shopping catalogue with a side of influencer flexing. Why are we all still on this platform acting like it’s normal? There are ad-free alternatives out there, yet everyone’s clinging to Instagram like we’re stuck in some collective Stockholm Syndrome. I just want a clean, chill space to connect not a corporate billboard in my pocket.",
146,"Ok, this is going to be long. As I said, I (22/F) am cutting contact with my family (Dad 52/M, Step mom 50/F, and stepsister 25/F) after years of emotional neglect and abuse, along with some physical abuse. Take this as a trigger warning as well please. There are mentions of self harm and suicide.

To start from the beginning, my dad was physically abusive to the point where I have anxiety attacks every time I hear someone angry and drunk, or hear a woman crying. He beat my mom and brother in front of me for years, and when I was 10, choked and slapped me on two separate occasions, and then later slapped me again and left a bruise when I was 16. 

He remarried to Kim when I was 11, and they both ganged up to emotionally abuse me essentially, though there wasn't any physical abuse for a while. I would have severe panic attacks, cut myself, and attempted suicide at both my mom's house and dad's house. Every time I had a severe panic attack, my dad and my step mom screamed at me and threatened to send me to a mental hospital. My stepmom even threatened to take away all of my long sleeve shirts if I kept cutting myself.

I moved in with them later because it was a better option than my mom who kept having drunk fights with her abusive boyfriend until I ran away.

Things got terrible between me and my stepsister, who was 16 while I was 13. I was very bad at hiding that I was gay in a tiny country highschool, so I got bullied while she got questioned all the time. She took it out on me by screaming at me and putting her hands on me multiple times until I was afraid to go home, my family never did anything except scold the both of us. I took every after school activity to stay longer until my family got home, because she wouldn't do it in front of them. She has grown to be the worst person I have ever known.

My mom later abandoned me at 14 on my birthday after I protected her from her abusive boyfriend. So, yeah. My dad got a bit better, but at that point, I was never upset or angry in front of them because of the reasons above. I learned to only be happy in front of them.

Throughout the years, I have been pushed aside. They constantly called me weird, stole up to $900 from me, asked for $300 rent when I could only work 9 hours a week as a full time student in my final year, etc. It all came to a head when I asked for my stepsister to not be at my graduation.

I mainly asked because I was done spoiling my memories with her. On my 22nd birthday, she constantly made comments like ""I didn't get XYZ on my birthday"".

The reason my parents went a little over the top is because they didn't celebrate my 21st at all. (All of my birthdays have been shit honestly where they did what they wanted and got mad when I did what I wanted). I was extremely upset because I spent over $100 and told them for two weeks about my birthday because I thought my 21st would be the one birthday where they would suck it up. No one showed up and no one did anything for me. They actually blamed me for not coming because I share my birthday with my partner (the only person other than my maternal grandparents getting me through this) and they just said that I celebrated with them, even though their family focused on my partner, as they should. 

Well, I didn't want my stepsister at my graduation and no one was happy. I ranted to my dad, and they cornered me in the kitchen and essentially blamed me for everything wrong with our relationship, but didn't apologize when I finally stood up for myself and told them they were wrong.

They tried blaming me for not spending time with them, despite me going to multiple events with them. I then pointed out my 21st birthday and the fact that I have invited them to several occasions where I wanted to share my interests, but they always backed out or ignored me. 

They tried accusing me of not spending holidays with them anymore because I skipped Thanksgiving and Easter to spend with my maternal grandparents after years of putting them second for holidays. I pointed this out and they went silent.

Were there good times? Absolutely. Do I think they meant this all intentionally? Absolutely not. I know my dad loves me (he's the one I wish I could keep contact with), but he only shows it when I do stuff for him. My stepmom is a complete narcissist, and my stepsister is... Well, I hate her the most. I would only talk to my dad if he got therapy and deeply apologized, because I still fucking love him and he has improved and proven himself in small moments. He has apologized, he has stopped with the physical abuse, he knows he has fucked up, and if my step-family wasn't in the picture, things would be better.

There was so much more, but honestly, this post is getting long and I'm getting overwhelmed and rambling.

In the end, I give up. I believe my dad loves me, but doesn't know how to love me, and I just can't anymore. I'm done being treated like a scape goat, the forgotten child, the ""bigger person"", and I'm sick of getting blamed for everything wrong in our relationship when they can't even apologize or realize they've done wrong. The only time my father has told me he's proud of me is with my relationship with my partner (he sees true love in us and has always been miserable in his relationships because he's a cheating sexist scumbag), and when I've given him money (which, now that I'm graduating and moving in with my partner, I barely have any due to the rent situation). I'm just so hurt and done... I don't know how I'm cutting contact yet, I asked for advice already and need to think it out, but it has to happen. 

Thank you. ",
147,"Early20s!F currently in a nearly 3 year relationship with the man I thought was the love of my life. He has been nothing but kind, sweet, and supportive in every possible way. Without going into detail, he helped me process some trauma from my frequent past and when i recently told him that I don't know if I want to have sex anymore he assured me its a non-issue and wants to stay with me long-term. We live together, take care of my pet, and have a whole future planned together. 

I've been struggling with the fact that I do not want to be intimate with men or be viewed by them sexually. This has nothing to do with my boyfriend and everything to do with aforementioned trauma. When I talked to him I thought I was fine living the rest of my life together with him and little-to-no sexual intimacy. The more I think about it the more I question if I really can go my whole life without that. I'm unsure if I would be comfortable doing those things with a woman (I'm bisexua(?) l and have been out for many many years), but there is an increasingly vocal part of me that wants to know. These feelings have led me to question whether or not the love I hold for my current boyfriend is even still romantic in nature, something I'm still unsure of. I know I like our life together, I could never hate him, and I would want to remain close regardless of circumstances. However I don't know where the line is for those feelings to be romantic if that makes sense.

I've recently found myself thinking of my best friend(F) the same way I used to think of my boyfriend; for comfort, with affection, etc. I have NOT crossed any lines into what would be considered ""cheating"" as I am not that kind of person and would never hurt my current partner in that way. Nor would I break up with my boyfriend and immediately chase my best friend. I'm well aware my feelings for her might fade completely when I resolve the issue in my current relationship and would not act towards her on impulse. 

I just don't know what to do. I am attracted to men but I genuinely can not see myself ever dating one again if this relationship goes south. I'm also unsure if I'm still attracted to men in the way I was years ago when my boyfriend and I got together. These feelings have been festering for some time and are affecting my ability to sleep, eat, and function. Please be kind, any/all advice appreciated.",
148,"A few months ago, my father got a rare bird from his friends. Where I'm from, sentiments like caring for endangered species or caring for the environment aren't really a thing. So this bird found itself in a cage instead of a reservation centre somewhere.

Not long after (a few weeks ago), the bird was attacked by a cat in the middle of the night. My grandmother (who was mainly responsible to feed it and clean its cage as my father likes to take animals but not takes care of them) and I found it hurt and advised him to send it to the vet. He refused, stating that the authorities would fine him for keeping an endangered animal.

In truth I think he just didn't care, like most people in my culture. The police barely do their job here, there's no way an authority would go out of their way to track this bird in this third world backwater. I wanted to send the bird to the vet but I had no idea how to handle it.

And so for the next few weeks the bird grew weaker and stopped eating. Two weeks ago, it seemed to have recovered a tiny bit but its condition worsened. Its neck was probably broken or its nerves were compromised. It could no longer hold its head straight and I visited it every night and sometimes would cry seeing how much it suffered. It hurt me deeply.

This morning I decided to end it. My grandmother understood. We took it out of the cage, and I caressed its fur, and did it.

For context, in the culture I'm born into, at least the contemporary one, there really isn't any concept such as mercy killing, or being humane to animals. In the extreme, in my area there are various incidents of people inflicting things kn cats and dogs that would autoremove thispost if I describe it. But overall, most people don't reserve the same compassion for animals. And they think it's merciless to kill a suffering animal to end its suffering.

I grow more resentful of my culture. I wish I was somewhere where people have humanity for animal. A few months ago my neighbour's kitten was stuck in the drain in the middle of the night, it cried and cried and I knew I couldn't live with myself knowing it was possible to not let it die. So I went into the drain and got it out. That neighbour is one of the few who take carr of animals and strays. It's not out of kindness, I have depression and overthinking about suffering messes me up. I cannot stop myself from putting myself into the suffering animal's place.

My cat is a former stray, I go to great lengths to take care of it. Our late dog died in my arms after 10 days of suffering, I tried everything to nurse it back to health. Once I love an animal my heart is too weak to let it suffer.",
149,"Hi everyone. This is my first ever post here after using reddit for a year,so please bear with me.

I’m a 21F MBA student studying away from home. I’m usually the go-to person, extroverted, cheerful, always supporting others even when I’m breaking inside. I never share my own pain because I fear being a burden. But this time, I need to talk.

At this new college, I have a small circle of close girls, even though I am a person who talks to everyone and anyone. This is about one of them ,let’s call her Anna (24F). We were always vibing, joking, studying, gossiping together. One day during a deep conversation, Anna suddenly started crying. She said she wanted to share what was hurting her but couldn’t. We didn’t push. I kept checking in on her afterward, just making sure she was okay.

A week later, we were volunteering at a college event when an arrogant guy from our class—Prick (22M)—walked in. Anna and I jokingly complimented him. She teased that his back looked good in formals which was truly a genuine compliment despite the type of person he is .

Suddenly, he lashed out saying, “Why? Do you want to lick it?” The whole room went silent. I called him out as it was inappropriate. He claimed he felt objectified. That’s another story for another day.

But from that day, Anna started slipping. She got quiet, weak, zoned out. That weekend during our usual group video call, her camera suddenly went blank. I knew something was wrong. I called her nonstop. When she finally picked up, she was having a panic attack—hyperventilating, alone, terrified. I stayed on the phone the whole night, just to keep her safe.

Things escalated. From the next day,Panic attacks hit her every few hours. She’d cry, shake, scratch me to the point my hands bled. She didn’t even remember her episodes afterward. Her roommates were away, so I moved into her hostel for a week. I was with her in class, at night, during meals—even when she used the washroom. I became her shadow. I was there throughout, missing my lecture, letting her scratch my hand to make her calm down at what not.

Eventually, it got so serious that our professors (who have a healthcare background) and I had to call her mother, even though Anna kept refusing. That’s when they told me what had happened. I won’t reveal the details, but it was sexual abuse—Prick’s comment had triggered her past trauma.

 I just did what needed to be done. I lived with her throughout, talked to her constantly. By the end of the month my arms were filled with scrathes and blood, eyes with ark circle. And then, Anna's mom came, and slowly we got her into therapy. There was a day when she finally confronted the man on a phone call—with her mom, teachers, and me by her side. I cried outside the room that day. After everything, she walked back into class, smiled, and said, “I’m back.” It broke me. In a good way. We all hugged and cried.

Now here the problem starts 

Later, during lunch with our girl gang, Anna stood up to share her story with the whole group, as her therapist advised. She was finally able to speak, and we were all in tears. Then she thanked everyone, and specifically thanked Flora—another friend in our group—for her support. Flora did help, no doubt, and I respect her for that. But in that moment, something inside me just… went still.

I wasn’t expecting a public thank you. I don’t need recognition. I’ve always believed that if your left hand helps someone, even your right hand doesn’t need to know. But still… something stung.

I don’t feel jealous cause flora did a lot too. Not angry cause it was my choice. Not betrayed cause she didn't ask me for help and I never expected anything.Just blank. I chose to be there for her. I don’t regret it. But I’m stuck with this odd emptiness. Why do I feel this way?

I guess I just needed to get this off my chest. If anyone relates or has advice, I’d appreciate it.

Thanks for listening.  ",
150,"I’m 29(M) and my whole life has sucked and everything had beat me down. I know others have it worse but maybe they see a brighter future, I don’t. I drink every day just to forget I’m alive and hope the next drink will finish the job. 
 I’ve worked since I was 12 years old and every job I’ve had I sucked at. I’ve quit every job because I know that I’d be fired sooner or later. I just can’t find happiness in anything I do anymore, the only time I’m happy is when I’m alone drinking with my cat and play Xbox or Pokemon.

151,"I’m 19F, working in accounting. I started off as an intern, and it’s been over a year and a half now. I honestly hate this job so much. My mental health feels completely gone at this point, like it’s just buried somewhere and I can’t reach it.

I think about quitting literally every single day, but I keep wondering how my family would react. I feel like they’d be disappointed, and that just makes me feel worse. The truth is, I’m terrible at this job. I’ve tried so hard to get better, but it’s just not working. I cry at my desk, more than I’d like to admit. I work night shifts because of the time zone difference, and I can’t even focus properly anymore.

I’m also in my second year of college and I can’t keep up with that either. I haven’t slept, I’ve been working and trying to finish assignments with whatever little energy I have left. I’m also in therapy, which helps sometimes, but lately everything just feels way too much to handle.

I don’t know what to do. I’m so tired. Just needed to get this out somewhere.",
152,I really need someone to talk to.,
153,"This has been eating me alive, and I don’t know how to process it anymore. I feel betrayed, humiliated, and so deeply hurt by someone I considered my closest friend in the world.

So here’s the situation. I (26F) was talking to this guy (25M), let’s call him J. We met through gaming — played a lot together on COD and chatted on Snapchat. We were talking consistently, and it was starting to build into something that felt like more than just friendship. I don’t open up easily, especially not when it comes to emotions, so even the fact that I was catching feelings was a big deal for me.

My best friend (27F), we’ll call her K, was also friends with him through the game. We all played together sometimes, and at the time, it felt harmless. But things between me and J ended very badly — it hurt a lot. I told K clearly that I needed him out of my life and asked her to stop playing and speaking with him. At first, she called me pathetic and said it was “harmless,” but after I explained more about how badly things had gone and how I needed a clean break, she said she’d removed him — though it turned out it was just from COD, not Snapchat.

Later, she told me J had messaged her — and instead of ignoring him or telling me right away, she engaged in a full-on conversation with him. She didn’t tell me what they talked about and even said she was annoyed I asked her to cut contact again because “it was a nice conversation.” Eventually, she claimed she removed him from Snapchat, but I later found out they were still connected on Facebook.

I just had this uneasy feeling, like she wasn’t being honest. She never gave me the full picture. I knew she’d been through a rough patch recently, but I didn’t understand why J — of all people — became someone she’d lean on. She had plenty of people to talk to, and she knew what he had meant to me.

Now here’s where it gets worse.

K never told me she was going away to Cornwall. She didn’t even mention a trip. It was kept completely secret from me. On the Friday she left, my car broke down and I was stuck alone on the side of the road. I called her — needing support, scared, just wanting to talk to my best friend. When she answered, her response was:
“Oh no, that’s not good. How did that happen? That’s gonna cost a bomb. Oh, by the way, J took me down to Cornwall. Try calling Jamie or your dad.”

That was the first time I even found out she was there — with him. She didn’t check in afterward. Didn’t ask if I made it home. She had no idea if my kids were with me, and she never even asked. That’s what breaks me. She stayed with him until Monday, and I was left sitting with this bombshell, alone.

Later, I messaged her mum asking when she’d be back because I wanted my house key back. That’s when K finally messaged me, and this was our conversation:

K: “What do you want to get from me? Mum told me you had messaged her.”
Me: “My key. Not like you’ll need it anymore.”
K: “Key? Aye? 😂 Ohhhhh house key!!”
Me: “My house key, K.”
K: “No need to say my name like that, ew 🙄😂. & hahah yeah that’s all good!!”
Me: “Cool. Do you really not care at all?”
K: “Of course I do, haven’t said I didn’t care. You jumped straight to that conclusion yourself 🧐”
Me: “Kinda the way it’s been led to feel.”
K: “Absolutely not.”
Me: “From your perspective. Anyway let me know when you’re back and I’ll come get it.”

What hurts the most isn’t even about J anymore. It’s about K — someone who used to call my kids hers, who was part of my daily life, who promised she was always going to be there. She was my safe place. My family. And now I don’t even recognize her.

I defended her when other people told me she was toxic. I said she’d changed. I believed in her. And now I feel like a complete idiot.

To make everything worse, I finally called her out — sent her a message explaining how badly this has hurt me, how wrong this all is, and how I couldn’t believe she’d do this after everything. Her response? Nothing. Radio silence. Not even an apology.

But that’s not where it ended. She got her mum to call me — not to help fix things or clear the air — but to have a go at me. Her mum actually rang me up to defend K, saying that K can “be friends with whoever she likes” and “doesn’t have to tell me anything.” Which is so ironic, because K used to tell me everything. I wasn’t even given the space to be hurt. They basically made me out to be the problem for having feelings, for having boundaries, and for expecting basic respect.

I’ve now removed her from my life. Not because I wanted to — but because I had to. Because this wasn’t just a moment of bad judgment. This was a choice she made, repeatedly, over months. She lied, kept secrets, and completely disregarded our friendship. And when I finally said enough is enough, I got guilt-tripped for reacting at all.

Everyone I’ve spoken to — family, friends, even people who don’t know the full story — have all said the same thing: This is betrayal. This is not okay.

And I just keep thinking… who does this? Who goes away for a weekend with their best friend’s ex (or whatever label you want to give it) and lies about it? Who hides months of conversations with the one person their best friend asked them to stay away from?

She’s broken my trust in a way that I don’t know if I can recover from. And despite everything, the worst part is I still love her. I still miss her. And I hate myself for that.

Anyway. That’s the story. I’m not even sure what I’m hoping for here. Just needed to get it out because I feel like I’m losing my mind.",
154,"so i am a uni student who currently stays in a dorm which only has one bed so i am all alone. and i feel like i am wasting all my days thinking about masturbating. i dont do any work, study or i even cancel out friends hangout just so i can go back to the dorm and play with myself. its ruining my life and the content i am watching/reading while doing it is disgusting, i dont even want to name it here. it gets worse everytime too because the normal content doesnt make me excited anymore. i feel awful and so humiliated after but i still continue. after every session i say to myself that this is the last one but after like max 30 minutes i go back to it again. i even skip breakfast/dinner just so i can do it. for example today i skipped school so i can ""study"" but i masturbated all day long and i wasted a whole day. and its not only just today its like this everyday. even when im talking to people on the phone, one of my hand is there. i feel disgusted, i literally want to end it all. i know im not supposed to do it, but this is like an addiction. i am not addicted to anything but this. i feel like its my only source of dopamine. the ecstasy i get, the feeling that only lasts 3 seconds thats the only thing that keeps me going. i dont know how to end this and i cant tell anyone about this because this is so embarassing and disgusting. i hate this, i hate living like this. i just want to get it off my chest.",

I know i don't deserve forgiveness for what i did, and she shouldn't, but i truly deeply feel like this is the final blow of my pathetic addiction to pornography, and it affects how i interact with people, it starts to affect other people too, i don't wanna go too far and i really feel terrified if i do for what would i become (corruption arc of my personality has become worrisome these days, it feels like walking on eggshells). I know i should seek psychologist, because i just can't fight this addiction alone, i need other people to monitor and watch me, maybe they can just distract me from my loneliness that trigger such addiction. But idk if i can find a high quality psychologist in Jakarta with Indonesian Health Social Security Service (BPJS).

I'm not looking for pity, i don't deserve it, but i'm here to confess and get it out of my chest. I wanna take accountability for what i did, desperately looking for punishment. I don't wanna hide and avoid even if this is going to tarnish my reputation.

At first my soul was crushed for a bit, but then I felt a little liberated, because I realized that I was holding onto a bunch of mental weight for nothing, and that it was time to let it go, and start enjoying life again.

159,"Hi everyone,
I want to share something personal that’s affected me deeply for many years. When I was very young (around 6 or 7 years old), I watched the horror movie The Exorcist with my dad. This experience terrified me so much that it gave me a long-lasting fear of the dark, nightmares, and anxiety that stayed with me well into my teens.

I couldn’t sleep without a light on, and I was constantly scared of closing my eyes or being alone in dark places. This fear affected my daily life and caused me to overthink and feel anxious. My parents were separated, and I spent a lot of time alone at home, which made the fear worse.

Now, I’m 29 years old, and while I can sleep in the dark without fear if I avoid scary thoughts, the trauma from that experience still impacts me sometimes. I’m sharing this because I want to connect with others who might have faced similar fears or childhood traumas and learn how they coped or healed.

Thank you for reading",
160,"Seven months of emotional investment. That’s how long I built something with this woman I met through work. We clicked right away—genuine connection, mutual energy. After I left the job, she asked for my Instagram so we could stay in touch. What followed was months of real conversations, vulnerability, and slow emotional buildup.

Eventually, I told her how I felt. Not in some pressure-filled way. I was honest but respectful. I told her I liked her. That I’d been feeling something from early on. That I wasn’t rushing, but I wanted clarity.

She didn’t shut it down.

Instead, she kept engaging. She made plans. She initiated hangouts. She said she wanted to keep seeing me. We went out multiple times—long walks, dinner, ice cream, meaningful places like botanical gardens. We got physically closer too—touches, playful flirting, her opening up emotionally. She made me feel like this was going somewhere.

After our fourth hangout, I started wondering: maybe she was waiting on me to make a move. That uncertainty pushed me to call her and finally speak my truth.

And that’s when she flipped everything.

On the phone, she said:

“I think we’re seeing this differently. I thought we were just hanging out as friends.”

She told me she wasn’t ready for a relationship, that it wasn’t fair to keep hanging out if I had feelings.
But she knew.
I had already told her how I felt before that last hangout.
And she still wanted to see me. She still planned it. She even said she was looking forward to it.

To hear her minimize it like that felt like gaslighting.
Like the months of closeness, the gestures, the emotional support I gave her—meant nothing.

I stayed calm. I didn’t beg. I told her, “We’re clearly in different headspaces. I appreciate your honesty.”
And that was that.

Since then?
She still watches my stories.
She hides me from hers.
She likes vague posts about healing and “being over it,” and cryptic emotional quotes.
It’s like she’s trying to convince herself she didn’t fumble something real.

What hurts isn’t the rejection.
It’s the rewriting of everything.

If you weren’t ready, say it back when I told you how I felt. Don’t continue making plans, don’t keep pulling me closer, don’t let me keep investing—then act like I imagined all of it.

She used my presence as an emotional cushion during her healing.
Then left when it got too real.

It wasn’t just mixed signals. It was emotional dishonesty.
And it left me questioning everything.

161,"Just got back from the clinic, and I’m still trying to process everything.

I was in a long-term relationship that started back in high school. We were each other’s first everything. We both came from religious backgrounds and planned to wait until marriage, but after a few too many late nights alone, we had sex. I really thought we were in love.

We even made plans to move in together for college so we could have some privacy. Everything felt like it was lining up. But just a couple of months before the move, she broke up with me. Said she needed space, wanted to experience more of life, and didn’t want to be tied down so young. I was devastated, but I tried to respect it and move on.

A few months passed, and I started developing sores on my penis. They went away, but then came back along with a rash on my thighs, feet, and palms. It freaked me out, so I went to get tested.

I didn’t think much of it at first, but a few days later, I got an SMS, positive for syphilis. I went back to the clinic for treatment, and the nurse sat down to talk with me.

She told me I needed to inform any recent sexual partners so they could get tested too. I told her I’d only ever been with one person, my ex. I asked, probably sounding naive, if it was even possible for two people who were truly each other’s firsts to end up with syphilis. She was kind, but honest. No, it doesn’t work like that. It likely came from third party.

Now I can’t stop thinking about the timing. Was that part of why she ended things? Had she already cheated? I feel sick. I trusted her completely, and now I don’t even know what was real.",
162,"to summarize my mom had an affair and then gave up her parental rights to me to go be with the other man.  Well said other man is my actual biological father.  And while I was growing up being physically and sexually abused they settled down and had two other kids who recently found and contacted me after learning I exist.

Here's the thing tho, from what they've told me they don't know abt my abuse and they think we're half siblings.  So there's a good chance that my biological father doesn't even know I'm his.

But I WANT him to know.  I want to make them understand that he abandoned his daughter to a living hell while THEY got to grow up with a happy fucking family.  And I want it to fucking destroy them. I want the guilt to eat them the fuck up until they can't even sleep at night.  I want them to feel even a fraction of the hurt and despair that I've lived with my whole fucking life.

God I'm just so fucking angry that they were able to just start over and have a normal family while I was looking forward to getting raped because at least if he was doing that he wasnt hitting me.

Idk where I'm going with this.  I guess I just need to vent or something.

163,"My boyfriend is incapable of communication. We see each other every weekend, but rarely ever outside of that (despite only living 2 miles apart). 

I have 2 really close friends that I see weekly. One is married and the other has been with her partner for as long as we have (2 years). 
I hate their relationships because it makes me feel so miserable about mine. They have what I want, and I know he will never provide that. 
They get frequent texts from their partners, their partners actually want to go out and do things with them, their partners actually give them the bare minimum of saying ""sorry, really busy today so will reply later, love you!"". I've broached this with him countless times, that I don't feel like it's a relationship if we only exist Friday night - Monday morning, that he misses so much of my life because he's just AWOL. It gets better for a short bit, and then it goes right back to recieving a text in the morning, and a text before I go to bed. 
I interviewed for a really prestigious role today. He has no idea what happened at it, if he even remembers it, and by the time we see each other, the euphoria of kicking ass and succeeding professionally will have worn off. And just like that, we don't share those high points in life.

I know Reddit tends to be a negative cesspit and will flog me for wanting to actually talk to my partner by labelling me needy and suffocating, but is the bar that low now??? Is it REALLY so terrible to want to share your day with the person you're supposed to share your life with?",

Thank you


I didn’t expect this post to get so much attention thank you all for your comments, stories, and honesty. I read many of them. And then I did something that felt terrifying at first: I shared the post with my wife.

We sat together. In silence, at first. But then, for the first time in what felt like forever, we talked. Really talked.

She cried.

She told me how heavy everything felt. That even though I wasn’t trying to hurt her, it felt like she was carrying the weight of two people all the time. Dishes, laundry, school drop-offs, doctor’s appointments, meal planning. The invisible labor that so many people in the comments mentioned — it was real, and she’d been drowning in it.

And I just… hadn’t seen it.

Our kids are 8 and 6. They’re wonderful, but anyone with little ones knows how draining that phase of life can be. Add to that a partner who’s unknowingly been more of a roommate than a teammate, and yeah… the silence made sense.

So I started small. I took over some of the chores without being asked. I made dinner last night. I planned a fun weekend activity with the kids, just me and them. so she could have a real break. And next week, we’re all going on a little family adventure together. Something light. Something fun. Something healing.

It’s going to take time. But for the first time in a long time, I feel hope. And I owe so much of that to you all.

Thank you. Truly.",

They don’t talk to me like they used to. And trust me I’m not the type to always emotionally dump on people that isn’t what’s going on. I rarely talk about my feelings if at all. 

I just realized I don’t think they like me very much.

It’s weird being here and realizing no one really likes you. They used to. I think they just got bored or decided there were better options that gave them more benefits. 

I feel really alone. I have like two friends I know who care about me. But neither are in a place where I can tell them I’m feeling like this. And so I won’t burden them with it.

The others well, just don’t care. I don’t even know how to talk to one of my friends anymore cause she just doesn’t care when we talk. Like it’s so evident with her replies she doesn’t want to talk. So I’ve given up. 

It was nice feeling so liked and cared for and I won’t lie- I just don’t think that’s ever meant to last. It was never going to.

What’s funny is we’ve had no conflict, if there’s a problem we all talk about it really well. But I’m the newest friend and being the floater friend they don’t really like me as much as they like the established friends.

But then it spiraled. I’d make up stories about what he was doing. I once even said he visited campus (he “left early” so no one saw him). One time I sent myself a message pretending it was from him and read it out loud.

Or maybe I'm reading into nothing. I just wanted to let this out. I'm reaching the end of how much I can take my shitty life. I'm scared and alone and I can't afford help.

171,"Hey. I started dating my girlfriend in november of 2022. Things have been good, we have good chemistry, we talk a lot, and we have gone in a bunch of adventures together. I trust her, and I know that she hasn't cheated on me. She has a troubled past. She told me about a guy she had a relationship with one of his rommates in college. he was abusive and she cut it off. This was in 2019. After that, she told me that she only had hookups but not actual relationships. One night, the sexual past subject came along. This is where the worry begins. She told me that the last time she had sex before being with me (and even knowing me) was in August 2022. all good there. according to her, it was just a friends with benefits who only agreed on having sex, not even staying over in her house or doing anything else but sex. I didn't have any problem with that. Back in January we went to a short trip with a bunch of her friends, and her best friend (in her drunken state) said something along the lines of ""hey xx, remember when you fucked xx back in October 2022?"" My girlfriend went silent and I didn't touch the subject that night.

That's the first part of the problem. The second one, is that I saw a dude liking a bunch of her pictures and sending her corny shit on instagram. She showed me. I asked her if she ever had sex with this dude and she completely denied it. I believed her and I didn't thought anything of it. But it kept bugging me off.

I know that I will be trashed for this, but my intuition told me something was off and I needed to know. Once, I took her phone and went through the messages with this dude. They indeed hooked up. Second, I went to the messages with the other dude (the one that her friend revealed by being drunk) and they hooked up in October 2022. One month before we started dating. (he is pretty much her neighbor, which makes things even worse) Third, I saw messages with the dude she was friends with benefits and they were fucking. Not only that but they were actually dating, and he was staying over at her place.

With all of this, it is pretty clear she is lying to me about her sexual past. Listen, I don't think she will cheat on me but this is bugging me off. I don't trust her the same as before and my views on her have changed. I know that snooping through her phone is wrong and I take accountability on that. I don't know how to feel about her. Why would she lie about this stuff? Is this the end?",
172,"Hey guys. Basically what it says in the title. Me and my partner got into a disagreement earlier on the phone and expressed he felt like 'doing something stupid'. This obviously panicked me (for a little context i lost my dad to suicide so i don't take stuff like this lightly). I live 3 hours away so i asked if he needed me to call his campus security (he's a uni student). He then tried to backtrack and told me he'd be with his flatmate so i didn't need to worry about him.

A few hours go by and i went to bed. I woke up an hour ago to realise i had a missed call off my partner. I tried to call him back and got no response. I then contacted the flatmate he said he'd be with (I'm also friends with his flatmate) and asked if he'd heard off my partner. The flatmate was active but wasn't responding to me. After waiting a little while i took the initiative and phoned campus security to ask if they could do a quick wellbeing check. The good news is, they did the wellbeing check and he was okay. The bad news is, i got this message off another one of my friends that lives with my partner and his flatmate:


''Thank you for waking me up at almost 2 in the morning with (uni) security knocking on (partner's name) door. We. Are. Asleep. I didnt want to be a part of this and you said you respected that this wouldn't be anyone else's issue but once again I'm being bothered by this. To say I am pissed off would be an understatement. I will talk to you after Friday but I am pissed the fuck off.''

I feel like my friend is being totally unfair. I'm currently 3 hours away and if i have reason to believe my partner is in danger and i can't get a hold of anyone there's only so much i can do. Additionally, it doesn't feel fair that it seems like I'm being expected to take a threat like that light-heartedly after experiencing personal trauma surrounding mental health. I appreciate i might be biased though.",
173,"For context, I’m 30 and female. I’ve been in recovery for over 2 years and the majority of the past 8 years I’ve been sober. I have mental health issues but have been stable since 2018. I’ve lived with my mom since 2022/23 when I left my very abusive boyfriend. 

My mother is an alcoholic who has a LOT of undiagnosed mental health issues, trauma etc including narcissistic traits. We typically get along fine now that I’m an adult but tonight she did something that made me react, then she played the victim. I’m a mess because of it.

To be fair— **I know I was in the wrong to get physical and turn over a piece of furniture.** I know that it was completely inappropriate, juvenile and aggressive. 

Tonight while discussing my sister, who is at the hospital trying to get off dope, I said I was gonna give her some pants and sweaters because she’s been in need of clothes for days. My mom argued with me, claiming I was saying she was a bad mom because she hadn’t brought her clothes yet. I repeated multiple times that I just wanted to give her some of my shitty leggings and that it wasn’t about her. 

I even plead with her calmly to stop the argument multiple times. 

She then accuses me of using and being mentally unwell. She knows I’ve been very anxious the past few days worrying about my sister, but that’s as bad as my mental health has been lately. She continues to not let me speak at all and continues to look at me like I’m crazy and tell me I’m “not normal” and I’m “doing something”. 

I’m not crazy, and I’m not using. I fucking lost it. I absolutely lost it. I threw my bedside table on its side on the ground and screamed at her to go through my entire room and all of my things, and that I would sit there and wait for her. She tells me to get out and she’s calling the cops, and continues to tell me I’m crazy and on drugs and she’s gonna put me in the hospital. She wouldn’t even let me finish a sentence. After I told her to go through all my shit she realized she was wrong and I’m not using, because she got all quiet and acted like a victim and like I’m being scary. I grabbed her shoulders and said “LISTEN TO ME” because all I was trying to say was “I didn’t want to argue, you accused me of this shit and I reacted and now you’re turning it around on me”. She turned around and went to punch me in the face. I went to hit her back. She said she was calling the cops, I told her to go ahead. I almost wanted them to come because I wanted to prove that I’m sane and sober. 

When I was freaking out she started speaking all calmly and acting like I’m insane/high, but kept verbally saying it. I think she was trying to create a narrative for the girl downstairs who could hear it all. 

I calmed down entirely immediately as soon as she walked outside to have a cigarette. She called my dad and sister and cried to them about how there’s something wrong with me and I’m scaring her.

I calmly got my things together and called my dad to pick me up. I’m now at his place for the next couple nights. Thankfully he understands because he was married to the woman. 

I refuse to go out and get high because I don’t want to give her the satisfaction.  I know I’m sober, I know I’m sane and I know what I did wrong here. But I also know what she did wrong. 

I’m now feeling horrible shame and guilt. I want to apologize for my part in this, but I’m also so upset.",
174,"There was a time in my life when I laughed without overthinking it. When I’d look in the mirror and actually recognize the person staring back at me. That version of me feels like a stranger now.

Somewhere along the way, I stopped feeling like a person and started feeling like a placeholder. Someone people come to for support, for distraction, for comfort… but rarely for love. Not real love. Not the kind that stays when things get hard.

Lately, I’ve been noticing all the little things I used to enjoy that don’t bring me any joy anymore. Music feels hollow. Food tastes dull. Conversations feel like obligations. I still show up. I still smile. I still say, “I’m good, just tired.” But no one asks what kind of tired.

The truth is, I’m emotionally tired. Soul tired. Tired of being the strong one. Tired of clapping for everyone else while quietly fading into the background. Tired of pretending I don’t notice how easily people let me go.

I think I’m grieving myself, in a weird way. Grieving the version of me that hadn’t been so hurt yet. The one who still believed people meant what they said. The one who thought love was unconditional if you just gave enough of it.

But I’ve learned that even when you pour every part of yourself into someone, it doesn’t guarantee they’ll hold you with care. Sometimes they drink you dry and then blame you for being empty.

I’m not okay. But I’m also not asking for help. I just needed to say it out loud. To admit it to someone—even if it’s strangers on the internet.

I miss the old me. And I hope someday, I can find pieces of them again.

That’s all.",
175,"I (18F) am very close with my dad. 
My dad's parents, my grandparents, were my role models growing up. We would visit them several times a year. My grandmother would bake cookies from scratch, always oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip—and she always seemed happiest when we were in her kitchen. My grandfather would take us on his motorcycles and laugh as we watched History channel documentaries about Bigfoot and other silly stuff. 

My grandma didn’t just send birthday cards—she made handmade cards for every single holiday, even obscure ones you don't usually get cards for. She’d write sweet little notes inside just like you’d expect from the perfect grandma. I kept most of them in a box because they felt like little pieces of her.

I adored them. I genuinely looked up to them and wanted to grow up to be like them—kind, thoughtful, involved. They were the people I bragged about having in my life. I loved them so much, and for most of my life, I believed that love was simple, safe, and unquestioned.

But that changed. When I was 11 years old, my family and I flew to visit my mom's side of the family for Christmas. When we got back to the airport in our home state, we realized the battery had died. So we called my uncle who lived nearby and he picked us up. He dropped us off at my grandparents, who agreed to let us stay until we got the car fixed. It was an unexpected visit, but they were hospitable nonetheless. One night, I woke up late in the guest room to hear yelling. My dad got me up and told me to pack up, that we were leaving. I was confused, but I did so anyway. I carried my sleepy 6-year-old sibling in my arms as I walked out the front door just in time to see my grandfather screaming at my dad, calling him stupid in front of me. ""Hey, kids! Tell your stupid dad to get off my property!"" was his exact wording.

I don't really remember how I felt at the time. I was just confused probably. We left. My uncle came and drove us to a car rental place, which my dad had tried to avoid doing. We went home that night and that was that.

There was no explanation for this incident. We just didn't visit them anymore. We didn't talk about it. When my great-grandmother (my paternal grandmother's mom) passed away when I was 12, it hit me really hard, because I loved her dearly. I saw my grandparents at the funeral and avoided them because it felt weird. Even though I had no idea what had happened that night, there was this new air of tension that I couldn't shake. I was too busy grieving my great-grandmother who had just passed. It was the first funeral I'd ever gone to. My grandfather attempted to make amends with my dad at it, but nothing went anywhere. 

I didn't understand until a year later, when I was 13, and my dad sat me down and told me about his childhood. He carefully explained that his parents had verbally and physically abused him his entire childhood. They were cruel to both him and my uncle. Name-calling, religious guilt, ridicule, and outright bullying were among the things they endured. And it was bad. My dad suffered from what I had noticed, but had not realized, were PTSD symptoms my entire life. Even now, in his 50s, my father is sensitive to sudden noises. 

When he had kids, he made a conscious decision to try to rebuild some kind of relationship with his parents—so that we could have grandparents in our lives. But that night, the tension that had been building for over a decade finally broke, and the truth about who they really were came crashing down around us.

Honestly, I was heartbroken, and I still am. It was a strange situation to process. My dad was and still is my best friend. My favorite person in the whole world. He has really broken the cycle of abuse. He's the best father I could ask for and nothing like his parents. Finding out that he had been dealing with things I had no clue about was really confusing and frustrating. I wasn’t angry at him for not telling me sooner—I understood how difficult that choice must have been. From 13 to 14, I had other stuff going on, so I didn't really deal with what I was feeling about that situation. 

But the pain kept coming back when I least expected it. A few months after I found out, my dad and I were on a trip when his brother called to say their father was in the hospital and might be dying. My dad drove us to the hospital, and I stayed in the waiting room while he went to visit. He let me decide if I wanted to go. I said no. I was angry. I still am.

By 15, I started to really understand how much the “grandparent thing” hurt me. When seeing an 18-wheeler with their small town’s name on it made me start crying, it was a clear sign something was wrong. The people I loved and trusted most had betrayed me decades ago—and I had no idea. Every kind thing they did felt tainted. I had been loving people who had abused the most important person in my life. I can’t imagine the pain my dad might've felt hearing me say I wanted to be like them when I grew up.

My dad has genuinely made peace with it and healed in his own way and I am so proud of him. He has reminded me that he is okay, that he has processed the trauma of what happened to him. He doesn't care about his relationship with them. He knows what happened wasn't his fault. But this whole thing has impacted me in a way I didn't expect. I'm still processing the pain of this betrayal. It's a strange situation to find out what a family member did, but what happened didn't directly happen to you. I feel all this anger and betrayal and sadness. I can’t look at photos of me with them or think about their house without imagining my dad as a child—crying, scared, and alone. It taints all those memories, and it hurts a lot. It didn't even happen to me. What sucks is I don't know anyone else who's been through this. How do I move past this anger towards them? I hate that they weren't actually kind people. They were just as terrible as they were all those decades ago. My dad is okay, so why can't I be okay?

Having genuinely good grandparents was something I cherished and now every time I hear my friends or other people talk about their grandparents, I feel the burn of envy. I really wanted to have my grandparents at my graduation, at my wedding, etc. I wanted to have them there because they were important to me. They were in so many of my childhood memories. 

The pain has faded a bit over the years but, now at 18, I’m still processing my anger and trying to forgive them. 

I'm reminded of this because I received the news the other day that my grandfather is very ill and likely going to pass away soon. I feel nothing and I'm not ashamed of feeling nothing about it. I know damn well I'm not attending that funeral. 

I'm grieving the loss of how I used to know my grandparents. How they once were perceived by my child mind. This is whole situation is what I've been working through for the past 8 years. And it's painful. It really weighs on me and has been the source of so much anger and pain. It's hard to put into words really. I hate that I share blood with them. I hate that I'm always tied to them, no matter what. I know I'm not like them and I never will be. To put it plainly, I'm just sad. I don't miss them. I don't want to speak to them or see them ever again.

I've been to therapy and journaled and written unsent letters to them and everything, but it's still here. It didn't even happen to me, but it still hurts. 

So here I am, sharing this because I don’t really know how to process it all on my own. 

I just want to hear people’s thoughts or stories. Sometimes it helps just to know you’re not alone.

Thanks for reading. It really means a lot.",
176,"So I just finished college finals and I really wanted a hearty meal that really fills the stomach. I decided to try to make some soup recipe that I found on tiktok, however, I took a trip to the store and they didn’t have a lot of the ingredients. I tried to make do and then made soup. It was so gross and watery. No flavor and it was bad. I had to toss it. Now I am eating microwave-heated pasta and I wasted 20 bucks. I’m so sad now. I want warm hearty food.

177,"I just need somewhere to talk about this without totally overwhelming my husband

I'm 26 weeks pregnant and my husband and I just lost our jobs. After a very long time of thinking and in his case, praying, about it, we've made the very hard decision to go no contact with his parents. His mother is very narcissistic and there was a recent situation that was just the final straw. The unfortunate thing about this all is that we work for his mom. I know that may sound silly given the circumstances but it worked in it's own way. So unfortunately it also included our jobs.

I'm too far along to get hired anywhere else, and I'm not eligible for maternity leave for another 4 weeks (Canadian/MB standards). I have absolutely no idea what to do. We're in a decent amount of debt (this baby was not at all planned and I was supposed to be infertile, so I will admit we weren't super careful either though) and we physically can't get everything settled before she's here without jobs. I literally don't know what to do. 

I know this was our decision and we chose this by going NC with them, but I was physically making myself sick by being around them. This decision wasn't made even remotely lightly and we didn't make it overnight. This has been in the works for well over a year now but we've finally hit a point where it's not possible to continue being in their lives. His parents had the option to fix the issue that caused this, or to go NC and they chose NC. It's pretty unique so I won't go into detail just in case, but they virtually picked a random ass dude they met through me (their DIL) over their son, his wife (me), and their granddaughter. 

I feel very lost and very scared. ",
178,"Firstly I have no intention of telling her since A. I do my best to be a decent person and friend.
And B. She already has enough relationship troubles from her ex and I don't need to pile on in anyway.

Like I said already, it's a crush, which means it's probably just some surface level silliness that'll burn out in a month especially considering like most of my friends i only get to talk to her online so I can't really know her well.
She's always so fun to talk to and she says stuff I that endears me to her like ""sweetheart"" or ""dearest"" and I know that's just how she talks to her friends but it always makes me feel giddy.
She's also accepting, im not really out anywhere but online spaces but she doesn't mind that I sound so masculine while identifying as a woman.
 I feel lonely sometimes though, all of my friends are in a relationship and that's something I want for me but don't have, so there's some days where I feel a little worse off then others but I know the day will come for me too, I just gotta keep living.",
179,"The irony is, I myself was being bullied at the time and it blinded me to my own actions towards a 'friend'. With hindsight I realise now that I have hurt her deeply, and I regret my actions. Keep in mind everything described bellow happened between the age of 9 to13 (I am now 27)

I'll be using Anne as a fake name for my 'friend' (she loved Anne Shirley when we were kids)

For a bit of context and explanation as to why I keep putting the word 'friend' in quotes : our frienship was forced from the start. I cant recall I time I ever considered her a true friend, someone I was excited to go see. And after all I did, I dont think I could say I was her friend.  
  
Anne and I went to the same, small, private elementary school. She was a year older than me, so not in my class. I met her one day because my best friend had already been picked up by her parents and I was alone for the ''pick up recess''. I saw Anne alone and went up to her to see if I could play with her. We played and we had fun, but that was it really. My mother came to pick me up and I said goodbye thinking that would be it until next time either of us have no friends to play with in the evening. But... Anne's mom came to pick her up soon after. Our moms met and clicked instantly. That was the beginning of everything bad that would come next.   
  
My mother had always been ''worried'' about me because I was an introvert before it became a well known concept. She always pushed for me to make friends, bring friends over and everything but I didnt have that many friends, even less that I would want over. So when she got along with Anne's mom she began insisting, if not forcing contact between us. 

Anne liked me. She also didnt have many friends. She told me people in her class thought she was weird. At first I was nice to her, I thought she was like me, not weird, just misunderstood and I wanted to be nice to her because I knew how it felt to be ''the weird one''. She told me she wasnt being bullied, just that people avoided her.  People were nice to her when she talked to them, it's just that conversations didnt last long and were awkward (As far as I know she is not on the spectrum, my mom asked Anne's mom but was told Anne isn't neurodivergent)

Over time it became apparent that we were VERY different. I already struggled to click with her, but at one point, our differences became irritating to me. And the forced proximity because of our moms didn't help. I still cant excatly figure out why her personality was so grating to me... I guess it was jealousy mixed with disdain? I dont know if there is a name for such an emotion...

To explain something about Anne, not as a justification, just to explain my thought process : Anne was a mama's girl on steroids. Her mom coddled her a bit too much. My mom and I often had discussions about how it will negatively impact Anne's future if her mom over protects her from every single thing. Despite her being older than me, it was as if she was far behind her age in terms of mental fortitude. She had lived a pieceful life, her mom always watching, ready to protect her from the sligthest thing, so she never learned to deal with the harsh reality of life. It annoyed me how naive she was.

And I guess I was simultaneously jealous of that naivity. On my side of things, I was being actively bullied in the most typical sense of the way for girls around 10yo. A mean girl surrounded by 2 lackeys throwing insidious questions/remarks with clear hurtful undertones, hidding/stealing/destroying my stuff, pointing out my mistakes for others to join in the mockery. The classics. My mom was also very abusive at home (verbally) and I didnt feel like she was my guardian or protector. So in retrospect, I think I was just envious that Anne lived life in a rainbow and sunshine bubble.

It manifested in my actions. I didnt want to spend time with her, but I was forced into her house, often stuck there for whole days on the weekend. While my mother was getting ''free therapy'' with Anne's mom who listened to all her woes in a private room, I was stuck trying to find things Anne and I both enjoyed doing, and believe me there wasn't much. I was bored out of my mind, forced into her rainbow and sunshine fantasies make belief games, and i grew frustrated.   
  
It started with me making comments about my boredom, adding my poisoned mind into her fantasies with violence and sad things to ''spice things up''. I purposefully exposed her to the harsh reality her mom hid from her. I told her about the bad things that some people did (murder, violence, addictions, human trafficking). I told her about bullying, like the one I was experiencing, I told her not all moms are nice and protect their kids, I told her people lie, people steal, people arent friends by default. At the time, I felt like I was pulling the wool from over her eyes, but in truth, I was just scaring her. And I enjoyed it. Not her fear, I wasnt realising that back then. I just felt satisfaction in exposing the world of pain to her. I felt like I was preparing her for the reality, that I was saving her from the the overprotection of her mother. I was annoyed by her rosy attitude so I tried tainting it... I was like a dark cloud in her life. 

I dont know when or how our 'friendship' ended, it's all vague, but I think at one point I made her cry, and she talked to her mom who scolded me harshly. I did deserve it, but she did go a bit far calling me a bad influence and that I will be a failure if I keep going down my path (whatever that meant). I wasnt a rebelious kid, far from it. I obeyed my mom's every command out of fear, I was studious, quiet, polite, people pleasing to a fault... It trully felt like I was being accused of being much much worse than I was and it hurt. I knew it was wrong what I did to Anne, but calling me names and implying I was going to end up as a thug was a bit far... but I dont know... Maybe I deserved it.

Anyway. My mom didnt condone my actions but also felt Anne's mom went a bit far. She stayed friend with her. I guess either Anne's mom didn't want me over anymore, or my mom just decided to stop forcing me, but my ''playdates'' with Anne were over. With only low contact in school because classes didn't interact much, I was able to maintain a friendlier disposition toward her and our interractions were more neutral-positive than negative.

I ended up in the same highschool a year after her and while we didn't become best friends, she was an anchor for me in a new setting. But things went south when I was approached by another girl. When Anne warned me about this girl, I wasn't exactly sure what to believe. Given how harshly I was judged by Anne's mom, I didnt trust Anne's words when she said that girl was a bully, especially since said girl was nice to me. I tend to trust what I see, not just judge people by what others say about them. I didnt turn my back on Anne, but I also didn't see any reason to ignore that girl. I was never 'friends' with her mind you, we just talked casually when we crossed paths.

So one day after school during dad's custody time (love my dad) Anne's mom came knocking on our door. She started yelling at me to never speak to that girl again, that she had hurt Anne the year prior, that I was already corrupted by her lies and would end up just like her, yadda yadda. She then looked at my dad and told me to go away, they needed to talk about this issue. I went to another room and cried, not understanding what I did wrong to deserve such a yelling and I was scared my dad was going to be mad or disapointed in me for ''being acquaintance with a bully'' (he wasnt btw)

That was the end of my relationship with Anne. I avoided her like the plague after that. The year after, the ''bully girl'' (I still do not know if she was a legit bully or a percieved bully) changed schools because she moved in the summer. So Anne was 'safe'. I wasnt mean to her, I didn't ignore her, I talked to her casually when we crossed paths, but aside from that, I wouldn't initiate anything with her. If I wasn't in a rush and she didn't saw me, I would take another path just to avoid meeting her.

After all that... I do feel guilty. I know I hurt her personnaly, and if the girl really was a bully, I probably participated in hurting Anne without knowing. She didn't deserve my animosity as kids. She didn't deserve my ''reality checks''. She didn't deserve to be hurt in her own home by someone she trusted and though of as a friend.  
  
I'm very sorry 'Anne'.

180,"I really don't know what to say, this literally happened less than an hour ago. I may need advice.... probably an additional therapist. 

For context, no, we are not friends with benefits or anything else. Like that. (No judgement if u like that sort of thing.) So, in Canada, after group homes that stop at 18, people like me (Crown wards) are put in these transition homes. That way we aren't just tossed out on the street. I am a high-functioning autistic individual and have never been in this situation, and could use any advice. Though this is more because I need to vent than anything. For me, this is temporary; I just graduated from college and got into university. Others like, I'll call him that guy because I can't think of a name right now, and I respect privacy, but that guy is a 46-year-old man with Down syndrome who, unlike me, probably doesn't have a chance of living on his own one day, no judgment. It's just how it is for some people. We were having a Final Destination movie marathon as the new one, Final Destination: Bloodline, Is coming out in two days, we got to the point in the second one where the biker girl takes off her top revealing her breasts and coincidentally I got up to grab a soda, when I look at my roommate who quickly jerked his hand away from inside his pants trying to play it cool. I froze and kinda just sat back down, stunned for a minute, wishing that I was the guy burning alive in the movie. After a moment, I said dude, you can't be masturbating, That guy said, I wasn't and I gave him a funny look because he said Besides, I thought you were gonna be watching the movie. I kinda just told him it was unacceptable and to go do it in his room, as I took my cat and went in mine. Now I feel bad, because I didn't want to shame him, and I texted some staff who were off duty, but I have no one else to tell. I don't want to tell someone who will start rumors, and my other friend was busy. So I'm telling Reddit readers on the internet. 

I have no clue how to go about this or anything, so I'm gonna read the Bedlam Bride, which I bought yesterday as it just came out, and try not to think about this. I'd ask my cat for help, but he isn't in the mood.

181,"Hey guys, I just needed to get this off my chest quickly, because I dont know how to feel about it: 
In advance, please be aware that it's going to be a long text. 

My ex-girlfriend of 1½ years, which I loved very much, (untill I realised she becomes more and more violent) started obsessing over her ""not archieving anything at all and is not like her peers"" . She told anyone of her very ambitious plan: She wanted to attend night school to complete her Abitur (the German equivalent of a high school diploma), while simultaneously starting a vocational training program as a lawyers-aid that required attendance at a Berufsschule. Which not only means that she has to learn for the vocational training but at the same time for the highschool diploma (which is a lot harder than the american one. Just to give some context, it's like including the first year of collge in your highschool). Both programs demanded in-person attendance, making it incredibly challenging to manage (physicly and mentally). I told her it was too much to handle at once and that she might should look at what anyone else is doing (working, or doing a vocational training where you can finish faster, or take a break, whenever it is needed.) A fact which might be of importance: We are in a class full of disabled people, who weren't able to finish highschool. Some of us had a severe accident in the last year of highschool (like me), or were not able to go to school, due to mental disorders.

Back to the mainstory:
She insisted she could manage it and just enrolled for her training without telling me. This was the time I have realised her tendencies to throw stuff at me and trying to hit me. So I broke up with her (2 years ago). At first everything seemed completly fine, but soon (after a few weeks) the cracks began to show.  She started missing classes and exams, and was completly overwhelmed with exhaustion. Eventually this year, her performance began to decline in both programs. She used to be an A+ student and now is just hanging by a threat to keep up the grades to keep her in class. Last semester she ended up with poor grades, and is going to jeopardize her future academic and career prospects. If she fails her vocational training she doesn't get any grants from the state any more, but if she fails her Abitur, she isn't even able to become a lawyer.

The Abitur isn't over yet, but it's clear to everyone that she's on a path that's harming her future.
It's painful to watch someone you cared about, making choices that will completly ruin their life. I genuinely wanted the best for her and tried to offer realistic advice. So did everyone of her family, friends and people she knows...

It's just crazy to me, that someone as intelligent as her is hell-bent on self-destruction with these decisions... 
I dont even know how to feel about it, but it's like a car crash, you can't really look away.

Tldr: She didn't listen to everyone and is ruining her life",
182,"For some context: I’m 16 years old and still in school. I don’t have many friends,just around two or three. But I’m grateful to have people I can spend time with and enjoy myself around. I get made fun of at school, but honestly, that’s not my biggest concern right now.

Lately, I’ve started noticing some strange patterns in my life. It feels like karma hits me right after I do something wrong, or that my days are just getting weirder and more surreal. Last night, I think I was hallucinating. I kept hearing the beeping of a heart monitor and the Flatline sound that plays when a heartbeat stops. Keep in mind, I don’t live near or work in a hospital, or anywhere those sounds would normally be heard. It made me wonder if the universe is trying to tell me something like maybe I’m going to die soon.

I also can’t shake the feeling that people are plotting against me. I swear my old friends from last year turned on me for no reason, maybe to fit in with others, or maybe I did something wrong and just don’t realize it. Sometimes I think I’m just a terrible person who isn’t self-aware.

I’m not sure if this matters, but I don’t really feel connected to the world around me. It’s like I’m dreaming, but I know I’m awake. I feel like I have some control, but things still don’t feel real. Even with my current friends, I don’t feel much of a connection, it’s like they’re just there to do “friend” things, but there’s no real emotional bond.

Maybe I’m overreacting, but everything feels off. Sorry if this doesn’t make much sense or feels incomplete. I’m having a hard time focusing right now.

I have 2 online friends i met a little more than a year ago. we’re all about the same age (17-18) give or take a few months difference. they both cut, in the self harm way not the diet way. we are all pretty depressed but i’ve never had the urge to self harm and i don’t quite understand why someone would do it. but it makes me wary (probably because i don’t understand). all three of us have a somewhat tight knit relationship with each other, but i idont know if i want to continue it because they cut. one of them said new scars so it must’ve been recent. not sure about the others but it seems like they’re both not stopping for a while. 

i’m generally really really bad at consoling people and giving mental health advice too… so i’m of no use there. i really do not know how to approach this topic while still having sympathy. id feel bad about ghosting them after being friends for over a year. we met cause we like the same things and decided to make a gc for it. i just dont know 😕

i feel selfish for thinking about how it makes me uncomfortable when they’re obviously the people who need more help. i dont know. i know people cope in different ways but i truly don’t understand this. maybe i know nothing at all. thanks for listening to my yap.",

Guess how I learned how to read. Seriously, take a stab at it. 

20 years ago I would’ve been 6. So since memory lane is calling. You’re welcome to come along for a rough unveiling of a pivotal piece of my personal lore. 

Can count on one hand the amount of people that know. Writing it here, unpolished, but in the name of self expression and.. remembering kid me. 

So.. come on back to when my excentric dad decided it was time to finally really teach me. 

I was excited at first. Was trying to learn on my own a bit. He got a set of mcguffeys reading books and “lessons” began soon after. 

(Yep. It’s exactly what comes up when you google them lmao idk man) 

These reading sessions comprised of me, trying my best, and getting punished when I’d mess up, get tired, or want to stop. These weren’t short sessions with complementary snack breaks. 

Punishment consisted of: beatings using various items- on bare skin or clothed. Forced to lay face down on the bed or floor for 30 mins to an hour+. Standing in the corner of the room with my tongue against the wall, or a sentencing to all of the above. 

Oh, and better not cry either or there’d be more. 

My mom tried to stop it some, but whatever, doesn’t matter now, and probably never did at this point. 

I vividly remember stumbling into the kitchen after a terrible lesson, came up next to her as she was baking, and read the words “chocolate chip cookies” typed out on her recipe book. 

The words were so blurry through my tears, but for a second it all turned from sour to sweet. 

It sank in that I was doing it. Me. Fighting through pain, unfairness, fear, but learning despite all of it. Overall life theme I suppose lol 

This experience has always stuck with me. Even now when reading something, sometimes I slip back into kid me for a second.  It’s like falling into a past life, but nope. 

The eyes that cried out of frustration and was punished for it at 6, are the same ones reading what’s being typed out now. 

Eventually I read through every book in that set, then whatever else he gave me. Not sure how long the whole process took for me to be considered literate, but the point is, I did it. 

6 year old me won that battle, and inspires me every day. All the versions of me after, got the chance to escape the world through a book, because of that kid not giving up. Anytime that little persevering reading warrior pops up in my head I send so much love, thanks, and a massive hug.

Anyways, to wrap it up, here’s a question for you. 

What experiences did little you get through that you should maybe thank them for today? ",
186,"I’m an engineering student. I worked hard. I kept my grades up. I followed all the advice, made projects, volunteered, applied early, tailored every resume, wrote cover letters, reached out to people.

And still nothing.

Summer’s here and I’m watching everyone else move forward while I’m stuck with nothing to show for all that effort. It feels like I failed. Like none of it mattered.

I know the job market sucks. I know rejection is part of the process. But right now it just feels pointless.

I’m not even sure what to do next. It’s exhausting to keep trying when you feel like no one gives a damn.

If anyone else has been through this, how did you deal with it? Because right now, I just feel completely lost.",
187,"why do i even try? I try to achieve things and be good at things, ive been trying to learn to paint since i was a child, ive put so many hours into the fundamentals and learning all this stuff and still im no good at all.

life is such a pointless thing.",
188,"I (27F) have been married to my husband (27M) for 2.5 years and together for 7.5 years. We have one child (2F) together. I think that I’ve fallen out of love with my husband. We’ve tried date nights and activities together and everything, but we just feel like roommates anymore. I am bored. I do love him, I just don’t feel as though I am in love with him anymore, and it makes me sad. ",
189,"When I was around 6 years old, I went to my home country and met my aunt’s mother. I innocently commented that she had small feet — just a typical kid thing. Somehow that turned into a huge deal. My aunt apparently took it personally and refused to talk to me, my father, or anyone close to us for the next **seven years**. No one explained why — we were just shut out like we didn’t matter.

When I turned 13, she suddenly started talking to me again without ever addressing what happened. No apology, no accountability, just fake friendliness like nothing had happened. But even now, her actions show that she hasn’t changed.

She clearly favors her brother’s kids and her in-laws' kids. One time, she bought her nephew a **$3,000 Xbox**. Meanwhile, she gave my cousin a **$5 bouncy ball**. Over the years, she’s never acknowledged my birthday — not once. Not even a small gesture.

More recently, she’s started giving me her **old used clothes**, while still giving expensive gifts to others. I don’t care about getting something fancy, but it stung. She could have bought something small and thoughtful, like a notebook or even asked someone what I liked. It’s not about the money — it’s the fact that she clearly doesn’t see me as worth the effort. And it’s not like she’s struggling — she walks around with a **Louis Vuitton bag**, has expensive jewelry, and makes a high income.

What really hit hard was when her **father** (my relative) was bragging about how much money she makes — going on about how successful she is and how proud he is of her. It just made everything worse. It reminded me that she’s *choosing* to be this way. She *can* afford kindness. She just withholds it from me and my family.

What makes this all worse is that when her son was born, **my mom sent her seven brand new baby outfits and $50** as a kind gesture. We’ve always treated her well, even when she ignored us.

At this point, I’m just tired. I feel rejected, humiliated, and honestly just confused about what I ever did wrong. I don’t know how to move forward or how to stop letting it get to me.

Any advice on how to emotionally handle this kind of dynamic or set boundaries with someone who clearly plays favorites?

edit; What really hurts is that when her husband went to Pakistan *after* March, she gave me her old, used clothes. But at the same time, she gave her sister-in-law, nieces, and nephews *really* expensive clothes. She’s not someone who usually buys cheap things, so it feels like she deliberately treats me differently. It’s humiliating and makes me feel like I’m less important to her than the rest of the family.

",
190,"I’m just miserable at my current job. I’ve been trying to get out for months, but i’ll admit I haven’t been applying to jobs as much as I probably should be. I haven’t really had the motivation or drive to apply, apply, and apply to jobs, especially when my current day job takes so much energy from me, and when this current job market is just trash. I barely hear back from anyone, and if I do, it’s just another rejection.

Things are starting to feel extremely bleak for me.. I really want to quit my job, and it sucks because while I do have the financial safety net to do so, I’m still scared of the repercussions it could mean for me. I’m scared that future employers won’t want to hire me because being unemployed is a bad look. I’m also worried about having a potentially long gap between jobs, because I don’t really know how long the job search could take me.

I don’t want to leave without something else lined up, but I don’t know how long it’s going to take me to find something in this current market, and at the same time I’m losing my fucking mind at my current workplace. I don’t know how much longer I can even hold on here tbh. And even if I do get a call back from a potential employer, they always want to meet during business hours of course, which can be impossible for me when i already work full time 9-5. So even though it may be easier to job search and attend interviews while unemployed because id have more free time, being unemployed also hurts my chances of getting hired at the same time. lol.

I just feel so stuck as if theres no way out of here. I majored in graphic design and I’m kind of regretting it since the field is extremely competitive. Yet, at the same time, it’s the only job I could see myself doing. Why the fuck did the only thing that interests me have to be so damn competitive? I literally feel so depressed and it makes no sense.. everyone needs a job to live, it shouldn’t be this hard to find something decent 🥲",
191,"I'm not a religious person, I even think myself as an atheist. I was raised Catholic but since I have been ghosted many times the last few years, deceived, ignored and rejected, perhaps it is a calling from the ""universe""? Or God? Being not reciprocated is okay although painful at least a few times or so, but in my personal life this fenomenom occurs more frequently than the normal average thing. I know I'm not the only one in the world of course but sometimes I seriously thinking I should turn into a young priest, monk, frail, brother or something similar far away from temptations in my early thirties and get used to that lifestyle and the idea of a espiritual daily life in a convent etc. Men are awful (I'm generalizing but in my experience they are) It is hard finding the right one and I have tried several (many) times than I would like to with different types and none of them results even in a very first meeting. Most of them don't pass from the online ""chatting"" and the other few that was made, don't have any further advancement and I'm very much aware I didn't do anything wrong to fail with no reason. I'm aware many of them don't want serious relationships and the ones we like they don't like us and viceversa. I get it but in my life this pattern is like 99% of the time and those that almost seems like we like each other's, don't work out at the end for some random reasons (the universe or destiny? Don't even give me the chance to reach an insignificant first freaking meeting, due to random cancellations or whatever from the other part, not mine) I try to understand and bring patient but neither of those has any good used to me so far. I'm sad and depressed and as an introverted, loneliness also hurts sometimes. I must add I'm gay and that makes it way more harder but at this point I'm just hopeless and shouldn't expect too much from them, neither life. Some disappear, others are cowards or just lack of politeness to say no (I would understand if they do) like string someone's along and then left (a very low thing to do) anyways. That just makes me feel deeply sad. Conclusion: I'm not made it for love and don't really want to reach and old age to ""enjoy"" the real love. Don't talk to me about waiting since that's precisely what I have done my whole life. I'm tired. ",

193,"ETA: I posted it and went off to work, I didn't think people would respond to this. Thank you so much for all the replies, even the harsh ones. My husband does a lot for me and I love him. I'll make sure to apologize and try to do better.

Answering some repeated questions:

1) Thinking hard, I did realize I'm lacking on doing things for him as he does for me. At the moment I'm just trying to support him in his dream. My husband is a game designer, but he's self-employed, so he works from home. He's been trying to make a game since we finished college and I've been doing my best to support him through it and support us both financially. He's not making any money right now, but I'm sure he will. Either way, I know this is just one thing and I can do more.

2) I don't drag him to any place with me when I go out. I ask him if he wants to go and if he doesn't I'll come by myself. Sometimes he also leaves early if he's feeling tired and a friend will drop me off at home when the outing is over.

3) The only reason I asked him to take me is because I know he'll be free that day and I wanted to spend some time with him before I go. I've been working most weekends lately on a second job, so we don't really have much time together. Hopefully we can make up for it on my vacation. He's usually free most days of the week unless he has an appointment, which doesn't happen very often. I offered to drive half the round trip, but he said he doesn't like me driving on the highway. He also likes to have the car, so he takes me to work and brings me home. 

We'll be talking today and I'll work hard to be a better wife. Thank you all again for your advice ❤️‍🩹

A part of me is telling me I'm exaggerating. Another part of telling me I'm too bold to think I'm worth the things I want. Yet another is calling me selfish and ungrateful. 

My husband is a very kind person. We've been together fifteen years, half of our lives. Married for seven. Sometimes I say how lucky we were to have found each other so young. We've learned to solve our differences and to accommodate each other, to compromise. My husband is not a very social person and I feel like I try my best to make him comfortable whenever I can when we have friends over or go to family gatherings. He's particular about food too, so we've adjusted to make sure our diets are the best we can manage and even sometimes we have separate, different meals. He doesn't like to celebrate his birthday (unlike me, who love it) but I always try to give him a special present and a special day. This year I was able to afford him a present he's been mentioning for months and he was so happy when he found out. He's been using it nonstop for months and thanking me over and over and I feel so much joy from it. 

He's very caring, very affectionate and he always listens, no matter what. He takes me to and from work, even as he's working from home these days. He takes my sister to doctor's appointments when my mom can't. He takes care of some of the house chores so all the workload isn't on me. He takes his parents and his brother to the doctor, the dentist, to go shopping, anywhere they need. He does so many small things to show his love.

But he also does things that sometimes make me feel like I don't matter to him. I'm not important. Sometimes asking him for a favor is difficult if he feels like it's too complicated. And yesterday it broke something inside of me. Like when a realization breaks a thread in a web and suddenly it breaks more and more threads. 

And even when I know he just said it in the heat of the moment, even when he's already apologized, I just feel numb. I feel like I don't want this anymore. It's not that I think I deserve better, but I think I don't deserve this either. 

I've been planning a trip to Europe for about a year and I'm supposed to leave in June, during my vacation. I've made a girlfriend online five years ago and she's one of my best friends and we have the means to finally meet in person, so I'll be coming to visit her for two weeks. We live oceans apart and I'm thrilled to be finally going out of the country to do something fun. I didn't even have a passport until we started preparing. We've been talking about it all the time for the last year. My friends know, my family knows, even some of my coworkers, who have given me travel tips plenty. 

When my friend and I decided to meet, I asked my husband if he wanted to come along. He said it's already expensive enough for one person (it is, but) and that maybe next time he can afford to come with me somewhere nice for vacation. I said it was a deal. I'll be staying there for 14 days and then I'll be back to spend the other 16 days of my vacation back home with him. 

I've taken care of everything. I've saved money like crazy, took a loan and I'm about just ready to get on a plane, safe for some small details. Yesterday, I brought up how early we'd have to leave if we wanted to be at the airport in time. A while ago I had asked if he could take me to the airport. It's a 2h30~3h car trip, because the airport is in another city and it's the closest I could find for my destination. We have an airport in our city, but not for international trips. He said he would take me. But yesterday his response was, “God, driving for six hours straight… My knees are not going to take it well.” I know his knees act up from time to time. I was a bit taken aback with this change of plans, but I told him I could look up how much was an uber and also try for a bus trip. The uber was immediately out of the question the moment I looked. Impossibly expensive. I asked a coworker about the bus and he said it's a good idea and the arrival is very close to the airport. At night as we drove home, I told my husband about my findings and that I was going to look into bus tickets. He seemed pleased and said he would take me to the bus stop on the day. 

I asked him if he could come along on the bus trip with me because I don't want to be alone for hours in the airport with three suitcases until departure. A bus trip is a little longer, around 3h30. He then said that if it's going to take this long and be this much work, we might as well just go by car. I felt confused, because I thought it wouldn't be good for his knees and I told him so right away. He said he could just rest between the trips for a bit and it should be fine.

Then I realized it. He didn't really care about his knees. He didn't even care that I was going to be alone until I mentioned it. He just didn't want to have all that work, either by car or bus. 

I told him bus would be better, I didn't want him to be hurt and I really didn't want to be alone before my 19h trip. He turned to me and said, “You never think about me, do you? Why do you have to make a trip that doesn't use our city airport? Look at what I'm going to have to do to send you off.”

I felt so stunned, everything went numb. All I managed to say is that he didn't have to do anything at all, before I got out of the car and into our home. I think he immediately realized what he had said because he came after me saying he's sorry and that he doesn't want to fight about it and he doesn't want to ruin my trip. But I didn't even have words to say at the moment. Everything inside of me wilted. 

He repeated the words again, but I couldn't respond, I was holding back tears by then. 

It's too much work to keep me company and send me off. I'll be away for 14 days, but it doesn't matter. The hurt part inside of me is sure he won't even call while I'm there. 

I know he didn't mean it to come out like that, because he apologized right away and I'm not mad at him because I believe he truly is sorry. But I just… something broke. I don't want him to take me anymore. Not even to the bus stop. 

I know my husband has severe depression. He's been in treatment, taking meds and in therapy for many years. I know sometimes just living is hard for him. But I thought he would want to at least spend a little more time with me before I went away. I didn't think it was too much to ask, I didn't think it would be this bothersome ordeal and that he felt obligated. It never even occurred to me. 

I've noticed he's been trying to show he's open to talk if I want to, but I don't even know what I could say. I'm just so hurt. And then he's going to feel bad and he'll want to take me, but now I don't want him to. I'm now here thinking if everything he does for me is because he feels like he has to. 

I know we'll have to talk, at some point. I know he regrets what he said. But he thought those words. He felt those things. 

And right now I'm wondering what our entire life together has been for. Right now I'm here wishing he was this horrible husband, so leaving would feel easy. I almost wish we hadn't happened and I know it's just because I'm still hurt and that it'll pass and everything will be okay once we work things out, like we always do.

But right now I'm just numb and I can't bring myself to tell this to anyone, so. I just wanted it out of my chest.

194,"This is my first time post so please don’t hate me but I need to get this out into the world.

(Trigger warning: miscarriage)

Some brief backstory; I have a two year old and my husband and I have been trying for a second kid since September of 2024. My husband is in a family of 3 boys is 1 girl. And the girl has always been the favorite as he was told his whole life that they’ve always wanted a girl…… whole other story there 🙄
Back in October I had a miscarriage at 7 weeks. It was hard but it was early and I didn’t feel much hurt at the time. But now I’m torn apart. My husbands sister is due with a girl and her due date is within 2 weeks of what mine would’ve been. And then his brothers wife is due is August with a girl….
I know it was early and strangely enough, I’m hurting more now than I was at the beginning. I had a picture of what our life would be like with cousins so close in age and it all was wiped away and it’s so hard to keep it together.
I was invited to help host his sisters baby shower and of course I obliged. But now I’m freaking out…. My mental health has been on decline for other external reasons and now the shower is this weekend. I like my in laws but I just haven’t stopped crying over the last few days over my bull shit I’ve got going on and then this…. I told them I’ve been sick and I can’t make it. But I mean I’m truly unwell and I feel like I would just cry the whole weekend. I’ve been crying non stop for the last couple days and I just don’t feel myself…. I told them I wasn’t coming due to me being sick without giving any details and I don’t feel regret. It was going to be a LOT of ppl at this shower and I just feel like me and my 2 yr old would’ve have a hard time. Trying to host ANYTHING with a 2 yr old is impossible 🤦‍♀️ at the same time I feel horrible… I committed to something and now I’m backing out. I hate being flaky but lately I just haven’t been able to get hold of my emotions. But maybe I just don’t give a fuck 🙃",
195,"tw: depressing af maybe?

Throwaway because ofc.

I wanna start by saying i understand you all have your own shit, and cant do magic, but im asking genuinely, wtf are you for??

Ive been to several psychologists for many years, none lasting more than a few sessions cause they all made me feel worse.  
Theres no way, i, as a patient tell you i wanna kill myself and you go ""ok, go for a walk <3"" (ive had 6 diffrent ones, all told me a variation of that, diffrent therapies too)

Ive learned more from tiktok about coping mechanisms, panic attack solutions, autistic meltdown cpoing and how to avoid, adhd hacks that EVER from a therapists. They just tell me no youre not anything without knowing me, even though i know myself, and i tell them it helps, and theyre like, ""Nah""

Today i confided on a friend of a friend, a psych that works with others, to ask what the hell should i do, i keep wasting money on all these therapies (money i dont have mind you) and i just feel worse, more hopeless, more misunderstood, and violated after exposing all my deepest traumas for them to be like ""awww, thats tough""

I was denied emdr (i paid them and they denied me) I was denied help at a specific centre for panic attacks and autism cause i told them i MIGHT suspect adhd)

Im so angry and so desperate. I really wanted her to be of some help, tell me where to go, what to do, who to talk to. SHE ASKED FOR MY FUCKING BIRTH CHART ""maybe theres something there"" Fuuuuuuuuck you.

I brought up to many therapists that i think i might be autistic, Audhd specifically, maybe bipolar? Cptsd probably too, SOMETHING. I know theres something wrong, and theyre all like ""well you seem very able to tell me what your problems are, so i think you're just depressed, money please "" Is that the only thing yall are trained on?? Bam, youre depressed, ok bye!!!

SEriously what the fuck am i supposed to do. Im sorry this is so ranty, and theres a buuunch of other factors, but this is the gist. And i had a really good day today, A reallly good fucking day. All to come crushing down when i asked for help and again, didnt get shit. Itrs genuinely traumatizing.

At this point i just want meds. Let me check out, let me sleep. I love alcohol for this reason, but thats not healthy (not that meds are either)

Friend of friend did help in the way that shes gonna get me hooked up with a psilocybin microdose. So that is something at least

(also im not depressed, im having a very NORMAL reaction to the world we're living in and where its headed to, theres no cure for that)",
196,"It wasn’t the loud fights that broke me. It was the quiet detachment—the way they started pulling away without ever saying it out loud. The way their ""good morning"" texts stopped coming, and when I asked if something was wrong, they said, ""Just tired.""  
They were always tired.

I think the worst part of heartbreak is not the end. It’s the in-between. The slow fade. The moments when you're still holding on, even after they’ve already let go.

They told me they loved me in so many little ways—sending songs, remembering small things I said in passing, calling me their safe space. And I let those crumbs convince me it was a full meal.

But then came the coldness. The excuses. The delayed replies. The way they looked at their phone when I was talking, like they were somewhere else entirely. Until one day, they just stopped pretending.

No big fight. No final closure. Just silence. A vanishing act.

And here I am, sitting with memories that feel heavier than they should, wondering if any of it meant anything. I want to believe they cared. I really do. But if they did, why did they leave so quietly? Why did I have to grieve someone who’s still alive, just choosing to live in a world I’m no longer part of?

I don’t want them back. I just want to stop feeling like I wasn’t enough to stay for.

That’s all.",

198,"I have suffered from MDD all my life, and recently got diagnosed with ADD (relevant to the story), when I got into university, the dorms were far away from my family & friends. I also have severe social anxiety so I didn't know or how to make friends and was all alone for all of my university days and also my depression skyrocketed to the point where I OD'd on a bottle of my depression pills. Ofc, the ambulance was called and I was transferred to the hospital for a few days. the dorms in my uni threatened to kick me out because i was a ""liability"" and they ""couldn't take care of me"". My mother begged them for me to stay and told them i didn't try to attempt & it was all a misunderstanding. The university didn't care, they made me bring my only friend at uni to sign a paper where she takes full guardianship at the hostel of me (btw shes 19 too). My depression got even WORSE than that and i wasn't diagnosed with ADD at the time yet so I just procrastinated and got depressed in silence and made all of my grades drop. I told my mother just now about everything. She looked at me dead in the eyes and told me ""It's not my life, you're the one who's ruining it"" to me just now and i want to cry forever.

199,"My estranged brother is a drug addict. I haven't talked to him in over 6 years. I tried to help him and he basically spat in my face and gave me a black eye for my trouble. Our other brother and my dad are still in contact with him and so are a few other relatives, but in my mind he doesn't exist and I don't care if it makes me a bad sister. My dad called me a few days ago and he told me my brother is still addicted (surprise) and might lose a limb because of it. He told me there is something in the drugs that causes infections and some people lose their arm or their leg. Apparently whatever is polluting the drug supply started in America and has now made it's way over here. My dad was mad I didn't know anything about the polluted drug supply but why would I know? I don't use drugs. The most mind-boggling part of this is that despite my brother knowing he is close to losing his arm he keeps injecting drugs into it. My dad got mad when I told him I don't care and I don't want to hear about it. He told my other brother about it, and now they are both mad. I don't even care if that makes me a bad sister. I'm not helping or changing my mind. I don't care if anyone says I'm selfish.

200,"Only told one mate about this which was on the day, never thought about it until it came up on the gc memories randomly yesterday.

I was on my way home around 2am from the uni library to get ahead of some assignments, had to take the backroads because of roadworks on the A45.

Saw a guy in the middle of the road laying on the floor, stopped in the middle and blocked the lane to make sure no one ran him over (my car was a classic so as bad as it sounds at the back of my mind I was worried it would've been damaged by an oncoming car since I spent 3 years restoring it 💀).

He looked like he had a large cut in the middle of his scalp, and from that there was a hell of a lot of blood covering his face. He also smelled of alcohol which is probably how this happened. I tried to help him in the best way possible to stop the bleeding and carried him to the side of the road where there was a bus stop I could seat him at.

During this time though about 3 cars slowly drove by, knowing they could see me asking for help they all still drove by which is kinda hilarious how they still decided to slow down and observe 😂

I called up the local hospital and explained his condition and to send an ambulance immediately - their response is still funny to me: ""I'm sorry but without his consent we can't do that sir"" MY GUY HE'S DRUNK AND HAS A CONCUSSION TF DO YOU MEAN CONSENT

So I called up the rozzers, thankfully they came along, called an ambulance and the whole thing was sorted in about 20 minutes from there. I never got the guys name but I remember just having a normal convo with him to try and keep him away about the last thing he remembers and funnily enough my uni life since he wanted to know.

Also good timing was my MOT on the car expired 2 days before this day but I was so preoccupied with uni that I forgot, thankfully the police let me off with it and said sort the next day, I'm free to drive home.

Only reason I'm writing this is not because I want recognition, I just really hope he's alive and has some family/friends to help him recover.",
201,"Yesterday I had a headache and did not want to have sex with her. I told her multiple times and she still touched me and jumped on me, because she was so horny.

AIO? :(",
202,"Hi, nice to meet you! I’m Alana, and as the title says—yes, I kissed my friend while having a boyfriend. Here's the full story:

I'm 17 and go to a public school that accepts people of all ages (even over 50). I’ve been there for two years now (including 2025). Last year, I had no issues, but this year, I met a really pretty girl—let's call her Mari (fake name). She's sweet, treats everyone well, and is the kind of friend everyone wishes they had. She's truly a great person.

The thing is, Mari and Samuel (also a fake name—the guy I kissed) have been friends for about six years. At first, I only talked to Mari, but I'd see Samuel from afar and thought he was cute, although I didn't like him (because I have a boyfriend). Around three weeks after classes started (I began in February, the second week), I started talking to him. My other friend, Diana (fake name), told me she liked him, so out of friendship, I lost interest to the point of even finding him unattractive. But I kept talking to him.

Samuel touched Diana's butt and breasts, I also saw him flirt with other girls in front of me and Diana, but she either didn't care or pretended not to. I'm not sure what happened between them, but they stopped flirting. Samuel once told me Diana was ""too intense"" and it stressed him out, which I understood, but I stayed out of it since it wasn't my business.

After that, he started paying attention to me. I talk about my boyfriend to everyone, and Samuel was no exception—I’d tell him about my relationship problems, sweet things my boyfriend did for me, etc. Every time I mentioned an issue, he’d say things like, ""My sweet girl, I’d never treat you like that. As your friend, I’d treat you so much better."" It made me uncomfortable, but I brushed it off.

It wasn’t until yesterday that I finally opened my eyes and realized he’d been trying to flirt with me this whole time—and I had no idea. Over the past few months, he became really intense, so I started distancing myself.

Three weeks ago, I had a big fight with my boyfriend, and we decided to take a break. I told Samuel about it, thinking nothing of it.

Then, on Tuesday, May 13, 2025, I arrived at school at 7 AM and went to my classroom. I saw Samuel standing by the door of the next class and greeted him. When I noticed my teacher hadn’t arrived yet, I told him I was going to the cafeteria tables to finish some homework. He said he’d join me, so we went together.

We were talking normally until I saw my teacher enter the classroom. I said, ""Samu, I’m heading back—the teacher’s here."" He replied, ""Okay, give me a hug first."" I never refuse hugs—I love hugging people—so I did. But then he started kissing my cheek. I grabbed his shoulders, looked at him, and suddenly, he pulled me into a passionate kiss (to put it nicely). I don’t know why, but I froze (the kiss lasted less than 10 seconds).

Then, I snapped out of it, pushed him away, and leaned against his shoulder, saying, ""No, this isn’t okay. You know I’m going through a tough situation right now. I don’t want anything with you—or anyone. I’m still waiting for my boyfriend.""

He had the nerve to say, ""Oh, sweetheart, you know you want me. Stop hiding it."" I got angry and repeated that I didn’t want anything, then said, ""Goodbye,"" and left for class.

I told my friends what happened, and they said things like, ""Samuel’s been trying to get with you for a while—you just never noticed."" That’s when it all clicked. I avoided him all day (I’ll add evidence in the comments). He apparently felt bad, but I didn’t care. After ignoring him, I went home.

That whole day, I had a terrible migraine from stress, felt nauseous, and to make things worse, I was on my period. I felt absolutely awful.

On May 14, 2025 (today), I avoided him again. I arrived at school later (around 8 or 9 AM), and Mari asked to talk to me (I’ll also share screenshots of our chat and hers with Samuel). I agreed and told her everything. She said Samuel had given her a different version of events.

Before all this, he’d asked to talk to me, but I avoided him. (Pausing here so you can check the screenshots.)

I told Mari in person: ""I won’t talk to Samuel unless he talks to me first. I already told him I don’t want anything."" Then, around 4 PM, my friends (who’ve been on my case since yesterday) started nagging me:

""Tell him, or I will!""

""Tell him to back off!""

""Just reject him already!""

""You’re being so stupid about this.""

They were treating me like garbage, and I finally snapped. I yelled at them—harshly—because I was so fed up. I said something hurtful to all of them (I apologized later, and we’re cool now because I also made them see they were obsessing over something that wasn’t their business). I told them I only shared what happened because I felt awful, and we all made up.

Then, out of nowhere, Samuel showed up behind me and asked, ""Are you ready to talk now?"" I said yes, but I was so stressed and angry that I spoke to him bluntly:

Me: ""Understand this—I want NOTHING to do with you. What happened yesterday was a mistake, and I’ve already rejected you four times. NO means NO.""

Him: ""I’ll wait for you as long as it takes. You know I love you so much and would never hurt you.""

Me: ""YES, SAMUEL, BUT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND—I DON’T LIKE YOU!""

Then he hit me with: ""Oh, by the way, I forgot to tell you… you’re actually a really good kisser.""

I just stared at him like, WTF, dude?! I repeated my rejection 2-3 more times, but he kept insisting he ""loves me."" Finally, I said, ""I’ve literally told you I don’t want anything. I’m leaving.""

But then he grabbed my face, stared at my lips like he was about to kiss me, and started leaning in. I just said, ""Okay, goodbye,"" turned around, and walked away.

Now I don’t know what to do.

I don’t know what’ll happen this Friday if I see him, or next Tuesday. I’ll update you all if I run into him or if he texts me. I’m not looking for criticism—I know what I did was wrong, but I just need to vent. Since yesterday, I’ve felt horrible: headaches, back pain, cramps, nausea… I’m a mess.

All I want is advice on how to make him leave me alone. I’ve told him repeatedly I'm not interested, but he’s still clinging to this idea of ""waiting"" for me.",
203,"I work nights. Been doing this job long enough to stop pretending it hasn’t changed me.

The first time it happened, it wasn’t planned. Bad call, long debrief, med room. She didn’t ask questions. I didn’t explain anything. We just didn’t stop it.

Since then, there’ve been a few more. Always off the books. Always someone who’s just as tired as me.

It’s not about the sex. Never was. It’s about having ten minutes where you don’t have to carry the weight, lie to your family, or feel like a walking trauma case with a pulse.

I still go home. Still play the role. But I stopped pretending I’m a good person a long time ago.

204,"I'm 4'8 (142 CM) at 25 years old as a guy. I kinda just... stopped growing at about 12. I'm pretty sure it was due to chemotherapy when I was younger since I had cancer. The type of chemo I had can apparently close your growth plates very early. Doesn't help that I *also* have scoliosis making it kinda painful to not slouch. 

I've never been insecure about that tho. Sure it got annoying hearing the same jokes repeated over and over again, but I've learnt to roll with it. But lately I've been realizing that moreso than I thought people *do* treat me differently because of my height. I don't actually think this would be so much of an issue if I was even above 5 ft but I'm *so* much below the average that people can't help but notice.

206,"Almost two weeks ago my ex (23M) broke uo with me (25F) out of the blue.
We had been dating for four months, and made it official two months before the breakup. Unlike past relationships I’ve had, he’s a man that showed me (or at least that’s what I believed) with actions that he wanted to be with me.

For a little context, I moved to a new country (the one where I’m currently in) and I met him after 3 months of living here. I didn’t know the area at all, he showed me around everywhere. I only have two friends because I can be a very shy person.

He asked me to be his girlfriend, everything was going amazing, he treated me beautifully, we had good conversation, chemistry and a lot of things in common. He introduced me to his mom and siblings, and to his best friend. 
On a random wednesday, my 13 year old family dog passed away, and I was alone in the house becaude my cousin and her husband (who I live with) went away on vacation, so I went through that alone. 

Everything with him was fine until that moment, where I told him what happened and he was just like “that sounds like a very rough day”, I immediately noticed something was off, and he had that day off and told me he was having drinks with his friends, while his GIRLFRIEND was alone at the house.
The next day, he was acting all weird, and at night i confronted him, he told me he wanted to break up with me.

He came over, I was crying uncontrollably, he told me he could just never get to the point of loving me, that he thinks there’s someone better for him out there. He said that I am not social enough (he has a big group of friends) which made me feel like shit because all my friends are back home. He said that he would sometimes ignore my texts, and that he just had the feeling that he didn’t like me that much from the beginning, but was trying to ignore it, and that we’re not really compatible (which is insane because we have so so much in common).

I’m gonna be honest, I begged him to stay, I cried and cried, I know I shouldn’t have done that, but I just couldn’t believe it, because all up until two days ago everything was amazing. It’s just really hard to process how two days before that we were hanging out having an amazing time, we had an amazing date and then BOOM. 

I really miss him, I have different moments where I say I’m going to be okay, but I cry every single night when I remember being with him, I just want to be with him and at the same time I wonder, why do I still someone who said all those things. ",
207,"Blocking my greatest love

I don't have anyone to talk this off with so I'll put it here.

Blocking my greatest love. Why? because of my family. I had to block her on all my socials because my family knows all my social pass and phone pass. I don't know what to feel. Suddenly, I feel dizzy, my head hurts. I want to cry. She's the love of my life. My first love. My puppy love. I met her when I was in grade 7, a classmate. We became close because we were always asked by our teachers to carry their things to the other section. We teased each other but I never felt anything until someone asked me, ""Aaron, who do you have a crush on?"" And that's when I realized that I have feelings for her. I confessed and luckily, the feelings were mutual. We were just kids, but she made me understand and made me think about what crush and love really are. After 2 years, we were in 8th grade. We suddenly stopped talking because of her religion. As my first love, even after 6 years, I haven't been able to move on from her. I tried looking for her qualities in other girls but I can't and I still can't find anyone like her. I was a chubby guy until 12th grade, very unattractive, but I transformed in college because I started going to the gym. In those 2 years in college, someone had a crush on me and there were two of them (like, what?!). So I tried. I talked to them. What happened? After 2 weeks, I lost interest. I tried to reciprocate the feelings, but I couldn't and I told them that.

Fast forward, my crush from grade 7 posted something on her story and it was a ngl link (for those of you who don't know, ngl link is a platform where can say something anonymously)Of course, I confessed my feelings there, I confessed over and over again because I knew for a fact that she wouldn't know it was me among the others confessing too. In my last confession, on her story, it said ""more clues please, I think I know who it is."" I hesitated to send it, thinking, ""What if she set her story on private to me?"" After a minute of contemplating, i sent it.

a few hours passed and she suddenly messaged me. Her last story was indeed set to private, and only for me. (This sounds so fake, but it's real.)

Her: you're caught
Me: What is that supposed to mean?
Her: You're caught, HAHAHA

Well, I confessed HAHAHA and the feelings were mutual, she liked me for the past years.

The joy, happiness, everything. It's like I used up all my luck that day, June 2, 2023. Exactly at 11:11, she messaged me and told me that she liked me

 We always talk about it and we still get giddy about it 'til this day.

But today, I blocked her without saying anything. For the past few months that my family knew I was talking to that girl. My aunts, uncles messaged her, calling her short, chubby, with a mustache, everything you can think of saying to a 5'1 chubby girl. She's hairy and that's what I like about her. And mind you, she's very beautiful and smart. She's an architect in N.U Manila (a university in the Philippines)The most beautiful and smart girl I've ever laid my eyes on, but for some reason, my family doesn't like her. 

They say all sorts of things about her, but she accepts it all. I asked her why. She answered, ""Because I love you. I understand them because I love you, my love."" That broke me. I know how strong she is, she's been through a lot. She's my strong girl. But knowing her, I know she's also hurting. It hurts so much. It hurts me so much that she's tolerating all of that for me. And now, I decided to stop things. She doesn't deserve that treatment. I don't want her to hear those words. I'm also hurting. I love her so much. I love her immensely. I also love my family, especially my mom (even though they're toxic). Right now, my goal is to make it to a cruise and give them the life they deserve. As for the girl I love? I don't know. I don't really deserve her. Coming back to her? I believe in fate and destiny. I'll let it decide.

208,"i am in no way trying to be disrespectful or ableist in the slightest. this is just something that has bothered me for years and i literally cannot stand to hold it in.

so for context, there are about three girls, and five boys that sit in the library during my online college class period. now granted, it’s online, so i COULD do the work at home, but i have a routine that i do and it just doesn’t work. so i can’t do most of my college work at home. 

anyway, they are extremely disruptive and very distracting, and i know for a fact the other kids in the library can say the same. examples include, but not limited to: 
- screaming at the top of their lungs
- making moaning and groaning noises
- banding on stuff
- walking around yelling

now normally they’re alright, not too loud, but a good three to four times out of the month they are very disruptive, especially to those who are actively doing their work. and look i understand they can’t help it, but the monitors just sit there and do nothing. but i believe my mom (a sped advisor) says they can’t do anything because the kids “wont understand”. i feel very strongly about this, but i feel like an asshole for stating this. they just become even less tolerable by the day, and i can’t leave the library even if i wanted to.

212,"Throwaway because this is very fucked.

When I (M24) was about 12, I touched my childhood best friend’s sister in an inappropriate manner.

My bestfriend’s when I was a little boy, were two brothers and their little sister. They were both a year or so older than me. The younger brother who we’ll call Greg was a year older and his brother, who we’ll call James was 2 or 3 years older than me. Who we’ll call Sam, the victim, would’ve been like a year younger than me.

We had been friends since we were all very young, 6-7 maybe. I would sleep over very often and for multiple nights, playing video games, slamming sodas, omegle. Normal 2010’s unsupervised kid stuff. Unsupervised is definitely what I would call their house most of the time. They had super cool parents, and parents that I think really loved them and their friends, but super aloof and disaffected. The kind of parents that just want you to do your thing and not get in trouble they have to deal with. Drop you off at the pool or the mall and see you in a couple of hours kind of thing. 

Anyway, during these sleep overs, their parents would be home but they were on the total opposite side of the house and basically no matter how loud we screamed it seemed like they literally didn’t register we were there the whole night. Blasting music, beating each other up, one kid that slept over used to have night terrors. We actually had to wake up their parents because none of us knew what to do about that and the kid was clearly horrified. My point is, it was a free for all, most of the time.

As we drifted toward our teens, things got weird, inevitably.

When I was a kid, sex and the human body was exposed to me in a context that was unacceptable at a very young age.

I remember being a toddler and finding my dad’s magazines when he was sleeping. On the back was a woman engaging in an intimate action I won’t describe. From that point on I think my perception shifted horrifically in a way that has affected me forever. I would literally attempt to replicate the action when I knew my dad was asleep, because I guess I thought that’s what you do with that part of your body now? I remember that period as very confusing obviously. 

That thought process exploded into an incessant need to understand myself and others through that lense at that age and onward. The more access I gained to the internet, to others I could ask questions and context I could see, the less I was shifted off of that path of discovery, the more I grew curious. Early youtube, kik, “subtle” google searches. Essentially, my foundation for understanding the world and people around me was only about that.

It was and is a viscous cycle. It has destroyed a lot of things in my life, made me feel guilty and immensely ashamed independent and post this situation and continues to significantly affect me as an adult. 

It hurt someone I cared about a lot.

We got older, grew closer, preteen love and all.

One day we had all gone to the faire. The brothers, Sam, her friend and I, along with their parents.

When you’re a kid everything is so intense. Endless new freedom for an hour, a new, blooming personality and hundreds of people you’ve never met to try it out on and new scenarios to show off for your friends. Tension is a theme for time period. 

The day ended, we all planned to stay at their house, per usual. Except it wasn’t. 

We had gotten home and been hanging out in Greg’s room for the past few hours. Greg had bunk beds, which I planned to sleep on top of, because James had recently moved into a separate room in the house and they hadn’t gotten him his own yet. 

Throughout the night I remember talking to Sam and her friend about cuddling and how I’d never cuddled with a girl before and that this was a shock to them.

Three or four in the mourning rolled around and Greg was definitely asleep. As I went to go to bed both of the girls went with me. 

My heart was racing I could literally hardly speak because I hadn’t thought I’d realistically ever be in that situation soon or ever. 

I had thought about things like that to this point but I still didn’t really understand it. Vague feelings, loose associations, no context for things I’d seen or experiences I’ve heard about.

I remember laying there for what I thought was hours. Till I thought they were asleep. I don’t know what I did exactly but I did what I thought wouldn’t disturb them. I don’t have a justifying thought like, “I just wanted to know.” There is mo justifying, I don’t know what I thought. I don’t know why I did what I did. I just did.

Eventually, I got up, went to the bathroom till my heart stopped racing and when I came out I saw them going to Sam’s room and we met in the hall. I don’t remember what we said but I do know that’s when I realized they were awake.

I waited till the morning, acted normal, went home and never spoke to them again. I was terrified. She messaged me on kik the next day or so that if I confessed we could drop it and still be friends but I just denied it. To this day I wish I had just owned up to it then. I suppose I blocked her or the other way around and we never spoke again.

I thought for over a year they would send me to jail. I avoided the topic of my bestfriend’s till that point like they would give me cancer. Somehow my dad never caught on that something was off, she never told her parents or brothers. I moved away and it disappeared for a little while.

A moved back to my dad’s a few years later in high school and it came up. Turns out we went to the same school and she told people I molested her when we were kids. Fair, but even at that point I was too much of a coward to face her or own up to it. I denied it and it went away again. I tried to message to her then but she wouldn’t respond so I figured it was best if I didn’t press on.

Two years ago I told Greg what happened. I messaged him on instagram and got his number. He had no clue why we stopped talking. He asked James and Sam and neither said they knew anything. He said he’d always figured it was just cause I moved away. So I told him what happened over the phone. He said it sounded like it was something that weighed heavy on me for a long time and he had to think and he’d talk to me again soon. I haven’t talked to him since. I haven’t tried to message him either for the obvious.

I’m writing this because I don’t know what I should do. I know and have known what I did was horrible. I changed affected Sam’s life in a way that no one should ever be affected. Child or not, I knew what I was doing was wrong.

I just don’t know what I’m supposed to do now. This has crushed me for over ten years. I just need to do whatever the right thing is, I just need to make this as right as I possibly can for Sam, regardless of the consequences for me. Obviously, that doesn’t mean communicating with her directly again because that’s just something people do for their own closure not to rectify a wrong doing. ",
213,"I once realized that I might have spent nearly three years thinking about someone every single day after we broke up. She was basically my first love, and although I don’t think about her like I used to, I still think about her sometimes.
That got me wondering: how often did she think about me during that same time?
Part of me would love to know. Like, if there was a counter showing how many times each ex has thought about you since the breakup—wouldn’t that be wild?
But then again… what if the number is painfully low? What if the difference is huge? That thought scares me.
Would you want to know? Or is it better not to?",

Honestly, I still don’t know how to feel. I felt so easily discarded - and that feeling still lingers. I’m left not really knowing what to make of it all.

I own my flaws, my mistakes, and the harm I caused. I did good, but I also did wrong. For that, I take full accountability - with responsibility and integrity. I’ve changed. I’ve meditated, reflected, and tried to understand everything. Even if my troubled family history, my past, or my worst impulses shaped some of the hurtful things I said or did - they’re not excuses. I’m still responsible, and I’m truly sorry. I was thorough for you, in loyalty and commitment, and I know i fucked saying awful things or entertaining stupid ideas up because of past traumas but I'm glad I showed up by being there with you 99% of the time, either physical or texting, even when going out I texted you where I was, or asking you to imprint hickeys on me because I would wear them with pride of being taken

But our last conversation, idk, didn’t feel like healing to me. You shared how you lost parts of yourself in the relationship - how you stopped doing what you loved, and drifted from your friends and that guilt consumed you. I hear you, I sympathize, and I’m sorry if I ever made you feel like you had to change or leave your friends behind. That was never my intention. You, as you were, with your social circle, were the person I loved.

Still, it felt like the sacrifices I made were invisible. I let go of things I cared about - time, energy, people, parts of myself, which I willingly let go with no hesitation. We both gave and sacrificed, but when things fall apart, after the aftermath we often focus on what hurt us, and that's a human thing, nothing wrong with that. Maybe we’ll never fully see what the other gave up. Maybe we just can’t carry someone else’s pain the way we carry our own - and that’s a lonely, but honest truth.

Like you, I stopped doing things I loved. I became motionless and I stayed in more. Even when I wanted us to go out, or when you suggested it but was not sure or forgot, I found myself unsure as well whether to go or stay. Our definitions of going out were slightly different - bike rides, hikes, or just strolls at the park are more of my thing - but I adjusted to the pace we were in. I adapted to city strolls, mall days, and hangouts with friends. For me it was never about what we did. It was about being with you. That was enough for me.

What hurt the most was what you said about your friends. And honestly, I think your friends are cool people, they never really bothered me nor your guy friends (sure there was one time I was confused but that's because I was unaware of the context), and I think I'm being painted in a bad light by them and that's okay, I don't mind. I’m glad they’re there for you. Truly. That kind of support matters, they’re alive. You can call, text, share them your stuff or hear their voices.

I can’t do that. Not with the one I need the most right now. She's (my mom) gone. And I need her more than ever - her comfort, her advice, her wisdom. That loss is unspeakable. No one saw it coming. There was no preparing for it. The silence it left is unbearable. And it's a prolonged guilt, it’s still raw, and it's the biggest sacrifice I made. Note, I'm not assigning blame. Life just struck me unexpectedly, out of nowhere.

Now even my sisters have distanced themselves. And their resentment toward me has amplified like never before, I know they’re hurting too, and have other problems on their lives as well. We all grew up in a broken dynamic. Maybe it’s not mine to fix. It’s just how it is

What I want you to know is this: it wasn’t one-sided love. If it ever felt that way, I’m sorry.

Every moment, every memory, every intimate act—it meant something to me. I did my best, last year when my parents wanted me to stay home for more than a while I wanted to get back to you, when I came back to celebrate your birthday, our 1st picnic, even when my mind was at war with itself. Even when I lost my mom and you asked why I felt distant and less intimate, I didn’t shut down. I stayed because I didn't want you to feel lonely. I tried. And I’ll always be grateful for the times you were there when I needed someone, too.

From the start - even before dating - I wanted to be someone you could lean on. Someone to listen, to comfort, to care. Every choice I made came from love. Genuine, sincere love.

But the conditions you set... left me confused. Rebuilding, you said, would involve dating others first, being happily single while I stay on a limbo waiting for your answer, that being with me would disappoint many people. When i had my first struggle with you, my closest friends adviced me when I was the most unsure, yet I chose my conviction and heart. That’s what love meant to me back then.

And let me be clear - this isn’t about keeping score. I’m not listing sacrifices to put guilt. These were my choices, my decisions, from my own will. I stand by them. I’m just naming what I carried, the way you named yours. And I still carry it, without resentment.

Right now, I’m the most vulnerable I've been. I’m mourning my mom. I’m grieving the love I lost. I’m navigating a broken family that dislikes me, and facing myself every day all at once. I’m not pointing fingers. I just want to speak my truth - quietly, honestly.

Even after all those sacrifices I also made, it reflected a lot and don't hold no ill will

I’m too old for that now—or maybe it just feels that way, even if I’m only 23.

215,"I was sexually assaulted in the bus full of people. I was so shocked by what was happening that I completely froze, could not move even after the guy got off the bus. That same year I was raped at a pub, my friends were partying upstairs while this guy who bought me a drink dragged me and forced himself on me in the parking. I never told anyone about that either. I went through trauma and hypersexuality for a long time after that. This my friends know, about hypersexuality because I would tell them about going on dates with multiple guys and then going to their house. They just thought that was me, my personality, in a way it has become a part of me. I have dated too many men and slept with a lot of them. Sometimes I wouldn't even go out on a date, I would directly go to the guys house and fuck him. I've done this with many guys. Now after a decade I feel like sanity has come back to me especially after learning to stand up for myself and realising that non of what happened was my fault. 


I tired talking to my friends but I couldn't do it. I want to be able to tell my friends and family about the rape but I can't see myself ever doing that.
 I've started dating this really unbelievably kind and caring guy. Can't talk to him about it either. I've made this post earlier. I don't know how to start this convo in real",
216,"A dream of mine since I was a little girl was to get married, have children, and raise them with a man I will grow old with. Now, in 2025, I see that this is simply not possible for me. The reason for this, is that in this world of porn stars and OF models, I am simply not enough to satisfy the male gaze. I simply do not have what it takes. I am not curvy enough, and I do not have the perfect hourglass body that is required. I am not enough. Men DO NOT react to my body the way they do to Sydney Sweeney's. I will never be complimented the way she is. Everytime I go on Instagram and I see a woman who's body does not look like Sydney Sweeney's, she is mocked and ridiculed by men. My body is not enough to keep a man interested enough in me not to cheat on me. I feel like I will have no choice but to let my husband go out and fuck girls with bigger asses and titties in order to keep him. I am not enough. Everytime I'm around men in public, I know that they're thinking mean things about me. I know they're calling me a stick and flat in their heads, and thinking horrible things like how I'd be better off dead. I know this is true because this is what they're saying about girls online. So it would be 10x worse with me. I'm obsessed with going to the gym. I got depressed and couldn't get myself to go, and I got skinny again. ",
217,"Hey guys, I just wanted to come on here and express what I’ve been feeling these past couple of months. It actually started a year ago when I suddenly began thinking about what I want my future to look like. Of course, everyone wants to succeed in life, and that’s really all I ever want. But the problem is, will I ever succeed?

As I finish high school, I’ve been planning my future—like where I want to go to college, what course I should take, and what job I want. I dream every day about who I want to become. But the problem is me. I call myself a “try-hard achiever,” but I don’t even think I deserve to be called that because of my bum grades. They’re always just a few numbers away from being removed from the 90s. I mean, sometimes I understand lessons or topics, but I can never be confident enough to answer because of how unsure I always feel.

I lack confidence in everything I do, and that sucks because I lose so many opportunities. I can’t even call myself a try-hard because I don’t know what “my best” looks like. I’ve never been able to put my full effort, energy, or focus into something, so how would I even know if I truly tried my best? How can I know my best when I don’t even know how to give my best?

I’m always distracted, and I can never seem to fix it, maybe because of laziness or a loss of motivation. Nothing ever really pushes me to become my best at anything. I understand that in order to flourish, you have to learn and work hard, but how can I do that if I don’t even know how to work hard in the first place?

I’m full of self-doubt, and it drains me every day. I know that if I just pushed myself, I could probably be like my friends who are so determined. But I don’t even know how to put myself into that mindset. I think that’s why I feel like I don’t have a passion or talent. I’m not good at performing arts, sports, or cooking—basically anything. I feel like I don’t even have a talent at all.

Being useless and talentless makes me question my purpose in life. If I can’t even help or impact myself, then what could I possibly do for others? I’m not good at anything, not even in academics. So what’s my purpose? What will happen to me in the future? Will I ever reach my dream of going to college abroad, working there, and settling down?

Every time I research what I need to do to get there, it just feels like a slap in the face. It reminds me that someone like me—useless and talentless—would never reach such a big dream. I know this sounds like a stupid rant, and I know I’m still young, but seeing my friends have talents and passions that will help them succeed just makes me wish I had something of my own too.

I think I’m just lazy and lacking initiative. My friends label me as a hard worker, someone who leads and dreams big, but when I look at my grades, none of that seems real. It all led nowhere. Maybe it’s just a matter of time management and having the initiative, but how do I get that? I’m not sharp. I’m clumsy, stupid, and not smart enough to teach a classmate even when I understand the topic. I’m not creative either. I always need a reference because I can’t think of anything original.

I’ve achieved good grades before, but it was because I relied on the internet, AI, or my friends. And even then, my grades still aren’t enough for my parents. If this is who I am now, how can I ever become the person I want to be in the future? Do I even deserve to dream when other people are actually trying and working hard?

The song “Let Down” by Radiohead really hits me. The line “One day, I am gonna grow wings” is something I want to believe in. I want to believe that someday I’ll grow into someone who’s capable, strong, and successful.

I still want to be successful in life. I just don’t know how to start. I don’t know how to push myself to actually do things. I want to find the motivation, the drive to do something that matters. Sometimes, death feels like an answer when I think about the reality of what Im thinking like the pressure, money, expectations, and myself. Despite everything, deep down, I still want to keep going. I just don’t know how. I still want to be successful in life, but I genuinely don’t know where to start. I don’t know how to find motivation or how to push myself to actually do something. I want to learn how to work hard, how to manage my time, and how to stop relying on luck or last-minute effort. I’ve ""tried"" to change, but nothing really sticks. Sometimes it feels like I’m stuck in a loop where no matter how much I want to improve, I just keep falling back into the same mindset and habits.

So I guess I’m asking, what do I do now? How do I build discipline and motivation when I’ve never had either? How do I stop feeling like I’m behind in life, and how can I start to believe that it’s not too late for someone like me? I’d really appreciate hearing your advice or experience or even motivation. Right now, I just want to find a way to believe that my dreams are still possible.",
218,"So i learned a lesson that is so cliche i hate myself for not seeing it coming. 

A friend from high school (we’re both 25) has been married for a couple years now. He lives across the country, so we talk once in a while but not often. It’s only been friendly. Five months ago he started talking to me about his failed marriage, drug use, etc. He painted a very detailed picture of his wife cheating on him and moving out and the mental health ramifications that followed. He told me they were in the process of getting divorced. I thought he was being honest and vulnerable. We’ve known each other for over ten years and I had no previous incidents to make me doubt him. 

He asked me to send nudes. I said no. It’s not something i’m generally comfortable with and I would feel weird about it when all the stuff with his marriage was so fresh. At one point, he offered $5k and i said no because it felt like he was being impulsive and stupid and i didn’t want to take advantage. After a month of him asking me every other day and constantly reassuring me that his marriage was definitely over (he sent screenshots that backed his story) and he could definitely afford to pay me, I caved for (allegedly) $2k.

He “tried to pay me” and his account “got locked” because it was so much money. Again he spun a fantastical tale about being in a bad place and he would get to it when he was able to. I told him to take his time, I don’t want him to have money problems because of me. He has not yet done that, which I wasn’t that concerned about. 

So last night he texts me and wants to “pay me for nudes again”. I said he had to pay me for last time first. Again he gave me a well crafted story about how he’s about to pass a test to get a job and then he’ll pay me a LOT more money on top of what was from before. So, being an idiot, i said “oh okay that sounds believable” and did it. 

This morning I get a text from his wife. She says(paraphrasing) that he’s been lying to me the whole time, he’s a master manipulator, he doesn’t have the ability to pay me, and would you please stop sending nudes to my husband. She even offered to send me proof that she’s the one telling the truth. She said she saw everything the first time and didn’t text me because he promised to stop, and she saw everything this time too. So that’s disgusting. 

I am such an idiot and feel terrible. She was SO kind too. She apologized for his actions and even offered to pay me some of the money he promised herself. I said absolutely not that’s not at all what i’m worried about right now. She asked me a few questions and I answered. I asked her if she thought i should be worried about privacy and she said no, he deletes stuff quickly and doesn’t send them anywhere. I can’t believe she was so kind and gentle with me. 

I feel sick with guilt and on top of that I’m pissed at him. He knew I was hesitant about the whole thing in the first place and promised me no one else would ever see them. Maybe he thought he’d get away with it the first time but he knew the privacy was breached after that. Obviously I am not the victim here and it feels absurdly selfish for ME to be upset that SHE saw all of that, but I am (at him, not her obviously). And he ruined a ten year friendship for both of us on top of everything he’s doing to his wife. With her permission, I sent one more text to him about why I no longer considered him a friend and then blocked him. 

Obviously I always knew the money was questionable, but I was so sure I checked all the boxes to make sure it wasn’t messing with a relationship. Lesson learned, don’t trust them unless you see signed divorce papers. I just feel so stupid and hurt and SO terrible for what I did to this sweet woman. Sorry for rambling. this sucks. ",
219,"People commonly attribute cheating to unhappy relationships, opportunity, distance, alcohol, etc.

It's true that otherwise faithful people might cheat in those circumstances -- but not everyone in those circumstances respond by cheating. Some people break up, others try to work it out, others stay, etc.

People are prone to responding in different ways to the same trigger. If I honk at someone, they might ignore it or they might chase me down the highway for miles with a shotgun. Is my honking what determined their behavior, or is it the interaction that occurred between the stimulus (honking) and their underlying tendencies?

It's analogous to lighting a spark in a room with a gas leak vs a regular room. Is it the spark itself that caused the explosion in the gas-filled room or is it the **interaction between the spark and the presence of gas that caused the explosion**? The same spark in a regular room would do nothing.

So when someone cheats, it’s not just the external circumstance -- dissatisfaction, alcohol, distance -- that explains the behavior. It’s how that circumstance interacts with the person’s internal makeup: their values, impulse control, past experiences, and predispositions. In other words, Person-Situation Interactionism applies to relationship cheating: the trigger matters, but so does what it’s triggering.",
220,"When my husband and I decided we were ready for a baby, we were financially stable. We were about to move to a nice apartment with plenty of room, had some savings built up, both had full time jobs. We weren’t rich by any means but we were okay and getting better. We were making good payments on debt and almost done, never missed any payments on rent or the cars, had groceries and entertainment. 

Then he suddenly had to take some time off work for an unexpected but very necessary surgery. The recovery time was longer than his employer was willing to give him (6 months minimum) so he lost his job. We had already signed our contract with the new apartment and had plans to move a few weeks later. Just after we moved in we found out I was pregnant. 

It’s all gone downhill since then. Our savings dwindled because on top of the surgery costs, there were unexpected bills, late fees because our energy company f’ed up our transfer to the new apartment, our cat needed to be put down, etc. We thought we were prepared for anything but with half the income and double the money going out, we’re now almost completely broke.

I’m 8 months along now, baby is due within weeks and we have almost nothing ready for her. I’m struggling to keep working at my current pace but can’t find an easier job, my husband has been cleared to work for a while but is struggling to find a job, even the business he was at before has been leading him on for weeks. My job only offers 6 weeks FMLA and not paid maternity leave, so we’re looking at 6 weeks of no income at all. 

I blame myself for so much but I don’t know how to fix anything or catch up let alone get ahead. We don’t have people to ask for help, we’re no contact with his family and mine is as broke as we are. All I can think of is that it was my decision to try for a baby, my decision to move because we needed a safer apartment to raise a kid in, all debt we were trying to pay off was in my name (a couple of credit cards I NO LONGER USE, and some school loans)… I wish I could go back in time and tell myself how bad things were about to get.

221,"From 2019 to 2023 (and a little in 2024), I was addicted to Discord.
I was just a 16-year-old guy in lockdown, bored out of my mind, attention-starved, and lonely.

So, yeah… I pretended to be a girl.

At first, it was just curiosity and trolling. But then I realized being a ""girl"" on Discord came with perks.
Free stuff, instant friends, mod roles, attention—I saw how differently people treated me, and I leaned into it.

I even used my sister’s voice once to pass a voice verification test.
Got the girl role. Got mod roles later. Some people were sus at first, but slowly they trusted me—mostly because I just acted normal and was fun to talk to.

I ended up talking to creepy dudes, kids who thought I could hack them (they were scared to even open a meme I sent lol), and even had a few online ""boyfriends"" (cringe now, but yeah).
I never used voice with them, just acted the part.
When things got serious, I ghosted them. I wasn’t looking for any relationship.

People trust strangers online too easily, and some of the guys I met were so creepy—it gave me insight into what real girls must go through online.
There were people asking personal stuff, trying to flirt, getting mad if I didn’t respond, expecting access to my real identity.

That disgusted me. And honestly, even though I was faking it, I felt violated sometimes.

I also bullied a few annoying kids. Nothing extreme—they were just scared of me, thinking I was some hacker. It was dumb but funny back then.

By 2024, I dipped from Discord. School got serious (class 12), and ironically—I got into a real-life relationship.
I told people I had to leave because ""I have real life too."" And I did.

Looking back, I don’t really regret anything. I learned a lot:

People are naïve online

Being a girl online is literally a survival game

Creeps exist everywhere

And messing around can actually teach you real skills—I got into programming, automation, botting, all through Discord servers


Yeah, I was a weird, lonely teen. But I’m 19 now, and a lot more mature.
Not proud of everything—but not ashamed either. It was a phase. And it taught me stuff.


---

TL;DR
I faked being a girl on Discord for years during lockdown. Got attention, free stuff, learned a lot, made mistakes, ghosted people, dealt with creeps, and came out of it more mature and self-aware.

Edit : **Just to clarify, the tone of my post might have come across the wrong way. I didn’t mean to downplay or trivialize anything—I was simply sharing my experience. I realize now that it may have sounded insensitive, and I appreciate the feedback.**",
222,"(This is a true story. I've changed a few details for privacy, but this really happened.)

Every dinner was a trip down memory lane. Same story. Same lines. Same laughter.

It was a trip to Yellowstone they took in 1989, and they never came back from it—mentally, at least. At first, I found it nostalgic. Then I realized they were rehearsing a fantasy they needed to survive.

I lived with my wife's family for a couple of years. From the outside, everything looked normal. Middle-class house in suburban LA, freshly cut lawn, framed photos on the wall. But inside, it felt like a time capsule. The furniture. The TV shows. The conversations.

There was always an old sitcom on TV—Cheers, Full House, Golden Girls—and someone would inevitably say, “They don’t make 'em like this anymore.”

And then the stories. The family trip to Yellowstone came up at least twice a week. They talked about the broken-down car, the bear encounter, the lodge breakfast. Everyone had their part in the story, like a script they’d been performing for decades. They even laughed at the same lines, at the same timing, every single time.

My wife, despite being born and raised in LA, often said things like, “Ugh, city people are so rude,” or “Back home, we knew how to treat each other right.”

“Back home” meant a small rural town her parents came from, where they still had relatives. She kept in close contact with them. Holidays were scheduled around their calendar. Their traditions ruled our life.

And her brother. He was 40. Didn’t work. Lived in the room he grew up in. The walls were plastered with merch from a regional cartoon mascot—plush toys, posters, pins. He called the character by name like it was a friend. He once told me, without irony, “She’s the only one who gets me.”

He wasn’t kidding.

Then their mother passed away. Their father was diagnosed with late-stage cancer. And even then, they didn’t snap out of it. They didn’t talk about death. They doubled down on the past.

“She’s still with us in spirit.” “Dad’s strong. He’s a fighter.”

They kept watching the same shows, telling the same stories, clinging to a world that was slipping through their fingers.

I wanted them to see it. To face the moment. To grieve.

But they couldn’t. And I couldn’t stay.

So one day, I left.

Now I wake up in a one-bedroom apartment across town. It’s quiet. It’s mine. The coffee tastes stronger. The mornings are real.

Their house still stands. But mentally, it collapsed long ago.",
223,"Yeah, yeah, I know it's nothing special. But I just wanted to get it out there. A lot of people are posting pics of when they went to prom or their children going to prom. 

I never went. I had no desire to go. Yes, it would have been fun, but I wasn't exactly a social person in high school. Plus, my mom (god rest her soul) had told me that spending a lot of money on hair and nails and a dress I'd only wear once really wasn't worth it. 

Do I wish I would have gone? Yeah, somewhat. Do I want the memories? Yeah. Do I regret it? Not really. 

I just wanted to share. ",
224,"I don’t think I have ever felt so depressed in my life. No I’m not diagnosed, but I began to catch on how I’ve been getting more unhappy and gloomy. Since January I felt sad, but I shrugged it off thinking it’s because of college applications. i focused on school for the following months, getting in to my dream school, gaining scholarships, getting recognition in my hs, and yet I feel sad.

And with all of the accomplishments I achieved, no one else cheered with me. Senior night, I only brought myself and everyone else brought family. College graduation didn’t feel like a day for me, instead it was all for my cousin. My acceptance to a top 30 Uni, my family members did not care, the call with my bf telling him I got in, sounded like he didn’t care. No one likes hearing my silly interests or wanna even try doing something I like, just theirs. I feel so alone

With my partner, he doesn’t like it when I talk about anything school related at all. Ik rn that’s all I probably talk about since it’s what I’m so focused on. But I’d still like a “good job” with enthusiasm. Not an “okay, great” with no emotion. Theres times when my bf swats my hand or grabs my hand and puts it down not wanting to be touched and I get it, but constantly doing it when I barely see him upsets me. Or when he just says that  ‘I’m fine’ when I feel some sort of way about myself. I feel like I’m a chore or an achievement to him. I plan on telling him this, but I don’t even know if he would be emotionally available. (He’s not a bad person, he’s more clueless)

I have never vented to my friends because I don’t think they would understand. And they would tell their mom. 

I don’t know what I’m doing, everything I have done felt like I have done it for nothing, I have accomplished nothing, I feel like a burden, and a moron.

I have been cleaning and baking in order to keep myself busy, but I start crying out of nowhere.

Honestly I don’t think I can handle this. I feel worse

(I’m not asking for relationship advice)

Im not good with expressing how I feel, so I might have worded it too much or didn’t give clarification. Very sorry.

225,"I know this may be part of the grieving process and accepting the news, but it physically hurts...

Less than a week ago, my fiancé (40m) found out he has cancer. There were no symptoms that previous doctors were ever concerned about and due to his age we never thought to push too far on it. Today we found out it is stage 4 colon cancer that has metastisized to the liver and potentially other organs. We will know more pending the results of more labs and imaging but the doctor estimates without treatment he would have maybe 5 months. With treatment, maybe 2 years. 

I feel like the wind has been knocked out of me. I have been trying to be strong and stand by him. But now I can't stop sobbing and think about how I wish it were me instead. How I wish I had it and he didn't. I know in the morning I will be calling my therapist, but it's so hard to breathe now.",
226,"Sorry if it’s confusing, still unsure of how Reddit works. 
So a little background information, I’m 18F, living with my parents 52M and 47F plus my brother 24M and grandma 82(I think😭). 

- Useful information to understand the story: 
I live in a place where right after school, you give some sort of exams and depending on how well you write you get a certain amount of points, then with those points if you have gotten enough you are able to go to a university located in different places of the country for free. Two years before you give those exams you are given an option to choose between different classes. Classes such:  
1) History, Latin, 
2) Math, Physics,
3) Biology, Science,
4) Computer Science, Science. 
Something along those lines, if you choose one of these, later on you can’t change it and when you write the final exams, you have certain options for uni depending on the classes you chose previously. 

However, if you haven’t gotten enough points to pass into university, or in my case you chose classes that don’t align with what you want to study later in life, you also have the option to pay for a private college that will give you almost the same opportunity. Differences are, (still unsure of this whole thing I’m learning) the university that you get into through the points, usually you are studying there for 4-5 years, while the college that you pay for, you usually study for 2. Also with the university I think, I’m not sure, but I think you get a one level better paper. This English is so wrong but I hope you got the point.

Now, to the point:

My parents are very strict. And I’m not just saying this, they are. If we compare my parents to the parents of other friends, classmates or in general people my age, I’ve been restricted from doing most of the things others did my age. Until the age of 14 I could go out until 7 in the evening then always needed to be home. Right at 7. If I came home later than that, I was always punished. Punished by having all my electronics taken away, no phone no tv no computer. And I grew up on these things, so it was hell. At 15 they let me until 8, and finally at 17 they let me until 11. After many many fights. Now that I’m 18, it doesn’t really change anything for them. Doesn’t matter if I’m 18 or 30 I still MUST listen to them. Oh and btw, if I go out on Friday, I can’t go out on Saturday. Two days in a row? Funny. If I had fun yesterday I can’t have fun today. Also couldn’t go out with people unless my parents knew them. I have gotten to know many new friends from a discord server my best friend put me in, and we met up with them whenever they would stop by my city. Many times I lied to my parents about going out with the friends they know, because otherwise I would miss out on so many hangouts. Trust me I had a shit load of fun in those. 

I’m talking a lot sorry, but I just want to make everything clear.

I have an older brother, we have 6 years difference. They were just as strict with him when he was young, but as he got older they let him do a lot more than me since he’s a “guy”. This sexist thing too, I do all the chores around the house. Ever since I was 12? 11? I don’t know. I always did everything. If I wasn’t at school, (Saturdays mostly because they’re home on Sundays.) I always needed to have the house clean, the kitchen clean, mop the floors and sometimes I would cook too. Nothing changed all those years I still do everything. And I don’t mind doing them, I know it makes my mum happy because she comes home from work and everything is already done and finished and she can go and relax. My problem always was that my brother would sleep until 12 or later then wake up eat and go play on his computer while I did all the chores. Always the same thing. 
Another thing that always pisses me off. Whenever anyone at the house needs something they always call me. They shout my name across the room no matter what I do I need to go and do what they ask for. Oh we need tomatoes? Go to the store. Oh you want water? Go get me water. Oh we’re all sitting at the dining table eating? Go get a fork, go get a glass for juice, go get the napkins. And it might sound like Its really not that hard to do all that, but I just find it incredibly annoying and frustrating that IM ALWAYS THE ONE DOING EVERYTHING. Not my brother, no no no. Since I’m a “girl” and I’m the “youngest” I need to do all that. And whenever I brought it up as a serious conversation I was always shut down with
“IS IT SO HARD FOR YOU? IS IT? Whatever I will do it, since it’s so damn hard for you” and I always felt bad afterwards because my mum would usually say it with such an angry tone.

I think that covers it, sorry again it’s so much. 
School is ending now, like we are writing the exams as I type this out. I unfortunately didn’t choose the classes that align with the work that I want to study. Which means that I cannot go to the universities for free. However I decided to go to the private college that you pay for, but I chose one, two cities over, a couple of hours away from home, since the school is better and I want to learn to be independent and live alone. My brother went to a private college here in the city where we live, and he lives at home. Of course it suits him, since he does nothing but play all day and sometimes read for the school. And in the summers he goes and works. My parents had him as an example, and now they’re saying why don’t I go to that college too? It’s convenient. It would be, but first of all, I want to get of out of this house even for a couple of years because I’m fucking tired of all of this treatment. Yes I sound ungrateful, but honestly I can’t take it anymore. We’ve had so many fights about all of this that are getting nowhere and I’m just tired of it all. I want to live alone so my own choices who I go out with when I go out and until when I can stay out. Also the school on that city is much MUCH better than the one here, also much cheaper. The school there is like 3600€ for two years and the one in our city is 5000€. We’ve fought a lot with my parents on this. I have told them that all I want from them is to pay for the rent and the money for groceries. The school I will pay myself. A lot and a lot of arguments but I think slowly they’re accepting it. 
Last year I worked the summer and I build myself a really good computer that I’m very proud of and I use it every day. My brother today said that he told our parents that in his opinion, for the first year of the college I shouldn’t take the computer with me(that is if I go ofc). He said he knows what I plan on doing there alone(in his mind I will be playing all day on it instead of studying) I got pissed off because that computer is something I PAID FOR, with MY hard earned money they can’t just say yeah no you won’t take it with you, we will see your grades first and then we will decide if you can. 

I’m just blabbering at this point letting it all out. If anyone will read this book of mine and let me know their opinion I will greatly appreciate it.

227,"A bit of background to start; I (31 F) have been happily married to my husband (32 M) for 12 years. We have an 8yr old and are both disabled vets. I take care of all of the grocery shopping, meal prep and cooking, because of his dietary restrictions and I know what can be substituted where. I do all of the cleaning and household chores because it causes him pain when he tries. I handle all of the driving because of his PTSD sending him into a panic attack anytime he gets in the drivers seat. I do all the afterschool activities for our kiddo, and handle play date and other planning. I even have to handle some self care things for him like brushing his hair or helping with his shoes. 

He encouraged me to go back to school to finish my degree, and I’m only a few classes away. I took off for the spring semester and planned to go back in the fall but with everything else I have to do, I don’t really want to, it’d just be one more task to add to my list. 

He recently got diagnosed with ED, and wants me to put in more effort in the bedroom. But, I just don’t have it in me, especially since all the foreplay has to revolve around him because of ED.

We are both in therapy, but for separate reasons. We have a loving and supportive relationship, I am just stressed, frustrated and overwhelmed with everything. 

Now, first, I am not seeking advice, I just needed to get this off my mind. I can’t bring my feelings to him, he already feels like less of a man and feels bad that he can’t help out more. I don’t want to stress my friends out with any of this because we have a lot of the same friends. 

I just needed to get this off my chest and into the void.

TLDR: I feel like I do everything that keeps a house hold running and my husband wants me to put in more effort, and I just don’t have it in me. ",
228,My mom always texts this one guy who I don't know/remember and only in taxis/alone/dad not around. And hour ago I accidentally saw that he sent her a dick pic. She has nothing to to with medical things so it can't be for that reasons. She always was toxic mom yelling on me and my dad for no reason and starting argument just because. I'm just 14 so I don't know how to confront her or my dad (sorry for bad English Its not my first language),
229,"I want to preface this by saying both deaths were accidental. But I do absolutely feel like I'm to blame, especially for the second one. This all started three days ago, when I found what we think was a baby blackbird on the sidewalk next to a big bush. I have a habit of rescuing pigeons who are injured or in immediate danger and either nursing them back to health or taking them to the local bird shelter, but this was a wild bird and the aforementioned shelter was going to be closed for the whole week. Putting it back in the nest wasn't an option either, as the bush it probably fell from was inside private property and nobody was at home. It was barely a fledgeling and I was scared for it, so I decided to take it home. 

I scrolled the web for hours for videos and blogposts about how to care for a baby bird, I even went and bought it a cage and appropriate food (live honey mealworms and a baby wild bird food mixture called SteccoPast). It quickly started to see me as a caretaker, it would flap its wings and open its beak when it was hungry and would chirp to draw my attention. It would hop around my room and perch on my finger, and fall asleep in my hands. The first night went great, I put it in a warm dark and silent place and it fell asleep almost immediately. I woke up at 7 AM to its hungry cries and gave it more food throughout the day, making sure not to overfeed it. I started fantasizing about eventually teaching it to fly and hunt on its own and one day letting it free.

When I woke up yesterday to complete silence, I immediately knew something was wrong. I went to check on its cage and found it curled up and dead, eyes closed. Rigor mortis had already set in. 

I have no clue what could have killed it. I am 100% certain I would have woken up if it had started crying during the night. It passed away without a sound. My last memory of Tweezer (that's what my partner and I decided to call it) is it falling asleep on me before bedtime. Needless to say I felt like I had lost my firstborn. And needless to say I still blame myself for not doing enough for it. I'll spare you the rest of my thoughts as my head is still a mess.

Fast forward to a couple hours ago, and I find another baby blackbird, this time slightly older, on the same sidewalk of the same street. I'm still full of grief at this point, so i tell myself ""this is a chance to redeem myself"". I take it to the other side of the road where there's a small public garden, set it down on the grass, step pretty far away as not to startle it and wait for a good 40 minutes, hoping the parents will come back and pick it up.

Nothing happens so I decide to step closer to see if the little guy is alright. I see its mouth is wide open and it's panting, which can be a sign of stress, overheating or both, so I make the decision to pick it up and put it under the shade, next to another bush. About 10 minutes later someone passes by with their dog and starts talking to me. The poor bird must have gotten scared, because it starts quickly hopping away deeper inside the bush. Still full of grief and regret from the morning before I dive into the bush to make sure it doesn't get tangled in the low branches and leaves, and after 10 minutes of searching I find it again and set it down somewhere else that's still shaded. 

As I'm walking away the poor frightened thing decided to start running again, this time towards the road. The grass is very tall in that patch and I briefly lost sight of it, I thought it was much farther away from me than it actually was.

That's when I feel something under my foot and sudden screaming. I jump back and see the poor thing writhing on the ground, screeching. I stepped on it. I stepped on this poor innocent creature while running. The screaming goes on for 10 seconds, then it turns into whimpering, then it stops. Its eyes close and it stops breathing. 

I still feel a terrible clarity while typing this. I cried for Tweezer yesterday, I haven't cry for this one yet but I know the world will come crashing down on me soon. I feel like I should be exiled from society and left to die in a ditch somewhere. I feel like I do not deserve anybody's love, let alone forgiveness. 

Both of them never got to fly. 

We have buried Tweezer in our garden and put the prettiest stone we could find over the grave, I even bought and planted Gladiolus bulbs around it yesterday. But I felt too guilty to bury this one in my own house, so I did it in the place where it died, outside. 

I do not seek reassurance, I do not seek views, I do not need to be heard by anyone, I just need to let this post go like a message in a bottle.  I'm sorry Tweezer, I'm sorry unnamed baby, I loved you both like my own offspring. I wish I could have let your own parents take care of you instead of my uneducated self.

I'm sure both of you are going to fly in the sky tonight. Wings made of stardust, big beady eyes that shine like quasars. You will be my North Star and my Sol. Every other bird will be jealous of you, and your parents will be proud. 

Rest well.

Goodnight.",
230,"I don’t know how to put that in words. A week ago my neighbor committed suicide and I was the one calling 911. To make that story clear, I DID NOT see the body, her husband came running around the hall of my apartment building, ringing my and others doorbells screaming. I didn’t open the door because I was scared, I just called 911. The paramedics over the phone asked me to go and see if the woman can be resuscitated or helped (She did this in her apartment to be clear) So i went to the hall, there were already other neighbors so I asked one man to go and check (I couldn’t bring myself to go in there). I didn’t know the woman, she worked from home I saw her two times in my life, but I knew her husband. I tried to help him in anyway, talked to him, gave him a hug tried to do anything to calm him down until paramedics arrive. I think that’s the decent and normal thing to do?

I called my mom (I’m 17 I live with my parents) and she came rushing home from work to me (didn’t ask her to do it). She also told everyone in my family so everybody called me to ask me “are you okay?” “omg what happened!?” “you’re so strong and brave” “that must’ve been so hard!”. 

The thing is it wasn’t hard for me. I didn’t see the body, I just talk to that man tried to calm him down. I feel like an awful person because it wasn’t hard or traumatizing for me. am I some kind of sociopath that doesn’t feel empathy or something. It was sad, and heartbreaking in the moment, to see that 20 something year old man cry in my arms. But when it ended I just got back to my flat and studied biology because I had finals the next day. Shit like this happens everyday around the world, these people were not my friends, not my family or anything. Am I an awful person? I feel so weird. I just needed to get this off my chest, and I’m scared to tell anyone in real life because I don’t want them to think I’m crazy or anything.
Sorry for any typos english is not my first language.",
231,"I know you love him, I loved him too. I’m sorry you were put into a position where you felt like you had to choose between us. That never should have happened. I’m sorry you have to deal with his hot/cold behavior — it’s part of his mental illness. I’m sorry you had to deal with the stress/anger that I lost control of — it’s my fault for spreading myself too thin. I know you don’t understand but I hope that one day you do. I’m sorry you have to try and figure all this out on your own. I tried my best to give you a solid foundation and all the tools to face life without me. It’s one of the hardest things as a mom, to try and prepare the most precious thing in life to live without you. I hope you remember and use those tools. 

I don’t know exactly why your dad is in denial of his mental illness (I’ve heard this is common) or why he is so against therapy for all of us. I worry because it’s a degenerative disease and will only get worse & above all I just want you to be safe and happy. 

I can’t sleep at night because I just think about you and wonder how you are doing. I miss you so much! I know your dad says I have moved on with my life and my priority is your baby sister but that’s just not how it works. He abandoned his other two kids and later me & it’s one of my greatest fears that he will do the same to you and then you will believe you are all alone. I’m still here  and so is Grandpa and Grandma. Sure, your baby sister requires a lot of attention/energy and maybe some of our activities you find lame since you’re a teenager and all now but babies grow fast and she can wait her turn. I miss our mom & son dates! I know it was rough there for a while since your sister came early but I am still proud of how well you handled it, how sweet and patient you were with her. You are an amazing big brother! It was a big change but we were figuring it out.

You know what else I miss? Taking you and your friends everywhere. They still ask about you. It’s weird not having a morning full of teenage boys yelling skibbidi Ohio and raiding my fridge before school. It’s weird seeing them all walk home from school and not having anyone to give a ride home to or extra cash for whatever. It’s too quiet around here now. I wish your dad would still let you hang out with them and take you guys places. I don’t know why he doesn’t. 

I miss our art projects the most. I hope you still get to work on some. It’s not stupid or silly. We had a lot of fun creating stuff together! I still have all your art work and collectibles. They’re all packed away and safe so your sister doesn’t get ahold of them. 

I’m not sure why your dad hasn’t coordinated picking them up but I don’t feel safe with him here after everything so that’s between him and Grandpa & I think they’re trying to work it out. I try and respect their relationship and let them figure it all out. I’m glad he finally lets you go to Grandpas! I’m hoping he lets you visit with your baby sister too. It’s hard because your dad likes to have control over everything & I resent that very much. I’m working on myself in that aspect and communicating better. I’ve learned that I am probably Autistic so that may be why I have struggled so much and underestimated how much anxiety was affecting you. Anxiety is really hard for me to wrap my head around but I am trying. I still believe we all have faults & things we suck at that we have to constantly work at & do our best to be better at even though it’s hard and we mess up. I don’t believe in just giving up. 

I would never give up on you. I never gave up on your dad either. I have a letter he wrote me when he was still taking medication. Maybe reading it one day will help you understand everything he did to our family and why. It helped me a lot. I don’t think your dad is doing this stuff on purpose— it’s just that his brain isn’t healthy and he is desperately trying to make sense of life and keep going himself. I wish you never had to get caught up in this “adult” stuff. Anyways, I will keep the letter for you and all the paperwork and stuff so you can read it one day when you are ready. Maybe it will help. I don’t know. 

I guess at this point I really don’t know much of anything except that I love you and always will. You are always welcome home and you always have a family here with us. I respect and honor your journey with your dad and learning about him for yourself. I hope you two have a good relationship in the end! I bet you guys are having a lot of fun with fashion. He always hated my style and you guys were always about those shoes and fit lol You needed your dad like that. He was always about that respect and discipline too — since his dad was MIA he picked that up from karate & it’s a great set of morals and structure to have in life! I loved doing karate as a family. Maybe that’s the hardest part of all of this. We had what we thought was a happy little family and now everything is so freaking different. 

None of that is your fault. You are an amazing, smart kid and I know you will have an extraordinary life with or without me! I love you forever wherever you are. ❤️",
232,"Back in July 2021, on the day of Eid al-Adha, I was having lunch at a restaurant in Amsterdam called Pizzeria Steakhouse Amsterdam. I was sitting inside by the window, and there was a man sitting alone outside.

He looked like he might be Gulf Arab — tall, light-skinned, black hair styled to the side, a neatly trimmed short beard, sunglasses, and a fancy watch. I think he was wearing a dark blue or black shirt and white pants. He was talking on the phone — I heard him say “3asakom min 3owadah” which made me think he was calling his family for Eid.

Before he left, he smiled at me… then walked a bit, looked back and smiled again. Then again, one more time. It was one of those moments that feels like time stopped. I didn’t know how to react, so I stayed seated. I’ve thought about it so many times since then — what if I had smiled back, or said something?

I don’t know who he was, and I’ve tried many ways to find him — with no luck. Maybe this is just a memory meant to stay as it is. But I wanted to share it with someone. Thanks for reading.",
233,"He tells me he loves me, that I'm not a burden, that he still wants us, still wants to marry me. But his actions have me doubting that, the way he isn't as loving or clingy, the way it feels like I'm losing him permanently and he's only staying so I don't hurt myself. 
I wish someone, a stranger or a friend, would talk to him about it and ask and get the honest truth. And if it's true give him a pep talk and some guidance, tell him his actions hurt people.

234,"I recently had my birthday (20s) alone in another country and I thought why not try something new since I’m alone and no one will ever know. 

I matched with this girl on a dating app and after talking for abit she said she was a rent-a-girlfriend type. I was horny so I didn’t really think it through, so I decided to try it out. Long story short, she made me jump through hoops to get payment, eg saying they don’t accept cash as its not safe. Eventually after a long while, it was a long while before I realised what was going on and decided to turn around and go home… 

I lost around USD200. I’m not looking for any advice, just taking this as a massive wakeup call. Feel free to laugh at me.

235,"I’ve not done anything for a whole year. Was going to start college (uk) in September at 18f (currently 17).most people start at 16 here. I did one year second year was too sick mentally and physically. So this would’ve been the 3rd school year since comp/high school. So late but I was happy to finally be heading in the right direction. 

Recently got arrested. The police told the college without my knowledge. I’m still under investigation so idk why they did that. The safeguarding officer called me yesterday saying the police called about my investigation and I’m they’re kicking me out so I’m not allowed to apply for a year. So this year will be a year of me just laying around all day again ig watching my friends be ahead of me. Even my younger sister is going to be starting her first year of college this year.

I want to kill myself. Genuinely the college worker probably thought I took it so well because all that was going through my head was “ok this is my reason to kill myself”. I’ve not taken the news “well” all I can think about is suicide because my life feels over. I’ve gotten really drunk tonight to deal with it but still feel suicidal. This feels like my only option really. College was the thing I was looking foward to. Genuinely I was so excited to start again in September because I thought it would be my new start from being in bed all day depressed.

It all feels hopeless. I don’t feel like I deserve to live. And I felt like college this year was the latest possibly acceptable. Now it feels to late. Now I know that doing  anything in my life is impossible. Killing myself is the only real option. 

I’m a bad person anyway so it’s probably worth it. I tried calling a suicide hotline and they told me to do grounding exercises and left. Idk what I was expecting but it didn’t make me feel any better. So I feel suicide really is the only option in this case. And I know I fucked up really bad so I don’t really deserve to live another year anyway. I’m 18 this month. And wow my life isn’t the way I wanted. Suicide is the best option it seems. ",
236,"Hey Reddit, this is going to be a sad one so fair I warning.


in short: I'm a failure, this is a permanent decision that's better for everyone, please give me advice on how to get my affairs in order the smoothest way so that I'm no one's burden.

I've been at this crossroads before in my youth, I had a pretty rough childhood and a pretty toxic family so I have always struggled heavily with depression, I have lived mt whole life in survival up until 2023.


A lot happened that year and I made the decision to live not just be alive, I fell deeply in love with my now fiancé and we spoke about living together one day( it's been long distance but I want to study in his country) and having cats and getting rich on military money. He visited me this year in April and it was amazing but a few bad things happened too unfortunately. Since January this year our relationship has had some big issues but I thought we were past them this April, I was apparently wrong and I have once again failed him, because all it has been my whole life being honest is me failing from one thing to the next.


So yeah we patched things up or so I thought but I can't help but feel like he would be better without me and is only staying with me so I don't hurt myself, the love there was seems to be gone, he isn't as clingy or loving and I find myself begging once again for him to love me.


Then moving onto other matters, I have one friend and I think he hates me a lil, I can't help but feel like I'm failing him too, I'm a shit person I know but I have really been trying to be better and to be worthy of the kindness he shows me,the kindness everyone I love shows me.


My education is messy, I applied to a bunch of Ausbildung only to get rejection emails from every single one, my fiancé says it's because I applied late but the fact they all said they were considering me and all got back to me even tho it was a rejection is a very good sign, I disagree. I failed. Again 
I have no real value and all I see myself as is a burden and a failure.


So I'm at this crossroads again, it hurts more now because I had hopes and dreams for a future but it's obvious to me those will never be reached, I wasted my own potential. I failed. This time I'm not telling anyone, this time I'm sure. I've started quietly getting my affairs in order, it will be done by the first of September, I'm starting by giving away my antique books, then I'm putting all my trinkets in a box for my fiancé. Then it'll be cleaning out my papers putting all the important documents in a folder again. Giving away clothes. 
And so on
I wrote and will keep writing scheduled emails for the 31st of August at 23:00 for my fiancé and my parents, I can't tell them all the feelings now or all the logistics but I want them to have it so that when the day comes they have the pieces of me they missed. I want them to eventually feel like I do, that this was for the better, I want my fiancé to live the life we talked about before I fucked up our relationship, I want my parents to know their daughter, even if I'm a disappointment I feel they would want that. 


I'm thinking of some kind of life insurance but I'm pretty sure no one covers this.


I was also considering getting in contact with people who I used to be close with, I want a little bit of closure, it's weird because up until this point I had never even thought of it. I just want to know they are happy and to return anything they gave me. 


I know it may seem I'm basing this decision on feeling alone and also that it's centered around my relationship troubles, please try and understand that this was my future and the only one I sawworth fighting for. Please understand that this future is one I don't deserve and one I won't let myself have because even if he says it's not true I make the only person I care about absolutely miserable. 


I don't know exactly why I'm posting this beyond the fact that I just need to say it to someone, I need advice on how to get everything in order in the neatest way possible so I won't burden anyone in the end at least. 


Please understand that in this situation this is the most logical decision and that it will be better for everyone else once they get past their grief, my removal is a relief - and I can't live once I've been removed I'm not strong enough anymore, I doubt I ever was.

237,"Ughhh. Background: I have a partner already, we do sometimes have sex with other people and I know they're okay with me being attracted to other people.

238,"I keep trying to tell my story, but everywhere I go—even in places that say ""come as you are""—there are rules about how much pain is too much to share.

""Be personal, but not political.""  
""Be real, but not too raw.""  
""Don't be fake, but don't be too messed up either.""

I get it. I really do. Moderation keeps people safe. Some stories are too dark. Some words are too triggering. Some truths are too much for public spaces. But sometimes I feel like the rules are a mirror of the life I’m trying to heal from: quiet down, don’t make people uncomfortable, keep it neat, make it digestible.

There’s a kind of loneliness that comes from having survived things you’re not allowed to talk about. Not because anyone's trying to silence you maliciously—but because your reality is too sharp, too broken, too “off-script.” So you write the trauma in metaphors. You remove the sharpest edges. You keep the worst parts behind a locked door inside your mind.

And still… you want someone to hear you. Really *hear* you.

I guess I just wish there was a version of the internet where you didn’t have to trade truth for compliance. Where pain didn’t have to be poetic or palatable to be seen.

I’m not mad at the rules. I understand them. But tonight, I feel like I’m bleeding in a language no one’s allowed to speak.

241,"Sabe o que é foda? Eu falo muito sobre o amor. E no meio disso, acabo criando umas “pontes” na minha cabeça. Tipo, tô falando de amor, aí de repente me vem duas pessoas que se amam. E aí vem a pergunta: isso vai virar casamento e um ""felizes para sempre""? Ou vai durar três meses e acabar?

E quando acaba... parece que ninguém mais quer reconstruir. Não querem encarar a dor de frente. Vão pra festa, ficam com várias pessoas, usam drogas pra tentar tapar o buraco. Mas no fundo... não seria mais fácil olhar pra si mesmo? Se reconstruir primeiro? Eu não entendo isso. Acho que é coisa de adulto que não cresceu por dentro. Eu, no meu canto, tentaria superar. Sentir, chorar, viver o luto. Porque pra mim isso é o normal. O saudável. Não sair se machucando mais ainda.

E isso é uma coisa minha: enquanto explico algo, minha cabeça vai puxando outros assuntos. Uma palavra me leva a uma ideia, e essa ideia me leva a outra, como se tudo fosse uma rede infinita de reflexões. E eu sou assim. Um assunto puxa o outro. Amor vira término. Felicidade vira saudade. E, num piscar de olhos... já tô triste sem nem perceber.

Mas o amor, pra mim, não é só dor. A dor que mais pega é a saudade. A vontade de tá perto. De acompanhar. De apoiar. E isso é diferente de querer “ter” a pessoa. O amor verdadeiro, pra mim, é isso: não se apossar, mas desejar que a pessoa seja feliz, com você ou sem você. E é aí que eu fico confuso: será que eu já alcancei esse tipo de amor? Ou só tô chegando perto?

Às vezes eu penso que sempre foi amor. Nunca foi só paixão. Nunca soube separar os dois. Ou talvez, do jeito que eu sou, os dois se misturaram. Só que não de forma tóxica. Porque eu ouço o que os outros vivem, absorvo, aprendo, reflito... mesmo sem ter vivido igual. Eu tento ter empatia real. E por isso, acho que não vou passar por certas coisas. Porque eu já me prometi: vou amar uma única pessoa na minha vida. E vou seguir esse amor até onde der. Só se algo muito fora da curva acontecer, e aí... talvez eu entenda que foi Deus mostrando outro caminho.

Mas enquanto isso, eu tô firme. Sentindo saudade, sim. Mas saudade é normal. Não tenho dependência emocional, só muito sentimento guardado. Não me faz mal... só me aperta o peito. Porque, no fim, tudo que eu queria era amar alguém de verdade. Do jeito mais puro e consciente possível. E eu tô tentando. Tô entendendo. Tô vivendo. Mesmo com todas as dúvidas.

É isso. Só queria tirar isso do peito.",
242,"I’m not afraid of being alone. Solitude doesn’t bother me—it actually gives me peace.
But I can’t lie… sometimes I wonder if there’s anyone out there who feels the way I do. Who thinks deeply, sees patterns, craves real connection but won’t settle for surface-level people just to feel included.

I’ve spent years giving parts of myself to people who didn’t know how to handle them. Not because I’m broken—but because I don’t do masks, I don’t do games, and I don’t do shallow. That seems to make me “too much” in a world that prefers watered-down versions of the truth.

I know human connection isn’t essential to survival, but it’s part of what helps us understand ourselves better. I think that’s the part I miss the most—exchanging thoughts, getting to know how someone else's mind works, realizing you’re not the only one building cathedrals inside your head while the world is content with sandcastles.

So I’m putting this out there—not looking for pity, not looking for validation, just… resonance.
Does anyone else feel this way? Like maybe you’re not meant to fit in—but you still want to find your corner of the world where someone gets it?

If this hits, I’d love to hear from you",
243,"welcome back to my tears, because realizing that i don't matter enough to even break up with is destroying the pieces of me that i glued back together. how long did you wait to ask for space while i kept pouring my love into you? you've already made me out to be the fool, so how much more do you intend to hurt me? i had hope we could work through things, but as the days have stretched on and you don't even care to talk, i know i have to accept what you've done.

i just wish you'd put me through this sooner, because every day closer to our anniversary is killing me. maybe i expected too much of you, to love someone i don't even love. i still love you, my darling. if you're done, please, just tell me. you know what i'm going through, that i don't have the energy to push. just put me out of my misery, please. i'm so tired of crying for someone who left when i needed them most.",
244,"I 19 (f) decided that last night  was the straw that broke the camels back with my relationship with my parents mainly my dad. Essentially I 
forgot to close my curtains and he told me to do it so I nodded in agreement and he started shouting so I put my hands up in a “im gonna do it not arguing or nun way” and that really pissed him off so he started screaming at me and stormed off. My mom stayed silent the whole time and just continued to watch tv. I’m so sick of them it’s the same routine :He yells at me for something it doesn’t matter if I apologise or if I’m activity doing the thing he asked I’m just not done it ,or even if it’s not my mess/my fault it’s just always been me he screams at. I was cleaning the dishes once because my older siblings in their twenties didn’t bother and I wanted to keep the peace and he yelled at me because I’m doing it so he doesn’t give out not because I want to .But who wants to do the dishes ? You do them because you have to.When he’s mad he literally seeks out things to be annoyed aboutt I actively tidy so he can’t scream that no one’s doing it. He went to my art exhibition the other day and he didn’t say one nice thing about my work he just asked why I didn’t have loads of things like everyone else took no interest in my work. He got in a fight with me that morning because I bought him a train ticket to go with free travel  pass and didn’t buy my mother one  so they could both sit even though I let her have my seat ( a seat comes with a online booked ticket  so he atomically had a seat and she can ride for free if she’s with him so I didn’t bother to buy her a ticket).He also got mad I spent five dollars on his ticket even though he needed one and told me to sort it out.As you can gather he’s a nightmare and my mother isn’t exactly better. A few weeks ago my sister bought ingredients to make my brother a cake and then went to a party that same night while his birthday was the next day. I come into the kitchen and my mom seems stressed so I ask whats up and she says “why did you let your sister buy ingredients instead of a cake?” ( she’s 26 I’m 19 I can’t make her do shit bffr). I tell my mom this in nicer words and then she says “ why didn’t you buy him a cake” well one I’m a broke college student and for two I wasn’t aware that she wouldn’t be there to make the cake and honestly I just assumed that like her and my mom talked about the cake situation as I only went with her to the shops to get out of the house. My sister asked her later what was wrong and she goes in an airy voice “ nothings wrong” .like I’m sorry but the person who made the mistake is right there but somehow I’m in the wrong I’m scapegoated for everything I swear.  So after the screaming of last night i officially moved on my journey to get my license so I actually have a means of leaving when I need to and when i officially move out I’m going extremely low contact. I started searching for job to pay for lessons  and I’m saving the rest of the money i make for my masters. I can’t move out because of the housing crisis and I can only really work over summer but this has given me the motivation and the drive to do it so I can move closer to my freedom.",
245,"I've posted on here before about this ex while he was still my boyfriend and also right after he broke up with me.

I (F22) and ExBF (M29) dated for a little over 2 months. Of course, we fell fast and hard since we had both gotten out of relationships around the time we met. We were both in vulnerable places and we leaned on each other. He said I love you first and initiated everything from the beginning including wanting me to sleep over after the first date. We regularly spent weekend together since he lived a bit over an hour away and for the first 2 weeks everything seemed good. We had one bad weekend, but I didn't let myself chalk it up too much since It was my emotional weekend and a situation happened both of us had no control over.

Well from there it went downhill. He became an asshole. Started arguing with me over everything, Making comments about my body, my weight, my teeth, my hair, anything he could think of. He would put me down so bad and then when I would get upset, he would get angry with me and tell me it's just because he loves me and wants me to be healthy. Y'all I am slightly overweight, but I think I still look good. 

Anyways there was one argument in particular where I told myself ""This is the beginning of the end of our relationship."" I knew right then it wouldn't work out but I just wasn't ready to let go. I wanted to give him a chance to here me out on how I was feeling. Tried to chalk it up to miscommunication. Well, that went as well as you could imagine. In any situation I brought up I tried to explain that I wasn't holding on to what the argument was over but how he treated me in certain situations. For instance, the time he yelled at me over asking why we needed a bag for his beer at the gas station. He humiliated me Infront of everyone inside and was bitching me out saying I talk too much. Or the time he screamed at me in the car because I told him the light was green while he was staring at his phone.

The last straw was 1 week after we visit his family out of state. We had a rough time due to what I would like to say is miscommunication but in reality, he just threw a temper tantrum. I went and saw him and he nagged me all night about my weight and my eating habits. I tried sleeping but he wouldn't leave me alone. The next day we went out and he absolutely non stop dogged me on how I looked while we were out in public. I told him I was going home for the weekend because I just wanted to have a peaceful weekend, and he told me to grab everything that was mine because I wasn't coming back. Told me he was blocking me.

Since then, it has been Chaos. He is nonstop blowing up my phone. One-minute he's telling me he loves me and misses me and the next he hates me and wishes he never met me. I suck, Im the worst, I hurt him, I left him. He told me I need to be accountable for what I did to him. He's told me more concerning things like saying he was going to drive his car off a bridge so he could claim insurance on it and was saying ""if I were to die just know I loved you with my whole heart"" I told him if he kept saying suspicious stuff like that I would report him and then he told me if I reported him he would make sure I regretted it for my whole life.

  
I don't know if you all have seen Maddie from the show 911 where she married this sweet guy who love bombed her and everyone thought they had such a perfect relationship and then they got married and he abused her. Well, I feel like this is where that was headed. He's been trying to love bomb me and he even tried to get me to go camping alone with him after I already told him I wanted no contact anymore. I honestly never want to see him again but today he mentioned he had been working over in my area and now I'm worried to even go anywhere alone. I feel like he will try to ""bump"" into me somewhere so he has an excuse to see me. I know he won't show up at my house because I still live with my parents, but it just sucks. 

My parents want me to get a no contact order from the police. I already blocked his number, but he is reaching out through social media, and I am worried if I completely cut out contact, he will start stalking me through other people or literally in person. This is a side of him I never knew existed and honestly its insane to me. I've never had to deal with this before especially with someone who dumped me.

Also to add I have not responded to any messages in over a week. Any money he sends to try to get me to respond I just send back. I have made it really clear that I am not interested in maintaining contact or a friendship or anything. He is convinced I have started seeing someone else (which I haven't) but I refuse to engage. Denying it will only make him think I still care about him. I just ignore all messages. He also has accused me of messaging his ex and telling her about everything since she will no longer reply to him. I also have not done that and more than likely I would beg her to respond just so he will leave me alone.

246,"I think this is the 4th one of all the weddings I've ever attended. My Mom's childhood best friend's daughter(late 30s) got married last Summer. They made it 10 or 11 months. 

My wife and I were invited, the wedding was fine. Cake time, groom has a fork full, goes to feed it to his bride but drags his hand upwards to spear the cake on I guess her cheek. The fork tines end up cutting her upper lip a little and there's this weird 5 mins where they're holding a fancy table napkin against her face to stop the bleeding. I still remember the look my wife gave me, with a shocked ""wtf was he thinking?!?!""  Both of them looked awkward and uncomfortable in the right after moments.

Guys, unless your fiance explicitly tells you to ""Do it!"" for photos or the memory or whatever... don't do it!!

What's the issue?  Money as usual but isn't it always.

248,"Well, in my story he would never find out if I really passed the tests or not, but that wont be important anymore. I will not tell him that I lied about everything, what good would that give me? Anyways, it wont be an easy path, I am going to have to find a job, which today isn't easy, then when I find it, there is no if, wake up super early, and grind every day, earning as much as I can while my expenses grow bigger since I have to pay for my own clothes, shoes, food, and everything. Well, uncle is polar opposite of father, best person in the universe. probably wont even ask me to pay my rent share, borrow me his car and etc. Mother, who we introduce to the story is passive aggressive, she really wants me to really take college and pass the 3 years, although I already decided, so with her I'm only faking that I go take tests, while I actually sleep at uncles when he's not home.

there are a lot of side characters in this story, and some of them, my friends, have asked why dont I start the job now. but- this is a stupid idea, since its already hard to fake exams and the college, it would be 100 times harder to wake up every day and do 8-4 or 7-3 job, come home tired and dead, and lie that I was every day 8 hours at college. yes, that would make me a lot more money until my plan comes- in the summer, but it would be an enormous risk to failing the whole operation. because, I have to fool some other characters, for example grandma, fathers mom, my aunt and basically everyone who asks about the college. and while I'm a pretty good liar, this is very too much.

Now check this out. father is doing what every [insert country name] would do, fake and scam his goverment. I don't accuse that. but- he is doing that in a way that- one half of his pay on the job, the half that is on all the documents, is his one part of the payment. and the other half is washed through my ""college fund"". so that every month I have to pay him 600 euros to his account, not because he is stealing some of ""my"" money- as aunt explained to me, but because he is conning the goverment. I would like to see them how they would have to come up the new way to do that when I break my act!

Thank you for reading, can find part 3 on my account",
249,"We were in a long-distance relationship for 8 years.
We only met in person around 10–15 times, but the connection was real. It wasn’t some random texting thing. We planned a future. We built emotional habits. I genuinely believed she was written for me.

She was beautiful, modest, emotionally reserved — and I loved her more than I can explain.

For most of those 8 years, I was going through the worst storms of my life.
	•	I lost my mother to stage 4 cancer.
	•	My father became paralyzed. I took care of him until he passed away.
	•	I fought for my late father’s property — against my own family, and against actual gangsters and land mafias.
	•	I received threats. Life was genuinely in danger at one point.
	•	I was scammed, betrayed by relatives, and even got pulled into legal battles I never asked for.
	•	My business collapsed. I was financially and emotionally broken.

And still — I held on to her.

She was my anchor. My safest dream. The only thing I believed I could still protect.

⸻

This year, I came to Pakistan.
I was already exhausted — mentally, spiritually, physically.
But I came with hope.
I thought, maybe now we’ll meet. Maybe we’ll finalize marriage plans. Maybe things will start to heal.

But when we met, she confessed something:
For a few months, she had been casually talking to a guy from her university.
She said it wasn’t emotional or serious — but she feared rumors might reach me, so she told me before someone else did.

And it shattered me.
Not just because she talked to someone —
but because she hid it for months.
And she confessed right when I was at my absolute lowest.

I didn’t fight her. I didn’t curse. I just broke. I begged her to tell me the full truth. And then came the worst part.

She and her friend created a fake Instagram account to “test” me.
At first she said it was for “a friend testing her fiancé.”
But later — she admitted:
It was for me. It was her.

And I failed.

In my brokenness, I responded to that fake account.
I flirted. I sexted. I sent a picture I deeply regret.
I didn’t cheat physically. I didn’t fall in love with the fake girl.
But I betrayed her trust, and more than that — I betrayed the version of myself I wanted to be.

She cut me off completely.
She told me I had destroyed the purity of our love.
She told me that when I said, “Maybe you just wanted a clean exit”, that’s what broke her more than anything.
She said I doubted her love — and that meant there was no return.

⸻

And I understand that.
But what I’ll never understand is: Why did she test me in the first place?
She could’ve just talked to me.
She knew I was dying inside. She knew I was surrounded by threats, gangsters, and grief.
She knew I needed love — not a loyalty trap.

And still — she chose to test me.
She’s a good girl. A pure girl. She doesn’t lie, doesn’t flirt.
So why… why would she do that?
Why create that fake account? Why test someone who was already on his knees?

⸻

Now she says my messages hurt her.
She says she wants peace.
She doesn’t want to hate me — but she can’t handle me anymore.

And I get it.
But it doesn’t stop the pain from eating me alive.
I journal for hours. I pray. I read books about healing.
I work, I build, I try to be better.
But some nights — I still find myself asking Allah to just let me pass away peacefully.

Not out of weakness.
But because the weight is unbearable, and because no one knows the whole story.

But I’m still here.
Still trying to survive something that felt like love… but ended in silence.

If you’ve read this far, thank you.",
250,"So, before I start, I just want to say that the text is a bit weird for 2 reasons, first, I talked to artificial intelligence so I had to present it like a fictional story, and second, my english is not the best, but I tried paragraphing things, so I believe you will understand everything. Please ignore my questions to the website and just answer, if you can, the one from the title. I apologize in advance. M20.

Lets say that I have failed 1st year of university, and now am repeating paid first year again at the request of my father, who is an asshole, and cant take no for an answer, so no talking out things with him. My uncle has a flat where he lives alone and will gladly take me with him. My theoretical age is 20 years old, so technically no restrictions from parents, but ""while you live under my roof"" mindset I cant do anything. My plan is to fake the test results (since wtf am I going to get if I tell him that I failed all) and just at the end of the year, when he goes on vacation to sea for 2 weeks, pack up my things and move to my uncles, so when the father comes- ""I left, I am going to find a job, I dont live here anymore."" Do you suggest that in the story I shall tell him that I passed the exams and fake the results, or tell him that I failed (i dont plan to even go take the tests)?

So the father has a mindset, if I tell him I want to leave now, he is the shittiest type of person who will say- you can go- but take off your clothes, phone, and everything else I paid for. Doesnt realize whats done is done and I dont owe him a tiniest bit. When I peacefully asked If I can take a break and try to work after failing 1st time 1st year, he just said one word- no. And I plan my revenge not to be explosive- just calmly say after I've done everything, that I have moved out, with a job and paying half to the uncle, wont ask him for money ever again. He will probably make an excuse that he didn't even go to the university after high school, and he ""doesn't want the same for me."" but I know he's never been told no to and this is the only way, no talking out with an aggressive person that wont stop until his plan is done.

Thank you for reading, can find part 2 in my account",
251,"A few months ago, I ended a two-year relationship with someone I deeply loved. I was always there for her, gave her my all, and tried to be the best partner I could be.

Recently, I found out that while we were still together, she was seeing another guy. They were intimate, and she even cried for me during their encounters but continued with him. After our breakup, she kept seeing him, and now they’re officially together. She claims he treated her better in two weeks than I did in two years.

This revelation has shattered me. I can’t eat, study, or find joy in anything. I feel a mix of anger, betrayal, and deep sadness. I gave her everything, and this is how she repaid me.

252,"I’m only 16, but it feels like I’ve been through too much already.

**Hello everyone!**

For privacy reasons, I’m using fake names. My apologies in advance, as I’m writing this through a translator. My name is Joe, I’m 16, and I’m studying at a sports college. This story will be long, and I kindly ask you to read it to the end.

I was born in Central Asia, in what you might call a poor country. I grew up in a rural village—imagine rural areas in America, but with a budget 100 times smaller. The nearest city was far away, and there were no paved roads. When I was 7 months old, my parents left to work in another country, so I lived with my grandmother (on my mom’s side) and my mom’s sisters. One of them, let’s call her Lily, plays an important role in this story.

From early childhood until I was 5 or 6, they raised me. My parents visited occasionally, but never for more than 10 days. When I was 4, my aunt Lily got married and moved to our family house (my dad’s house, though I lived elsewhere with my grandmother). She was only 17 at the time. A few years later, she had a daughter, and I moved in with her. That’s when things took a dark turn.

We lived in our house, but Lily spent days and nights on her phone, rarely cooking. Sometimes we didn’t eat for an entire day. Her husband worked, but I received no love or care. 💔 Sometimes Lily forced me to stay home all day, and I would just sit in a corner, staring at the wall, doing nothing. I started going to school, where I studied well, but then something worse began.

At night, they told me to sleep at 9 or 10 PM, but I was full of energy and couldn’t fall asleep. Within 10 minutes, they would start being intimate. We all slept in one room—it was a two-room house with a kitchen and a bedroom. I heard everything: their explicit conversations, their actions. I lost count of how many times I witnessed it. In the mornings, used condoms were often left near the couch. They argued a lot during the day. Once, my uncle hit Lily in the face, triggering an epileptic seizure. Her daughter was about 3 at the time, and we were all in the same room.

I was always a good student, an excellent one even, but toward the end of elementary school, something irreversible happened. I started having speech difficulties and began to stutter. I didn’t pay much attention to it at the time, probably because I was young, but I still excelled in school. Words can’t describe how much I suffered. I craved love, which I desperately needed. Lily constantly scolded me—she was barely more than a child herself, and her husband wasn’t a good person. Despite this, I was passionate about many things: singing, dancing, solving Rubik’s cubes, and cooking.

When I entered middle school, my mom returned from abroad. Lily and her family moved to another house. I forgot to mention that I have a younger brother—my mom gave birth to him when I was 4. He grew up with the same grandmother, but we now have a great relationship. My mom gave me a lot of love, but it still wasn’t enough somehow. As I grew older and became more aware, my stuttering worsened, and my grades started to slip. Normal conversations became a struggle. My mom became very nervous over time, and by the end of middle school, I had become extremely withdrawn. I used to be a cheerful, lively, kind boy. Younger cousins loved me, and I was a good brother. Even other kids were drawn to me—I think I have a kind soul.

In our culture, there’s an old tradition called “the system.” In short, you have to respect older students. Our school doesn’t divide into elementary or middle school—it’s grades 1 to 11. When you reach 8th grade, this “system” kicks in. You have to greet older students by shaking their hands every time you see them. If you don’t greet them, greet them incorrectly, or have a sour expression, they beat you. They demanded money, made us buy them cigarettes or alcohol, and forced us to do farm work at their homes. Sometimes they’d call us at 11 or 12 at night for a “meeting,” where they’d beat us. Why didn’t we go to the police? Even if we did, the older kids would find out, call you a “loser,” and beat you even worse the next day.

My mom was very protective and tried to keep me safe by not letting me leave the house. In 8th grade, she got pregnant by my dad, who visited occasionally. During her pregnancy, she changed drastically. She scolded us every day, hit us, called us names, and yelled at me to “speak normally” and stop stuttering, as if I was doing it on purpose. One night, I told her I was going to play soccer, but she knew about the “system” and we argued. She grabbed a knife and threatened to “cut me” if I went outside. I ran out to the porch without shoes, terrified, while she stood in the doorway, yelling at me not to come closer. After 15 minutes, she calmed down, sat in the kitchen, and cried for half an hour. I comforted her, and we went to sleep. But she kept scolding me. One moment I’ll never forget: she was yelling at me over something trivial. I tried to hug her and apologize, but she pushed me away, dragged me to the bedroom, threw me down, and started hitting me—punching my stomach and slamming my head against the wall. It wasn’t the first time. The physical pain was bad, but the emotional pain was worse. I just stood there while she beat me.

I endured everything until 9th grade. Then I decided to leave. In our country, you can pursue further education after 9th grade. My mom had given birth to a baby girl, so I left her with my newborn sister and younger brother. At that time, I was playing soccer. By the way, I was in love with a girl since 5th grade. We were best friends, always together, sitting at the same desk, sometimes hugging. Teachers scolded us for it, saying we’d get in trouble for “hugging in public.” In the end, I confessed my feelings, and she rejected me. That, combined with the fights at home and school, broke me. I started smoking but quit after a month or two—it brought me no joy.

I moved to the capital city to study at a sports college, hoping to train every day and play soccer matches. It felt like a fresh start, and I loved it there. But the reality was disappointing. We were given one ball a week and told to play on a small field. Soccer in our country is underdeveloped. I joined a club, paying €40 a month just to train, but there were no matches against other teams—just practice. After two months, I left and searched for other clubs, but it was pointless. At 16, I was told, “We already have a team.” The best option was my old club, but they required €500 upfront for a year—huge money for us. I could live on €10 a month! My family is relatively well-off thanks to my dad’s job, but it’s still a stretch.

Yesterday, I argued with my mom over the phone. I asked if I could join the club since they sold a cow and had some money. She said, “Finish your studies first, then the club.” I explained that my studies are easy and I’d manage both, but she started yelling, saying, “Are you raising your voice at me?” I tried to calm her down, but she blew it out of proportion. I ended up crying, my nose bleeding, and wished her goodnight before falling asleep. My mom is kind and caring, but when she gets angry, it’s like she becomes a different person.

Now I’m stuck: money problems, speech issues, fights with my mom, no soccer club. People compare my playing to Messi, but coaches don’t notice me. I moved to the capital because my uncle (my mom’s younger brother) studied at the same college and promised to find me a club. He’s a successful athlete with connections, but he hasn’t helped. He comes and goes from work, scolds me, and I’m left cooking every day. We live in a one-room apartment on the 4th floor of a building with a shared bathroom downstairs and a single toilet per floor—shared by boys and girls. It’s chaos.

I don’t know where I’m going or what to do. I don’t want to give up soccer, but it’s nearly impossible to become a professional in our country. Time is running out, and I’m lost. If anyone knows how to help with stuttering, please share. Thank you to everyone who read this. I just needed to vent, and I hope a few people see this.

253,"Before you freak out, I'm not being bullied or something.

When I say against my will, I mean, I'm being backed into a corner with no way out but death or living a life of dread. Why? Because I made a stupid decision.

Heads up: I'm fourteen, I want to be writer so some parts may be dramatic and you can call me Allison or Alli ^_^
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi! So, I was actually supposed to post this like a month ago but I've been procrastinating my death for so long it's actually embarrassing.

I'll get to the point before explaining it: I failed all my classes.
(To be fair, I only failed three but I got 65 - 75's on all the other classes.)

Now why is this so bad that I need to die? Because im that one kid who was sent to gifted programs in elementary school. That one kid who was told if I got anything less than an 80 I would get hit and if I got an 80 I would get told to do better.

This may seem stupid to you but to me this is my whole world. Everything I love and want is on the line. Hanging out with friends, being able to write and do things I enjoy, having a chance at love would be taken away from me in a moments notice. 

I'd be forced to sit at my desk and work. And if I'm not working, do chores. And if I'm not doing chores, get yelled at and if that's not happening, get hit with a belt. With no break in between.

How do I know this? Because my parents flipped out when my sister got an 80. And although they've been more lenient with me, they've let me know on several occasions that if I don't fulfill my responsibilities as a student, things wouldn't be pretty.

So how did I fail my classes you ask? 

Because I may or may have not gotten randomly in a slump.

To be honest, I don't know what happened but I just kind of didn't want to get out of bed and away from my phone. I got randomly tired of living and lazy I suppose.

A week of missing assignment turned into two and next thing you know, it's been a week of me promising myself I would end my life and not doing my assignments.

Time skip, it's now May 14. And unfortunately, tomorrow is parent teacher conference. (My parents don't know about my grades yet so...)

I honestly really hate this situation because I want to live so badly.

I want to continue sharing my passions, I want to make more friends, I want to experience my first kiss, my first heartbreak, I want to experience aging.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is all I have time to write.

I could go into more detail but I don't really have that much time and my aunt's visting for a week so I need a plan on how to hang myself discreetly.

If you want to know more, lmk!!

254,"**TL;DR**  
In March 2025, I (32F) learned my ex-husband (39M), who took our three dogs after our 2021 separation, had been severely neglecting them. One was found emaciated during my ex-husband's eviction. I rescued all three and placed them in safe homes. My ex-husband has been charged with animal neglect but is dodging court and ""traveling."" I'm heartbroken and furious.

**LONG STORY** \---

Back in March, I found out that my (32F) ex-husband (39M) abused our three dogs that he was supposed to be taking care of. When we separated in September of 2021, he requested ""custody"" of the dogs in our separation agreement. After our separation, I continued to check in on the dogs, and everything seemed to be fine - he was feeding them and taking care of them. After our divorce in September of 2022, I didn't speak to him as I was finally moving on with my life.

Fast forward to March 2025 - I get a missed call from animal control and several text alerts that all three of our dogs' microchips had been scanned. I thought maybe the dogs had gotten loose, so I called animal control back. Turns out that the dogs were confiscated during an eviction. During the call, I clarified that my ex-husband was responsible for the dogs and complied with identifying each dog via description. To confirm their identities, a police officer texted me pictures of the dogs. He warned me that two were in decent condition, but that one was in extremely bad shape. I prepared myself for the worst, but whenever I received the pictures, I was astonished. My sweet dogs, who we rescued as puppies, looked sad and scared. The largest dog was emaciated - for reference, he previously weighed 93 pounds and was 36 pounds at his intake into animal control.

In my state of shock, I completely broke down crying. I had to save my babies, but could not take in three dogs as I had 2 cats and 1 dog and lived in a townhome at the time. I broke each dog out of ""jail"" starting with my emaciated dog. My current angel of a husband (32M) and I took him to the emergency vet where we were originally quoted over $4000 to help him. Fortunately, my mom was able to assist us, and his ultimate vet care ended up only being $1600. He was diagnosed with emaciation/starvation, worms, demodex mites, and an ear infection. He was losing hair, had sores all over his body, his skinned was cracked, oozing, and bleeding. He would also need to be fed small meals every 3 hours to start gaining weight and would need to come back to the vet for regular checkups. Fortunately, my dad offered to foster this dog since my he is retired and had the time to devote to the dogs rehabilitation.

The next day, I broke another dog out of ""jail"" so he could go to his new home - far away from my ex-husband. Then the last dog was broken out of ""jail"" the day after that to go live with a foster to treat his seizures so he could be transported for adoption. It broke my heart to give up my dogs after already having to give them up during my divorce, but I know that they are all in such better, loving homes.

As for my piece of shit ex-husband - he was charged with animal neglect. In our state, he could face up to one year in jail. However, on his court date in April, he decided that he wanted a public defender thus pushing his court date to god only knows when. He's now ""traveling"" for work according to his Facebook. My family and his family, who I am still friendly with, think (a) he's convinced he's going to get jail time or (b) he's avoiding the courts hoping they will forget and not prosecute him.

I'm still so pissed and angry at him and sad about my dogs. I still cry over them, especially my dog who was basically 1/3 of his body weight. The officers strongly believe that my ex-husband left this dog in a crate upwards of 12 hours a day. Neighbors claim they saw the two other dogs, but never this dog. My ex-husband even had the audacity to say that the dog was so underweight because of a skin condition, which vets confirmed was bullshit. What happened to this dog was clear neglect.",
255,"So this happened a few years ago but I still think about it randomly because… what the actual hell.

My cousin “T” told everyone she was pregnant. Not just close family—literally the entire extended family, Facebook friends, coworkers, everybody. She had “ultrasound” pics (which we now know were pulled off Google), a visible bump (she wore some kind of foam pad), and even pregnancy cravings she’d talk about at every family dinner.

Her boyfriend was kind of stunned at first, but eventually started stepping up—he told us he was trying to “do right” by her and the baby. My aunt started buying baby stuff, even redecorated a guest room.

Six months in, one of our other cousins decided to throw a surprise baby shower at a nice little Italian restaurant. Everyone was excited, brought gifts, and one person brought a car seat as a group present.

That’s when everything cracked.

T walked in, saw the car seat… and just froze. I mean full body lock-up. Then she said she forgot something in her car and walked out.

She never came back.

We all sat there awkwardly for about 30 minutes before her boyfriend left too. He called my aunt later that night and told her everything: T confessed that she made it all up. No pregnancy. No baby. She said she thought he was going to break up with her and panicked. She figured “once it started, I couldn’t stop.” She was planning to say she lost the baby later.

Everyone was devastated. Some people were angry, others were more worried that she needed serious help. Honestly, I think it started as a lie to buy time, and she just spiraled.

It still blows my mind how long it went on—and that it was a $100 car seat that finally brought the truth out.

Edit : This was very well known in our family when it happened, I don't know how she managed to fake it all that time or if he was also in on the act but you know it's still shocking In any case.",

258,"This has been weighing on me for weeks, but I just feel so devastated…and let down I guess? At the same time, I know a big piece of this situation is my fault.

My Sister (early 40s) and I (late 30s) have, in general, have had a pretty close (if occasionally tumultuous) relationship. Things didn't really become “intense” until she was in her late teens, when she started dating her husband. He's always been very volatile. At the worst, he's abusive. At the least, he's neglectful towards her. Because of this, as I became an adult, my sister started to rely on me more and more for emotional and financial support. I literally gave her thousands of dollars in my 20s, to help her pay rent and activities, because her husband wouldn't support her.  She for one reason or another could not work, so she relied on me for financial support. 

I finally put my foot down about 7 years ago and stopped paying for things. The funny thing is, it was not because I was tired of how she treated me, but rather, how she treated other people. She did not handle my setting boundaries well at first (she initiated NC, but I continued it for months). Once we reconciled (at the insistence of our mom), I ended up still emotionally supporting her for a long time, which brings us to the current situation. 

She finally decided that she wanted to divorce her husband. Initially she claimed it mostly had to do with her husband's behavior, but then decided it was 100% driven by kids vs no kids (she wanted a family, he didn't). Understandable, and whatever reason she decided to focus on, I supported her. She would call me multiple times a day for months talking through her thoughts, through the situation. Everytime I would pick up the phone and talk to her or text her, taking time away from my job and my own family…because I didn't want her to be or feel alone. This has gone on for months. She borrowed $500 from our parents to file for divorce, but was too scared to serve him. So that was an ordeal. 

When she finally told him (still not technically served), he instantly  became nicer and expressed regrets, which made her feel guilty…which made her call me more. 

My husband and I started building a house almost a year ago, and offered her a room. It was in case she needed somewhere to get back on her feet/a fresh start. Instead, she would rather try to lay claim to a house owned by my parents, that she and her husband have driven to disrepair. My parents have several times indicated a desire to sell the house for their retirement, but she cries and begs so they put it off. At this point she has made clear she is waiting for them to die so she can take ownership. 

So where I messed up…at the beginning of April, an extended family member of ours reached out to me and asked about her, stating she seemed so sad lately. This particular family member had lived as a roommate with my sister, her husband, and myself for several years and had witnessed her husband berating her, punching walls, etc., so I guess some part of me felt in that moment it was ok to mention that they were likely getting a divorce. 

Well, about 2 weeks later, this family member calls up our younger sibling to catch up, and the family member mentions that they heard about the divorce. My younger sibling, thinking nothing of it confirms that she filed for divorce, but that any other info will need to come from our sister. A few days later at Easter, my younger sibling casually mentions the conversation with the family member to our sister, again not really thinking anything was wrong. Oh. It was very wrong. She yelled at younger sibling, then tried to storm out of the house. 

I was sitting in the living room trying to calm down my toddler son who had just finished having a tantrum, so I had no idea what had just transpired. It was like a bad movie. She came storming in, and I naturally asked what was wrong? 

This, understandably, caused her to go into a tirade about how I had no right to share her personal information, and it then devolved into just screaming and cursing at me with pure rage. This all happened in front of my husband, son, and extended family. After a minute she basically told everyone to leave her alone and not call her, packed up and left in a ruckus in her car, scaring my aunt and her friend who had just shown up. It was quite dramatic.

She proceeded to block me on her phone and on messaging apps. 

Now where things get messy is that she has bonded with my son. They truly love each other, and I am sad for both of them for this loss, which is my fault. His birthday is coming up and I had always intended to invite her, because I thought she would want to celebrate him regardless of how angry she is at me. I mentioned this to my husband, whose immediate response was absolutely not. He took huge issue with her outburst, especially since she specifically was screaming at me with a look of pure rage while I was holding our son. He felt the she should have asked me to step away before losing it, which I do agree with. 

We decided to compromise and write a letter to my sister (since im still blocked) mentioning the party but also requiring that we at least have a conversation before the party to minimize the risk of an argument or drama. When writing the letter, I chose to share all of my feelings, my regret for the situation and sadness that she is missing out on time with her nephew before we move. I also (maybe foolishly) pointed out a lot of the major events that had taken place that I had just been expected to move past…

- When I refused to take a college course pretending to be her so she could graduate…and her reaction was to threaten to smash all the windows on my car

- When i went to college out of state, my dad happened to have a mental break from (unrelated) financial stress. She called me everyday to tell me it was my fault for leaving, and that if he died it was also my fault

- She found out about my sexual preferences while I was away at school. She decided to share that info with my mother. My mom mocked me and brought it up to embarrass and criticize me more than once.

- When I first refused to continue paying gor everything, she called our parents and told them they better let me move back in with them, or else she was going to kill me. Then, she picked up my living dog and told me to say goodbye, because she was staying and I would never see her again. When I went to the common area to get my deceased dogs ashes, her husband stopped me and threatened to beat the shit out of me if I took them. Out of fear for my life, I left both behind. I didnt speak to her again for almost months before my mom begged us to reconcile. 

- Recently, she has told me and the rest of my family multiple times, that when our parents pass, she is entitled to the house the rents from them, our younger sibling gets my parents current house, and I should get nothing because my husband and I bought our own house. Literally dictating what our inheritance should be. I have made it clear it's up to my parents what they want to do, not her.

These aren't even the extent of things, but I dont want to make this longer than it already is.

Before Easter happened, my husband was so curious about why I would accommodate/ try so hard not to trigger her. Now he has seen how angry she can get, he understands a bit more.

Anyway, I sent the letter 2 weeks ago. I never received any sort of response. The birthday party is happening very soon, and I guess she won't be there. That makes me sad…but I also know I am at fault.",
259,"Sometimes we smile not because we're happy, but because it's the only way to keep people from asking questions.",
260,"I used to think, I don’t like chest hair but recently I saw my boyfriend chest hair, grown after recent trimming and it’s kinda hot, I like I’m gonna lick off his hair chest and I hated doin this earlier and I never saw hair on my ex, and its weird telling anyone I like it",
261,"Hey everyone,

A few years ago, I had a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. Since then, I haven’t been the same person I once was. My behavior has changed drastically, and I struggle deeply with the choices I make. My past has been incredibly painful: sexual abuse and prolonged, extreme violence and systematic abuse by my (now ex-)partner. It left me feeling like I was worth nothing. Shutting off my emotions during sex became a survival mechanism.

After the resuscitation, I suddenly began to act impulsively. My core values began to fade, and I started making choices I never imagined I would—cheating and doing sex work, even though I’m in a relationship. It's something I never thought I’d be capable of, yet here I am. It feels so far removed from who I used to be, and I hate myself for it. I know I’m not helping anyone, especially not the people I love.

I’ve had treatment for PTSD and was open in therapy about my sex work because I want to change, but it was never really addressed. Recently, I was diagnosed with acquired brain injury (ABI), which has helped me understand the changes in my behavior. My brain responds differently now, which influences my decisions—but that realization also makes me more painfully aware of them.

I hate what I’ve become. I hate the behaviors I’m not proud of. I hate the choices I make. I’m sharing this here because I don’t see another way out. I feel completely alone with these feelings. I’ve taken the first step and reached out to an ABI support organization to try to gain more insight into what’s happening. I don’t want to continue with this destructive behavior, but I feel trapped in a vicious cycle. I’m painfully aware of the hurt my actions cause others, and I don’t want to keep hurting anyone.

And please, I’d rather not hear how terrible I am, how worthless, or that I deserve to go to hell—because I already believe those things about myself. Words like that only drag me further into the darkness. Thank you for reading this. It means the world.",
262,"TLDR: logged into brother's account, sent screenshots to his girlfriend, don't know if it's justified or not because he is a cheater and also is exploiting me for his fetish. Don't wanna get in legal trouble either.

I logged into my sibling's discord account a few times to retrieve screenshots of his poor behavior. In the past he has bribed people to meetup with him, even while dating other people. But he's also been groomed/assaulted, and I've gotten at least one of the groomers legally reported. However, he also steals my (feminine) underwear and posts pictures of himself wearing them, leading to people asking to buy the underwear and even pictures of me, which he said he would ""gladly sell"". He has also broken his legal probation many times. I mass reported a lot of creeps and also got his account permanently banned.
However, where I think I messed up is that I (anonymously) sent screenshots of this behavior to his current girlfriend. I thought sharing the cheating would be helpful, as it helped his former girlfriend who he ALSO cheated on. She doesn't seem to care at all that he is a cheater and pervert, and instead my brother says he's gonna get the law involved for being ""hacked"". I don't want to get in legal trouble so I'm probably gonna admit to it, which will destroy whatever ""trust"" he has in me. Not that I want it cuz he's disgusting. I think my parents will hate me, but I don't really care anymore. All I ever wanted at the start was to protect him from the groomers, and all he wanted was to sell pictures of me to perverts on the internet. So this I guess was ""revenge"". Maybe it's wrong, maybe I'll go to hell for it. Whatever. I don't want to see him again and I hope they send him somewhere for breaking probation.",
263,"I know this sounds pathetic. I feel like a loser I’m not really doing anything meaningful in my life and sometimes it makes me feel bad about myself. I’m just a waitress

I ordered a few scrubs online and I’ll walk around in public in scrubs just to feel like a somebody. I feel confident when I wear scrubs. Even though it’s not real. I’ve lied and said I was a nurse when I’ve been stopped by a stranger, they were making conversation and I said I was going to work and he asked what kind of nurse was I and I said I was a nurse at a pediatric hospital. He told me that must be rewarding and I said it really is. Sometimes I get caught up in the lie and forget who I really am and I’ll just make up a work story on the top of my head and my lies and stories are good, people believe them. I have a lot of knowledge about it because a lot of my family are in the medical field 

I don’t want to be in the medical field. It’s too hard and I’m not very smart. I also don’t have the time and money for that. I just enjoy pretending like I am because it makes me feel important. Sometimes friends see me in scrubs and I just tell them it’s comfortable but I know they lowkey think I’m a weirdo lol",
264,"This is new. I don't know if I like it. Actually no, I do like it, it is just so unfamiliar to me that it also feels wrong. In the beginning, even unexciting. It felt slow, but the more that was the case, the more I started to appreciate it. I felt safe in a way I didn't know before.

Suddenly I didn't feel that there was an expectation of something happening, where my past self would have thought to be available as soon as possible. Because that's kind of how society shapes these things. You feel like you have to move fast. Catch the bait before it's too late and it got away, or even worse, got caught by someone else. That's the problem right there though, right? Seeing this as a play of catch. It shouldn't be. It should be an exploration and an experience where you feel no rush, no stress, no expectations.

But that's not what I am used to. I am used to this rush of chasing someone, of passion that is so over the top and intense I lose myself in it so deeply that most of the time I don't even know that I am not even feeling safe. I am used to things being complicated, highly emotional, and not safe. It's what I have learned from childhood, so that's what I know. That's what I attracted and that's what I wrapped my arms around.

It is a false feeling of comfort, one where I feel a false sense of security in what's happening. I know how to behave in these situations, I know how to be the good girl, and to act accordingly. So that's where I feel in control, even though in the reality of it I have no control at all.

And now suddenly that's not what is asked of me. Suddenly there's no remarks, push and pull, no vagueness, no play. It's still raw, but not in a hurting or intense way. The pace is so slow I sometimes felt like I was pushing away or second guessing myself. But there was always his perfect answer to all these questions and uncertainties, that unbeknownst to him, he gave me.

So I let it unfold more, and I embraced this slow, cautious way, and every time it felt more and more secure. A feeling of light enjoyment became a feeling of wanting more of that. Then slowly I realized there was something slowly creeping up on me. I wanted to be closer. I wanted warmth. And the way I got it was the most cautious and gentle way I could have asked for.

Everything felt so new, even though it shouldn't, because I lived all that already. So why is this so unfamiliar in the best way? Where suddenly you feel nervous touching just a hand, looking each other in the eye for too long. A throwback to this feeling you would have if you'd have your first kiss. You know, this build up before it happens. You know it will, but you're too shy to let it happen. But slowly you approach each other and the moment in between, just right before you kiss, this electric feeling.

I only knew that one as the step stone to going all the way. This time I was able to just experience a kiss as raw, secure, and simple as it should be, but with all the intensity behind it in the most gentle way. It didn’t just end there. Every next step over the days and weeks was a slow, exciting exploration of the old in such a new light.

There was no shame, no intrusive thoughts. I don't know how or why, but I feel so perfectly secure in all of it. I don't feel like I am not enough. I feel appreciated. I feel free to talk and ask questions, to suggest and to be bold.

But now it's starting to shift to where I am scared again. Not because of circumstance, but because I am starting to evolve out of curiosity and enjoyment into liking, and maybe more? It feels like this is safe, and even though it's still a lot of new milestones and figuring each other out, I realize this wanting increases. And it becomes more intense slowly. But that's where it starts to get scary.

Will I become too much? Go too fast? Can I let myself allow to be what I feel? Or do I fall into that trap of letting it cloud my judgment again?

Right now I feel like there's this huge wave building up inside of me and the moment it will catch me, I won't have a chance of fighting it. I will be swept away. And in a way, I do want to feel all of this, because I feel like I can without losing myself like I used to in my past.

But what if that is me just falling for the same traps? What if that's me clouding myself again in order to chase something I feel I want?

How much time do I have to give myself before I throw myself into an ocean of waves that slowly sweep me away into the distance and closer to each other?

When is it appropriate? Or did I just forget what is human and what isn't? What is normal and what is emotional instability? I lost my grasp on these feelings so long ago I can't interpret myself.

But I do feel this little flame inside of me trying to ignite again for someone, but this time it feels like there's nothing I have to do to protect it from being killed by the waves, but rather it being protected by them.

Maybe with all of this and the pace it moves, I am slowly building a boat for the waves to bring me further and deeper into something than I could ever let it before.

So the question only stands: am I allowed to give in to this feeling and let myself be swept away?",
265,"today is my birthday and idk... i guess i'm feeling a bit down and i need an outlet because i'm too embarrased to tell anyone i know irl.

266,"One day, I took her and another friend out for pizza. We took pictures, and I only posted one of the other friend because she was on social media. That’s all. But that small, innocent decision turned into a storm. My “best friend” felt offended, started blaming me, and told others I was being exclusive or shady. She spread rumors and made it sound like I had intentionally hurt her. I didn’t understand what was happening — I was a kid.

Soon after, I became the target. I remember the judgmental stares, the way classmates frowned at me like I was on trial. They ganged up, asked me loaded questions, and made me feel like I had done something unforgivable — when I hadn’t done anything wrong at all.

Then it turned into bullying — the real kind. I was poked with needles, tripped on purpose, and humiliated.

There’s one memory I can’t shake: it was the last period of school — games hour — and all the students were on the field. No one wanted to play with me, so I sat near the school gate, alone. My grandmother had come to pick me up and was standing at the gate, waiting. That’s when a group of girls — including my so-called best friend — came up and surrounded me. They used their legs to block me from walking away. Most of them began questioning me, ganging up while my grandmother watched helplessly from outside the gate. I couldn’t hold it together. I started crying the moment she came in.

Later, my grandmother said she considered filing a complaint with the police because of how cruelly I was treated. I will never forget that day.

And it wasn’t just one incident. They made fun of my food. How I spoke. How my grandmother spoke. How I looked. There was a constant undertone of judgment and mockery — and I kept wondering what I had done to deserve it.

Years passed. And then, this same girl reached out to me. I thought maybe she had changed. I was willing to forgive. Maybe time had softened us both. For a while, everything seemed okay — until one day, she randomly told me that nobody from our class liked her because *I* went around saying bad things about them. She blamed me — again — for something I never did.

When I pointed out some of her present-day behavior (like tracking people’s grades and making comparisons), she got defensive. She claimed others were just too scared to confront her and even bragged about being aggressive in school. Another old classmate told me that she once deliberately lowered someone’s marks out of jealousy.

Later, she said something that stuck with me: “You weren’t less either — you talked back. And your granny was the one who threatened police.”

As if *defending myself* or *being hurt* justified what they did.

Eventually, she unfollowed me and started acting cold again. I realized — the person I forgave never really changed. She just found ways to reframe the past to make herself feel better.

I don’t carry hatred anymore. But I do carry the truth.

I’m not ashamed of the kid I was — scared, alone, yet still strong enough to survive it. And I’m definitely not ashamed of the grandmother who loved me enough to stand up when no one else did.

To anyone else carrying childhood wounds that still ache — I see you. And you don’t have to apologize for surviving.

Thanks for letting me share.

268,"As the title says, I took a MyHeritage DNA test recently—mostly out of curiosity about where my ancestry might trace back to.

I mentioned it to my dad in a text, and he unexpectedly called, asking me to come to his place the next day. That was unusual—he lives out in the countryside and normally comes to me. I honestly thought he was going to tell me he was ill or something.

When I arrived, both he and my mum (they’re separated) were there, which was even stranger. They sat me down and told me the man I’ve always called Dad isn’t my biological father. The biological one disappeared a long time ago, and frankly, I have no interest in knowing anything about him. Only the three of us know, and I plan to keep it that way—but I needed to get this off my chest.

The funny thing is, the thought crossed my mind years ago. When I was about 12, I found my birth certificate and saw a different man listed as my father. When I asked my mum, she told me my dad had used a fake name so she could keep receiving some kind of child benefit. It sounded plausible enough at the time, so I never questioned it again.

I do feel a bit sad knowing he’s not my biological dad, because he’s honestly the best father I could have asked for. In a strange way, this has made me admire him even more—for stepping up and raising someone else’s child without ever letting it show.

It also explains why I have the middle name I do—it’s my biological father’s name, one I’ve always disliked. So now, as a way of honouring the man who chose to be my dad, I’ve decided to legally change my middle name to his. It’s the least I can do to show how grateful I am.",
269,"Hi, I’m 19. I know this post might be long, but I just need to let it out.

I feel like I’m falling apart. I used to believe I could do something with my life. I finished 12th with 83% but my parents weren’t proud. I kept thinking, “Maybe next year I’ll prove myself.” But everything I touched just failed.

I took a drop year to prepare for entrance exams. My family spent so much money — coaching centres, online classes — and I still failed. Not because I didn’t care, but because my mind just wasn’t okay. I couldn’t adjust, I felt lost, I couldn’t study or focus. I felt like a total misfit everywhere. I thought I was lazy at first, but now I feel like I’m mentally breaking.

I also ruined a relationship with someone who genuinely loved me. I hurt him deeply, and I carry that guilt every day. I feel like I push away everyone who ever loved me. I don’t know why I’m like this.

Now I’m just left with silence. No friends. My family looks tired. Relatives talk like I’m a mistake. I feel like I’ve become a burden. Like I messed up everything — studies, people, even my own peace.

There are days when I just cry alone. Sometimes I think maybe I shouldn’t exist — maybe then my parents will be happier without this weight on them. I don’t want to think like that, but these thoughts keep coming.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t know if this is depression or something else. But I feel like I’m slowly dying inside.

If you’ve been through this, please let me know how you got through. Even a few kind words would help. I’m tired of pretending I’m okay.

270,"I'm using a throw-away because this is so embarrassing. The water in my apartment building has been out since yesterday and I found out from my neighbor when I got home. I was mad because I wanted to workout but wouldn't be able to take a shower. Ok, not a huge deal. 

This morning, I'm not feeling well but because I'm the type that is really sensitive to medicine and various things, I get nauseous a lot and try to wait it out. I had been at work for a few hours but it just kept getting worse. I tell my manager that I'm going to work from home the rest of the day and leave. When I get home I start to feel like I'm going to throw up and realize that the water is still out, even though the property manager said it was on again. There are construction guys out front and I ask if that's what they're working on since the notice on the front door of the building says that the water was turned off because the bill hasn't been paid. They said it should be done today but that doesn't help me in my current situation. 

In my mind I'm searching for a scenario where I can be sick without making a mess or having to deal with a toilet that can't be flushed for who knows how long??? I honestly don't have much time to figure it out, so I scramble and put plastic wrap around the whole toilet bowl with the sides held in place by the toilet seat. I am almost crying because this is so humiliating and I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do if this keeps happening. When I'm done I manage to wrap everything up with the plastic wrap and am able to put it in a dog poop bag. I can't believe this is my life right now. 

I feel better for an hour or so and then I'm really nauseous. I'm fighting it with everything I have in me but eventually I know that it's going to happen. Now I'm running around my apartment trying to find some kind of plastic bag. Thankfully I find one just in time to barf in it. 

An hour later I can tell that I'm going to need to use the toilet again and there's nothing I can do to stop what's coming, so I'm frantically looking around my apartment for some kind of savior. I end up with a Home Depot bucket and a trash bag this go around and am just grateful that I didn't make a huge mess since I don't really have the energy to clean it up. 

I'm still watching the construction guys outside trying to fix the sewer pipe and PRAYING that I will have water in the next few hours. This has been a horrible experience and I hope no one else ever has to deal with this humiliation. ",
271,"Apologies in advance for any messy language, but this is a horrible situation and I don't have the energy to fix it.

So. My friend (16 at the time) found herself a boyfriend on a sketchy Omegle like app, and sure, that would've been normal considering our age and all that. But he's like 25. He moved to our city immediately after he met her and started dating her. 

Sure, it's like a 8-9 year age gap, not too dramatic if it wasn't for the fact that she's in her second year of highschool, and he is already post uni, working a full time job. Immediately that just felt wrong to me, the maturity age gap and everything else just felt too high.

I hate the guy.

He keeps making jokes about her being inexperienced, he makes jokes about her being young, he jokes about her being a child at this point, and yet he's still dating her. he makes odd comments about her childhood photos, I've been nearby when he does that. 

Maybe it's just my imagination, maybe this is normal, this is just regular banter between two loving partners, but it feels and sounds wrong and I don't even know how to describe it. I hate him. 

And I told her that I hate him, he's pushing her to do things she doesn't like nor want to do, they've been arguing for half of their relationship, but anytime they're on the brink of breaking up, they make up (from her insistence) and it's all cool. But then they argue again, and again. He constantly uses the argument that he moved to our city for her and how dare she be so ungrateful.

Instead, I got pushed away. Hard. Our entire friend group is somehow accepting of this guy, while also hating him, but also not. It seems like me and only one of my friends see it as genuine grooming.

I've been a victim of grooming before. I know how it works, I've experienced this, and it seems so close to how it started for me I am terrified for her and what he might do but he's oddly respectful, besides the times he's not.

It feels like since she got with him she healed, just a bit, so I don't want to take that away from her, I can't, but at the same time, I know that every argument pulls her away from healing and then they make up and she's happy but then she's not and it's this circle of unfortunate circumstances.

I decided I wouldn't speak of him, I avoid any conversation regarding him, I don't talk about him, but that just pushes me further away from them but I can't seem to push away the unease because every word she speaks of him is so, so uneasy and it's terrifying.

I just wish I acted like he's perfectly normal. I wish I never told her I hate him, I wish I never did all of that and maybe I'd still have my best friend, but it's been different, I can tell it's been different, and I can't seem to think that I messed up hard by doing everything wrong and suddenly everything is quiet besides certain moments where we're still laughing at school but I can tell I'm being ignored by then. 

But it is legal, i can't do anything, and I guess that makes it completely acceptable. It still makes me want to throw up anytime I think about it.",
272,"Some background:  
I grew up in a fundamentalist, evangelical Christian family and was pretty much drilled with constant scripture and conspiracy theories. I started to drift away from the faith as I began to enter high school as I began to think critically about faith and spirituality and came to the conclusion that the faith I grew up with wasn't what I believed to be the objective truth of the world, and became an agnostic for a while.  
I also began to date my first and current girlfriend in my freshman year of highschool, and we've been extremely close. We've always had opposing views on everything and I feel like we complimented each other because we had such different tastes and styles and that kind of allowed us to compromise a lot and explore new things, ideas and concepts together. We've been dating for almost 4 years and we both turned 18 recently, about to graduate highschool and go to college together.   
I have extremely strong feelings for her and I really would like to marry her once we're finished with our education, with children in mind. I love her very much.

However, recently I've begun to have almost daily nightmares, to describe how real they felt would be impossible to do over text, they felt REAL. As if I was there, as if I could feel everything, and not only that, every time I woke up from them I could feel dread and an almost heavy weight on my heart, as if the feelings I had were going to explode out of my veins any moment like they were real injuries.   
What scares me more is the content of the dreams, they always involve my girlfriend, and they always involve her either contracting an illness/lethal disease or dying unexpectedly, and being able to see her in a literal pit of fire afterwards in what I can only interpret as ""hell"".   
The dreams scare me so much because I imagine a future with my girlfriend, I want kids, I want marriage, I want her to be with me until we're old, that's how much I feel for her, and I've always been a hopeless romantic. I believe in the idea of soulmates, and I believe in love after death. I don't believe in divorce or remarriage, for me anyways. The idea that she might die before me and go to a spiritual plane I can't go with her scares me. I'm scared of being separated from her, permanently. This is my greatest fear now.   
I know the dreams aren't random, before the first night of nightmares I never thought about the status of the human soul after death, or even contemplated that someone I'm close to could die at any moment. I didn't have any religious encounters until that night, I didn't seek out religion and religion didn't seek out me. There's nothing I can think of psychologically that could've caused the dreams to suddenly become a constant, haunting thing every night.  
After the 3rd night of nightmares, I woke up sometime around 2AM, I couldn't sleep and finally confided in some friends who happened to be practicing Catholics, they recommended me to seek out a priest and instead of waiting until morning like a normal person I immediately hopped in my car and drove to the nearest Catholic Church, a traditional location about 20 minutes away. Of course it wasn't open at 2AM and all the doors were closed and locked but I walked around, looked inside through the windows at the icons of Christ, the Virgin Mary and the saints, and sat on a bench in front of a statue of the Virgin Mary, and just looking at it. In that moment I felt as though someone was watching me, and the heaviness in my heart felt like a 50 pound weight was just dropped on top of everything I was already feeling. I drove home, and the feeling didn't leave me.   
The feelings I felt in the morning only intensified since the night I went to visit the Church, I feel guilt for what I can interpret as ""sins"", or morally wrong actions I've done throughout my life, and by my life, I mean my life, in my normal day now I can randomly remember something wrong I did years ago, like stealing 5 bucks or lying to my parents in middle school. I feel like I've disappointed somebody, the same feeling you get when you disappoint your Dad. It's driving me insane.   
Being raised in a fundamentalist evangelical family never gave me feelings like this, but suddenly just seeing Catholic icons and the Virgin Mary have caused this sudden emotional and spiritual transformation overnight? I never critically thought about my sins or the actions I've done wrong, and more than that, I've been actively avoiding my vices and negative behavior, I don't raise my voice, I try to calm myself down before getting frustrated, I tell myself not to hate others, I don't vape or drink alcohol, I've stopped using as much profanity in my daily speech. My girlfriend tells me its like I've become an entirely different person overnight.   
My religious friends are convinced I've received some kind of revelation from God or whatever, and even my non-religious friends are telling me that I should pursue this encounter further. I've learned how to pray the rosary and will be consulting a Catholic priest about my nightmares and the emotions I'm feeling.   
When I brought up the idea that it might be the work of spirituality and religion, my girlfriend scoffed at the idea, she's a cradle Catholic but has been an atheist in the time we've been dating.  
I'm going to be attending my first Traditional Latin Mass at the church I went to visit this Sunday, I'm praying the nightmares will stop. They've stopped being as frequent and less real as they used to but they're still there. 

I'm praying that the feelings I have since the nightmares began and my visit to the church will soon end. I'm beginning the catechumen process and getting a rosary, I've begun to pray every morning when I wake up and every night before I go to bed. I pray the nightmares aren't visions, and that they're just nightmares, otherwise I'm lost. ",

So idk how to introduce myself I'm just a guy who took 3 drops for neet failed in all the three with low marks ,but the story isn't about me it's about how me my two brothers and my mother is facing and will always face problems in our life ,We were never a happy family my father always use to charge on my mother, because of his smoking and drinking habits also he stopped earning a long time ago and that made us real poor but back in 2018 my mother decided to do something so she started working as a care taker who take cares of patient ,fyi we have a lot of loans like maybe 6 lakhs as of now and my mum use to work day and night to end all of them but after a while we have to take debts to pay loan and now it's a never ending loop because it's not ending,i always wanted to do something for my mother but she wanted to educate us so i started preparing for neet without coaching but after giving it tries i failed ,the one more reason of me taking drops was that we were unable to manage college admission fee ,my mum earn 18k a month (not all the time because patients dies too) and we have loans of 21k ,idk how she's managing all of it ,and now i feel like doing something but unfortunately I can't because due to lack of nutrition we are really weak and I'm the most weakest one , I just can't study and be educated to change this situation but now i think I can't due to lack of money ,i always prayed to God but now i stopped it because nothing is changing inspite of doing so much 
People come and abuse my mother because of debts, sometimes i feel like dying but I can't because she only believes in me,but I can't do anything im such a loser,i should've died the day I took birth,and if there's God whys they not listening to me ?",

I'm worried it won't last long.

I'm wondering how long it will take for them to change their mind, for me to get replaced.

Of course these are silly feelings. I should just enjoy being appreciated, It's wonderful to be special to someone. It feels awesome. And it's okay if things change. 

But god it's so hard not to despair. How many times have I been someones favorite and it ended up in flames?",
276,"Since the pandemic, it feels like there is an uptick in people on their phones at the theaters. Last 10 movies I saw, every single one has had at least two people sitting in front of me compulsively checking their phones, every 2-5 minutes, and probably at least 4-5 people in the theater as a whole. Its so annoying. Not one of the staff check in on the screening to kick people out. 

I usually tell them to turn it off but if they keep checking it after there isnt much you can do. Tell them again to the same effect? Leave the theater, go tell a staff member and miss 20 minutes of the story? Make a big scene and ruin your night? 

I dont know if its tick tock brain rot, but ffs if you cant pay attention to a movie without checking your phone every 5 minutes, just stay home. ",
277,"I don’t know how to say this without sounding dramatic, but I genuinely don’t think I’ve ever been *loved*—not truly. Not without conditions. Not without performance.

Every time someone said they cared about me, it felt like there was a silent asterisk at the end:  
*as long as you stay happy.*  
*as long as you don’t complain.*  
*as long as you don’t make it inconvenient to care about you.*

I was always the “strong” one. The helper. The listener. The reliable one. And at some point, I started believing that if I wasn't those things—if I wasn't useful—then I didn’t deserve anything at all.

So I wore the smile. I said ""I'm fine"" until it became muscle memory. I held other people’s grief while silently drowning in my own.

The worst part? I don't think anyone noticed.

Not when I stopped texting back. Not when I started sleeping through days. Not when I stood in the shower trying to remember what it felt like to *want* anything at all.

278,"I have been up since 3 am and I am going to work in 2 hours. I was laying here thinking about how the new guy is trying to show I am incompetent by sending on the work group I left cleaning supplies, in the light machinery room. I left a trolley a broom. The light machinery is the fuse board for the lift. That only goes to one floor. I am the Deputy Manager at this site, and have been promoted after working my way up from 0 zero hour contract to Deputy in 9 months. I take every shift and even have done 20 days consecutive work.  

I earned my place, I have been through 12 courses in that warehouse, I even cleaned it 8000 sqft! Did the site increase of use by 3% in my first month.

Now at 38, some 26 year old guy, who asked me if he could wear shorts to work is trying to get me over a broom in a closet. I feel like calling him up and being like ""Good Luck"". 

Also what a F*cking snitch. I reported him. Got written proof of him being rude over handover notes. 

My view is this, I could let it slide, if he wasn't late for his shift. But 10 mins every time...this guy is in probabation...warehousing accepts almost anything but health and safety issues and lateness are inadmissible.",

She came clean on her own due to her guilty conscience but continued to text him for weeks after. Breaking things off with him gently while I was devastated and being told to get over it!! Maybe the first sign that I should have run. 

We stay together cause we feel we have something special, I’m a very generous person, and I will give my all to a relationship that I think is worth it. She helped out a motivational speaker that spoke to kids about school violence and seemed that she really believed in the cause, that being said I paid for her to fly to Miami and be part of a convention only to find out later that her and this guy had a sexual past before we met. She claimed that there was nothing between them anymore, but in my book, I should’ve had that information before I forked over all the cash to send her. 

I’ve never been an overly jealous person, but it did strike me odd that 90% of her friends were male and after some heated discussions about these Guy friends. It came out that she slept with most of them but now we’re just friends. 

We do have something very special, but if I’m honest, all of these relevations are really getting to me and I’m wondering if it’s time to walk away. ",

I flunked out of college for the second time, and now i’m applying to an apprenticeship. I keep changing my mind on what I wanna do in my life, and it always ends up being the wrong decision. The fact that I also isolated myself from everyone makes it worse. When I had graduated high school, I was at my best. I was going to college on a scholarship, and I had friends. Women liked talking to me. I was at my best with my mental health as well. Everything seemed to be going great. Then I got sucked into the frat life, and got kicked out because I wasn’t going to classes. I left, got my shit together and moved back home. I went to community college, and got a job. Then I found my girlfriend. I thought I had finally recovered and came back stronger than I was before. Then she started sucking the life out of me. No matter how much I tried, she was never satisfied, so I finally broke and left. Im really unhappy with myself and who i’ve become. I get to see some of my friends graduate next year, and I really am happy for them. I just wish I didn’t have to go through what I did.

282,"Came back to update cause I felt horrible after I made the initial post, but I've felt better since then and have thought more about the after.  This post will continue the after.

TLDR for first post:  I was stationed in Germany and my pregnant wife was home in the states.  She went to ER and her doc told me her and the baby may not make it.  My higher ups denied my going home due to impending medical discharge from service that I still didn't know a date for.

That first week I literally just functioned.  I did my duty but don't remember it.  I checked in on my wife when she was awake, but she was out of it a lot and thankfully her mom shut her shop down for a week to be there cause the time difference was not in my favor.  I drank a lot and my buddy who I will call Broke Dick would walk with me to the nearest store to get more alcohol and check on me.  (Broke Dick was what i would consider a close friend and the name is a sign of how close we were cause military dudes are jackasses like that...  Also he had a broke dick due to a medical issue we all including him made jokes about.  He is better now, but he doesn't get to change his name now anymore than I get to change mine which I won't be sharing.  We met on first day of basic. I comforted him when he failed his PT test and wasn't allowed to start his training.  We reunited at our job training after basic and were sent to our first unit together.)  I got emailed pics from my wife and my mom of my kid and these both helped and hurt me.  Seeing all those machines hooked up, tubes connected seemingly everywhere, that hurt.  On the other hand, here was my kid fighting for their life and winning.  I sort of remember showing off every picture I was sent to anyone who came to check on me in the barracks.  I don't remember who came besides Broke Dick, but I remember fighting back tears while showing them off a number of times.

Wife was allowed to go home on the 8th day and we spent a fair amount of the time talking on the phone about nothing while I drank slower that night.  Work was still pointless bullshit that was the same drudgery we'd been doing for months that meant nothing to anyone.  Broke Dick kept checkin in on me, but just long enough to see I'm chattin with the wife and later to make sure I was eating something.  He cooked me food a number of times if I hadn't.  Received more pics of my kid and still fighting strong, but could still go either way at this point.

Following couple weeks were pretty much the same except wife is getting better and kid is getting stronger, until I'm grabbed by my team leader again and we have to go see first sergeant again.  Standing at parade rest in his office with my team leader next to me, platoon leader, platoon sergeant and first sergeant are across from us at his desk.  FS asks if I want to reconsider my medical discharge and stay in the service?  I gritted my teeth for a moment so hard that my jaw hurt and made a fist behind my back so fast that I'm sure my team leader heard the knuckles popping.  Let the air out slow through the nose so it didn't make a ton of noise and trying to keep a calm and respectful tone in my response, I told him I'm quite sure about my choice, especially with my wife and kid in their current conditions.  He let out a sigh and told me I was being discharged in two weeks.  He handed me paperwork, told team leader what needed to be done and dismissed us.  

Walked out of that building almost floating and after getting permission from team leader to go smoke, I called the wife while chain smoking in joy for the first time in a while.  She answered groggily due to my waking her up which i apologized for and started crying when I told her which i did not apologize for.  Let her go back to sleep and finished out my day.  

Spent the next two weeks bumming rides from whoever wanted to get out of duty for the day to help me with clearing.  Wife went back to work during this time period so calls got more limited but she kept sending me emails with pics to make up for it.  Stuff in my room got shipped out 2 days before I left.  Arrangements had to be made so I could go get my car from a friend in Arizona and drive it home since I wouldn't be able to afford to fly down and get it at a later date.  That time went fast.  Until the final night before I left.  That night took forever.  It was the longest 75 years of my life.  Talked to the wife for a couple hours.  Got my mom to turn my US phone turned back on so I'd be good to go the next day.  Literally twiddled my thumbs at a number of points.  Finally the sun came up, and with it, my team leader showed up to do a final walkthrough and sign me out.  Shortly after that, ride to airport showed up and we were away.

Gonna stop there for now cause I'm frankly tired of thinking about back then and I'll do a final update when I'm good again.",

They tell me it shouldn't take too much time for a mechanic to figure out why the check engine light is on in my car as if that's my main concern. They constantly remind me to save like crazy for retirement when I can barely afford the little bit of money I put away now.

They already owned a house and had three kids at my age. They bought new cars every five years. They took us on family vacations. We went out to eat at nice restaurants every so often. Both of my older brothers ended up on the same trajectory as them while I barely limp along. It's bad enough being a failure but constantly having to explain it to them makes it feel so much worse.",
285,"I still feel like shit about something that happened over 3 years ago. 

I was having issues in my relationship and I was drinking at a friends bar. I made friends with some people at the bar, and I swore the guy was gay. I know I had too much to drink. My friend from the bar told me later that I puked behind the bar, my new “friends” held my hair and offered me a ride. I blacked out completely, when I woke up I was naked in this guys bed, who I thought was gay. I was telling him I still believed that he was gay and he said if he was so gay why did we just have sex. I had an extremely vague memory of him on top of me, I know he wasn't lying.

I have never blacked out before from drinking. I’ve had fuzzy memories but not everything just gone. It was a really scary experience. A big part of me wonders if I was drugged but I know I did have more to drink than was smart. 

It all makes me want to throw up when I think about it.

Also the guy had later texted me telling me not to listen to the lies his friends were telling me about what happened that night. I didn't have their contact info, nor do I know what he was referring to. It makes me suspicious that he drugged me or purposefully took advantage of me, but at this point I'll never know.

I never told my partner because I know he would only have considered it cheating, and not consider that I was beyond the point of consent. I felt violated and incredibly guilty. I know I should have made better choices.

TLDR: I got super drunk or drugged. I blacked out and came to after having sex with a stranger that I believed was gay. I have never told anyone. ",

SHE BELIEVED ME. said “oh no, take all the time you need.” and i did. and what did i do with that time? did i grieve fake-grandma? nah. i booted up chatgpt,used an echo writing prompt, fed it my old essays, and sat there while it literally ghostwrote my trauma essay like some digital séance.

the freaky part is it sounded like me. like if you printed out my internal monologue, spilled coffee on it, and then handed it back with teacher comments. every “kinda,” every weird side-rant—it knew.

i don’t know what’s worse: that echo writing helped me write it, or that i didn’t even feel bad when i hit submit. like i was proud of it. proud of an essay built on a lie and a missing urn that’s actually still on top of our fridge behind a cereal box.

i feel like a scammer. or a prophet. maybe both.

i just needed to put this somewhere before my brain melts from carrying this sin. grandma if you’re watching, i’m sorry. your ashes gave me 48 extra hours and an A-minus.

i owe you.

287,"Hey Reddit,
I’m really upset and needed to get this off my chest. I’m part of a team working on a project, and recently we were divided into sub-teams. In my sub-team, it’s just me and one other girl (who is also my friend—or at least, I thought so). 

We were assigned a task to prepare around 100 documents. I genuinely took on most of the load and ended up doing about 60–70% of the work. She did maybe 20–30%, and I didn’t mind at first because I just wanted to be helpful and get the task done for the team.

But here’s where it hurt—during a team call where we were all sharing updates, she casually said she had completed all the 100 documents the previous day. She made it sound like she was solely responsible for the entire task, and didn’t mention my efforts at all. I was stunned and honestly, I didn’t know what to say in that moment.

Now, the rest of the team thinks she’s this super hardworking person, and I’m just... there, maybe doing nothing or ""timepass"" as some would say. It hurts so much because I put in real effort, worked late, and never once thought about stealing someone else’s credit. But this isn’t the first time either—she has a pattern of taking credit for things I’ve contributed to.

I feel completely sidelined. People now seem to think she’s more competent than me, and it’s really affecting my confidence. I’m not someone who likes drama or calling people out, but I also don’t want to keep getting stepped on like this.

Part of me wants some kind of “accidental revenge” (not harmful, just something to balance things out). But mostly, I just want to know:
What should I do? How do I make sure my efforts are recognized without sounding petty or confrontational?

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?

Forgot to tell you guys from my team only i and here are from same place and the rest of the team resides in foreign country. 


Thanks for Reading.

I may not know who you are, your entire life, or know the pains you suffered even when you told me some. But i wish.. that you won't give up either and hopefully will find a way. 

I know you guys have potential. You may have wounds that no one understands...

Make at least one little good decision and it might change everything. Now or never!

289,"This might be a long rant, but I need to vent.

I'm 32 and have known my friend ""Amy"" since we were like 15-16. We got to know each other online, then we eventually met in person a few years later. She later moved to my town for uni, and we were roommates for a while. She calls/used to call me her sister, but I don't feel the same.

She's always been a bit unhinged, these are just some of the things she's done.

While we were roommates, she was dating different guys and begged me not to say anything to her fiance (who lives in another town). I was too weak/naive at that point to not obey her.

A couple of years later, she asks me to take care of her cat for a couple of days while she visits her fiance. I was a bit hesitant since I already had two cats and wasn't sure how they'd get along, but okay. That part went fine, but she called me crying after a few hours saying that her fiance broke of their engagement and she was on the train home. She was devastated. I picked her up from the train station, bought her favourite snacks and told her to stay with me for a few days.
She stayed one night, then came back with her boyfriend that she'd apparently been seeing for months. Said she was gonna stay with him now and asked me to keep the cat for a few more days, and not tell him why the cat was with me (since he didn't know about the fiance). Again, foolish of me.

She was also quite limitless when I was dating, I have multiple examples but the one that sticks out is when she showed up unannounced on a first date (with my now boyfriend). She wanted to sit with us and got mad at me when I said no, called me a bad friend etc. It seemed like she wanted to be a part of the date and vet my future partner, she even told him that he'd need her approval first(?!).

Not long after that, I turned 30 and had booked the sauna in my apartment complex. I invited her + bf, my bf and another friend of mine. We heard them being intimate in the showers, they pretended like nothing happened but it was obvious and really awkward.

Shortly after that, I had to put my cat down and while I was taking his body home to my parents for burial, she texts me saying that her ex-fiance might have someone new. I didn't respond then because I had other things on my mind, and she got really mad. She also got mad when I had a severe cold a few weeks later, blamed me for always having excuses not to meet up and kept calling me multiple times after I had said no.

That last part was about 2 years ago. During this time, she also told me she was bipolar. It turned out to be a lie, but I wouldn't be surprised if she is bipolar or has a personality disorder.
I know that I held out for far too long, but I told her then that I needed a break from our friendship. More incidents have happened.

I'm doing fine without her, I know she wasn't really a friend, but I'm still affected by all of this.

Yesterday, she wrote and asked if we could meet (and that it's fine if I don't want to). That brought up a lot of feelings and memories. I truly believe that she's a better person now, but I don't feel ready and don't know how to communicate that to her so I'm just ignoring right now.",
290,"TW: false accusation, bullying, PTSD



>!Hi, I’m 17 now, but when I was 15 I was falsely accused of rape by a girl at a school in my town. She didn’t go to the police, but in our small town that didn’t matter because she told people around our schools, and it spread fast. I ended up getting really bullied for years. People used to call me a rapist in the halls. I got beaten up, isolated, and completely shut off from everyone. It felt like the worst kind of hell where everyone thinks you’re a monster and no one listens to your side.!<

>!Now, a couple of years later, I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD and I’m in therapy. I’m doing better. I’ve learned to manage things, but what hurts the most is knowing there are so many people like me who aren’t coping—who feel totally alone. !<

>!Recently, sombody close to me went through the same thing. The girl who accused him did go to the police in his case, and he messaged me because he knew a bit about my situation. We talked, and I could tell how alone and scared he was feeling. But just speaking to him, I know it made a difference. He felt a little less alone, and honestly, so did I. !<

>!There’s barely any awareness or conversation about this stuff. It’s like society just doesn’t want to admit that false accusations happen and that they can absolutely destroy lives. I also think when we only talk about one side of the story, it leaves space for lies to grow. If there were more open and honest discussions, especially in schools, including about the consequences of false claims I think it would protect everyone, including real victims of sexual assault. !<

>!I  want to speak out more. Maybe even become a speaker one day that goes into schools and shares  my story to show the impact. Because I know what it feels like to lose your name, your friends, your mental health, and your sense of self. I also know it’s possible to work on yourself and move past it. Have any of you been through something like this? Or do you think there’s a respectful, constructive way to raise awareness about false accusations without taking away from real victims? !<

>!Thanks for reading if you made it this far. I’d really appreciate your thoughts.!<",
291,"Im on a throwaway I hope thats okay.

I feel hopeless. Life's beating the shit out of me. I don't have anyone to talk to. Ive even tried calling and texting crisis numbers, but I swear the people that answer aren't even real people.

292,"I (27M) have realized something that's been bothering me a lot lately. My mom has always been incredibly loving and supportive. Every phone call ends with her saying ""I love you,"" every visit concludes with a hug and those same three words.

But I've never said it back. Not even when I was little.

It's not that I don't love her - I definitely do. She's sacrificed a lot for me, worked multiple jobs to put me through college, and has always been my biggest supporter. But for some reason, those words just get stuck in my throat and feel somewhat unnatural.

I was raised in a household where my dad was pretty emotionally distant, and maybe I think I internalized that as the ""normal"" way men should behave. Now as an adult, I feel this weird mental block whenever the opportunity comes to express my feelings.

Last weekend was Mother's Day, and I could see the slight disappointment in her eyes when I gave her a gift but couldn't say those words she always says to me. I just awkwardly patted her shoulder and said ""Happy Mother's Day"" instead.

I'm worried that someday I'll regret never having told her, but at this point, it feels like such a big deal that I don't know how to start. Not really sure what to do, but just needed to vent. ",
293,"Before the accident I had a life. A job, friends, goals, I knew what my days would look like. I had a sense of who I was and where I was going.

Now? I wake up and go straight into caregiver mode. I need to feed him, help him dress, manage medications, keep the house running, try not to fall apart and repeat. I cant remember the last time I did something just because I wanted to.

The scariest part is how easy it is to disappear like this. People still ask how he is doing. No one asks how I am and honestly Im not even sure what I'd say if they did.

Lately I've started worrying about money. I left my job to take care of him, and savings only go so far. We're getting by but barely (rent, food, medical supplies). Ive looked at job boards, tried thinking of ways to earn from home, but nothing feels realistic with how much time caregiving takes.

It's not that I don't love him, quite the opposite. But sometimes I miss the version of me that got excited about things. That had room to breathe and felt like more than just a support system.

I don't expect advice or anything. I just needed to say this somewhere before I forget completely who I was.",
294,"Before you read this, I just ask for one thing:
I'm sharing something human , not political, not dramatic. If it doesn't speak to you, it's okay to move on.

I’m a 29-year-old Syrian living in Kosovo. My life is stable . I come from a decent family, I work, I live clean.
But socially, I feel erased.

People don't see me, they see ""the Syrian""
Friendships don’t last. Romantic connections don’t begin.
Even walking beside me seems to embarrass some people,  like I’m a burden they don’t want to be seen with.

And it's not because I'm lacking.
I take care of myself, I'm often told I’m attractive, I’m emotionally self-aware, and I genuinely value connection, depth, and respect.

Sometimes I drink my coffee alone in silence, wondering when was the last time someone really saw me - not as a nationality, not as a stereotype, but as a human being.

I didn’t survive war and exile just to feel like a ghost in so-called peace.

I’m not here asking for sympathy or romance. I’m simply hoping to find someone /anyone /  who believes in real friendship, emotional depth, and human connection.

I’m tired of how shallow the world has become.

295,"I (21F) have been haunted by this fact for 7 years and I am just now revealing this to my friends. It happened the morning after my 13th birthday party when all of my friends left my house. My parents talked to me and said they found a bag of human poop in the trash, like a ziploc bag. It is an understatement to say I was shocked, confused, and dumbfounded because I am now trying to figure out which one of my friend’s shit is in my trash. Currently I am ruling out who has not done it but I have no clear evidence as to who actually did it. I do have some theories as to what would have led to poop in a bag:

1. The toilet got clogged, they reached into the toilet and scooped the poop- however that would entail reaching pretty far into the toilet which seems impractical. 
2. Maybe they did not even go to the toilet and just directly pooped in the bag, but the thought of one of my friends POOPING IN A BAG, WHILE OTHER PEOPLE ARE ASLEEP IN THE NEXT ROOM, scares me beyond belief. 
3. They possibly could have popped their pants- but there were no other signs for such cleanup. 

With all the theories, the person would have to of known where my family keeps plastic bags and I would never need to have shown my friends where plastic bags are. Now I’m imagining one of my friends raiding my house in the middle of the night looking for a plastic bag because they had a poop issue. The other option would be they brought a plastic bag with them, but WHY IN THE WORLD would someone carry a ziploc bag with them because I can’t imagine planning on needing a bag in case I poop. 

I can only imagine the horror my parents felt when they discovered the poop bag and for years I’ve had to live with the fact of knowing that one of my friends pooped in a bag at my house. I guess I may never know who did it , and maybe I shouldn’t but I just needed to share the story and theories with the world. ",
296,"Hello I F(19) have a close friend also F(19) let’s call her K. K and I have been friends classmates for a very long time. And we were definitely best friends when we were younger. K is a friend who I love and appreciate very much. However she has a tendency to become extremely jealous when I get close to other people, she will either be visibly annoyed and uninterested when I talk about my other friends or she will try to insert herself into the friendship even with people who she has nothing in common with except being friends with me. This inserting into friendships has most often resulted in one of three things.

Her and my other friend clicking and becoming friends.

Her and my other friend not clicking. To which she will begin to think very negatively of them. That often included the aforementioned annoyance or her shittalking them to other people.

Or the weird mix between the two where she will automatically see herself as their close friend because I am (I guess she kind of sees us as a package deal) and then start treating them as her close friends. The problem with this is that my other friends find it really uncomfortable when this girl they’ve met a few times run up them hugs them and starts telling her how she loves them (this is at school not parties or other places alcohol is involved) This sometimes ends up with my other friends rejecting her affection. She will then be very hurt and upset and expect me to be there to listen so her talk down my other close friends.

 it upsets me so much!! I know she’s sad and feels rejected. But I totally get my other friends, and I would have a similar reaction! I get to frustrated and sometimes embarrassed. and it’s affecting our friendship very negatively.

But even so I know she’s only trying to get closer to me, so I feel like a giant asshole for it upsetting me.

299,"Final note:

""I had one of the most interesting lives. It's a shame I won’t be here to tell it. I fought. I won for a while, and now I’ve lost. I fought well. But I realize now that my life isn't going to pay off.

I had a good life. I suffered a lot. I'm making this decision not out of despair or impulsivity—just a cold, rational assessment of both the quality and the meaning in my life.

In this world, I really enjoyed art. It was nice while it lasted. I'm an atheist when it comes to traditional gods—the personal ones, the ones you pray to. I don’t believe there’s anything after this. So, you know, I’d probably be in hell, looking up at you.

I'm what you could call, philosophically, a pessimist—but that doesn’t mean I couldn’t have a laugh. And I still believe the world can be better—not good, but better. I was on the liberal left.

2023 was the best year of my life—not from an objective standpoint, but because of how I thought during it. And about my writings—I don’t understand them either.

I love my parents. I know this is going to be really confusing and hard for them. But I’m a failed investment from an objective point of view. Pouring more into a failed investment isn’t the best move. I hope they’ll be okay.

Will I regret the choice after I jump? Yes, probably.

I’ve realized why people regret suicide after making the choice. It’s because, in those dying moments, the brain romanticizes the simple things in life—even if that life is bad. People are simply not programmed to commit suicide (except in some cases where it’s evolutionarily advantageous—like failing to reproduce and being a resource burden to relatives who share your genes). And the view from halfway down—being regret—doesn’t necessarily say anything about the decision itself, good or bad.

I think people have a drive (almost Freudian) toward a good death—a happy death—where you feel content with the life you lived. Maybe that’s what drives all our actions: to die feeling happy that you lived a good life. Suicide is, in most cases, a reactionary act to pain, not a rational choice. And since it's a reaction to pain, it’s not a good or happy death. So, suicide is a sad death. You aren’t happy while dying from suicide. But that drive—to die happily—is irrational. Sometimes, suicide is a rational assessment of the quality of life. And in that case, the drive toward a happy death isn’t rational. 

P.S. All of this is a dance around saying I’m broke. Marx was right.

P.S. Fuck Big Pharma.

300,"I'm really sorry this is long but I really want to vent/get this off my chest and perhaps hear from people with similar experience.

So yesterday, I 26f like any other day, I was at work working just like any other days it wasn’t busy, no stress about work, nothing. Just a peaceful, quiet time working. I had breakfast before I went to work, and again a snack in between before lunch, so I wasn’t hungry. It was lunch time at this point, and I was finishing up a few tasks I wanted to complete before lunch.

I work 9 hours from 9 to 6, and I can take a lunch break for however long I want. There’s no monitoring or pressure from the boss, as long as I get things done on my schedule before I clock out.

Suddenly, I felt sleepy, then a little blindness, and then dizziness. Everything happened so quickly. I went downstairs (my boss and I work from home), grabbed my bottle of water, and drank. I thought, “I better have lunch at this point,” even though I wasn’t hungry. I warmed up my lunch, but before I could even finish heating it, I could barely support myself to keep standing.

I got my food from the microwave and sat down on the floor. (We have two long/tall chairs in the kitchen where I like to sit to have my meals or just take a break), but this time I didn’t have the energy, it felt like I was going to pass out at any moment. I lost my appetite suddenly. The skin on my face felt very dry, like something was on it. I just felt weird. No physical pain, nothing. I just couldn’t understand what was wrong with me.

It was around 1:20 p.m. by then; everything had started around 12:30 or 12:40. I quickly texted my boyfriend (we’re long-distance, different continent), as he was looking forward to talking during my lunch break. I didn’t want to keep him waiting with no idea of what was happening, in case something bad happened.
I know this sounds crazy, but at this point, I was afraid that I was dying. I texted him, saying, “I don’t know what’s wrong, but I suddenly feel like I can passed anytime.” He replied, “You mean pass out?” I said, “Yes.” Then he sent me one of his favorite stickers and wrote, “Here is a kiss for some energy.” I replied, “It’s serious.”
He proceeded to ask what I was doing before the feeling started. He reminded me that he had seen me have breakfast before work, so he didn’t think it was from skipping meals. (I have stomach ulcers, which I got from growing up with eating anxiety.) I no longer have eating anxiety and I try to keep up with meals to avoid any ulcer reactions.

At this point, I could read messages clearly, but I didn’t have the energy to type. Then my boss came into the kitchen to have her lunch. She was shocked to see me sitting on the floor. (For context, I have a very good boss who makes sure I’m comfortable, whether at work or home—she really cares.)

She asked if I was okay. I asked her if my face looked weird. She came closer, looked at me, and said, “No, you don’t look weird. Are you okay?” Speaking became difficult, and suddenly I broke down and started crying. The more she asked if I needed help, the more I cried. I didn’t have a headache, but the more she spoke, the more my mind raced and the more I cried.

She called her husband, who had just gotten home from the office. I don’t know what they discussed, but the feeling of wanting to sleep, not understanding anything while still understanding everything, became intense. I seriously felt like I was about to stop existing.

I’ve always been healthy, with no  mental or physical health issues just occasional headaches, stomach pain when I starve (ulcers), mild sinus issues, and period cramps. Sometimes I get the normal flu or a cough once in a while. That’s been my health history. So this was the first time I’d experienced something like this.

To make a long story short, everything got worse and I was rushed to the emergency room. Even there, I had no pain, just tears every time someone spoke to me. They did a full body check-up and blood tests. It took them an hour or more to get enough blood for testing. They couldn’t get any blood at first not even a drop so they had to insert an IV cannula. I was still aware of everything, still feeling like I could pass out or fall asleep, but something inside told me that if I slept, I wouldn’t wake up. I’d die.

I love life. Even though it’s been unfair, but I also know that I’m not the only one who’s had it hard. I’ve never had thoughts of ending my life. If anything, I fear death the most because I feel like I haven’t lived or enjoyed life yet. I’ve worked so hard. My childhood wasn’t great. I grew up with self-doubt, anxiety, maybe even depression (i come from a continent/country where things like depression/anxiety is called white/Europen or rich people kind of issues) I don't mean anything bad by saying this.

And for the past few months, I have been happy. I'm in the healthiest relationship (my first one was a nightmare, and this is my second). I have the most fulfilling, stress-free job I’ve ever had. I finally had the courage to cut off toxic family members. Honestly, I’ve been the happiest I’ve ever been. Life finally feels meaningful. I wake up every morning with hope and curiosity for what the world has to offer.

After all the tests, everything came back fine. Medically, I’m healthy. The doctor concluded that I must have been “too sad,” possibly due to stress or receiving bad news which wasn’t the case. For the first time in my life, these past few months, I haven’t been overthinking or feeling stressed about anything. So I still don’t know what happened.

They suggested I see a psychiatrist since nothing was medically wrong. My boss and her husband dropped me back at my apartment after the IV cannula finished, and I was no longer crying. I told everyone I didn’t want to hear anyone talk, because every time someone did, I just cried more.

Today, I didn’t go to work. My boss told me to take the day off, and that I can return whenever I feel ready or want to talk about what happened. She’s willing to get me all the help I need, as long as I’m okay and willing to receive it. But the truth is, I really don’t know what happened, and I don’t even know where to begin to process it.

Also, I have to say that when everything was happening, it felt like something mental. It’s fair to say the whole thing was mental. I felt like my brain was functioning faster than usual, like it was overworking.

Should I agree to see a phychiatrist even though I don't feel mentally ill or anything? Also I remember all I could say to my boss when I couldn't fully tell her what's was was "" I'M OKAY,
  I'M FINE"" ",

All this made me cry so much, I am so happy for my husband and this beautiful friendship he has. May it always remain like this. 

May he never have to feel how lonely I am in the world save for him. My ""bestfriend"" didnt even call me when my city was attacked during a war. When I asked her she said ""I knew you were ok and besides you know I am a new mom""

She never texts, never picks my calls. Always says its bcs she is busy. I realized that its not the baby thats keeping her busy, being a friend to me was always lower priority for her. From school days, she was a medical aspirant first, friend second, then a medical student, then a doctor, and now a mom. 

At every stage of her life, talking to me, being my friend was just this inconvience that she put up with and did sometimes but it didnt give her any joy, she never made time for it. And here is a friend, sacrificing his sleep, inconviencing himself for his bestfriend. 

I am so envious, when and how will I ever have friends who truly love me? Plus I ruined the few connections I made at uni bcs i niavely believed ""bestie"" was the only one I could trust, the only one I needed.

We can't keep them here forever because they'll eventually start multiplying and that will become a problem for us, so today we've started catching them and putting them in cat carriers so we can turn them in to a pound.

I made a Reddit post about some of those struggles, and a man in his late 50s messaged me privately in response. He’s married, Christian, and has adult kids. He’s always been respectful and never creepy or inappropriate.

We’ve kept in touch ever since—through Reddit, Discord, and the occasional phone call. From the beginning, I gave him a fake name (Rachel) and changed my ethnic background. Not to catfish him, but to protect my privacy. My real name is unique, and I’ve been featured in news articles for some of the work I’ve done which can be public facing. If someone Googles me, a lot comes up based on my job, so I created a bit of distance.

Even though the name and background I gave him weren’t real, everything else I’ve shared about my life, career, beliefs, and inner struggles has been 100% honest. I’ve never sent a photo, and I’ve never misrepresented what I look like—I’ve just never shared that part of myself at all. It was about feeling safe.

Over time, he became this strange but steady emotional sounding board. Someone who didn’t know me in real life, so I could say the kinds of things I sometimes worry my closest friends would judge me for—things about my faith, fears around relationships, anxiety, even some darker thoughts. He’s listened, offered advice, and been consistent.

He sometimes asks, “Is there anything you’re not telling me?” or “Is there something you’re afraid to share?”—but not in a pressuring or manipulative way. I think it’s more his way of giving me space to open up, especially knowing that I’ve shared things with him before that were really personal. He hasn’t pushed boundaries or asked for photos, social media, or anything inappropriate.

But now I’m 28, living my dream life, and growing into a version of myself I actually like. I have a solid career, friends, and a more stable emotional life. And I’m starting to wonder: what place does this anonymous emotional connection have in my future? I do want to be in a serious relationship eventually—and while I know even the healthiest relationship doesn’t erase all anxiety or temptation, I don’t know if I’d feel right maintaining this kind of one-on-one emotional bond with a married man if I had a partner of my own.

And part of me does wonder about a married older man reaching out to a young woman, although nothing inappropriate has happened. 

So I guess my questions are:

Has anyone ever had a long-term emotional connection like this online? How did it end, or did it evolve?

Should I be honest about who I am now, or would that just make things worse?

Do I let it fade quietly, or have a proper ending?

And am I wrong for having needed this, even though it wasn’t built on complete transparency?

I don’t regret the connection. It got me through a season I might’ve drowned in otherwise. But I also know I’m not that girl anymore—and I’m not sure this needs to go with me into the next season of my life.

Would love to hear your thoughts.

306,"My wife and I have a solid marriage. We have 4 kids, (one adopted, 2 from her previous marriage and one bio child that's ours). We can talk about anything and there isn't any issues with our marriage. I acknowledge that this issue is mine and mine alone. 

We opened up our marriage and have had several fun experiences where she was able to try damn near everything on her sexual bucket list and I was more than happy to facilitate it and make sure she had a safe fun time. 


Now it's been my turn to find someone else to play with and the rejection has been brutal. People will reply to my FetLife posts, see my wife in the pictures we have together and then they will reject me and then ask ""is your wife open for play?"" 

This has been every experience. Male or female.  People find out I'm married, reject me, and want my wife instead. 

It's been absolutely brutal to my self esteem and it makes me feel like a fucking loser and it's definitely not what I want out of this experience. And I feel so fucking narcissistic when I hear my thoughts say ""So are you really complaining that you only are going to fuck your hot wife for the rest of your life?"" Like what the fuck is wrong with me. 

How the hell do people do this nowadays? I never thought I'd be the ugly husband. 

I thought being bisexual would mean more opportunities for fun and adventure but all I've seen is twice the rejection. 

My wife has been wonderful through all this but she thinks I feel unloved. Fuck no! I'm drowning in love! I just feel like The dad from American Beauty and I'm just this husk of the man I used to be. Funny, charming, always making people laugh. Now I just seem like a joke.

I don't even know what I should do from this point on.

307,Am I the only one that think its weird and a bit uncomfortable to be in a bathroom with 3 urinals then another man comes in and starts using the one RIGHT NEXT to you. Anytime I’m in this situation I just go to an open stall or leave a urinal in between me and the person. Am I wrong for thinking like this? I just want a lil space when I’m pissing ,
308,"Hi there. 36mtf Trans woman. 

Came out about a couple years ago but this morning I had a bit of a Menty B and Reddit seemed like a good place to get this all out there. I find people don’t mind reading if the story is fucked up. And every time I tell people this in person I’m usually met with shock (and laughter but I’m a performer). 

Growing up in a very small, poor neighborhood. I learned there were all kinds of people with all kinds of interests. When I hit high school I started to dip my toes into fandoms and communities when the early days of the internet and instant messaging were kicking off. 

In my last year of high school. A friend of mine introduced me to the “furry” fandom. Which for me was really cool because I grew up on anthropomorphic animals and was a creative teen so the idea of “cat people with magic” was up there in the ‘cool’ category. 

This led me to meeting the greater furry community. For better and for worse. 

At 36 I can look back and see the red flags. 

But at 16 I was just like ‘I’m hanging with people my age and people older than me and learning so much about media I’ve missed and making friends’ and had major blind spots when it came to the bad apples in the fandom. 

That led me to the FIRST HORSEMAN

IXY
Ixy was a furry who got very close to a very young me. We would chat on MSN messenger late into the night and for a couple of weeks would be affectionate towards me. 

Now I wasn’t sure of my sexuality at the time or my gender identity. I was just a person who saw this person was appreciative and affectionate towards me and I was happy. 

After a few months of travelling to visit him, I spent the night under the pretence of playing DDR all night and watching anime. I went with a friend at the time as a buffer. Because I wasn’t sure if he was intent on his flirting. 

That night. When my friend was sleeping at the foot of the bed. We were watching IDLE HANDS and relaxing when he made the move on me. I honestly didn’t know what to do because while I had a vague knowledge of sex because I had the internet, I was still only 15.

After that night he started to message me, telling me he was being kicked out of his house and needed my help finding him a place. 

I had close older friends who had their own place. (One of which is next) and they took him in because I had also gotten him a job as a night cleaner for the grocery store I worked for. 

In the span of 6 months. He would lose the job, get rehired because I talked to his boss, then quit. All the while taking advantage of me in progressively sexual ways. 

When I would try to refuse he would say things like “I would hate to be mad when it’s just me and your friends”, threatening them so I would comply. 

This ended when one day when we were both in the kitchen, I (16) was confronted with sex when I was able to hold a knife to his junk and threaten him to leave the city. In the period of an hour and a half his friend was at our house moving his stuff out because I didn’t move the knife till he left. 

When he was gone. I stopped meeting up with the local furries I did like because I didn’t trust that I wasn’t going to end up in the same position. I was scared. But I had friends I could lean on…at least…

SECOND HORSEMAN. E

E was a person I met in high school. She was a couple grades older than me but we connected through our love of anime and JRPGS

She dropped out of school and had to move into her own place but we still remained great friends. Often cosplaying some of our favourite characters and with her having her own place this gave me an opportunity to cook and find my love of food. 

This was when I got deep into the anime community. My favourite opportunities were being able to perform 20+ hours worth of panel work over a weekend at anime north in Toronto doing panels that would draw hundreds. If not a times. Hitting 1000+

I would often go to conventions with her. Again because I never understood my own sexuality at the time, I felt genuine love for this woman. All while she pined for a gay aspiring voice actor who seemed to be ignoring her. 

This is one of the times I think I want to toot my own horn. I’m a very social person. 

I was making friends with voice actors to some of my favourite anime and video games, I was performing stand up comedy in front of like minded nerds and getting genuine laughs. I was a liaison for convention guests, giving me year after year instances of stories of having amazing times with these people. 

And because I had friends. They were there with me. 

Now when I talked about Ixy, E was the person who took him in. For her it was another money source to bring down her bills. And she had the space and liked him at the time too. 

When Ixy was threatening them. He was threatening people I genuinely loved and felt I needed to protect. 

And when Ixy was gone. I told her about what he was doing to me, not that he was threatening her life to get it. I didn’t want her to feel bad or scared so I just told her we had a falling out and his friend picked him up. 

After she moved and some years passed, I was dating D (the devil).  And we met up at a coffee shop with some friends. It was there she made a scene where she slapped me across the face and caused the police to be called to the area. 

But it was what she said when she made a scene that ripped my heart out. “I was never really friends with you. You bought groceries for me and cooked for me. I was fucking using you”

Luckily she had fallen out with a lot of her friends so when she slapped me and the police came…she had nothing because everyone was backing me. 

After that. I lost some friends. Either because they were still in her web of influence or because her house was the only point of hanging for a lot of us. But the ones I kept after that all look to her as a part of their past filled with social and financial manipulation.

NOW INTRODUCING. THE DEVIL

Just going to call him D. D was about my age, into all the same music as I did and at the time was someone I thought was really cute. 

After the events of Ixy. I kept to myself and took to block a lot of the furries I hung out with on MSN and AIM because I didn’t know how to discuss what had happened to me. 

After a few months, I saw D on MSN and his username implied he was dating someone new. I unblocked him because now that he wasn’t single, I could be friends. 

We talked for 6 hours straight and by the time we were logging off, he confessed he was in love with me. I was caught. And starting that day, we began what would become a 15 year relationship and marriage. 

He was by my side when the E stuff was going on and was there with me when I felt I was alone. 

Over the period of 3 years we went to conventions together, did panels together, and were pursuing a real relationship. 

About 5 years into our relationship, he moved out of his parent’s place into an apartment with his friend, who would eventually become one of my best friends, and after a discussion. I moved cities to live with them, pursuing a new job and a new life with him. 

We were having a good time because we had friends we could hang with and were living in ‘first apartment’ mode where every weekend was a party. 

Relationship wise we had been comfortable but he was expressing sadness because he was expressing confusion in his sexuality, something I could relate to as I never felt ~sure

He knew I had been with a woman in my past and expressed interest in women sexually. And because I’ve never been sure of my sexuality, I had never had a critical attitude towards sexual activity (fukin if we’re being blunt)

After a long conversation where I consoled him emotionally, I had told him if he were in that position where he would be physical with a woman, he would have my support. 

ENTER HORSEMAN 3- Blondie

Blondie was a girl who was in ‘the circle’

There were offshoots of groups of friends that eventually spawned from the furries who used to hang out before I had stopped going. The two who housed the meets had moved to spend their lives and careers independently and happily together so I couldn’t blame them. 

There was T&S who were two very close friends (would be in our wedding parties) who had a friend. We called her Blondie because frankly. She was a woman with the same name as me. (Born with a gender neutral name)

This seemed to have set something off in D. Because the more she made herself socially in the community, the more intent D was about hooking up with her. 

Now T, a friend who would later live with me and D, was angry about this. Because D didn’t need to hook up with her when he has someone like me already. 

But what I wasn’t seeing was that the feelings D were having weren’t sexual. They were logical. 

He wanted a woman, she was a social nerd like me with the exact same name. For him. She was the perfect upgrade and replacement for the model he already had. And he didn’t shy in making that the vibe. 

D was losing his ability to not make his intentions blatant. He was cheating on me, spending time with her alone, and then, after I expressed concern with the way she was treating others in the community (drama, lies, bs), he basically came out to tell me he wanted to have sex with her. 

T actually was the one who pulled him aside to tell D about Blondie’s propensity for manipulating as she was in the middle of finding out after socially fucking around too much. And he also told D how close he is to losing me. And was that something he wanted?

Blondie was confronted by her fucking around at some point. She left the city, dropped her whole online persona and basically changed her whole identity before we found out she did this again in a whole different city with the furry community. 

When she was gone. It was a rough patch for us. We fought, we worked different hours so when he was sleeping I would be at the gym with my roommate training to be a pro wrestler (I did become one but that’s a whole nother story)

When we did confront the situation. It was close to my birthday. I had made it a tradition to go to Toronto on my birthday and spend some days shopping and seeing things. But when we were going this year, I could tell he was going to propose to me. 

The whole train ride to Toronto, he was reaching into his pockets and looking back to me and I knew he was going to do it. And when we got off the train to union station, he got on one knee, and I said yes. 

Honestly there’s times where if I were watching my life as a television show, this would be the time someone flips a table and taps out of the show. Like if I am the main character to my own story, I’m a dumb bitch 😂

We spent YEARS engaged. Money was never great for us. Independent wrestling, while very emotionally fulfilling, was literally killing me. I injured my back and had to step away after being paired with inexperienced wrestlers doing moves wrong and giving me several concussions. 

I was kind of lost for a bit. Still in pro wrestling circles socially, but I grew up with dreams of being in front of thousands, just talking and performing, but felt like those paths in life were fading. 

I fell into taking pride in my relationship. Making D happy and supporting them in their dreams. They wanted to make music so I took the time to work with them on their music. I am autistic and musically inclined, as well as a graphics designer and marketing professional so I tried to put that behind him to make it work. 

Socially I took a step back and mostly kept to myself and a few close friends. I stopped going to conventions and I stopped watching anime

And sexually. His want to be with a woman had reached the point where he had discussed the opportunity to make our relationship sexually open. 

I am the type of person who knows a lot of people in sexually open relationships who love each other and make it work, so I looked at my relationship as something that could match that energy and I told him yes. 

FOURTH HORSEMAN- Jay

We had decided to do one more furry convention. It was going to be him and me and a friend of his sharing the room. But it wasn’t until I got there I basically learned his intent was to spend the entire weekend with his friend, with the intent on building a sexual relationship. 

That conversation led to him telling me he was having emotional feelings for her as well and that things were going to work out. I trusted him. But i was depressed. 

I thought if he’s out there just fucking why am I laying in bed in my room? That’s when the door diving our room and the adjoining room knocked. When I opened it, there was a tattooed muscular older man in leather and a million dollar smile greeting me and I smiled back. 

We kept the door open for a few hours, talking about ourselves and sharing some drinks before cuddling on a bed. This was when he had asked me what I knew about the BDSM community. 

I was in the community in the Toronto areas socially for a while. Working with meets and charities and pride events. So I knew a lot. 

He said he wanted to train a new submissive, but doesn’t like randos, would rather have something over time. This was when I asked where he was from in the states and he told me Detroit. That’s like a $50 bus ride I told him. 

That weekend I found myself in my hotel room more than anywhere else. Friends I had in the community that were at the con were busy either working for the convention or with their art tables. And my husband (we were married by then. The marriage is a whole PTSD story in and of itself) was with this girl he talked to online introducing her as his girlfriend to people. 

After that weekend. I had a talk with D. 3 hours of me discussing how his want to be with a woman has evolved past sexuality and turned to an emotional outlet and in my mind I was just thinking of all the things I have to do when he dumps me for her. He didn’t though. He presented Polyamory. 

He would have her. 
And I was free to explore the bdsm relationship with Jay. 

This isn’t what I wanted. I wanted to be with my husband. But this felt like a way I could make him happy, and still have him. 

Over time while he was with his girlfriend. I connected more with Jay. As well as the BDSM and Leather communities in the Detroit area. I felt happy because I felt like I was social again. 

Jay had his quirks. He had lived a hard life and had a lot of history in his community. What I didn’t know at the time was that his history wasn’t great. But when I would talk to these people who would bring it up, they would look at me and in a way be thankful that I was in Jay’s life. 

I was there to help him when he competed in title competitions at local bars, talking up judges and being a chatty Cathy among the leather pups in the community. (That was also the night a serial killer hit on me but again. Nother story)

Over the year I was with him…he put me in situations under the context of kink and BDSM without my consent, but because I was out of my own country and I was emotionally wrapped around his finger because my husband was basically done with me for his girlfriend. 

But it was when he wanted to create his own Leather Group that the alarms went off and I had to get out of this. 

He told me his intent was to create a group to help people trying to find community. People who are struggling in their own queer identity could go here and find support and friends. What it actually was, was a chance for him to repair a tarnished reputation among a community of people who see him as an asshole. It was a vanity project for him to make him look like a pillar of the community. 

When I realized that. I ended things. When I got home from the last time I visited, I told my husband I’m not going back to Detroit and that he and her can do whatever they want, I crashed into my bed. And kind of didn’t want to leave. 

That night, my cousins were going to get together at a local bar and my sister invited me and my husband. I didn’t go. My husband did. But I didn’t. 

I was honestly expecting to not be alive by the time he got home. 

But my phone went off, and my sister was calling. Now up until this point, I had never really been open emotionally about the THINGS I’ve done in my life. I grew up being told I’m being dramatic (turns out I was just autistic) a lot so I didn’t want to feel like I was burdening people with my problems. 

I unloaded all my tears during that call with my sister. But even to this day I can’t thank her enough for calling me because it did save my life. It also gave me the understanding that my little sister was actually an adult and I can talk to her like one. 

Things were getting tough. But then…2020 hit. 

THE DEVIL’S FINAL CHAPTER

2020 hit and I was devastated. I was having a mental breakdown out of fear that I would be the death of someone I loved. So I basically secluded myself in my room. 

My ex, was working a fast food job and every day he would come home and spend two to three hours yelling at me about my selfishness while he’s out there working and his girlfriend is in another country. 

At the time, I had just begun trying to find my side to the polyamory and was beginning a relationship with my current girlfriend (and savior lol) and the pandemic made it so they were with me, and my ex hated me for that. 

He didn’t need to tell me. 
The drugs did. 

He came home one day with mushrooms, saying we should all do them because when he did he was so much calmer and I was dealing with a lot of anxiety to which I would’ve done anything to relieve. 

So we all took some. 
After drinking some orange juice and getting them down, it was then he told me he had taken more than a GOD DOSE. something along the 8-11g range. 

He said he was fine and we were relaxing for a bit. Then a heard a crash. Seconds later my husband crashes through the door, blood all up his side, crawling on my bed to grab at my face. After holding his hands back he was yelling at my face “we’re in the bad place. We have to die to go to the good place” and began rolling around my bed, getting his blood on it. Turns out he went to take a shower and fell, hitting his side off the faucet 

He grabbed both my wrists and slapped me across the face before getting up and going to his room. 

I went downstairs to talk to the girlfriend who was gaming (social distancing in the house means gaming systems in different rooms) and that’s when I hear footsteps crashing on the stairs. 

D was trying to run outside…in the nude…and we live in an area where kids play and I’m not dealing with cops. I tackled him, dragged him to his room, threw him inside and used a bungee cord to lock him in his room by tying it to the doorknob and a supporting beam. I called his best friend and he came over to trip sit him after everything that happened. But before he got here I could hear him yelling “I hate you. I want to be in New York with (her)”

After that day. I knew I had to get out of this. This was a man who, while he was there through everything I had been through, was no different than them. He watched others manipulate and use and toss aside and that was just what he wanted to do too. 

He wasn’t going to leave me. He couldn’t. But what he could do is take everything I’ve been through and put it in a light where he’s always there for me. But being there for someone requires supporting them. Something I was doing for him, but not something I deserved in return. 

After years of trying to deny myself, find words to socially frame it, and putting my life aside. I came out as trans. From childhood to adulthood I never felt like a man, I never understood men or understood the privileges I was told I was born with. I spoke to my doctor, a former therapist, and began my journey. 

My husband’s response was “I’ll still prefer real women” and it was done. I emotionally checked out from him and just needed to physically. 

His girlfriend was living in the states, and early into their relationship, I was behind the idea of trying to get her into Canada either through schooling or work so they could be together and spend more time together /so he could be happy/

My ex’s plan was for us to get divorced so he could marry her for the green card. He assumed that I would just nullify our marriage because the relationship would still “count” under the context of polyamory. 

So I told him. We can do that plan. But if we do. He’s out. I can’t continue the relationship if our long engagement and fucktacular wedding was just a tool to immigrate his girlfriend. Shortly after. He moved out and we divorced. 

————-
So this is where I am. I’m about 2 years into my transition and I’m proud of myself for doing something for myself and I’m excited to where my life is going. 

I have a trans girlfriend along with me on my journey and she is beautiful and creative and supportive. 

But I feel so lost. I feel like these horsemen and the devil have so much of my formative years wrapped up in drama and bullshit that seeing through it to what is ahead of me is so hard. 

I want to go back to that social butterfly of a person I was before. Hell I would take the social behaviour of two horsemen in. 

But I’m just…scared if that makes sense. This is the first time I’m really taking the time to write a lot of this out, and this doesn’t even begin to crack the surface of the things I’ve experienced in my life that I haven’t fully processed. 

I want that chance again to be social, to be talkative, to be in front of hundreds or thousands of people helping make them smile. 

But I’m scared. I’m scared of this world I live in where the label of being trans, for some reason discounts what I’ve been through. I’m scared that I’m going to be abused again. I’m scared to put myself out there, even though being out there and learning and growing are things that make me feel good. 

So I wanted to take the opportunity to just. Get this out there. Off my chest before the breasts come in I guess. 

If you read this all. Thank you. Truly thank you. 
This was hard to put into words but I hope if anyone is seeing anything in their lives that I’ve been through, that they can get out before they’re like me. 36 and just…so unsure of the road ahead.

I met a woman, a single mom, probably late 30's and I can't get enough of her. I've started showing up earlier to have more time to talk to her and even when she isn't there, there are other moms who I find equally as attractive.

311,"I wish I could just say it all. Every broken, bitter, exhausted piece of what I’ve been holding in. But there’s nowhere that lets you fall apart completely—not really. Even the places that say “be honest” still ask you to do it quietly, politely, carefully.

There are always rules.

Don’t talk about that.  
Don’t use those words.  
Don’t sound too angry.  
Don’t be too sad.  
Don’t make anyone uncomfortable with your pain.  
Don’t name the things that actually happened to you because someone might get offended or triggered or annoyed.

So I stay quiet. I shrink. I make my grief digestible. I turn my trauma into paragraphs that won't get removed. I format my hurt into acceptable content. Even now, I’m censoring what I *really* want to say because I know it won’t be allowed.

It’s like drowning silently because screaming would be “against the rules.”

I understand why the rules exist. I do. But it doesn’t change the fact that I feel like there’s no place in the world where I can just *bleed without explanation.*

Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever get to say the whole truth anywhere, or if I’ll spend the rest of my life turning my scars into stories that won’t get flagged",

I used to think when I was small that my mom is suffering a lot and yes she is but now I feel like she makes small things into big drama just for attention.

Hi. I don’t usually post stuff like this, but I don’t know where else to go.

Recently, everything in my life seemed to fall apart at once. It feels surreal how quickly things spiraled. I’m writing this mostly to let it out, maybe find some support or even just some perspective from strangers who’ve felt something similar.

⸻

1. A Close Friend Cut Me Off

It started with a misunderstanding in my friend group. I said something on a call that came off harsher than I intended. I was frustrated, I admit it, and I apologized after. But one of the people I trusted most cut me off completely. No willingness to talk it out. No space for repair. Just—done. And that silence still hurts.

⸻

2. A Serious Accident

We had a group trip planned and I went, despite the tension. During an activity there, I had an accident. It was serious—I ended up with a fractured wrist and a lot of physical pain that I’m still recovering from.

But what really messed with my head was something that happened after. That same friend who cut me off showed me a message they had sent earlier “predicting” I wouldn’t make it back alive. I’m not even sure why they told me. It didn’t feel like concern—it felt cold. That stuck with me in a deep way. I can’t explain the emotional gut-punch of that moment.

⸻

3. The Person I Loved Walked Away

While all of this was happening—literally while I was injured and vulnerable—I had a call with someone I loved deeply. I was overwhelmed, and I guess I came across as cold or dismissive. That call ended with a really cruel line and then total silence. They eventually ended the relationship.

No support. No checking in. Just gone.
I thought I was safe with them. I thought they’d stay. That break didn’t just hurt—it shattered me.

⸻

Why I’m Posting

I’ve been physically hurt. Emotionally isolated. Shut out and abandoned by the people I thought would be there when everything else went dark.

And it’s been… a lot.

I know I need therapy, and I’m working on that. But I also just need to say: I’m not okay.

If anyone has ever been hit with multiple types of grief all at once—how did you survive it? How did you get through it when it felt like your whole life changed in a matter of days?

Thanks for reading. I’m just trying to keep going, one breath at a time.",
315,"I had a not so great childhood. Mother was never a mother and abandoned my sis and me for a man, we did see her after that but she was never a mother after that for me. Dad failed us, emotionally and fiscal abused us.

I always pushed almost all people away to this day not to get hurt. Only a very selective few I let get close.

But today, my mother in law did something that just shattered me. I was honest that I was nervous for something I need to do for work. She gave me advice. Motherly advice. Comforted me that I could do it and still get a outcome that I want. And it worked. I stopped panicking about it(very hard to do for me, mental issues that make it very hard).

I just realized I let my mother in law get close. I love my mother in law as I would have loved my mother. And I must say....I makes me feel so confused, conflicted and sad. I'm panicking about this now. It makes me vulnerable to get hurt again.",
316,"I (m27) have been dating my girlfriend (f24) for 2 years. Pretty early on I learned that my girlfriend had a big fear of water and didnt learn to swim. Due to almost drowning at swim lessons as a little kid. Growing up I loved swimming, it was my favorite sport In the summer. Had great memories swimming/ playing  in the pool with friends. was on the swim team in high school, was a lifeguard from age 17-21. Something I still enjoy now. 

Early on once I found out I offered to teach my girlfriend, she wasn't interested in learning. Told her the offer to teach her was always on the table. Recently she asked if I would still be willing to teach her. Of course I was, told her I would be honored to and would enjoy being able to go swimming with her. 

I made it clear we would take things slow and if she was ever uncomfortable or it became too much we could stop. Saturday was her 4th leasson, its been a slow process which I'm ok with. I wouldn't want to rush her, I want to make swimming a fun experience not a scary one. But Saturday she made good improvements and was so proud of herself after. I was proud of her too. I've been thinking about it nonstop thr last 2 days. Today she had another swimming lesson (her 5th one) and today was a little more difficult but she's doing great and I'm so proud of her. 

Just had to brag about my girlfriend, plus I feel like sharing a sweet and positive story.,",

Living up to the expectations

Being a part of the society

Proving your worth

Becoming what others think is best for you

Doing what others think is best for you

""Investing"" your present for the future


......i know they are important but are they even worth it???
Sacrificing ""now"" for the future that we are  uncertain about.

All there burden of a responsibilities, expectations that we carry upon our shoulders.....it feels like swimming alone in the ocean in scorching heat not knowing where the shore is. 

It's fking smothering whenever you think about it.

Idk i just want to ignore everything like nothing except me exists in this world and live freely but it is the luxury we cannot afford.

...........................................................................
~my parents asked me what i wanted to do in the future. I was uncertain about it so i told them i want to become a doctor because they wanted to have a doctor daughter.

Now that they have invested millions in my studies (by however means they could) i am realising that neither do i have any interest in studying or  becoming a doctor nor do i have any other interests or talents.

I feel so stuck......stuck in the middle of i don't know where.

This really sucks.
At this point i am so clueless and lost that i try to find loopholes in death.
It feels like if a bomb hits our house today then I'd die and i won't have to think about tomorrow......whats ironic is i feel very ecstatic about it.

Ive  been surviving on autopilot.
Playing the role. Saying the right lines. Smiling when my soul is begging to just be still for a second.
..........And now the mask is slipping. 

My parents know that iam worthless i am a disappointment, that they wasted their time and money by spending it on me.

Now they are telling me that they are giving me a last chance so i should either  study and get into the college ( that has an acceptance rate of less than 5%) or give up and stay at home at the village and help in the house chores.

I still don't think I'd be able to study enough to get in the college (even tho that is not what i want to do) . But i definitely don't want to stay at home, do house chores then get married at the age of 23 , and i definitely won't do it even if i have to die.",
318,"I have spent years keeping it together for everyone else smiling or work showing up for family, pretending everything is fine somewhere along the way I lost the part of me that felt genuine joy. Now when something goo happens I do not feel excited, I just feel nothing. 

I miss laughing until I cannot breathe. I miss feeling proud of myself. I miss feeling at all. I am starting therapy but it is hard admitting I feel this numb. Just wanted to say it out loud somewhere.",
319,"My mother died due to a high blood pressure bleed in the brain. The thing is she wanted to retire and instead I dragged her across the country with me so she could help me watch my 1-year-old while I worked. And then 2 days before she was hospitalized we did mushrooms together. I think the mushrooms made her blood pressure go so high up that it killed her, and no one in my family knows this. I have six other siblings and I can't tell them because I don't want them to hate me.",
320,"so, i'm in highschool, and after a messy few years with details i won't be going into, i finally found two friends i trusted, and the three of us had a great dynamic. 

i found out one was leaving last thursday, due to her parents wanting to move her for convenience. it was sudden and really shocked me. 

my other friend, who i'm closest with, has known for a while she might be dropping out to take an alternative pathway, however she expected to still be in school for months, however the school sped up the process of her unenrolment and today was her last day. 

i'm genuinely so sad, and i don't resent my friends but if feels so unfair. i'm back to square one after years of trying to fit into groups that didn't care about me, sitting alone and being stuck in friendships with shitty people, and what was it for? nothing 

i'm so worried about going in tomorrow, guess i'm alone once again",
321,"TL;DR I want to pursue a career in art but family pressure makes it impossible. Cliché, I know.

Sorry for the rambling, but I want to let out everything that's stuck in my heart.

I (M25) come from a country in North Africa. I've studied architecture for the last seven years (state school so no fees outside of owning a fairly powerful laptop for rendering software), but over the better part of a decade I didn't find any particular love for that field.

Don't get me wrong, it's absolutely a noble profession, and has obviously been essential for the continued survival of the human race. But it's just not something I enjoy practicing. Realistically (and especially for young architects) it's mostly just sitting down in front of ArchiCAD designing plans that rely more on software knowledge and vague directions from your boss than artistic expression, often working until 7 or 8 PM (or in weekends) to hit unreasonable deadlines (something we were already habituated to do in school). Again, I have the utmost respect from anybody who finds that life fulfilling, but it's clear for me by now that it's not for me.

I got my degree last September and finding a job has been difficult. I have to mention that it's commonly understood to be a very oversaturated field where I'm from; nobody is hiring workers without years of experience. All I've been doing since is interning (for free) at firms that make it very obvious they're not considering a full-time position. I actually got to learn more about being a professional during these internships and my last boss made a point to praise me about my productivity. But really, I'm just buying the lede here...

As far back as I can remember, I've always loved drawing... You see where this is going. My lifelong passion for drawing was the only reason my parents pushed me towards a career in architecture (even though commercial architecture involves basically zero drawing).

I've been taking digital art seriously since at least 2019, using a small digital tablet I was gifted. It obviously wasn't academic but I managed to learn the fundamentals of art from whatever resources I would find, in my free time. Drawabox, Ctrl+Paint, I bought and read the most celebrated books on anatomy, perspective, color theory and painting.

Eventually I acquired the professional-grade Cintiq Pro tablet entirely on my own (I won in a corporate comic contest) which convinced me more and more that I could maybe have a career in a field that I actually liked. I built a small online following (around 7000 followers on Twitter as of today) and have also done about 15 commissions. My skill level isn't anything mind-blowing but I'd say that my artstyle is appealing and that it could reach a professional level with more studying and some tweaking...

...but my career is not really something I have a say in.

Being unemployed, I still live with my mother. And as long as we live together, her word is law. I tried to convince her to pursue this art thing. Maybe study a little more and build a professional-looking portfolio to work in Illustration (in the game industry or otherwise), or maybe collaborate with other creators in the indie comic scene.

I don't want to paint her as bad person, since she's only thinking about my best interests, but she just doesn't seem to understand that drawing makes me happy while professional architecture doesn't. Or that whether or not I'm content with my work is not relevant as long as it's in a career she considers to be respectable. She forbids me from turning my back on architecture (I spent 7 years studying it, after all) and forces me keep interning for free, since to her time spent in front of my tablet is time wasted.

What I keep repeating to her, and what she'll probably never understand, is that it's MY life on the line and not hers. She should not make it her concern if my choice of career doesn't work out, but it will ALWAYS be my burden if I stick with a job that makes me miserable. The thing that I can never get out of my head is that every second I spend in these unpaid internships keeps me further from a life I'd actually enjoy living. I'd randomly start thinking that, during work or otherwise, and start feeling depressed.

And can I even really blame her? My ideas for a career in art are vague at best. My skill level is poor compared to people who actually went to art school, and 7k followers doesn't guarantee a comfortable living. Seriously pursuing it will probably turn me into a pariah in the eyes of my family. The only real argument I have is... that I feel happy doing it?

(On that note... I can't even really explain why the prospect of never having a career in art instantly makes me feel miserable. Like, why does it have to be this? This and other aspects of my life make me suspect I'm neurodivergent but I don't really know, where I live things like autism aren't treated seriously)

I still try to squeeze in 4 hours of drawing after every day of work, which can be stressful but still keeps me somewhat sane. This week an uncle of mine got me in another unpaid internship - he keeps framing it as if he had to pull plenty of strings for me to have this opportunity, which adds to the pressure to ""do the right thing"".

I know the education I got was a privilege that not many could afford (something I'm constantly being reminded of after I show any resistance). Some people would kill to be able to practice as architects. Some might call me entitled or even insane. Others might call me selfish for turning my back on a field that's more useful to society.

All I know is that, try as I might, I can't find fulfillment in anything other that art, and it's breaking my heart.",
322,"I grew up really poor. At 21 I met the woman I would marry. At 25 we spent $4000 on our wedding and honeymoon combined. I worked hard to put my wife through college and provide a stable and enjoyable life for my family. I’ve never owned a new car and I’ve never sold a used one. We eat simply, we save, we research big purchases, and we never try to “keep up with the joneses”. 15 years ago I finished school and became a mechanic. About 7 years ago my wife quit her government job that put me through school and started her own business. She has worked her brain and ass off. Through that she has gained a serious reputation in her field as a trustworthy professional who always has her clients businesses as the top priority. What she does, or rather the way she does it, is highly sought after by other small business owners. We talk almost every night about how our days went and she shares her little successes, challenges, goals, etc with me. I always listen but I guess I didn’t quite put it all together in my head, I just knew that she was happy and feeling proud about herself. 

Well, this weekend we went on a Mother’s Day drive so the kids could implement their plans at home without being “caught” and ruining their surprises. On that drive we talked about a company she hired to streamline her social media and advertisements. She was pretty excited about it but I almost choked when she told me how much she was paying them! I reminded her that I trust her completely to make the right calls and she has proven that track record again and again but…did she really think that was a wise investment? How long did she expect before she would see a return? She assured me it was fine and that she had budgeted much more for this service anyway. I asked how much and she said she’d set aside about 3 times that much. Anyway, that conversation led to more direct questions from me to her explaining in detail how she divided her companies income and profits, what her plans were for the next couple of years and other details. I was a little stunned at the amounts of money she was talking about so I asked her “if your business continues on this trajectory for the next ten years, where do you think we’ll be combined income wise at that point?”  She looked me right in the eye and said “baby, in ten years it’s gonna be very different. In fifteen you can retire and we’re gonna have a fuck ton of money to do all the stuff we want to do. You won’t have to think about money for the rest of our lives”. She’s in a financial business and I know she is honest and would never lie, or even oversell anything to me. 

I’m crying right now as I write this. Guys, I’m gonna be ok. My kids are gonna be ok. It’s all gonna be ok. ",
323,"I have a flatmate who's got way too much time on his hands. He’s always pulling dumb pranks that he sees on TikTok like wrapping the toilet in cling film, filling my bed with balloons, you name it. At first it was funny, but it got old very quick and some pranks had quite poor taste, like when he froze my keys in ice and because of that I was late to class by 15 minutes.

The other night, I get home late from class. I am so done and I just need to go to sleep. I head upstairs and there’s a stack of like 20 cans blocking my bedroom door stacked just high enough that it would be dangerous to knock them down. That was the last straw.

Instead of knocking them down and going to sleep, I sat down and carefully peeled the labels off every single one, returning them back to his shelf. I knew this would make his life hell as the man **lives** off ready meal-like cans and he had now way of knowing until he opened the can so he'd just have to eat what he gets. But I didn’t stop there. I went out, bought a can of dog food, peeled that label too, and hid it at the back with the other cans.

The next day, he sends a message in the group chat about the cans and that I went a bit far, now he can't plan what he's having for dinner. But has no idea what is coming.",
324,"Not sure who else to tell about this, don’t really trust anyone to remain unbiased in my telling them. So here I am. 

My girlfriend (25f) and I (27m) have been together for about a year and a half and have really been on a great path up until this point. We are currently considering moving in together when my apartment lease ends around the new year. 

My girlfriend has always been very sensitive towards my two cats but I just let it go up until this point. But she recently told me that if we move in together I will no longer be allowed to sleep with my cats in the same room as me. Up until this point they’ve been allowed in the bed with me while I slept. 

Her reasons being that she doesn’t like the cat hair in the bed and they keep her up at night (this is true, I have a vocal cat that keeps me up as well). She also is very sensitive towards morning sex and sex in general and feels like my cats cockblock her. 

Which leads me to my next issue; the sex. She has an extremely high sex drive and consistently says she wants sex “every day and every night if possible”. I just can’t deliver on that - I don’t have that same sex drive. I’ve tried to increase the sex frequency to keep her happy but honestly I just feel like shit about myself and my needs in the process. It’s a damned if I do damned if I don’t situation because she gets irritated with me if we don’t have enough sex. 

The fact is, I’ve used my cats cuddling with me as an excuse to get out of sex before. I will admit that. I also clearly view my relationship with my animals differently than she views relationships with animals. And at the end of the day, it hurts me that in order to move forward with her I’ll have to effectively compromise my relationships with my animals now and forever more which I don’t think I will be okay with. 

I see that she has valid concerns and I don’t think she’s wrong for feeling the way that she does but I just can’t get behind what she wants anymore. 

Both of these issues are exacerbating each other and I can feel myself disconnecting over them already. I don’t want to go back to dating but I will if she keeps trying to control aspects of me. 

Thanks for listening to my rant. Have a good one. ",
325,"I'm a sub5, 5'10, virgin nobody who, with nearly 2 decades on this planet, has nothing to show for it. I have no friends. No relationships. No high school memories. No heart breaks. No parties. No life. I've missed out on everything someone my age should go through and it's too late now to do anything about it. I'm close to graduating and have accomplished nothing. I've gotten all of this through isolation, deep self-hatred, and paralyzing anxiety and overthinking. 
Day to day ""life"" is nothing but agony. I hate being alive, if you could even consider this living. I go to school. Come home. Sleep. Go to the gym. Come home and lie in bed for hours as I desperately try to make myself fall asleep. There is no purpose, no end goal, nothing and no one to live for. If I disappeared today, I'd be forgotten as quickly as I left. I've given up trying to socalize or talk to girls. Who would want to talk to someone in this disgusting body, the one that has hindered me all my life? 
The worst part is that I am stuck in it. I can lose weight. I can take care of my skin. I can eat clean, dress nicely, take care of my hygiene. I can do all of that self-care bullshit but at the end of the day, this ugly face will stick with me for as long as I live. There is no more growth to be done. There are no more changes to come. This is who I am and who I will be.

I hold no hope and hold too much hatred for myself to even want to see myself succeed or be happy. My mom tries and tries and tries to help me, but she just doesn't get it. It's too late.
I plan to take my life sometime after my 18th birthday later this year, when I can legally own a firearm. It may bring my family pain, but they all will have reasons to continue on. I have no reason to continue. There is no hope for me and I serve nothing to my family or society. It's over, and it never really began",

We always say how close we are and we only have each other, as we’re not in relationships, but now, she’s totally excluded me. I feel so shit and it’s made me think of who I am as a person. I just love to have a good time and get along with others easily. So there’s no reason to exclude me. I sort of believe it’s BECAUSE I do make friends pretty easy, maybe. I dunno. But I’m so angry and am trying to piece together how to confront her. Getting to the bottom of how I feel before I get too angry with my words and lose a good friend.

327,This girl basically made me feel really terrible. I know she wasn't ever going to find interest in me but it hurt so much the way she said it.

329,"I'm not talking about Postcoital dysphoria (post-nut depression). I feel sad before, during, and after sex. I felt that way the first time, when I lost my virginity, and I have felt that way every single time since. And I was never sexually assaulted. And I was not instilled with any sexually repressive values. And I'm not asexual, I get horny and turned on by women, but when it comes time to do the deed, I just get this wave of sadness that kills any enjoyment or sexual passion in me.

I have no idea why I am this way. When I am about to hook up with women now, I'll usually just back out, which gets a negative response naturally. I still desire intimacy and love, but it is hard to get that without the sex. I used to be able to just push through my sadness for the sake of a relationship or for the small bits of intimacy that you can get from a hookup, but I'm tired of doing that now.

Any idea what this might be? And how to fix it?",

after emailing them again to reconsider their decision I once again was told that their decision is final and there is nothing they can do for me.

I know they are a business and need to make money, i get that but I am just so relieved. After dealing with this for 5 days I can finally have this weight lifted off my shoulders. They are letting me rebook my cruise and gave 100% full cruise credit for the next time. I am just so relieved.




I just got this email from carnvial about my cruise:

We have reviewed your request for special consideration and regret that we’re unable to honor your request for compensation.

331,"When I was 21, I dated a 27-year-old man let's call him Andy. A pilot. Charismatic, smooth, charming from Ahmedabad, India — and emotionally manipulative as hell.

He would come and go as he pleased. He never committed, pretended to be my boyfriend, blocked me whenever he got bored or uncomfortable, then returned after years like nothing happened. No apologies, no ownership. Just silence — then *“hey, how’ve you been?”* like he didn’t throw me away like trash.

He once threw me out at 9PM with nowhere to go in Bangalore when I went to meet him. I told him I had been touched inappropriately by a man in a crowded bus in a bus in Ahmedabad and he didn’t believe me — thought I “made it up to get his attention.” He was constantly on Tinder and Bumble. Who knows what his body count is now. I was just a naive 21-year-old looking for a relationship. He knew that. He used that. This happened between 2017-2018.

In 2020, he unblocked me and sent a request on Instagram through his second fake account. I recognised him because he uses a particular type of vocab. I dm'ed him and instead of replying he quickly sent me another request from his personal account. I was actually excited cause I hadn't moved on. We sent each other reels and met in early 2022 in Gurugram. I had a bus from New Delhi so I thought this is the chance to meet him. I fell for him again only to realise he hadn't changed at all. Obviously in a place like Delhi-NCR he had a lot of matches and dates. It hit me and I was sad again. We still sent each other reels till I met a guy in Manali on my solo trip and had an instant connection. I finally blocked Andy after realising that he is a man wh\*re who manipulates girls and treats them like objects.

I’m 27 now (2025)— the same age he was back then. And I realize how *young* 21-24 really is. I would never date someone that age now. I was manipulated.

Fast forward to yesterday. After 2.5 years, he texted me again on WhatsApp. No apology. Just casual conversation. Asked for pictures of me. Claimed he blocked me in the past (2018) because he “liked me and needed to move on.” I played with him because I wanted revenge. But I ended up getting frustrated, after all he is 'Andy'. Let me share the highlights:

1. “God you have got all this so so wrong I can't even tell you.”
2. “Men date younger and women date older, it's hardwired in us. It's called evolutionary psychology.”
3. “Anyway all of that doesn't matter. I am glad you are thriving, and getting to hear from you is enough. You take care lil one :)”
4. Asked how he could see my Instagram profile picture (I’ve blocked him), he was using a 3rd account probably. then asked again for pictures for the third time.
5. When he realised I will not fall for his game trap, he ""confessed"" he liked me. You don’t block someone because you liked them — you block them because you couldn’t handle the guilt of how you treated them or you want to date someone new.

*Evolutionary psychology* to justify dating younger women? *Lil one* to a grown woman? I almost laughed. This man really thought he could crawl back into my life with pseudo-science and condescension. Mind you, he still hasn't apologised. No sorry, no accountability.

So I told him to f\*ck off and also said ""I don't wish you well. You are and were a red flag all along""

And it felt amazing. Because the 21-year-old me would have begged for closure. The 27-year-old me doesn’t need it. She *is* the closure.

To any younger women out there: if something feels off — it is. If he treats you like an option, invalidates your pain, disappears and reappears like a bad habit… he doesn’t care. He just wants access. Deny it.",
332,"Not to say I'm ugly or anything, I think. But, I'm demiromantic and greysexual/asexual which are like 2 blows to the stomach. I see my friends jump into one relationship after the other (like one started dating after a week of knowing her) and it kinda scares me cause by the time I developed feelings for someone, they would've lost theirs. Deep down I'm a hopeless romantic I swear but it takes time. Trust issues and all. Furthermore, everyone's so lustful so they want you to put out so early and I don't even get in that state like that so I get really uncomfortable. I usually just outright ignore it, try and laugh it off or make a cold comment to make it friendly. It happened with someone I liked but I didn't know how to express it without making it seem like I didn't like them romantically and i was afraid theyd leave. For someone else they might be okay with it but I'm not, ugh. I don't even know where I'd get the opportunity to slowly know someone, fml.",
333,"I just saw a reel of someone spending over 1000 dollars to save a guinea pig, and it reminded me of this.

When I was like 8 we got a cat, he was the first pet I’ve ever had, and autistic little me sure loved the hell out of him, even though he was the type of cat who enjoyed personal space and wasn’t really clingy. When I was 12, he fell down the stairs I think and somehow got paralysed waist down. Even though we were comfortable (upper middle class) my parents never thought it was worthwhile to spend money on a pet. It could be that couple years ago, they spent a lot of money trying to save our dog, and then they just thought it was unnecessary to do that again. 

What really upset me was that they behaved like they did the most they could to save him. They brought him to the vet one time, and refused any kind of medical treatments that would cost them more money. They brought him to our yard and said that the nature had healing energy? And that would somehow helped him get better? They were never the type of people who believed in pseudoscience kind of stuff. And if I asked them to bring him to the vet again they would get really mad and say stuff like they’d already done that, and it did nothing. 

When I went on a field trip couple days later and came back, our cat was gone. I remember them saying stuff like they brought him to an animal shelter or something, and that he was at a better place and he would be better taken care of. We lived in china back then, if you know anything about how animals are being treated in china, the chances were he probably got euthanised right away. The thing is I still don’t know if they really brought him to an animal shelter or maybe they just abandoned him somewhere. 

12 year old me couldn’t do shit, and I didn’t even cry when they told me the news bc I was scared that that would piss them off (or maybe deep down I knew this would happen). I was forced to accept the reality that for the sake of him, they did the most they could do to save him. I was so ashamed that I couldn’t even talk about it, I would just lie about why he was gone. The hypocrisy was insane, and I was left traumatised. 

As a result of that, my sister and I took extra care of our own cats, we gave our cats the best care possible. And this topic was and still is off limits.

I don’t know how I’ll ever get over this. I don’t know why I’m saying this. I’m just so angry and so upset, I miss my Audrey so so much.  ",
336,"A month ago I was in a full blown crisis because I feel like I wasn’t worthy enough to be with this guy, I’d always have mental breakdowns because of my low self esteem. Since then life has bloomed, we started dating. He’s brought so much happiness in my life. We’ve gotten closer, I get to see who he really is and I really like him as a being. He makes me feel so beautiful, he makes me laugh so much, and he makes me want to better myself. We talked about our low self esteem’s to each other, we were both confused why we picked each other. He told me he thinks I’m beautiful, I bring out the child in him, I’m one of the sweetest girls he’s met, and I’m a bright light in his life. Ugh this guy is a dream, if I were to write out my dream guy on a piece of paper that would be him. We both have similar goals in life, which I enjoy a lot. Last night we actually got into a mishap, I’m not gonna go into detail but what I got from it is that we both are able to comfortably communicate what bothers us, and ways we can work around these obstacles. We’re only 2 weeks into the relationship, I’ve known him for 2 months. I hope this isn’t too soon to be feeling this way about him, we both don’t want to rush anything; but we are crazy for each other.. still we’re taking it slow.",

Whoever cursed me or holds a grudge against me, please Stop. I have had enough....",
338,"I feel like if I write this I'll realize how wrong I am and that there really is light at the end of the tunnel. I apologize in advance if: there are any grammatical errors or things that don't match/It's just random incoherent stuff.

According to my old notebooks full of drawings, the medium through which I express myself, I have wanted to mortally harm myself since I was 12—if not younger, since I have no record nor memory of it. I only remember vaguely pulling my hair, slapping/ pinching myself, and picking at my nails/skin for as long as I can remember.

A year ago I actually cut myself for the first time on my wrists and thighs, which I had wanted to do since I was young. I felt very happy because I had accomplished something I had set out to do for years. Kinda messed up. The other times I tried it over and over, I didn't even feel anything no more, just did it out of routine or for the 'fun' of it. I didn't feel sad or angry or ecstatic—just a void that I haven't been able to fill with jack.

I feel like a burden to my mother (typical) and I wanted to earn money as fast as I could, but since I didn't look hard enough and I'm a fucking procrastinator, I'm working at my 17's in a shitty job with miserable pay. Every day, except for one that's when I go to school. 

In a month or a few weeks my boss will find my replacement and I will be left doing nothing for the rest of the school year, without generating income, my brain gnawing itself away with awful things, and no real friends to hang out with. At least I have some savings.

My brain tells me to kms before something else does it. Before I have to die naturally. ""Which I must do."" It gives me a false sense of control and self-sufficiency. I'm exhausted from wanting my head crushed by a semi-truck. I'm tired of being a nihilist, thinking that i'm being only realism when it's straight pessimism. I don't want to die. I don't want to kms.

I thought if I did something with my life I'd finally stop having these thoughts, I thought that if I entertain myself enough with something, anything, I could change. Be happy. Be normal. But, if anything, I'm even more tired, more 'suicidal', more 'depressed'. Those thoughts haven't vanished, the voice has never shut up, the impulses haven't faded, the intrusive thoughts remain. And I'm so fucking fed up. I cannot stand it. I cannot stand myself.

Is this what adolescence feels like? Am I suffering from dysthymia? Depression? Hormones? Anemia? Just life? I know it'll get worse from here. Getting older sucks, and becoming an adult terrifies me. I'm afraid of falling asleep, I'm afraid of dying, afraid of the universe, afraid of people, afraid of myself, afraid of nothingness. Afraid of living.

I know I'm just getting my bearings, that I need to put on my big boy pants and get on with it. But I want to know how you managed to rise above this fucked up mess. Need to know how not to drown in a glass of water.

Thanks for your time.",
339,I had been hooking up with a girl for several weeks. She wanted me to wear protection but each session I would just take them off and finish inside her. Now she’s pregnant. She told me a week ago and I’ve since cut all contact with her. But now I almost feel guilty.,
340,"My father calls me fat and says i need to lose weight. He points at my legs and tells me how big they are. He switches between calling me a little girl and young lady when it suits him. I know im big, and i know im getting bigger. I do ~6 hours of cardio and ~2hours of both weight lifting and other exercises weekly. Its as if he thinks im blind and cant see the issue. I can see myself. I have to for the rest of my life, because im stuck in my body. Its not like i have a choice.I'm  trying  to eat healthier and exercise and lose weight. I know if i gain more itll be a problem. But he acts as if im a hippo walking through the front door. I dont need reminder every time i walk through the door of his damn house. There is not a day that goes by that i dont stand in the mirror and  wonder how i got to this point. Its not like im stupid and blind to the point i cant see the numbers on the scale. Im 17 pounds over weight, i know that. I know my body better than anyone in this damn country and planet. Im not fucking stupid. Why is he acting as if i cant see myself? Im trying my hardest to lose weight and nothing goes down. I can see my love handles, my arm flaps, my double chin, i can see my stretch marks and the marks on my skin from scratching bug bites too hard. Im a child. I am human. I get sad and insecure. I cant be comfortable in my body when everyone tells me there is an issue. Just when i get comfortable with how i look, my own goddamn father breaks down whatever security i built up. Arent parents supposed to help you, love you and support you? Then why is he so blind to my efforts? Im trying. Im really trying. Why cant he see that??  Why is my grown ass man of a father telling me i dont look good because im overweight? Im not trying to look good for him, not for anyone but myself. I started track not only to lose weight but to be my own version of cool. Why are words said in ignorance making me lose sight of my goal? He gets upset when i waste his food, but when i clean my plate i eat like a pig?  Am not supposed to be hungry? Is something so terribly wrong with being overweight that i have to be reminded by someone who is supposed to love and guide me? I dread the days i have to go by him. I cry when i have to stay by him when my mom travels for medical or work reasons. He makes me hate both him and myself. Im a child. Why cant i act like one sometimes? Is that  something that has to go away when  i grow up? I try my best. I get good grades. Im second in my class. Just let me be. Please? Do i have to beg for respect from my own goddamn father? Cant i be tired without a reason? Is my back not supposed to hurt cause im young? To hell with that. Leave me the hell alone. Im trying my hardest. Let me be. Please just let me be. Im not blind or deaf and I am most certainly not stupid. Let me feel pretty and good in my own skin. Let me have at least that. Please. Please god let this man leave me alone. Im trying. Cant anyone see that anymore?

 i started questioning religion a couple of months ago and slowly realized that the god i thought was going to send me to eternal fire was not real. 

i dont bear the weight of eternal torture anymore but i am still outwardly apearing as a muslim, still in the closet even though i got  outed a couple of times. still being forced to obey the rules made by a man 1500 years ago.

atleast my mind is free, i hope that i can fall in love, live a peaceful life. even though i know that that will be so hard to achieve.

excuse me for my poor english it is my second language.


edit:
i am currently seeing a therapist but shes muslim and thinks being gay is a sin and an illness to get rid of, i have a few friends who know about me being gay but i can never tell them that i left the religion. ",

But whenever I suggest doing a deep clean to fix that it’s ’there are more important things to do.’ Like his stupid coupon book that I know isn’t going to do anything because that’s not how the world works anymore and he’s so stuck I. The past that he just won’t listen. And it doesn’t help that I’ve had six different interviews in the last six months after being off for two years because I was working four jobs and the stress got to me and all I hear is ‘why haven’t you applied for this job’ or ‘why aren’t you calling clients for the coupon book, if you just did that we’d be set.’ Like I haven’t been trying so hard it hurts.

345,"My mother had a rough upbringing. Extremely poor, living in dangerous neighborhoods, my grandma was not the nicest to her and had her marry a grown man at the age of 14 hoping that would put my mom in a better position, obviously did not. She struggled with addiction and being an alcoholic. Was doing prostitution, was a stripper. She was divorced a year later. I was her first born. She had me at the age of 16, one night stand with my father. She did not introduce me to him until I was 4 years old. I lived with her from birth until age 6 or 7 can't remember exactly.

I have very faint memories of her. Most my memories are feeling pure love for her and from her as well. There are some memories I have of her putting me in bad situations, which made her a bad mother. I have many happy memories as well. I remember being extremely attached to her. No matter what I went through, I was just so happy to be loved by her. I never doubted that she loved me. 

My last memory of my mother hurts so much. I destroyed her mental health more and caused her major trauma of her kids being taken away from her. I know I did the right thing, especially for being so young, but because of the choice I made, I lost her and never got to see her again. 

I was 6 or 7. She would regularly leave me home alone at night to babysit my 5 year old brother and 2 year old sister. She wouldn't get home till morning. I remember always being scared when she would do this. One night she left, gave me hug and kiss goodbye, said she'd be back in a few hours. I got my brother some dried ramen to eat cause he was hungry, gave me sister some milk. Then I had them lay down on the couch to go to sleep for the night. During these nights id force myself to stay awake all night cause I wanted to make sure I was alert if my sister woke up and started to roam the house or on the off chance someone broke into our home, I could try and protect my siblings from the intruder....me, a 6/7year old girl. Lol so I'm watching cartoons, feeling scared, wanting my mom to hurry home. Well she finally gets home right when the sun is rising. She usually immediately gives me hugs and kisses when she gets home, this time she didn't, and went straight to the bathroom. I went to check on her and she was sitting on the floor, using her makeup to draw all over her face and is rambling a bunch of nonsense, I walk up to her ask her she's okay and she's says ""of course___""and instead of using my name, she calls me by her sister's name. And I correct her and say ""no mommy, it's me, your daughter,___"" but she keeps saying her sisters name. I remember in this moment realizing there's something wrong, and she needs help, and I was scared. I looked at her, grabbed her cheeks with both my hands, squished them together, and gave her a kiss, looked her in the eyes and said ""I love you mommy"" and I went and picked up my sleeping sister, woke my brother up, told him to grab my favorite stuffed animal and follow me. I took them across the street, to the neighbors house. Knocked on their door, and told them I needed to use their phone book and phone so I could call my grandma to come help my mom. Well of course, the cops show up. I'm questioned, my father who I barely know, pulls up and I'm told I have to go with him and my step mother. And I was so confused but I did what they said. And that was the last time I saw my mother. 

My father refused to let me see her or anyone on her side of the family including my siblings. I found out when I got older that she got sober and put on medication after they took all her kids that morning. And she tried getting us back, but all the fathers of her children refused to let her see us. And she was too poor to hire a lawyer. So she was heartbroken and ended up back into addiction and prostitution. My whole childhood I was emotionally and mentally abused by my step mother. I had a goal that when I turned 17, I would move out and go find my mother. 7 months before my 17th birthday, she was prostituting, got picked up by a guy, they did drugs together, and he killed her. The story is actually truly traumatic but I don't need to give details. 

I'm 33 now. And I don't think I'll ever get over this. I destroyed her life. I lost her and I loved her so much. I really thought I was going to see her again. That goal is what kept me alive my whole childhood. And 7 months before I was able to make my dream come true, it got taken away. And now she will never know how sorry I am for doing what I thought I had to do. I'm sure she wouldn't want me to blame myself. I know she blamed herself. It's truly just so sad to think about. I'm so heartbroken over this and no matter how many different therapists I talk to, it's never going to get better. I'm never going to forgive myself. I just want my mom. I needed her so bad all the time. I still need her. ",
346,"TW if this makes anyone uncomfortable it has some topic of sexual assault

347,"This is so stupid but it's been bothering for at least eight years. 

When I was 16 I went to write the written drivers test to get my permit. I got 5 questions wrong and the limit was 4, so I had to wait two weeks and re-write it. My younger sister and my parents (to an extent) mocked me incessantly until I got my permit. *Every single day* I would come home, study, and then someone would ask if I had studied at dinner and the ""joke"" would start. Saying it's a shame I grew out of my epilepsy just to not be able to drive, that ""I bet you wish you'd let your little sister write it, she would've passed"", I better study before my sister was the one driving me everyday, maybe I'd better stick to walking, on and on until I passed the written test (on my second try). I passed the driving portion on my first try.

TWO YEARS LATER, my sister sits the written test for her permit and gets it in one try. In between being smug she made sure to mock me about my failed test again, which my family happily joined in on. 
Then she failed the driving portion. 

I was SO PUMPED. I figured I'd get to crack a couple jokes, but mostly was excited that this meant the jokes about my driving would stop. No. My mother called me and told me that under absolutely no circumstances was I to make fun of her or even bring it up, because it ""was very upsetting for her"". Like it wasn't for me?!?!??? I called her out on that in the moment and she essentially told me to get over it and be nice to my sister, and that I was being an unsupportive bitch. So my sister comes home, she's crying, whatever. I don't bring it up. Then during dinner she's like ""well, at least I failed the driving part. That's harder, it's not like I failed the written"". I didn't look up and just said ""well, at least if you'd failed the written you'd have a license right now"". Cue absolute meltdown from my sister. I got sent to my room and wasn't allowed to finish supper. I'm still not allowed to bring it up. My sister can make fun of me for this whenever she wants. I'm still pissed but any acknowledgement of it is denied by everyone. 

I'm 24 now and still mad. ",
348,"I guess that's some typical teenager shit to say. But well, I do want to. I'm 16 and live with my parents with my two siblings. My parents are both 40 so they got me pretty early. Well, i felt unwanted until i was about 13 i guess. I felt like I was their biggest problem and I should just disappear, run away and never come back, to make their life easier. Well, safe to say, I developed depression. That was also because I lost my friend group because I didn't fit in right into the class and they didn't want my bad reputation to affect theirs, but that's another story. Somehow I found other friends but the damage was done. Walking on eggshells, extreme fear of losing them, jealousy and doubt when they did something without me. I started sh. I realized I couldn't get through this alone (actually I just wanted a depression diagnosis) and asked my parents for therapy. They said yes. I thought it was gonna be better from then on, but oh boy was I wrong. I went to therapy, got my depression mixed with anxiety diagnosis and thought “oh, now they have to take better care of me and take care they don't trigger me anymore, finally i have a validation for my feelings!” yea no, my parents didn't give a shit. My mom continued to call me lazy and bedrotting and I just wanted to get out of there. I just can't do all that. If you tell me to clean your room I will not do that because I'm tired and it's just not fun and I will be distracted by anything after a maximum of five minutes. Well, i told my therapist i had suicidal thoughts and she send me into the clinic for a talk. Until i had the talk i had to sit with my parents though and i think that traumatised and broke my trust to them forever. My mom screamed at me and asked me why I would say such bullshit, because I couldn't explain to her why I had those and she screamed that others have it worse and I'm ungrateful and why exactly around christmas? Well, I had the talk and they let me go again. My dad came into my room playing songs with lyrics like “you are perfect the way you are” and “Please, don't jump” and it was the cringiest thing in my life and didn't help shit. I just felt guilty and they didn't change their behavior so I guess they didn't learn anything. They still said they need to trust me 100% else they can’t allow me anything, like staying at home overnight alone, because they think I'm 5 or something and will light the house on fire and throw my dirty clothes everywhere around the house. I'm not sure if they actually think I would do that but I could imagine them thinking like that. Well, just a month after the clinic incident my therapist moved away and since then I haven't had therapy. I relapsed like 5 times, found new friends, got kinda better and realised I might have ADHD. I asked my Parents for therapy again and OH MY GOD. My mom asked if I wanted to end myself again, that ADHD is a trend and that she doesn’t see any ADHD in me. Well, I guess no Therapy and I will 100% not ask them again. 

The thing is, I feel so bad. What if I'm really overreacting? These are just short slips of my mother when I really did something wrong. Sometimes we sit together in the evening and laugh and have great conversations. But the bad memories are somehow more important for my head even if they are actually the minority. Once I found cigarettes in her handbag and when she came back I asked her passive aggressively when she had stopped smoking again. she shouted at me that i shouldn't touch her things and i felt so bad as if she had just caught me smoking. I was 7. I once had a desk mat so I wouldn't scratch my desk. I stabbed it because I liked the feeling, it was just so funny. She saw that and hit the back of my head with the mat. Not hard but still. She said I couldn't take care of my things and asked if I thought I was alone in the world. After that I played flea market in front of my room door because I felt like I didn't deserve any of my stuff. I was 6. One time, when I was doing an assignment at the last minute, I was really stressed because something didn't work out the way I wanted and my parents were constantly trying to talk me out of it and I'm not good with changing plans. I started crying and bit my hand and arm out of stress, relatively easily. My parents yelled at me and told me to stop acting out and slapped my hand away and told me to stop acting. I locked myself in the toilet because it was the only room I could lock and cried. I was able to turn in the assignment on time. I was 14. One time I had to cook something and I really couldn't multitask. I had a plan of how I was going to do it but my parents said I should do it differently. I was very hysterical but just as I calmed down and drained the vegetable water, the lid fell into the sink and my mother pushed me against the fridge. She said I had done it on purpose. I have hated cooking since then.

I just want to move out and never talk to them again, do things my way and prove that I'm capable of surviving on my own and that I'm not just a pile of dirt. I can't wait to make my own money.",

The man I’m with has been avoiding me physically, because I brought up topics of his behaviour which I felt disrespected by. I invited him to talk to me, but he couldn’t, because (he said) he’s really bad at talking about such stuffs. I sent him hefty messages detailing my feelings, but, he read parts of it and did not respond. Hasn’t read the one I sent today. I suppose it’s a work day after all.


I “lost” my best friend due to circumstances this year. I used to tell her everything. I saw her often. Now, I haven’t heard from her in months. I miss her. I have no close friends to go to now. I feel so lonely. Another close friend of mine is studying overseas. I have multiple friends and acquaintances, but they have other closer friends. 


I feel pressured to go further in life. But I’m just so scared to do things alone. I only have myself.. but sometimes things are easier with company. 


That’s all. My heart feels heavy, especially by the unrequited feeling from the first man i’ve ever almost loved. I accepted him, flaws and all, and yet he could not rise up to where I needed him to be. I am just so tired. Things will be better.. I suppose, yes, but I feel so dejected now.

350,"Losing hope in receiving love from those closest to you leaves a deep scar. When you lose faith in their ability to understand or contain you, it becomes difficult to even believe any subsequent attempts from them.

This despair makes communicating with them superficial, and you begin to build walls around yourself because you no longer expect from them what you once needed.",
351,"I'm adding the NSFW flair as a trigger warning as I am going to be talking about a bit of a heavy topic, also appologies for formatting issues, I am on mobile



I'm going to be free! I can't believe it, I'm a 23 year old nonbinary person with autism and a few other medical conditions, and I'm going to be able to finally live as my true authentic self! I'll be leaving my transphobic, financially, verbally, emotionally and on occasion physically abusive home.



I will be free from my mother, she won't make me feel like I'll get in trouble for spending my own money for things I am interested in, like a nice shirt once in awhile, or on the rare occasion buying myself a video game. I'll be free to finally be Vermillion, go by my true name, I'll get to look at my options for transitioning, I'll change my name legally, and maybe I might find a person who will love me for me, romantically, once ofc I've gone through a shit tonne of therapy. 


I won't have to be the peace maker anymore, having to stay up late due to a verbal argument going on for hours on end, I won't have to be pulled away from studying for university or having a break from a day out just because of some minor inconvenience that has suddenly been made my fault.


I won't have to feel this crushing weight that everything is my fault, that there is something wrong with me, that I am a terrible person and deserve all of this, I won't hav to feel like I'm some burden, that I'm being irrationally rude and horrible for just.. asking for something.


I'll be able to finally realise why I am having seizures that aren't epileptic, I've had them since I was 18 months old, I'll be finally able to figure out why they're happening and potentially treat or manage it. I'll have more accomodations for being autistic, and my sensory issues along with my body heat disregulation issues (and I can find out if those are connected to my autism or a medical condition too!) 


I'll get to finally have a healthy sleep routine, be able to determine my own routines, set healthy habits for exercise, eating, down time, studying, etc.



I can't believe I'm saying this but I'll be free, instead of saying 'just not today' like I have for so many god damned years, I'll be able to say it tomorrow, that I'll be free, it may not be today, but I have the ability to make sure it happens tomorrow, I'll finally be safe.. maybe one day I'll even be happy, this is my chance.


Tomorrow is my day, I'll take back some control, some self confidence, I'll finally be happy.



PS: if anyone has any tips for any healthy habits/routines I should start up early on to make it my new normal, please let me know! I am open to suggestions 


*edited to fix a typo, I may find more later and fix those up, also I'll try to make an update here to let you all know how it all goes tomorrow 


Update: 

Sadly I wasn't able to update on the day I moved but, I am today, the following morning, it was definitely hectic and.. a lot, but I'll try to break it down as best I remember


I almost got caught twice but managed to escape, however by the time that I arrived at my university..my mother already found out who my support work was.. I thought I'd have had at least an hour or more but.. I guess I over estimated it. Thankfully she doesn't know where said support network lives.


She also reported me as a missing person and had the police and I had to deal with that, she had the police at that station as well as the people at the job seeker agency I use to help maintain my employment (due to my disabilities) around her finger, they wouldn't hear much of what I said, thankfully I went to a police station that wasn't the one my mother was at (much further away) and I was believed. 


Yesterday I was advised to sort out my money.. but sadly I wasn't able to do so.. so sadly I'm still reliant on my support network and my limited amount of cash for now (I haven't counted it but I know it's a few hundred from memory) so there's that.

Sadly I got a stress headache and went to bed early, thankfully the headache is gone, I'm just.. taking it all in I guess.. that I'm actually.. free, I don't think reality has really hit yet


My brain hasn't allowed me to cry yet.. sadly I've been too all over the place, it's like my brain has been shutting on and off my emotions.. though I'm so used to just not being able to cry so, I guess it makes sense that I've not been able to? I don't know.. 


I also feel like too much of a burden on my support network who are helping me, and who I'm staying with.. they've been amazing but I feel awful that they've had to deal with my mother. I'm terrified of her finding me still.


There isn't much to update, I haven't listened to any of the voice messages, there's.. a lot, and I'm not going to for my mental health..

352,"So, I need to vent this. My partner and I have a good relationship. We go through rough patches and through good patches as well but currently I would say we are doing great. We have talks about our future together, we make decisions regarding our shared home and we are both physically affectionate to each other (kisses, hugs, cuddles etc.)

The thing is, I have quite a sex drive. And so does/did he. Our sex life has been great so far! But the past week he kind of... Stopped? I tried to set a romantic scene, cuddled and kissed him as usual... But he just straight up tells me no. This has been going on for five days straight now and I really don't know what is happening. 

I do still feel like he loves me, and that he desires me. Maybe it is us moving out of the honeymoon phase and into the love-bonded phase. Maybe it is a good thing.. 

I don't want advice as well, I just needed to get it off my chest. ",
353,"So I (m20) moved to a new place about two years ago. Shortly after coming here I went into a shop. Inside of the shop was a girl working the front desk. I thought she was attractive so I tried striking up a conversation with her. She was rude in response so I left cordially, respectfully. The interaction brought up some shame for me but other than that I didn’t think anything of it. But then I started seeing this girl everywhere I went (small town). Namely the gym I was attending quite frequently. At this gym was lots of attractive women. Being the extroverted young lad I am I approached many of them and asked them for their numbers. Some said yes, some said no. I was always cordial and respectful as can be. Then one day I was leaving the gym and on my way out was stopped by the guy at the front desk. He told me I should stop asking girls out at the gym. I asked why and he said because they received complaints. Sitting at a chair at the front desk across from him was this same girl and her friend. I actually liked the guy at the front desk but argued with him until he confessed that she was the one who told him that I was being weird. She said that I ask EVERY girl and it makes people uncomfortable. I told them that wasn’t my problem, flipped them off, and left. I have since made up with this specific gym employee and we are friendly. Flash forward a couple months I return to that gym after a hefty break. I end up asking a girl out who I found attractive and she says she has a boyfriend. I cordially, respectfully tell her “no problem, have a nice day.” The next time I see her at the gym no problem. But then today I walked past her on my way into the weight room and she instantly got up and went to the front desk. I worked out for like 20 minutes and took two trips to the water fountain in between sets. Both of these trips I made a specific effort not to look at this girl, who was working out near the fountain. Then a different guy that works at the gym, one I have prior beef with (I find him condescending and I gave him lip once for asking redundant questions) walked up to me and told me I had to leave. He said he had received multiple complaints that I was staring at women creepily. I leave and come to find out that the girl that I asked out roughly a week ago (the one I walked past and she went to the front desk) is seemingly best friends with the girl who reported me the first time, as seen on her instagram. What a surprise. The gym said they have to review the security footage to determine whether or not they’re going to ban me for good. I’m sorry but this is ridiculous. ",
354,"ive been living a directionless life. i don’t really have any goals or anything. I completed highschool, though i struggled. I have a job and i struggle even though i have very few hours. i have fibromyalgia so i’m always in pain and it never goes away.

i don’t feel fulfilled in my job, but i can’t conceive of a job that i would feel fulfilled in.
i thought about going to university but all courses don’t feel like they would make me feel fulfilled. It all feels like busy work. I don’t even know if I could start and finish an assignment.

I have moments where i’m with friends and just hanging out where things feel sort of right. But the moment I’m not talking to people or listening that looming feeling takes hold.
I want to provide for the people i care about, i want to feel like i mean something. I want to be more than this. i can’t work up any ambition",
355,"Years ago I dated my then and now best friend. It was a few months, but it was still the longest relationship we both had since then (or even before). I'm a girl, she's a girl, you might know how complicated wlw relationship can get. Our love was natural, we fell in love at the same time after years of friendship. It just hurts to remember that she was my muse and the only person in the world whose touch didn't activate flight or fight mode in my body. We were in the planning phase of moving in together as first year uni students. 
She was the one who broke up, because her romantic love for me faded. A lot was going on in her life, I know, but in mine too. We still remained best friends after a little break. I don't love her like that anymore, none of us are the same after all these years. 
Fast forward a few months ago, she got a boyfriend. She was madly in love with him, and I'm gonna be honest, they were very compatible with eachother. They planned on the long term, the guy almost moved in with her. Then he dropped that he doesn't love her that way anymore. She was/is devastated, and I had to comfort her, but deep down I feel like she deserved it. 
She finally got the taste of her of medicine; breaking up from nowhere, when you think your relationship is going to last a lifetime. She snapped like me back then, but in a crazier way. She is privileged, isn't conditioned for confrontation. 
I still care, and am concerned about her. We talk everyday, discuss our life and struggles. I feel bad, yet so relieved because she finally got a big slap from Life. ",
356,"In process of getting evicted, I decide to clean my toilet since it was just used by the rest of my household and I remembered hearing a cleaning hack about how you can pour fabulouso in the toilet tank to make it smell nice. So I went ahead and did that but it wasn't even much, about a 1/3 of the bottle. I immediately realized my mistake and confirmed by googling that you SHOULDN'T do that bc it can mess with the flap that helps flush and I should get it out as soon as I can. I didn't want to make a mess and end up reaching out to my landlord about my blunder so in a panic I just flushed and kept flushing until it sounded normal. So far my toilet looks and sounds normal so I'm not sure if I got lucky or if this is gonna come bite me in the ass later. I couldn't tell anyone else about this since we're in the eviction process and I know it was such a stupid thing to do without making sure. Just had to vent and get this off my chest.",

358,"i had the surgery anyway. i had put up with enough from my last partner, who pressured me to not get the surgery. i am a strongly independent person. i am very in love with my girlfriend, but i had to fend for myself from a young age, and i had to put myself back together from a young age. if i need to do something alone, with no support from those around me, i will do it. ive done it before with hrt.

but that didnt happen. my girlfriend never touched my chest pre op. she completely ignored it, which was fine, because i didnt really get anything from being touched there. but after i had top surgery, it was like a switch flicked for her. i was obviously a lot more comfortable with a flat chest (i had huge boobs, seriously. not fun for anyone) and since around 4 days post op she could not keep her hands off of me, feeling my new chest through the medical binder. when i got the binder taken off, she was so excited to see my new chest. she was my sole caretaker after my surgery, and she treated me like a king. she did all of my nipple care, scar care, drains, everything. i luckily didnt have much (any) mobility issues, but if i needed more help, i know she wouldve been happy to

its been months since then. we moved across the country together. im looking into bottom surgery and im sure im going to have people who tell me, ""she wont stay with you once you have that done,"" but frankly i dont believe them, because she has every other time, and not only has she stayed through my other surgeries, but shes been very excited about this one as well

we've been together for two years and im proposing later in the year after we've gotten settled out here. i wouldnt want to spend my life with anyone else. ive posted in here before about her because im just so happy with her. i think people who hate us and people like us so violently simply dont know any of us and havent seen the love we share with each other. anyway, thats all. and yeah fuck that other person",
359,"While I should--in no means necessary--be entitled to anything that my roommates had, what I just figured out pisses me off a little, hence why the callout post being made. I had made an effort, like I did in previous semesters, to share whatever it was that I had owned with my roommates in our collective suite. Trashcans, a TV, decor, a broom, Febreze, etc etc. I wanted to make it feel like a collective space that we could all contribute to, freely and indiscriminately. I expected that whatever I shared would be shared back with me in a similar quality. It was not.

Apparently, this whole time my roommates had mops, trashcans, fridges, freezers, microwaves, and so on for their own disposal which I had no access to, seeing as we had our own locked rooms. Again, they had no reason to share it with me, but it just sucks seeing as I went out of my way to buy stuff--*sometimes even for them and our shared space*\--and they hadn't felt compelled at all to return that same favor. They even stole shit from our shared common area for themselves! A whole ass footrest was kept in one of my roommate's rooms! Like, damn, dude. I don't know. I wish there was the same amount of care that I had given to them that they would give to me. Yet again, nothing in this world is owed to us, so who am I *really* to complain?",
360,"I’m slowly realizing the effects of abuse. When I was a kid it never occurred to me that the things I went through were the cause of everything I was feeling and doing. 

Now that I’m older. It makes sense. I just never thought that experiencing abuse as an adult would revert me back to the insecure human being I was back then. Then again, I let myself be abused after realizing what was happening so obviously I’m no wiser for the wear. I know all of the things, I had therapy for almost a year after I wasted. I thought I’d overcome it so much easier. 

I’m so unsure, no confidence in anything I do, no enjoyment in life. I feel like a shell that had the creature that once was inside violently ripped out and eaten by the predator that chose me for its meal. 

I now realize what letting yourself go means. 

I just want her back. ",
361,"This is going to be a long one, but those of you who make it to the end will know that I’d be doing a disservice by leaving any of this out. This is one of the crazier things that’s happened in my life, so I suppose I’m looking for advice but I’m also just disturbed and can’t keep it to myself. I’ll try to be as concise as possible. I promise this isn’t just another low-brow “religion bad” post.

I know some of this will sound outlandish. If I weren’t living it I would think it was the plot of a South Park episode. Not because it’s funny, but because it’s so over the top that it’s bordering on parody at this point.

I have no problem at all with religious people or even the concept of religion if people find it fulfilling, but what I’m observing in my roommate has become something very different from typical Christianity. We’ve lived together for the past 18 months and still have eight months left on our lease. We’ve been friends for around six years. Before moving in together I knew he believed in God, read the Bible often and went to church on Sundays, but there was no indication that his beliefs would intensify the way they have over the past year and a half. He knows I don’t subscribe to any organized religion but has tried to recruit me in various ways.

Over time, he slowly started talking more about ways he thought God was communicating with him and would frequently tell me God was “telling him” things. I understand this can be considered a normal part of religion, but these would range from things like “God told me to sit in the front row at church today” to hyper-specific things like “I was walking past a woman on the street and God told me she needed help cleaning her pool. I walked up to her and asked her if she needed help.”

I initially dismissed this as him innocently becoming more excited about religion and felt bad for judging him. I found it strange, but smiled and nodded and accepted that I just don’t understand.

A few weeks after this became prevalent, I was sitting in my bedroom on a Saturday morning and heard weeping coming from his room. I was obviously concerned so I went and knocked on his door to make sure he was okay. He told me to come in and I found him at his desk, hunched over his Bible, crying as he was reading it because he said “the scripture shapes and impacts his life every day.” He has since told me that crying while reading his Bible has become a regular occurrence.

He’s also become much more invested in pushing religion on other people. For me, it started with gift giving. For Christmas he got me something small based on one of my interests, along with rosary beads, a Bible and prayer cards. He will probe often into whether I’ve read any of the Bible (I’ve skimmed some passages as it was a gift and I didn’t want to seem ungrateful). Again, I felt bad for finding this odd at the time since I know he has good intentions and he’s a friend I care about.

One day I was sitting in his room and noticed a packet of paper on his desk. I asked him what it was and started flipping through it. It was a detailed guide on how to approach strangers in public with the specific intention of guiding the conversation toward religion and trying to “spread the good word.” It followed some sort of process like “First, give the person a compliment so they feel comfortable and appreciated. Then, tell them they’re a child of God and ask if you can hold their hands and pray for them. If they decline, ask them why.” Yet again, I found this odd, pushy, and out of character for him, but dismissed my concerns as being too harsh.

**_Now, this is where I stopped dismissing my concerns._**

When we first moved in, he celebrated by buying us a bottle of our favorite expensive liquor. He insisted it was a gift from him and for us to share and that I had free access to it. I don’t drink often, but was excited for us to enjoy it on the weekends. It sat in our freezer for a while untouched, and one Friday night I suggested that we break it out since we were just chilling at home. He told me that he took the bottle out of the freezer and threw it in the dumpster days ago. I thought he was joking and laughed, and then he told me he did it because God told him that he “had to make a decision about whether he’d rather serve Him or his earthly desires” and that “the choice was clear.” This crossed the line into full-blown delusion for me, but it gets worse.

He has a tech job in our city that he’s averagely-successful at. He came home from work one day wearing a suit, which is different from his usual attire. I asked him what the special occasion was and he told me that he left work early to drive an hour and a half in the opposite direction of where we live to interview for a new job where he’ll get to try and convert people to Christianity. He told me he would leave his tech job that provides him benefits like health insurance and his 401(k) in order to take a massive pay cut and work 20 hours a week in an office that brainstorms ways to convert people to Christianity. I’m unclear on how this is a paid position, but he claims it is. We’re obviously too old to be on anyone else’s health insurance at this point, so this seems extremely irresponsible and reckless to me.

**The last straw was a few days ago when he brought people from his church over to our apartment for Bible study.** It was a group of about eight of them. They were having a discussion in the living room while I was cooking myself dinner in the kitchen a few feet away. He’s had them over before and they’ve always been kind to me so I don’t mind, but as I was cooking I was listening to their conversation and it was extremely unsettling.

Some of his friends were talking about wanting to join a group of people that claim to have “holy visions” of random people in random areas and then actively go searching for those imagined people because they think God is telling them to find those people to pray for them. The example his one friend gave was that the group had a “shared holy vision” of a girl in a coffee shop with a pink water bottle who was wearing a white shirt and jeans. The group then searched coffee shops in our city to try and find the girl on the very day they imagined her so they could pray for her.

His friends tried to engage me in conversation while I was cooking by asking me what my plans for the night were. I told them I was binge watching all the Scream movies and that I’m a big horror movie fan. They told me that they detest horror movies because they “glorify death in a way that is not in line with scripture.” His one friend said that he liked the first Scream movie, but immediately after saying it became noticeably distressed and immediately backtracked and claimed he actually did not like the movie. It was like he believed God was in the room and listening to the conversation and he had to dispel it immediately or God would become angry at him. Again, disturbing to witness.

**The absolute cherry on top/where I draw the line** is that one of the members of his Bible study is clearly a gay man. I’m a bisexual man myself (not to my roommate’s knowledge, and he’ll never find out at this point) so I’m absolutely not judging his friend at all, I’m just being honest that it’s extremely obvious. One day my roommate told me unprompted that the friend in question “was gay before he opened himself up to the Holy Spirit.” I was understandably stunned that a man in his 20s would believe such a thing is even possible in today’s world, so I pushed back lightly by asking “do you believe that’s possible?” and he claimed that “God puts in your heart what you need.” My roommate then went on to say he viewed it as a positive that his friend’s story “can help people in the same situation.” What’s most unsettling is that his friend is 39 years old, has no current or former relationship with a woman and claims to be “enjoying the single life.” My roommate is unable to make the leap in logic that his friend is still gay and truly believes he was “healed.”

I’ve never told him about my sexuality because I don’t really care to (I would tell him if he asked, I’m just more of a private person) but seeing that shift in him in particular made it apparent to me that I’ve completely lost him. He’s on the highway to religious extremism and has insulated himself in a community that reinforces everything I’ve described. 

I’m in mourning over our friendship knowing that there’s likely no coming back from this. ",
362,"I am sick of feeling guilty all the time. I am 35 years old. I have a somewhat stressful job, I am also on the road a lot. Currently i am only home on the weekends. I hate it that when I am home, my mom makes me feel guilty for not spending enough time with her, even though I make it a point to eat Sunday dinner with her and my dad. I also feel guilty that when she calls me, I don't always feel like talking. I am trying to decompress from work and she will call me and ask me a million questions about work, my bf, my step child etc. And she seems to ask me over and over again about everything that stresses me out. And if I don't feel like talking, or I start getting short with her, she will play the victim about how she ""just misses me"" or she will say that I am not really upset with her, I'm upset with something else and taking it out on her. She just called me a little bit ago, to ask me a million questions about the house we are trying to get a loan to remodel, and I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS RIGHT NOW! I had a rough day at work today and now you want to interrogate me about something I do not have the bandwidth to deal with right now? I don't feel like i have enough hours in my day to give everyone that wants my attention enough time. And she is the absolute WORSE offender for feeling entitled to all of my time. If I don't have a VERY thorough excuse for why I can't talk to her, or spend time with her on the weekend she will make me feel guilty about it. She will also text me everyday for the next week about how much she loves and misses me. I know I should be grateful, and there are people who would kill to be able to talk to their moms again, or to receive that text again etc. But she is worse than having another partner that demands my time. I am letting other relationships fall through the cracks in my life because I don't have the mental capacity to handle talking to people or visiting with people 24/7. She is someone that if I agree to do an activity with her that should take 1-2hrs she will do EVERYTHING she can to extend it. I spent over 12 hours with her last Saturday because I offered to take her to get pedicures for mothers day... I know she won't be around forever, and I love her very much, but I needed to get this off my chest because I can't take it anymore. Thanks for listening to my rant. ",

I’m doing everything I can I work, I study, I’m not lazy. But I live in a small town, and I don’t have extra jobs to pick up, and the next paycheck won’t come until the end of the month.

edit: why are you downvoting me",
366,"Well, I just got back out from a rabbit hole and I'm an absolute mess and I'm shaking. For context, I (35f) was raped by an ex of mine in late 2013. I had moved him from NY down to VA where I was living at the time because he swore he could find work there a lot easier than where he was living. That turned out to be a lie and things spiraled from there, and one night he wouldn't listen to the word ""no"". He tried again the night after but I was able to snap out of it and send an elbow to his throat and he left me alone from that night on.

Then one day after I came home from a doctor's appointment, I noticed all of his stuff was gone and so was all of our food and some sentimental items of mine. Because he disappeared without a trace and I didn't have a working phone number for him, I was never able to get justice. Unfortunately, that rape resulted in a pregnancy as well that I had a hard time dealing with, but wound up finding a family to adopt my child. I'm doing much better with interacting with my child now that it's been more than a decade, and I have found the love of my life who would never dare do something like that to me and knows my triggers with this situation.

Fast forward to today, a video popped up in my YouTube suggested that made me think of my ex, and since he blocked me on Facebook, I decided to do some digging elsewhere. Lo and behold, I popped his name into Google, plus the word ""arrest"" and there he is; arrested for 50 counts of child pornography possession and the sexual abuse of a minor in Pennsylvania. And when I checked the sex offender registry in that area, there he is again, a convicted sex offender since 2015.

My heart has been racing ever since and there are all these swirling emotions of vindication, disgust, and just overall confusion in my mind. And then it clicked even more, since we met when I was 16 and he was 7 years older than me; the only reason he wanted to get back with me was to get away from where he grew up and just keep me around so he could continue his sick games. And all of the things he said and asked of me when I was 16 made more sense and now I'm just delirious with this overwhelming hate and odd sense of justice. I hate that a child was hurt because of this bastard, but at least that child received justice and so did I by a very distant proxy.

Then I started searching for his family to see what had happened since then, but I think they just decided to do a social media freeze on that year plus a few years afterward. There's no mention of what was going on that I could see, but it's likely those posts were private or deleted since then. But I did see some pictures of him from 2019 with his father and sister, and he looks MISERABLE. Then again, he has to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life and have his mugshot updated every time too, so the misery makes sense.

I'm waiting for my husband to come home so I can update him on the news, and hopefully he can calm me down for the night.",
367,"
Hi everyone,

I’m writing this not as a rant, but more as a way to let some feelings out. Life isn’t really turning out the way I imagined 
(in both a positive and a negative way).

For some context, I come from a very poor background .no inheritance, no family money, no safety net. Since I was a kid, I’ve always been curious, full of energy, and eager to explore what life had to offer. I experimented a lot, had fun, met all kinds of people. That curiosity led me to discover new passions, music production.

During university (finance) , I decided to pursue that passion seriously. I dreamed of working with BIG artists and labels, and I worked incredibly hard for it. I dreamed of being the main character of my life.Starting from zero, with no connections or help, I managed to hit some impressive milestones. I collaborated with a couple of the biggest artists in the world, won some gold and platinum awards, and built what, from the outside, might look like a successful and incredible career.

When I was younger, I truly believed I could achieve anything if I just worked hard enough. But the older I get, the more I realize how different people’s starting points are how much some are backed by family or wealth, while others have to build from nothing. And I feel that difference deeply. It hurts. Because despite the odds, I reached goals that 99.99% of music producers will never reach in their entire careers and yet, I still can’t make a living from it. I can’t fulfill the legacy I imagined for myself, and that’s a painful truth to accept. Especially as i’m writing this i have in front of me my awards that made me so proud.

The music industry today isn’t what it used to be. Unless you create a global smash hit — the kind that racks up billions of streams and dominates radio it’s incredibly hard to earn a stable income or living wage to sustain a family. There’s no paycheck, and your livelihood depends on factors completely out of your control. Many people in this field have financial support from their families, which allows them to keep going even when money isn’t coming in. That’s not my case.

For the past few years, I’ve been constantly worried about money. This pressure has slowly pulled me away from the pure joy of making music and forced me to think about financial survival. I’ve come to realize that someone like me can’t rely on music alone. I need to build a future that offers stability, too. Time is passing and as much as i love music i can’t live on the verge of bankruptcy without a structure in my life.

I’ve always been a dreamer. I wanted to live a full life and do something meaningful, to be recognized, and to reach a high level in my field. Be financially comfortable so i can (maybe)buy myself that house that i’ve never had and always dreamed of. Or at least try to. But I’m starting to accept that I may have to take on a job just to fund my real passion and regular life in general. And while I understand that many people separate their income from their purpose, it still hurts. I didn’t want to live a life divided between “money” and “dreams.” I wanted it all to be one thing whole, meaningful, and fulfilling. But I know now that this was probably a fantasy, especially for someone in my position.

So yes, I’m sad. I’m not asking for help I just needed to get this off my chest. I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished, and personally grateful. But economically, it’s not enough. I can’t support myself long-term this way, so staying on this path alone isn’t sustainable. It hurts. It hurts badly.

Sometimes I wonder if things would’ve been easier if I didn’t have this desire to be someone in this life and to express my full potencial. And now I’m afraid. Afraid of starting this new chapter where I’ll have to divide myself in two. What if this new version of me is not as good as the one before? Afraid of letting go of my passion. I don’t want to. Afraid of forgetting what the younger version of me dreamed of. Afraid of a future that doesn’t match what I imagined. Afraid of my passion leaving me.

The system always worked against me. I’ve had to live like many others in near poverty. No heating. No fancy vacations. No expensive clothes. Being ashamed to invite friends at home because how small and bad it was. This is my story. A story of someone who just wanted his life to be a story of greatness but hit a wall after reaching the top.

Thanks for reading.",

369,"My parents had a new baby almost 2 years ago, and ever since i feel deeply depressed about it 

I was 16 at the time he was born and still cant seem to actually enjoy the “sibling experience”… I do love him, he is a very cute and sweet baby and he likes me too! But I don’t like being a sister.

I had to simply throw away almost every dream of mine because of our financial situation after him and having no more free time, I threw away hobbies, friends, studying and many more important things to me because I physically can’t stand having to watch him and take care of him ALL day and function normally..

And I can’t choose to just not take care of him, or else I’m yelled at, threatened in some ways and my guilt comes after me lol 

I know it’s selfish, but this year was supposed to be MY year… the year I would finally pass in a good university, study and work hard and actually start to have a life of my own.. but now it’s all ruined, I can’t even open a book now and it makes me so depressed.. 

I can’t even work cause my parents don’t let me and say “you don’t need this, you’re not going through hunger”

It hurts me so bad that even if I love that poor innocent baby that loves me back if I ever got the option I would choose him to never be born at all

Often I don’t even wanna get up cause I know I’ll have to spend all day doing the same thing all over again

370,"It’s been six years since I went NC with my ex-best friend turned rapist. He took me home after a party, and I woke up naked next to him the following morning. The last thing I remember was throwing up in the trash can under his desk. 

He apologized for raping me and I told him we shouldn’t speak anymore. 

Fast forward to this weekend, my friend was performing at a large community event and I caught a glimpse of him as I was exiting the auditorium for intermission. 

I wanted to cry and leave the event, but if people like him are allowed to carelessly exist and take up space, so should I.

Not to go for low hanging fruit, but he looked really bad. Hairline receded to the crown of his head, holding onto whatever length of hair he can maintain, and the same dead stare from the last time I saw him. 

I really do wish him all that he deserves.  ",
371,"
To give a bit of context, I live with my children in an 8-unit apartment block. My 14-year-old son is responsible for putting the garbage and recycling bins near the street on collection day. He does not handle any furniture. It's up to the other neighbors to bring their own items to the pickup point.

I've had several issues with one particular neighbor in the past, constantly having to remind them of the rules (the landlord as well).

A few days ago, a large pile of wood appeared, and among it were reusable bags full of various items. I found toilet paper, tampons, sanitary pads—you can imagine the rest. I was furious.

Today is the scheduled pickup day for wood. I moved the pile myself (it was too dangerous for my son). While moving it, some papers and envelopes fell out of one of the bags, and, surprise—there was the address of the neighbor I've had problems with before.

I went to knock on their door, and the mother answered. I started yelling at her. I told her it was disgusting to leave her trash lying around and reminded her that it's my son who takes care of the garbage. She started denying everything. I showed her the envelope, and she kept denying it, even snatching the envelope out of my hands.

I asked her if she would let her kids handle my used sanitary pads, and she said no. I told her to never do this again, or I would bring her trash back to her doorstep. She slammed the door in my face.

I then sent a text to the landlord, who's just going to give her a warning. If rent wasn’t so high in my city, I would have already moved out. I'm so fed up with the lack of respect from my neighbors.",
372,"So I had a realization about my ex-friend, after way too many years have passed. I've tried to get my mind off things by taking up hobbies and Journaling. But most of my time has been takien up by unhealthy things feeding into my thoughts.

I don't have anybody to talk to about this. I can't talk to my husband about what I've been going through. The only other person is my mom and she hated ex-friend too much to be a shoulder to lean on. She all but yells at me to STFU amd get over myself already. I don't even want to say how old I am or what my circumstances are because this is too fucking stupid for me to be going through now. I am so fucking ashamed of myself. I've tried to get over this and I can't.

So, I figured maybe I could write to him. If I have to.let this go anyway, why not tell him how I feel? I'm not making any big confessions, just that I'm sorry we couldn't be friends. I didn't sign the letter or put down a return address. It's not that he won't figure it out. It's that I don't expect or need a reply. That's...that's not unhinged at all. That's totally reasonable. Understandable, even. Why, that was the greatest idea ever! It's better to regret something you did than something you didn't do, right?

God, what a load of shit!

I mean, what's ex-friend gonna do? Track me down and reply? Oh, God... 

Someone please save me.

Edit: Here is what I wrote 

"" I want you to know walking away from you was the right decision in the end. But, for what it's worth, I am sorry that we couldn't be friends. Also...thank you.""

I wrote ""thank you"" because I got this tip when you're having trouble getting rid of an old shirt or something, tell that object ""thank you"". It really does help me get rid of things I don't need anymore. That's not the only reason, but I'm going to keep it to myself.",

I loved you with every fiber in my being and you did this to me. I expressed to you about how being cheated on was my worst fear and still, you did it. You decided to turn to the internet to talk to some random girl from Canada.

I feel as though it's my fault that you cheated on me. I feel shame because we didn't have sex. It was a combination of antidepressants, life being tough, and not feeling attractive or being attracted to you. I should've said something about not feeling attraction towards you. You could be so mean sometimes, so angry, so mad at the world. I didn't like how it made you look. I told my therapist but I didn't tell you. I figured that we've been together for 4 years and I couldn't change you.

Anyways, I tried to come up with a solution - a sex schedule. You agreed and we decided to implement it that same night. You were talking to that girl when you last had sex with me. After you told me how good I was to you and how I made you feel, how did you feel after? Did that make you sad? Did it make you feel enthralled? Did you ever care about how I would feel? Or did you think of her when you were in between my legs?

I know logically it isn't my fault but I could've given you more and I know that I could've been a better girlfriend. I'm sad today but I won't give up on love.

Hello reddit. This is very interesting depth so please turn away if you don't have the spoons.

I am an only child with Dissociative Identity Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder.

My biological Father refused to work, and only had horrible things to say to me.



my Father was adopted by his step father. His biological Father was institutionalized in Saint Peter Minnesota for Antisocial Personality, which I didn't learn until I was in my late 20s.  He used to set woman on fire. He also struggled with alcohol. 
      My biological Father was in and and out of the foster system due to ""problems "" that his biological mother wouldn't identify. I have reason to believe is antisocial behavior was a response to the trauma he experienced as an autistic child.
       From an early age, he struggled with his half sibling who was his biological half sister, who came to be from his step father, a first generation Native American German man. The man, we will call Fred, was the first generation American born son. He later learned in his older years that his biological mother left Nazi Germany, abandoning her toddler and her small 5 year old child. Perhaps this affected how he cared for my Father and his biological daughter, though I am unsure.

I learned most of the history from my Father, and unfortunately was a pathological liar. 
My Father only went through half of ninth grade, and met my mom in rural Minnesota when she was in like tenth grade. He would have been a been a legal adult.

He has a disturbing relationship with my grandmother ""Jaja"" who took to heart the German culture to erase her own blood affiliated culture. I only learned this from photographs and word of mouth. One of her Sisters contacted cancer two years after she died (when I was seven) and her half sister went mad, and who was admitted into one of Minnesota's pyc wards for long-term care. I am unable to ask them familial history.


Last year my Mother finally confessed to me that my Biological Father was not white, which was a demonstration of her own generation racism.

I haven't vocally spoke to my biological Father since I was 12. I only found him because he stalked me and my Mother, appearing at my house suddenly.

Although I knew I was the odd ball out, it's hard to find a community to feel welcome in as a white passing person. It's okay, I understand, and I'm not upset. 


I just want to know how you guys find community without fitting into a box, or having the blood quantum card to prove it?


Thanks guys.",

381,"The other day my girlfriend’s ex DMed her on Instagram (off of a second account) & confronted her about cheating on him during their relationship. I asked her about it & she denied everything. At first I was a little skeptical, but later on I believed her. 

Today, she cried to me & confessed that she lied & she did cheat on her ex. Her ex said that he wasn’t ready for a relationship, so she ended up having sex with her coworker. Obviously she regrets it & she told me that she hated herself for it ever since, & she would never do the same to me. 

I could definitely try to forgive her since that incident was 2 years ago, but I don’t think I can trust her the same. She told me before that she never cheated & hates cheaters etc, but it’s all crazy to me now knowing that she did. She’d definitely have to regain my trust, I just don’t know how.

Me and my partner have a shared friend group (we'll call our friends B and T). Earlier today i got upset at my partner because he disclosed a personal trauma of mine to his parents who i haven't met yet. I expressed i was upset and he offered to call me later in the day as i had a social event to go to. 

I stay at my social event for a bit, and then i go home to call my partner. My partner had decided to go for drinks with B and T instead of calling me. I messaged him expressing i was upset that he ditched on our plans to gp drinking. He responded for a bit, and then stopped opening my messages. I message B and T politely asking if they could get my partner to call me. They both open my message but completely ignore me. I tried calling my partner, the call went through but he didn't pick up. 

It's now been 6 hours since they all started ignoring me. I have no idea why or what I'm supposed to do. I'm beside myself with anger, sadness and anxiety, and i feel like they're all being completely unfair. If they didn't want to talk, they could've told me instead of blatantly ignoring me.",

385,"**TLDR:** I ended things with my ex. I still love him. And now, I’m that ex—the crazy, clingy one. I hate it.

Maybe the title is misleading. Maybe it’s not. But here it is: I’m *that* ex. The Clingy One. The kind I used to pity. The kind I swore I’d never become.

We were together for three years. He was my opposite in so many ways, and yet we somehow fit—messy, flawed, complicated, but real. We had our ups and downs, and on New Year's Day, after days of bitter arguments, endless crying (mostly on my part), we finally broke it off. And yes, I was the one who agreed to it. I *thought* I was doing the right thing.

We ended things on good terms, if that even means anything. We said we'd stay friends. We kept living together, because we had no choice—trapped in a lease, sharing the same space, even the same bed. It wasn’t ideal, but we made it work. Or so I told myself.

Then the lease ended—and somehow, *we* didn’t. We chose to keep living together, even moved somewhere far together. And that’s when things started rotting from the inside out.

It’s been nearly six months, and every single day my regret eats at me. I’ve become possessive, obsessive even. I see him smile at someone else, laugh with another woman, and something in me breaks. It’s pathetic. I *hate* it. I hate *me.*

I never wanted to be this person—the ex who can’t move on, who spirals the second he looks at someone else. But here I am. Trapped in love with someone who’s already made it clear: he’s never taking me back. No maybes, no hope. I even asked, in a “hypothetical” way. He didn’t hesitate. Just said *no.*

And I have to wake up every day in the same space as him, pretending I’m fine while he's clearly moving on. Like our three years meant nothing. Like *I* meant nothing.

I’ve tried distracting myself—flirting, hobbies, watching dumb shows, anything to numb this. Nothing works. The anger keeps building, and it scares me. Because I don't *want* to be this angry. I don't want to be this bitter, clingy ex. But I am. And the worst part? A part of me doesn’t even care anymore.

I’ve tried talking to him. Tried to confess, to pull back, to set boundaries, to behave. But it’s like my feelings are glued to my skin. I lash out, say things I regret. People tell me I’m being immature, and maybe I am. Maybe I’m just losing it.

So yeah, that’s my confession. I’m the pitiful, desperate, emotionally wrecked ex still in love with a man who’s already erased me from his future. And I don’t know who I’m becoming. I just know I don’t like her. But I can’t stop her either.

I don’t even know if this post belongs here. I guess I’ll find out soon enough.

**P.S.** Before anyone says we should just stop living together—yeah, that’s already in motion. We’re parting ways later this month. It’s temporary for now; it feels like the most practical option while we try to untangle everything else going on. And yes, I know it *should* be permanent. I’ve heard it, I’ve thought it, told myself that a thousand times. But life’s complicated—messy in ways that are hard to explain in a single Reddit post. Maybe I’ll explain more in the future, but for now, this is all I can give.",

389,"Trying to keep this long and complicated story as short as I can. I’m a 28-year-old guy, and I’ve been with my partner for 13 years. We got engaged a few years ago. We grew up together, went through everything side by side, and essentially became part of each other. We never fought, never had major disagreements, and just clicked perfectly. We’ve been living together for 6 years, made a home, and planned our future together. It’s our first and only relationship — neither of us has ever been with anyone else or experienced life on our own.

Last fall, things started to wear down a bit. We were both overworked, adopted a puppy (which drained a lot of energy), and ended up putting less effort into our relationship. We prioritized quantity over quality, and I admit I struggled when she started going out more and spending time with her friends. I should’ve been more open and understanding.

That emotional distance and the pressure I unintentionally put on her led to her meeting someone new — someone she eventually fell in love with. At first it was emotional, but then it turned physical. She didn’t come clean immediately — I found out in pieces, especially about the physical part, which she only admitted after I confronted her.

It was a devastating shock. I never thought she was capable of this — we had what felt like a nearly perfect life (home, travel, a car we just bought, a puppy, plans for the future). At first, I was furious and tried to let her go. But I realized I couldn’t just throw away 13 years like that. We’ve been talking a lot since then, trying to figure out what to do.

She says she still loves me deeply, feels I’m her soulmate, wants to build a life and have children with me. But at the same time, she’s in love with this other guy — even though she knows it’s not going anywhere serious (he’s younger, immature, and not in the same place in life). She can’t seem to let go of him… but she can’t let go of me either.

I know what most people would say: walk away, you deserve better, have some self-respect. And maybe you’re right. But try to understand — we grew up together. She’s my other half. I can’t picture life without her, and honestly, I don’t want to. Despite the betrayal and the lies, I still love her. And we still enjoy spending time together.

For now, we’ve separated physically, but we still talk, meet, and keep a connection. Meanwhile, she continues seeing the other guy. In a way, it’s become an ‘open relationship’ — and yeah, I hate that. I hate sharing someone who used to be just mine. But I can’t bring myself to let go of her. I just can’t.

It’s messy and emotionally exhausting. I know this ‘solution’ (if you can call it that) will probably hurt me more in the long run. But I’m holding on to the hope that we can set a timeline — a period where she can figure things out — and then eventually return to me fully. She’s open to that too.

How can I tell if my hope for a future together with her is realistic, or if I’m just holding on to something that can’t be fixed?",
390,"Leg came to my work today.  They ducked in, waved, and left, and it was less than a minute, but now my anxiety is kicking in and I'm really freaking out.  I regret ever telling them where my job is.  I regret talking to them in the first place.

And I know it's my fault, I still haven't outright TOLD Leg I don't want them around me.  But I still don't know WHAT to say.  'Hey, some things you said gave me the ick, and one random internet stranger on Reddit said you might be a pdf empathizer, so go screw yourself'?  I know I'm a doormat, but something just keeps me from cutting them off.

I'm pretty sure it's because they told me they don't have a lot of IRL friends, and about two months (ish) ago they said they were cut off by an online friend.  And I'm honestly starting to wonder if the reason wasn't what they told me, and if someone else had a case of rose tinted glasses coming off.

I guess I thought I was in a safer predicament since Leg and I haven't spoken since EARLY APRIL.  But then they 'swung by' today and now I'm terrified they'll show up again and try to start something while I'm at work.  I doubt it'd be anything violent or illegal, but I don't know.  What happens if the 'eldritch horror god' personality they supposedly have decides to come harass my coworkers?

I started this as a vent and to beg for advice, but I'm not sure what I can do at this point.  Avoid talking to Leg?  Risk showing them up at my work.  Tell them I need to walk away because they're a fucking crazy weirdo?  Risk them showing up at my work.

391,"Dear You,

You never really knew me—not truly. You saw the version of me that survived, the one who loved you the best way she could, but you didn’t see the roots that grew her. You didn’t see the pieces of a girl who had to become her own protector, her own guide, long before she ever learned what love should feel like.

I didn’t grow up surrounded by soft things. I wasn’t cradled by love or taught that I was safe to be held, to fall apart, to be heard. The kind of comfort that comes easily to others was foreign to me. I saw things—hard things—before I ever saw a birthday party with candles. I watched people fall apart and hurt each other in ways no child should ever witness. I learned quickly that silence was safer than speaking, and that pain would sometimes come disguised as love.

I made decisions that no child should have to make—survival decisions. I carried burdens that would break some adults. I was the kid who had to grow up too fast, always aware, always on guard, watching the world from behind a kind of invisible glass that separated me from softness. That shaped me. That made me careful. That made me strong—but also made me crave deeply for something real, something safe, something lasting.

That’s why I loved the way I did. That’s why I gave you the parts of me no one else had access to. Because even though I had survived so much, I still hoped. I still believed in the possibility of being chosen, cherished, seen.

You saw glimpses of my strength, but you didn’t understand the cost. You didn’t understand the quiet sacrifices I made to be better for you—the pieces of me I softened, the habits I re-examined, the fears I tried to silence. And I didn’t do those things because you asked. I did them because I wanted to show up for you in a way that maybe no one had shown up for me.

But you misread me. You thought my pain made me complicated. You mistook my need for connection as neediness. You thought my silence was cold, when it was the only way I knew how to feel safe. You thought when I pulled away, it meant I didn’t care—when it meant I cared too much and didn’t know how to stay without losing pieces of myself.

I don’t think you ever really knew what shaped me—what built this mind, this heart, and this resilience. I don’t think you ever looked long enough to ask yourself how I got to be the way I am. But I did. I had to. I’ve spent years peeling back the layers, sitting with the pain, facing the memories I couldn’t outrun. And maybe, if I can lay it all out here, piece by piece, you’ll finally see me—not the version you projected onto me, not the one you decided I must be—but the real me. The one behind the silence, the overthinking, the passion, the sadness, the love.

I grew up surrounded by emptiness—by love that was never soft, never stable, sometimes not there at all. I made adult decisions when I was still a child. I’ve seen people at their worst, at their cruelest, and at their most broken. I’ve seen pain that would swallow most people whole. I’ve had to hold myself together while the world around me fell apart. I didn’t have the luxury of a soft place to land—I had to become it.

I carried silence like armor. I learned not to ask for things because asking usually led to disappointment. I learned to anticipate needs before they were spoken, to read moods like maps, to hold space for others even when no one held space for me. That’s what built my empathy. That’s what taught me to love in the deepest way—to see beneath the surface and still choose people, still believe in them.

So when I met you, I didn’t just offer you love. I offered you safety. I offered you grace. I offered you a place to rest your chaos without fear. And I did that not because I was weak or naïve, but because I knew what it meant to have nowhere to go with your pain. I offered you the kind of love I spent my whole life aching for.

And still, somehow, I became the one who was misunderstood. Misread. Dismissed. You saw the surface—the quiet, the withdrawal, the moments I had to breathe—and you took it as indifference. You thought I didn’t care, when in reality I was carrying so much of us both. You thought I was cold, when really I was protecting myself from being swallowed by everything you refused to acknowledge.

But if you had ever truly looked, you would’ve seen someone who fought her whole life to stay soft. Someone who has given love like lifeblood, even when she wasn’t given the same in return. Someone who always tried to make things work. Someone who would have done anything—everything—for the right kind of love, the real kind, the kind that is honest and intentional.

You would’ve seen that I wasn’t quiet because I didn’t care—I was quiet because I cared too much. I was analyzing every moment, every shift in your energy, trying to understand what I did wrong or how I could make it better. My silence was never passive. It was survival. It was the voice of the little girl in me who had to learn early that speaking up often led to pain.

You never saw that child. You never saw the girl who grew up without gentle hands brushing the tears off her face. The one who had to be strong before she even knew what strength was. The one who saw too much too soon—violence, neglect, abandonment. I saw things no child should ever see. I learned that the world doesn’t hand out kindness easily. So I became the kindest person I could, hoping one day someone would see me and be that for me too.

You didn’t know the kind of choices I had to make at an age when most kids were just playing outside or being tucked into bed. I had to choose how to survive—how to keep my dignity, how to stay sane, how to not let the darkness around me dim the light inside me. And sometimes I failed. Sometimes I gave into the weight of it. But I always pulled myself back. I always found a way to fight for something better, something softer.

So when I loved you, it wasn’t casual. It wasn’t just about romance or companionship. It was sacred to me. It was rooted in all the decisions I made to be a better woman. There were things I did on my own time, in private, that you’ll never know—books I read, prayers I said, trauma I confronted—all so I could be a better partner to you. I grew in silence. I worked on myself in silence. I became someone who could love you better than you had ever been loved.

And you couldn’t even see it.

You thought I was difficult. That I was dramatic. That I needed too much. You didn’t realize I was giving everything—everything I never had growing up. Everything I would have wanted someone to give to me. You didn’t realize that when I cried, it wasn’t manipulation—it was grief. Grief for all the times I needed someone and had no one. Grief for all the ways I bent myself to be loved and still came up short.

You saw me as too emotional, maybe even intense—but never once did you ask why. Why I felt so deeply. Why I held so tightly. You interpreted my need for connection as pressure. You mistook my longing for reassurance as insecurity. But I was never trying to control you—I was trying to protect myself from losing someone I loved again without warning, without reason, without closure.

What you never realized is that I wasn’t just reacting to you. I was reacting to every time in my life I had to beg to be seen. Every moment I was made to feel invisible or too much. Every time I had to shrink or silence myself to be acceptable to someone else. And when I finally thought I could be myself with you, when I finally thought you could be safe, I started letting those wounds rise to the surface—not to blame you, but because I trusted you. Because I wanted to heal them with you.

But healing with someone requires presence, patience, and emotional responsibility. And you weren’t ready to hold the kind of love I offered.

Because my love is not ordinary.

I am not ordinary.

I am the kind of woman who would have poured into you even when my own cup was near empty. I would’ve fought for you even on the days you didn’t show up for me. I would’ve prayed for you in rooms you didn’t know I was in. I would’ve lifted you with a soft voice and hands steady with faith, even when you were too tired to believe in yourself. Not because I’m naïve, but because I understand how hard this world can be. Because I know what it feels like to walk alone in the dark. And I never wanted you to feel that.

But instead of seeing that, you took. You took and expected. You benefited from the strength I fought like hell to build, but never asked what it cost me to become this version of myself.

And that’s what hurts the most.

It’s not that you’re gone. It’s not even that you couldn’t love me the way I needed. It’s that you never tried to understand me. You never honored the depths of the woman in front of you. You never stopped to ask yourself, What has she survived to be this soft? You never noticed that I was love in human form—bruised, tender, still showing up.

I gave you the best of me.

And you’ll never know the power of what you lost.

What you’ll never understand is that every move I made—every time I tried to communicate, every time I pulled away, every time I came back, every tear I cried—it all came from love. Not weakness. Not manipulation. Not immaturity. Love.

I loved you purely. Even when I was confused. Even when I was in pain. Even when you made me feel like loving you was a burden.

And that’s the part you never saw.

Because you were so focused on protecting your pride, you couldn’t see that I was trying to protect our connection. You thought I wanted control, but I wanted closeness. You thought I was dramatic, but I was drowning. You thought I was needy, but I just wanted to be chosen the way I chose you.

You think you know me. But you don’t.

You never met the parts of me that grew up too fast. You never sat with the little girl inside me who had to raise herself, who had to be emotionally strong before she even had a full vocabulary for pain. You never asked how it felt to always be the one who loved harder, who stayed longer, who forgave more. You never even noticed that behind my softness was discipline, behind my gentleness was survival, behind my nurturing was a lifetime of learning how to carry people who didn’t know how to carry me.

I didn’t just show up in your life. I built myself into someone who could love a man completely. That wasn’t accidental. That was work. That was conscious. That was me sitting alone and deciding to heal. That was me studying communication, empathy, attachment, love languages—trying to make sure I didn’t just repeat what hurt me.

You never knew about the nights I journaled about us, trying to find the right words to reach you. Or the days I prayed that you’d find clarity, find peace, find the man you were meant to be—not just for me, but for yourself. You didn’t know how many times I bit my tongue to keep peace. How many times I chose patience over pride. You didn’t know I used to look at you while you were sleeping and whisper in my head, Please just love me right. I’m not asking for the world—just consistency.

You thought I was emotional? I am. But not in the way you reduced me to. I am emotional because I feel everything with intensity and purpose. I see people, I feel people, I carry what others avoid. That’s not weakness. That’s strength. You had a woman who would have followed you into the fire, just to help you find your way out.

But you never let me in.

You never let yourself be loved fully—not because I didn’t offer it, but because you didn’t know what to do with it. You wanted my peace, but you weren’t ready to offer any in return. You wanted access to my body, my presence, my care—but not to my needs, not to my mind, not to my truth.

You wanted to be loved like a king without ever learning how to hold a queen.

And that’s why I had to let go.

Not because I stopped loving you—but because I finally started loving myself enough to stop bleeding for someone who kept handing me the knife.

You see, nothing I did was ever about control. If you ever felt that from me, I need you to understand: I never wanted power over you. I wanted to love you. I wanted to give you safety, consistency, loyalty, presence—everything I never got, but everything I’ve always dreamed of giving. When I asked for more communication, when I wanted reassurance, or when I tried to help you see what you were missing in us—it wasn’t about domination. It was desperation—for connection, for understanding, for emotional partnership.

Because my love doesn’t come from a surface-level place. It comes from a soul that’s been battered, abandoned, manipulated, used. It comes from a girl who had to become a woman far too early. Who had to navigate betrayal before she even knew what trust was supposed to look like. Who watched people she loved become cruel. Who kept choosing to love anyway. I come from trauma—yes—but I am not my trauma. I’m the one who chose to heal in spite of it. I’m the one who chose to still be soft, still be generous, still believe in people even when they gave me every reason not to.

And I chose you. Despite your distance, despite your coldness, despite your silence, despite your walls—I still chose you. I saw something in you that you never saw in yourself. And maybe that’s what hurt the most—loving someone who never believed he was worth loving, and therefore could never really receive the kind of love I had to give.

I never asked you to be perfect. I never asked you to save me. I just wanted you to meet me—honestly, fully, gently. I wanted your presence, your effort, your heart. I would’ve stood beside you through anything if I knew you were really choosing me back. I was ready to build a life, to pour into us, to learn you, love you, support your healing while I did my own. I wanted to be a safe place for you. But you made me feel like too much, when really, I was just trying to love right.

Everything I gave came from a place of love. Every change I made, every sacrifice, every time I held back my needs just to not lose you—it wasn’t about ego. It was about love. It was always about love.

And maybe that’s the part you never fully understood—how much love can look like labor. Not in the sense of suffering for someone, but in the way a gardener tends to a field that no one else noticed. That’s what I was doing with you. Loving you felt like tending to dry earth, hoping one day you’d grow into the man I saw buried beneath it all. You were always the seed. I just wanted to be the sunlight, the water, the care.

But I think I learned something hard through loving you: no matter how pure my intentions, no matter how much patience, softness, grace I bring to someone—I cannot make them choose to bloom. I cannot make them see me clearly. I cannot make them love me back in the ways I deserve.

And yet, I still did. I still loved. I still believed. I still held on to the idea that maybe if I just stayed a little longer, tried a little harder, softened a little more—you would finally see me. The real me. Not the version you painted when you were projecting your own wounds, not the woman you misunderstood, not the one you claimed didn’t really want you. The truth is—I wanted you more than you’ll ever know. But I also wanted to be wanted. I wanted to be chosen—not when it was convenient or when you were lonely or when the silence got too loud—but truly, deliberately, consistently.

And that’s where the pain is still rooted. I grieve the fact that you never got to see me. The woman I am underneath everything. The way I love with no conditions. The way I would’ve stood by you through storms most people would’ve run from. The depth of my emotional world—how I process everything around me, how much I feel, how I see things most don’t, how I’m constantly looking deeper into people and life and pain and love.

If only you had stopped long enough to ask me who I am. Really ask. Not for the version of me you assumed, but the truth of me. If only you knew the choices I had to make at such a young age. How I built my heart from brokenness. How I carry the weight of things no one should ever have had to see. If you knew the kind of strength it takes for me to still be open, still be loving, still be tender despite everything life has done to me—you would fall to your knees with gratitude. Because people like me don’t come around often. And people like me don’t stay where we are not seen.

You lost something you didn’t even know was rare. You lost a woman who would’ve walked through fire for you. Who didn’t want to control you—only to know you. Who didn’t want to own you—only to build with you. Who didn’t want to change you—only to be your peace.

And even now, I’m not writing this to change your mind. I’m not writing it to be begged for or chased or called back home. I’m writing this for me. Because I need to say it out loud. I need to remember who I am. I need to reclaim all the parts of me I quieted just to love you gently.

I am a woman of deep soul and powerful softness. A survivor, a lover, a thinker, a feeler. I am a storm and a sanctuary. And you never took the time to know the difference.

And maybe the hardest part to admit is that I did change for you. Not in the way people warn about—losing myself—but in a quiet, intentional way. I started doing things differently, small things, private things. Ways I carried myself. The way I’d respond to conflict. The way I spoke softer when you seemed overwhelmed. The way I showed up with more patience, more understanding, even when I wasn’t getting it in return. And not because you asked—but because I wanted to grow into the kind of woman I thought could build something sacred with you.

I didn’t want to control you. I wanted to protect what we were building.

I know now how you may have misunderstood that. Maybe you thought I was trying to shape you, mold you, direct your life. But that was never it. I just wanted a place for love to live safely. I saw your pain. I saw your silence. I saw your defense mechanisms. And instead of judging them, I tried to work around them. I loved you around your walls, hoping one day you’d let me inside.

But that day never came.

And still, I never stopped showing up. Even in the moments you’d withdraw or make me feel invisible, even when you twisted my intentions or misread my heart—I stayed. I stayed when I should’ve left. I listened when I should’ve screamed. I tried to understand you when you never once paused to understand me.

Because I am built that way. I’m made of something different. I carry a kind of depth that makes people uncomfortable if they aren’t ready for it. And I used to think that made me “too much.” But now I see it as my power. I see it as my gift.

You couldn’t hold it. You didn’t know how. And it’s not even your fault. You weren’t ready for love that doesn’t quit. For love that asks you to heal, not just receive. For love that sees you all the way through—not just the polished pieces.

But I was ready. And I gave it. I gave what most people keep hidden out of fear. I gave my truth, my softness, my loyalty, my mind, my time, my body, my laughter, my tears—all of it. I was yours without ever fully being claimed. And that’s a heartbreak I’ll be unpacking for a long time.

Still, if you ever wonder who I was… who I am—let this letter be your answer.

I am the woman you couldn’t see clearly because you were looking through the lens of your own fear. I am the woman you’ll remember when the noise quiets, when the world stops spinning, and you start realizing that most love doesn’t hold the weight mine did.

And I am the woman who is finally learning to give herself everything she once begged you to see.

Maybe the most misunderstood thing about me is how devoted I am to love.

It’s not just something I want. It’s something I believe in. Something I honor. It’s my compass. My anchor. My truth.

And no, it’s not a fantasy I built from fairy tales or romance movies. It’s a sacred thing I built out of absence. You see, when you grow up without love—without consistency, without safety, without someone choosing you on purpose—you either shut down completely, or you become even more open. You go searching. You decide that what hurt you will not be what defines you.

That’s what I did. I made love my mission. My rebellion. My redemption.

I told myself that no matter what the world tried to convince me—that I was unlovable, too sensitive, too complicated—I would still show up with a full heart. I would still believe. Still risk. Still try. Because I knew how rare love is when it’s real. And I knew that if I ever found it, I would give it everything.

That’s who I am. That’s the why behind my loyalty, my softness, my patience, my longing. I love with a kind of devotion that isn’t common. Not because I don’t value myself—but because I do. Because I know what I carry. Because when I love someone, I pour the most healed parts of myself into them.

But the thing no one tells you is… not everyone wants that kind of love.

Some people think they do, but when it shows up—consistent, honest, open-hearted—they flinch. They sabotage. They question it. Because they haven’t healed enough to receive it. Because they’re still measuring love in power, not presence. They think love means control or sacrifice or ego. But the way I love? It asks for truth. It asks for reciprocity. It asks for courage.

And not everyone has that.

So I get called too much. Too emotional. Too intense. Or worse—I get misunderstood entirely. Like I have a hidden agenda. Like there’s something I want that I’m manipulating to get. When really, all I ever wanted… was to be loved the way I love.

And with you—God, with you—I thought maybe I’d finally found it.

I thought maybe you’d see me. Really see me. Not just the things I do, or how I show up. But the why behind it. The little girl in me who learned to be everything for everyone, just to feel a little bit chosen. The woman I’ve become who carries that same tenderness—but now with boundaries and wisdom and clarity.

I loved you in ways that asked for nothing and everything at the same time. Nothing… because I never demanded what you couldn’t give. Everything… because I gave all of me hoping you’d want to do the same.

And I think that scared you. Maybe even annoyed you. Maybe it made you feel small or cornered or exposed. I don’t know. I’ll never know.

But what I do know is this: you never stopped to understand me.

You took my softness as manipulation. You took my questions as control. You took my need for clarity as pressure. You took my love and held it like it was something disposable. You never sat down to ask: why does she care this much? What has she lived through that made her this way? What has she survived?

If you had asked… you would’ve found a story inside me that would break your heart. You would’ve seen the scars under my silence. The decisions I had to make at an age when I should’ve been worrying about nothing but cartoons and schoolbooks. You would’ve seen the woman I’ve had to raise myself into.

And you would’ve realized: I didn’t love you because I was needy. I loved you because I was ready. Because I had spent years doing the inner work, preparing myself to be a safe place for someone. And I chose you, hoping you’d see that.

Hoping you’d match it. Mirror it. Honor it.

But you couldn’t.

And I know that now.

But still… I want you to know who I am. I want you to know what you lost. Not out of revenge. Not because I want you to suffer. But because I want the truth to finally speak louder than the lies, the confusion, the silence between us.

So here it is:

I am not too much. I am exactly enough. I am a woman who learned to love through pain, who turned her ache into offering. I am not naïve. I am not weak. I am not dramatic. I am a force. I am softness with a spine. I am the kind of person who doesn’t just hold your hand—I hold your history, if you let me.

 I hold your fears without judgment. I hold space for your healing without rushing you. I see the parts of you you’re still afraid to face, and I love you there too. I listen between the silences. I love between the cracks. I don’t love halfway. I don’t just love who you show the world—I love the version of you that cries in the dark, the one who’s never felt fully safe. The one who pushes love away because they never knew it could stay.

I am the kind of person who learns you. Softly, fully, deeply. I memorize the way your voice sounds when it’s breaking, not because I’m trying to fix you—but because I want you to know you don’t have to break alone. I give love like it’s oxygen, like it’s sacred, because to me, it is. And if you’d let me… I would’ve stayed. Not just in the good moments, not just when it was easy—but when it was hardest to choose love. Because that’s who I am. That’s what I was built for. I wasn’t too much. You just didn’t know what to do with all of me.

I loved you with more than most people will ever have to give. And if that made you uncomfortable, if that made you run, if that made you misunderstand me—then that says everything about your readiness, and nothing about my worth.

I won’t apologize for my love anymore. I won’t shrink for someone who couldn’t expand with me.

And when real love finds me—because it will—it’ll feel like breathing. Because the one who deserves me will recognize me.

And they’ll stay.

393,"*TL;DR - My brother hid his gambling problem and his relationship problems with his (now ex) girlfriend from me, and I'm sort of mourning the close relationship I thought I had with him. But I also don't want to sound selfish because he has bigger problems right now.*

I've always been close with my brother (or so I thought). I have 2 older sisters and 1 brother. Everyone always mistakes him for my twin. We were born in the same calendar year only 10 months apart. We were in the same grade at school when we were kids and we look so alike so people always think we are twins. He was the best man at my wedding. I always told my brother everything and I assumed it was the same for him. Maybe I'm just an idiot. He's always been a person I was close to but maybe I was wrong.

I'm in the armed forces and my wife and I just went back to my hometown for a visit. I do sometimes miss my family because I have never been stationed in my home province and getting back for a visit is always nice. During my visit my parents wanted to take everyone out for a family dinner for me. A couple of days before the dinner my brother asked if I would have any objection to him proposing to his girlfriend because the dinner was for me since I was visiting and he didn't want to steal my attention. I honestly didn't care about that at all. I was happy for my brother and I've never had any problems with his girlfriend. 

His girlfriend said no to the proposal and everyone in my family was shocked. But she told us that her and my brother were having relationship problems. My brother has been having issues with sports betting according to her. She didn't say anything to anyone because she wanted to keep it private but she was so angry that my brother proposed when the relationship was in her words ""hanging by a thread"". She said it's at the point where it's not even about who wins games but whether specific players or athletes score or don't score and my brother gets major anger issues when he doesn't win whatever he bet on. I understand why she told us. My brother proposed in front of our family and strangers knowing the relationship was barely hanging on. A few days before the disaster dinner his girlfriend had given him an ultimatum that either he get professional help or she was done. My brother told us after the dinner disaster he hought since he agreed to see a therapist that everything was fine. He had not even made an appointment yet or been to a support group meeting so I completely get why his girlfriend was mad and why she went home early. Apparently the relationship is over for good now.

My brother never told me he was having gambling issues or relationship problems. Whenever we talk he always says and acts like everything is fine. Even now he's acting like everything is fine and that he doesn't understand why his now ex-girlfriend was so mad. I understand that he is probably in denial about his gambling problem or maybe he is ashamed. My parents, my sisters and some of my other relatives say my brother asked for money from them and lied about why. Saying stuff like the rent increased or his hours at work got cut. Now they know none of it was true and he was likely using the money for gambling. He had asked them not to say anything to his now ex-girlfriend because they were both embarrassed by it but really it was just because he was hiding the extra money from her to gamble.

My parents and sisters and other relatives want to have an intervention for my brother. I have already said I will do everything in my power to make it back home for that. I do feel upset that my brother hid so much from me but I don't want to say anything because he's got bigger problems right now and I don't want to make things all about me. That's what I wanted to get out here. My wife is great, she has been really supportive, she's the only one who knows how I really feel but I don't just want to dump everything on her all the time. I guess I'm just mourning the relationship I thought me and my brother had.",
394,"Slight content warning: Small breach of sexual consent through text, but not too severe. Another one for inappropriate behavior while being nude.

I'm a 22 year old woman, got into my career at the same time as let's call her Danny (F21). We got together as a group of four girls and became inseparable. On the second year of our career I started to develop feelings for Danny, but she was taken. 

I couldn't do anything about my feelings but hide them, and I was fine with that. Another one of my friends introduced us to her best friend, Gabriel. He wasn't too out of the ordinary, we slowly warmed up to him. Eventually, Gabriel and I became close too, and one night we had one of those ""spur of the moments"" flirting through texts. I did start to like him, and he confessed to have found me attractive too. 

We texted each other the next couple of days, and we started to flirt even more intense than before. But the thing is, he came too strong for me, saying he wanted to masturbate me and wanted to do other things, and I eventually wanted to stop. He didn't stop texting saying I should ""go with the flow"". I eventually had to put my foot down and call him out for how creepy he was being, and that I told him to stop. He apologized, and that was the end of it.

A lot of things happened between him and other friends, the most severe one was that he got into a nudity group in a chat, and he tried to coax his best friend to get in bed with her (literally, not as an innuendo), he was naked, and tried to pull her towards him. She confided that with me and my other friends, and we all became very distant with him. I even confessed to what happened between me and him on the texts.

Months passed, and he was really remorseful, tried to do everything to get her to apologize. And she eventually did, said that we shouldn't have became distant from him and we can go back to being friends. 

I did not. I was not really hostile or anything, I just didn't text him like I normally did before. 

Back to Danny, she broke up with her boyfriend after realizing he was treating her like trash, she got over him a year or so later. She took time to herself, and I respected that. I was not going to make a move on her when she was emotionally vulnerable. 

But funny thing is, after that time, I realized that I got over my feelings for her, and I really just wanted to see her happy with the one she would love later. I got over my initial aversion to Gabriel and talked with him too, occasionally. But then on December, Gabriel and Danny got really close too, Danny told me she was talking more and more with him, and recently he took her out in a date. He confessed to her and he was a ""gentleman"" as she put it. I didn't doubt that, because I saw how much Gabriel changed. Still, I wasn't sure if Gabriel wasn't going to hurt her or something, even unintentionally. But I figured it wasn't my place. 

Last Friday they made it official, we were hanging out, the four of us girls and him. He brought her a bouquet of flowers and they talked one on one, then throughout the hangout and sleepover, we all saw Gabriel give Danny kisses, first it was just shy cheek ones, but it progressed into full lip ones. That's how we knew. 

Part of me is almost grieving because I used to like her, another part of me is simply happy for her. Gabriel seemed to have made a 180, now treating her like a queen (from the little glimpses I've seen of the relationship), complimenting her, supporting her, today they also had a date and I felt myself just happy for her. If she's happy, I'm happy. 

PS: Gabriel and I have a weird vibe now. But that is only natural, given our history. We still try to talk normally during hangouts.",

I’m not sure exactly what is wrong with me, but I only noticed it because it has gotten so bad I have stopped a lot of activities. It has affected my mental health and even physical one. It started with small rules, but now it completely dominates my day to day schedule.

It started when I was young, my mom dealt with a lot of depression so my bedroom became messy (we shared) and when I was in elementary school I started cleaning my bedroom every Friday up till it was spotless so my bedroom would stay spotless during weekends. The feeling of cleanliness made me stupidly happy, so I feel like cleanliness started being associated with how my mental is since then. 

After that it became a rule that only when things are clean, I am allowed to enjoy things. That was the first rule I created for myself. If my apartment wasn’t clean, then I couldn’t enjoy myself. From then on things for intense, specially the more stressed I got. Right now life has gotten really troublesome and the rules got intense, that’s when I noticed my own behavior and how weird it was.

Here are some rules I created for myself-

- If my apartment isn’t clean, I can’t work, play games, or shower (This is because when you get dirty when cleaning, so I didn’t like showering to get dirty again after cleaning) Double showering is not a choice because then my hair and skin will be unhappy. This though would end up in me doing absolutely nothing when I’m depressed and low in energy, because my brain does not allow me to do anything unless where I am is spotless.

- I cannot eat after specific times, which has ended up in me eating once or twice per day. 

- I cannot eat unless my chores/calls to friends or family are settled and I have nothing else to do. Which paired with the previous rule, has resulted in me barely getting any food in my system.

- I cannot go to sleep before 11PM as that would end up with me missing out on free time, which ended up in my sleep schedule to be completely messed up.

- I cannot wear new clothes or wear cute clothes unless my apartment is clean, or unless I’m showered. Which has resulted in me only wearing the same clothing for 2 years. 

- If I’m on a routine call with friends, I cannot hang up first because that may upset my friends (even though they really don’t care) which has resulted in me eating very late, and thus going back to the first rules.

- If I don’t have at least 2 hours to enjoy myself, then I won’t do my second job (which is more of a contractor job) and has resulted in me being very behind in work and severely stunned it. 

- I can’t finish video games unless I’m content with life, and that obviously has been really bad so I have a lot of unfinished games. I literally will start a new file. I have restarted Skyrim about 10 times now, play the whole game (about 120 hours) and stop when I’m about to finish main quest.


These are some of the ones that may seem small, but control my day to day life. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I don’t know what to do. I try to break my own rules but my brain always goes back to it. It wasn’t as bad until recently where I’m so controlled by my own rules that I end up doing nothing productive in my day. 

Anyone has any tips on this that has gone thru something similar? I’m feeling miserable.

396,"I got groomed cause it's embarrassing, but when I was on discord I met this guy who I will call Mo right we talked i introduced him to my best friend who I will call Bu then we had a little group server for each other, we would hang out do all sorts of stuff. Then Mo and Bu got really close they started bullying me causing me to get depressed but then things kinda slowed down and then Mo decides to show me and my best friend porn and jerked off I felt uncomfortable and I could tell Bu did too and then Mo started pressuring us into doing it and encourging it going into detail. Everything after that is sorta fine and then me and Bu get in a fight then fought with Mo. I then realised what Mo had done to me and stopped being friends with him. A year passes and I for some reason become friends with him again I then introduce him to my new best friend who we will call Exo. He starts to develop a weird friendship with Exo and Exo starts to hate me I then became really depressed until they had a fight and he stopped bullying me, me and exo were pretty close after that until Exo told me if it was ok if he could get Mo to become friends with him again. I agreed cause I saw it was harmless then same thing happened and I got fed up me and Exo fought then we blocked each other and I know him in real life and i'm afraid he's spreading the secret stuff that I told him and like the stuff that Mo probably told him.

397,"I’m going to be pretty vague and alter some of  the details. I Just don’t want anyone figuring out who I am or who my post is about, I’d be mortified if this got back to his mom. Honestly I’m just struggling with the info she shared and don’t really have anyone to talk about it with. I love her dearly, she’s undoubtedly devastated by this whole thing, I don’t want to cause her harm by my own emotions and thoughts. I couldn’t even begin to understand or describe how awful this has been for her. 

For some context, I’m an amateur writer and I’ve written several pieces regarding him over the last two years, just sharing stories and my grief and she has always asked me to share them with her and encouraged me to share them publicly. He was truly a wonderful person and I never expected to live in a world with out him. This loss has been devastating for me, and writing has always been my way of coping. His mom recently shared that she had been writing about his death per her therapist’s recommendation. 

He died almost two years ago, we’re actually approaching the second anniversary of his death. Which is likely why her therapist recommended she write about it to help her process. He was struck by a reckless driver while on the side of the road. His funeral was closed casket for obvious reasons. She was one of the first people on the scene, thankfully she wasn’t able to get to him as others had intervened, but she saw more than she ever should have. 

She sent me the piece she wrote and I read it, to say I wasn’t prepared for the graphic details is an understatement. 

He was so beautiful, and strong. I thought he was invincible since we were kids. I’m not naive enough to believe he could have withstood the impact of a car hitting him, but ever since I heard the news I had just always imagined him laying flat out. 

The way she described his body after he was hit, is a mental image I wish I couldn’t have conjured and wish I could forget. I think consciously I knew that it couldn’t have been pretty but I never would have imagined him in the way that she described him. 

I miss him terribly and I hate that he died the way that he did. Knowing it really was so horrific just makes my heart break so much more. ",

I’ve struggled really badly since becoming a mom - I did also struggle some as a kid, but differently than how I do now. Some days I’m even keeled, others I feel worthless or can’t function. My kiddo has major behaviors that therapy sort of helped with but still working on it. Some days I’m so overwhelmed I just mentally check out. It kills me but it’s like my brain just shuts down completely. A year after my kiddo was diagnosed, and I finally decided to bite the bullet and get a psych eval to help me be better.

Today I was diagnosed with moderate-severe inattentive ADHD. It partially feels like a relief because I was right about something being wrong. But I also feel numb? I went to tell some of my close family members and they just rolled their eyes. My friends are supportive thankfully but idk. Maybe this isn’t the breakthrough I think it is? I just feel like I’ll always feel this damaged and alone. I did this to get the help I need so I can be a better parent to my child, but now it feels like maybe I made a mistake? Like my close family just seems annoyed with me for even looking into it, like it’s another thing for them to deal with since they do assist with my daughter’s care.

401,"Whoever let their grandpa out yesterday afternoon without taking his meds, yall need to get this man help. 😂😭

Yesterday afternoon I wanted to get some alone time out of the house without my wackadoo toddler and I went to Kroger on county line at around 4:30 yesterday for what I THOUGHT was going to be a relaxing shopping trip. I was QUICKLY reminded of the anger some people have inside for unnecessary reasons. I was looking for a parking spot and saw a first row spot was open. As I swung wide and started to reverse to park. This old white man pulled around me and blocked me from parking. I waited because I thought he must be trying to park in the handicap  spot next to me. So I rolled down my window and said “sir are you trying to pull into this handicap spot?” He said “you ain’t fixing to park there” I said “no you’re right I’m going to park in this spot I’m in right here” he said “you saw me coming from back there you knew I was gonna park there” I kindly let him know that’s not how parking lots work and I was going to be using this spot. He told me I was going to hit his truck if I tried to back up and I said I wasn’t going to hit his truck but I wasn’t moving. I rolled up my window and called my fiancé in disbelief this was happening. While I’m on the phone he started to back up and I rolled down my window he said “I’m gonna let you have this spot, but when you come out and your tires are slashed you will know why” I said “yea okay” and smiled because truly I was just uncomfortable that this was happening to begin with. I rolled my window back up and watched him pull in the row behind me exactly behind my car. I waited for him to get out, as I’m a female by myself and this is a grown ass grandpa who just threatened to slash my tires over a PARKING SPOT. He wouldn’t get out of his truck to go inside and I got a weird feeling so I left the store and drove myself right back home. Because one thing is IT WAS NEVER THAT SERIOUS TO BEGIN WITH I was just trying to get out of the house and instead was reminded why I don’t leave 😩🥲 get your grandpa please!  And men. Don’t threaten someone over a parking spot. A PARKING SPOT. The world is scary enough. Also I did take pictures of his plates but I didn’t want to be the person who just pulled out my phone to record this interaction for some social media. But I was really just too stunned 😳 ",
402,"Title might be confusing but I’m posting this on a whim and a lot might not make total sense. Don’t know what else to do with these thoughts so hence the tag, is why I’m here. 

Had a small friend group a bit ago and were super close, we’d do basically everything together every weekend from game nights to bar hopping to going to local events and all around having a good time. Due to moving different states, we don’t get to do that anymore, not that I would especially want to now and I’ll explain why: 

One person in particular I’ve cut off all contact with, for the simple reason that they confessed their feelings for me multiple times even when I rejected them. 

The first time they confessed, I was polite about it and turned them down as I was going through a grief-filled part of my life and thus wasn’t focused on anything remotely romantic. They were mature about it as well, as we were able to be civil to one another, or so I thought, when I became friends with our coworker who they also happened to be very close to who I’ll call Sally (we’re all in the same field). Sally also had a cousin that moved in with her and because I had relatively no other access to others my age they accepted me with open arms and we meshed quite well. 

Well, that was until the second confession from ex-friend. I admit, I probably should have distanced myself from the group altogether or at least just this person. As it wasn’t even a few months knowing them that they decided to tell me their feelings again. This would happen two more times before I finally put my foot down that the only time they would see me is in group settings, as he would only pull this when we were alone. It worked, and there were no major hiccups in the group until ex-friend started confessing to Sally’s cousin. 

Similar to me, she rejected him and had to do so multiple times for him to come even close to getting a hint. And even the, would still ask Sally’s cousin to reconsider when they had too much to drink (which would be often enough). Eventually they would end up confessing their feelings to Sally herself, which we all thought was more than strange as they always said they had a sibling-like relationship. 

Despite all this, Sally remains this person’s friend. And I don’t exactly know how to feel about it. They were friends first, sure, but if I was in Sally’s spot I don’t see myself choosing to be associated with someone who would constantly cross a friend’s boundaries and make them uncomfortable with their unwanted advances, including a cousin who is basically like a sister. I don't like using the term 'toxic' often as I feel like it's overused imo, but this person caused a LOT of easily avoidable drama, such as blowing up over Sally just because she liked a friend of ex-friend’s instead of them and nearly ending their friendship over it. 

If you managed to read this far, thank you for sticking with this word vomit and minor existential crisis lol. I probably won’t bring it up with Sally anytime soon as it’s her life and not mine, and honestly feels like a can of worms I shouldn’t be the one opening.  I like to think in the future, she’ll wake up and realize how bad this person is for her psyche, time, energy, and loved ones because I sure as hell couldn’t deal with it anymore. Which is only a fraction of how much time they hung out together

403,"TLDR: people only interested in me after I lost weight and feel like I've been lied to

Long post warning


I have always been a well liked person. Making friends is something never I've had an issue with and I've been described as very charismatic and have a large social circle and a close friend group that I get to go out with and socialize weekly.

Despite this dating has always been something I never found much success with. I have plenty of hobbies, passions and a career that while some consider boring I genuinely enjoy. If I was at a bar or social event and was talking to a woman that I really felt like we had hit it off I would sometimes ask for their number or if they would want to get coffee or dinner sometime and the response was always a very polite no or that they appreciated me being respectful but they weren't looking for a relationship. I never let my love life dominate my mind or affect how I see myself and always felt like that I just hadn't met the right person but I have always wanted to start a family and consider my life to be secure enough and at a point that I would like to share it with someone.

A few years ago I decided to create a profile on a couple dating apps to try and go on dates and potentially meet someone. My girl friends helped me set up the profile by telling me what photos look good of me doing some hobbies I have and a short bio that they think shows my positive outlook and compared to the low quality shirtless bathroom selfies they showed me that flooded the mens profiles on tinder I was really happy with how much effort I had put in and was really excited to see how it would go. A couple months went by and I had no matches outside of a few bot accounts or people who would after a couple messages would ask if I was wanting to join their private Snapchat or OF (I have nothing against sw just not what I'm looking for in a dating app). Nevertheless I didn't pay it much mind and didn't let the app determine my self worth or dominate my time and kept going about my life.

Two years ago I went to the gym with my friend because his usual workout partner was taking care of his girlfriend who had gotten sick and he wanted someone to spot him and I was available and wanted to hang out. I should probably point out that I've always been a little heavier than my peers all throughout my life this has never bothered me since my health has always been fine as per my doctor and some people are just a little larger than others and I still kept a very active lifestyle with my hobbies like hiking and Wrestling which I still coach. Well I found out that I had so much fun lifting weights that I fell in love with it and made time to keep progressing in the weight room.

Over that year I had lost about 40 pounds with the largest change in my looks being the doughy look around my stomach and gave me very visible abs which while nice I had never considered my physique to be a priority and was just more happy with how much it had helped me in my other active hobbies. 

During that time my friends and me went to our annual beach trip and took a bunch of photos together and I posted some on my social media. The comments were flooded with people I had known my whole life would only point out how much better I looked and congratulated me on my ""glow up"" which I knew came from a good place I never understood why it mattered so much.

At the same time I had updated my tinder profile with new photos which my friends had told me to do every year so I had updated with new photos my dating profile exploded in likes with new matches from people that I had previously liked and did not match with. Plenty of profiles that had matching interests that now were messaging me and asking me if I was interested in going out on a date and other people who had clearly ignored my profile and just liked me based on my photos and wanted to know if they could come to my place which I wasn't a huge fan of.

 Went on a lot of first dates during this time and I picked up very quickly that the people I was seeing didn't care about my career or interests and while I tried my best to make an effort and make the date fun for the both of us I would always feel a little worse at the end. The worst being a girl I had decided to grab coffee with openly said her friends weren't gonna believe her when I wasn't a catfish and asked if I was wanted to go back to her place or mine I politely declined and said I just wanted to do this date and go from there if  we both thought it went well and her comment to me was ""Oh bigger girls like me usually don't get a chance to sleep with jacked guys"" which I didn't make a scene about but I had mentally checked out of the date and when I left unmatched with her and deleted all of my dating apps.

These same social outings that I've always gone to I'm now approached by people who want my number or Snapchat even people I had met previously and had told me they weren't looking for a relationship. but when I tried expressing my confusion my guy friends would comment ""who cares dude"" and when I asked my girl friends why so many people are only now romantically interested in me I would hear. ""Girls can smell a Confidence and happiness from a mile away"" which is ironic since this is the worst I've ever felt about myself my entire life. During one of these nights I realized my friends who you would consider conventionally attractive during the decade plus I've known some of them I have never seen them date someone who looked like how I did.

I've always dressed well, taken care of my hygiene and been my best to be a kind outgoing person and now that I'm reserved insecure and paranoid about anyone actually liking me for my personality I have had more success romantically than any other point in my life. With some of my friends girlfriends even calling me telling me about their friends who want to find a good guy and asking if I wanted to do a blind date despite them never asking me before. 

I feel like everything I've been told about what is actually important in being what people found attractive seems to be completely unimportant outside of just being conventionally attractive and what actually makes me a person seeming to be secondary.",

406,"I have never made a post on here but I need to get some things off my chest…

I (25f) have been with my boyfriend (25m) for almost 8 years now. Back when we first moved in together, we were both 18. At the time, we both lived very wild lives together and did things that I regret to this day. 

We would have sex and do lots and lots of cocaine: I know…nasty…but that’s what we did. Almost every night for hours until he needed to go into work. After we moved in with a close family friend, I had noticed that he would be in the bathroom for HOURS. What’s crazy is…I knew what he was doing but at the same time, doubted myself. We then moved into my mom’s house, that’s when shit got ugly. I finally got evidence of what he was doing. I want to add that I was no longer doing coke at all. It was over for me and it served me no purpose and I learned that it actually was not fun and made me feel like shit. So, I stopped. But, I know it’s not always that easy 
For some people.

One night while laying down in bed, he got up and went to the bathroom. He was on there for a while and something told me to just…look around. I found an almost empty cocaine baggy behind my jewelry box. I then stormed upstairs, banged on the door and demanded him to let me in. All while being under my mom’s roof. It was about 1:00 in the morning when he came out. I cried, and told him what I knew. He apologized. But, little did I know, this was would be the beginning of a very depressing phase in our relationship. This continued to happen. Even after I got pregnant with our daughter in 2021. Constantly in the bathroom watching porn until he decided to be done for the night. 

Fast forward we move into his mother’s house for a while. I had our daughter a week after and I thought that this was it. It wasn’t… the shit still happened. I left for a few months to clear my head and when I thought enough time had passed, I came back. Then I caught him again, now downstairs in front of his monitor. Eyes big, breathing fast and could see his pulse in his neck. A few times of me finding him like that, made me leave again. But, I returned a few moths after.

I grew up with my sister being a drug addict from 15 years old until 36 when she unfortunately lost her life to an overdose. I know what drugs can do. So I tried and tried to figure out what I could do to help him but nothing was enough. I want to make it clear that even though he was doing the things that he was doing, he still loved me a lot. He loved our daughter a lot. He showed that every single day. It was the fact that he couldn’t give up the cocaine and porn combo. It destroyed us. It made him into somebody I didn’t even recognize. I got my first job after having my daughter and tried to make things a little easier for him since he was the only one providing for us. I shaped up after he had told me that he was stressed out. I got my job, got my license and got my first car. But things got worse.

He would come home after work totally wasted. Sometimes I would find him in the bathroom with throw up all over. I would clean him up, bring him upstairs and make sure he was okay. This kept on happening. If it wasn’t alcohol, it was cocaine and porn. He wouldn’t come home some nights after work. I would drive around with our daughter in the back and look for his car. It would be so late at night. I couldn’t even keep my eyes open but I just wanted to make sure he was okay. Make sure he wasn’t in a ditch somewhere. But other nights he wouldn’t come home at all. His loud car would wake me up at 6:00 am and he wouldn’t be able to talk. He was so out of his mind from doing so much coke all night. I would be on my way out for work and he wouldn’t even get out of the car to say goodbye to our daughter. Stuck in his car. Our daughter pounding on the window to give him a hug and a kiss before we left. But he couldn’t move. I cried and told our daughter to get in the car. And left him with his thoughts.

I’m not sure what it was, but he slowly got better. I was so damaged that I thought it was all bullshit. But he shaped up and we were finally doing a little better. Soon after I went through his phone and saw messages between him and a girl that he worked with. Calling her “baby” and talking about when would be the next time they would fuck. Also, witnessing multiple videos he took of them having sex. flipped out, cussed him out and wanted to know why? Why the hell I wasn’t enough for him? Why was I the one getting punished? He got on his knees and pleaded for me to just listen. I needed to go to work but I told him the we would talk when I got out.

I want to add, that when he was going through that phase, I had disconnected. I would start going out with my friends more. I got guys numbers. I would even would dance with guys sometimes at the club. I wasn’t proud of it, but I figured if he got to do what he wanted to do and didn’t care about hurting me, I should be able to do the same, right? He found a video that my friend had taken of me when we were having one fun night at the club. He saw me dancing on another guy he flipped out. I think that’s what triggered him to talk to another girl….but to have sex with her…now that’s wild.

Anyways, I got home from work, we talked and 
 That was that. I didn’t  forgive him but life carried on. I was sad, empty and alone all while taking care of my daughter. Months passed and we were still very distant. He shaped up. He proved to me that he wanted our family. He wanted to live happy with us. I could tell, he was trying for me. But of course addiction is a bitch and I caught him a couple more times downstairs in front of his computer doing whatever the fuck. 
 
I want to add that I would literally know when he would be craving it and when he would do it. I could just sense it. I know it sounds crazy. But, all it took was to look in his eyes and I knew. And every time he would fess up. It would always take some effort but eventually he would confess. Living with somebody for 7+ years, you’ll know them almost as much as you know yourself.

It’s been a few months now, he has a fantastic mindset and is again showing how much he cares and how he wants his family. He used to not talk about his feelings but, after everything, he is definitely more open and willing to tell me more and more everyday. I’m happy but worried. I still have my guard up but I’m not sure when to let it down. I dealt with my sister being clean for years and relapsing. Every time I believed that she wanted to get clean. She meant it. I saw the same look in her eyes as I do him when he tells me. I know it’s hard for him. I’ve thought about moving out for a bit to just give me time. I worry that would make things worse. I am happy as I right this. And there are times that I think of the things that happened in the past but I don’t let it ruin my mood. I let it come in my brain and leave when it wants. I don’t dwell on the past.

I want to add that I am scared that he will relapse again because he has many demons from his past and mental illness runs on both sides. His father is schizophrenic and his mother has bipolar depression.

I’m not sure if I want advice or if I just needed to get this off my chest. I just want to believe that this is it. I love my family and my daughter loves her papa so much. I see how much she’s helped him in his journey. He treats her with so much love. I feel that it’s healing him to raise her to be better than he was raised. 

Anyways, thank you for reading. I apologize if things are scrambled. I’m typing out years and years of trauma and trying to pick through my brain.

I’m not saying mental health doesn’t matter. Obviously it does. But let’s be real, most of the people who constantly preach “check on your friends” or “mental health awareness!” will ghost you the moment you show signs of struggling.

They’ll repost tired and microwaved memes and wear the little ribbon, but if someone around them is depressed, anxious, or just not fun to be around? Suddenly it’s “I need to protect my energy” or “That’s too much negativity for me.”

It’s like people only care about mental health when it’s trending or fits neatly into a TikTok caption. The second it gets messy or inconvenient, they’re out.",
408,"When I was a teenager, I felt deeply uncomfortable with my appearance. I wasn’t skinny, and my nose was too big. I was longing for a beautiful body, something that would make me feel like a **qualified woman**.

In adulthood, I had double eyelid surgery, and I learned how to be sexier, clumsily, almost dumbly, at first. I didn’t know what I was doing. But I began to notice: I could get something from it. From a glance, a lean-in, or an elongated question, I felt empowered. Yet what I really felt is **power**.

Now, as I grow older, almost coming of age as a professional, I find myself somehow lost. On the surface, I am successful. But deep down, I feel that part of my identity has been built around being attractive. That doesn’t mean I’m not hardworking. But a voice inside me whispers: “you have taken advantage of me for too long.” So now, as a woman who has achieved a lot… what should I do? Should I abandon the part of me that knows how to be sexy, or just keep using it as a weapon I never fully meant to carry?",

It is what it says in the title... my boyfriend keeps an ever-updating list on his notes app of everything I've done wrong. A few examples?

•I left my pyjamas on the bathroom floor 
•I left my shoes out
•I told my family that he reversed into something 

Not asking for advice, just needed to tell someone 

Small update: Thank you for all your concerned comments, I really do appreciate it. I asked him why he has it and if he would delete it. It obviously all blew up. He blamed it on his poor memory (previous🍃 smoker) and said he wanted to be able to remember what I need to work on (I do ask him this question because, like I said in one of my replies, we're only human and no one is perfect, I don't want to live idly, I want to be the best version of myself) Having said that, that's no excuse.

The flight is extremely expensive for my family being about $2000 and my dad can't afford it so he had to take some money out of my college funds and my account. I'm thinking about not going so it won't cost as much. I don't want to ask my uncle for money since there not going but I also don't want to not go since it's a special moment.

 What should I do? I feel guilty if I go since it's going to cost more",

I wasn't really sure what to title this but I just need to get this out there more than anything. 

Finals week just ended and it's coming up on summer which means I'm one step closer to achieving my degree. 

All through the last month or so I've been consistently stressed, depressed, and feeling a tightness in my chest that won't let me relax. no matter how many deep breaths I take, no matter how much I reflect on how well I'm doing with school and on a professional level with my internship that's lead to a job offer within the next year if all goes well with school I can't help but feel that this accomplishment doesn't matter, and I guess it really doesn't since it hasn't amounted to anything yet. I just feel like I'm still drowning when I should be relaxing while i have free time this week before the summer semester starts up and I'm back to the grind. 

I can't focus on anything I enjoy doing my mind wanders constantly. Every accomplishment I've achieved thus far working toward my degree I thought would bring me at least a little bit of relief knowing that There's light at the end of the tunnel. 
But it's always met with a very brief feeling of reprieve followed by my desire to achieve the next goal as soon as possible like I'm trying to beat the world record speed run of super Mario 64 and then beat it again because the first time wasn't good enough.

I like to read a lot and today I've been really struggling to focus with it and a quote that really resonated with me from a book I recently finished is this:

""Thinking is not always comforting. It is always good, but not always comforting."" - From Robin Hobbs's ""Royal Assassin""

That quote is kind of where I've been at the last few months. I reflect a lot on my own thoughts, the things I say and do, my personality traits, and my life goals and the direction I'd like for my life to go to better understand myself and to grow as a person.

I'm not really sure where I'm going with this anymore I'm just kind of rambling so if you've read this far, know I truly appreciate it. 
I just needed to throw this out there somewhere.

414,"I’m gonna be real debating on Reddit has gotten mentally exhausting. Not because I’m afraid to be wrong, but because I genuinely want to be challenged in good faith. I came here hoping for thoughtful, honest exchanges where people care more about the truth than defending their pride. Instead, I keep running into walls of projection, deflection, and condescension.

It’s draining watching people ignore the actual argument and hyper-focus on some micro-point just to avoid engaging the substance. It’s frustrating to see people act smug while refusing to clarify their own claims or dodge questions that strike at the core. Half the time I’m left wondering, “Am I being unfair? Am I missing something?” because I don’t want to become the kind of person I’m arguing with.

And I’m not claiming to always be right far from it. I’m more than happy to admit when I’m wrong, especially here, where nobody even knows who I am. There’s no ego for me in being corrected. But what’s soul-crushing is realizing that for a lot of people, this isn’t about truth. It’s about defending an identity, a belief, or a worldview at all costs even if it means being dishonest or evasive.

I don’t mind being wrong. I mind when the conversation stops being about learning and starts being about ego or identity preservation.",

Hi there. I'm a co-director, co-writer, script-proof reader, bug tester, ⅔ of a creative team and the entire advertising and marketing team of a 4-person indie company that specializes in video games and artwork. We recently entered RPGMaker GamerJam after our first game sold 90 copies in its first three weeks back when we were a 3-person team, noting mostly positive reviews for its originality (including custom soundtrack and story).

We have a shoestring budget if any and are brand new to the gaming scene, so obviously we have different standards than companies and devs like Sandfall or Microsoft. Recently, I proposed a game akin to Corpse Party (the first game, aka the good one) but with American folklore in it as well as the ""nexus limbo"" location being a manor and a hotel, which was a hotspot for ctrl+alt+del oneself from existence and only appears at witching hour during stormy nights instead of a ritual. It's a psychological supernatural horror adventure game at its core, very simple. My boss was all for it at first.

And I was happy as it was one idea for a game I loved. I even gave it an unofficial title (I called it ""Echoes of the Forgotten""). Well, my boss and our composer recently finished playing Expedition 33 and our composer, the pickiest gamer alive, stated the game was ""the most amazing thing he's ever played in years"" and my boss said he loved it more than Persona 5 and other games he played. To each their own, from what I know about the game, it's definitely not something to sneeze at (no, I have not played the game due to finances). Upon giving the title idea to my boss, he said he didn't like it as it was ""too long, hard to make into an artsy title and it was a title that people would just glance over"", claiming we should only have titles of 1-2 words as it was ""perfect"", naming such examples as Omori (until he said Fear and Hunger, to which he backtracked and said ""three is the max"").

Well, we had a bit of a disagreement on the name of the game as he had given title names that contained variations of ""betwixt"", ""limbo"", ""3:33"" and ""03:33"", and he ended up saying the title would be ""3:33"" as ""that's the key to the game, the witching hour"" (it's not a key so much as a plot device). I reluctantly agreed because this is weird, abnormal behavior from him. He also wanted a tutorial at the beginning where it sounded like handholding (a huge game-killer), claiming that ""players are stupid and need to learn how to play"". After doing a small survey of 7 people in total (all of which said the title was ""not good"" and saying my boss was ""trying to hard/chasing perfection that doesn't exist""), I reported my findings to my boss.

He got frustrated and decided to ""postpone the game"", claiming that he ""didn't even know what game we were making and everyone will just thing it's a generic horror puzzle game"". This is after the events of our game being judged in GamerJam, where some of the people playing the game (even the judges) were a bit slow on the hunger mechanic and kept dying due to it, yet we still got praise for making a game in less than a month that was ""actually good and original with a beautiful soundtrack on a shoestring budget"".

I felt deflated and like I wasn't listened to, which may be my fault because I didn't fight him on it for very long (particularly because I didn't feel it'd be worth it). And I feel his love for Expedition 33 played a huge part in it, that and mixing the fact that he felt frustrated by the player base and possibly losing GamerJam. I'm worried my boss is going to copy other games and bank off of their success and make himself insecure and place these unfair standards on himself and us as a team, losing his originality along the way. But maybe I'm overreacting.",
416,"this seems really stupid compared to a lot of the posts here but here goes,

ok so basically whenever i go out to shop like food or clothes or anything, when people make small talk i just lie about really random stupid things.

the other day i bought a lot of chocolates and sweets because i like snacks and the man was like 'oh are you throwing a party?' so naturally i said yes, i said that i had lost a bet and that if i lost i had to buy snacks and host the next game night with friends. he was interested and still had a bunch to even so he asked what the bet was and i couldn't think at that moment so i said ""oh my sisters driving test was yesterday, if she passed i would win the bet"" and he was like oh did she fail and i don't know what possessed me not i said ""no she ran over someone"" then paid and left💀💀",
417,"Coming here because I need to get something off of my chest. This is from awhile back. I know that IATH here.

Going to keep it brief. Used to be in a relationship with someone. While we were expecting our first child, I found out they were not being faithful. I couldn’t stay with her anymore knowing what she had been doing and the stories she had been saying about me when I believed everything was going great between us.

Fast forward a few months, I get with someone else a month or so before my son is expected to arrive. This relationship goes on for a few years. We get married in-between. The connection was beyond anything I’ve ever experienced. But I was expecting WAY to much of them as a step parent. I think I was rejecting the idea of having a son at the time and just couldn’t mentally handle it, so I expected them to just do everything (and they DID // god bless them). But it was way too much to ask. To take in someone else’s child as their own when truthfully they never wanted kids to begin with. But they did it for me. After a while they grew tired of it and I just wouldn’t wake up. They’re gone now. I see now years later that it was all me that burned that relationship down.

I guess I’m struggling with forgiving myself? Maybe I’m still not over it or just haven’t gotten closure? I have dreams of it almost every other night at this point. I can’t tell what’s wrong, but I’m getting to the point where I’m intentionally skipping on sleeping to avoid seeing her. Last night it was her parents and grandmother. I know I was an asshole for a very long time, but it almost seems like it haunts me everyday. 

Current relationship problems have led me to reflect on my past and come to this conclusion. I’ve got a lot of weight on my shoulders, far beyond mentioned here, that is beginning to feel like too much to carry and I do not know where to turn. I guess that’s why I’m here.

419,"I find it disgusting and unnecessary. It feels like there is a part of me that dehumanizes people by liking them as I would like something to consume. It is even more obvious when I can feel profound respect and admiration for someone and then this other heinous feeling for them. It makes me feel like a monster and fighting it in any way feels like self harm.

I know sex is supposed to be a good thing and whatnot, but people act like it's this cutesy thing like liking someone's hair or style when it is more of a visceral and bestial feeling of attraction, and I know this because I can find someone pretty, attractive even, without this grotesque aspect. It is only when sexual thoughts begin that I feel disgusted at myself.

I know it's probably just me, but it drives me insane. I doubt people are going through the same as me. I consider myself as someone with an average libido, compared to my friends and previous partners, but everytime the feeling rises I feel like I am dehuminizing people in a disgusting way so I try to push the thoughts away and focus on something else. It feels wrong to perceive people in a sexual way without their consent, even if it's not imagining whole scenes with them or whatever.

I wish I was asexual or demisexual, because then I wouldn't have to live with this part of myself, or I would only have to deal with it when I find someone I have genuine romantic feelings and a deep stablished connection and have their consent to sexualize them. Sigh...",
420,"I (27 MtF) am going crazy lately about not being able to be a mom. With Mother’s Day having just passed and several women in my life who are pregnant or have recently had babies I’m just feeling so dysphoric and isolated. I have a few career dreams related to the creative fields I enjoy, but I think I would give them all up to be a mom, particularly a bio mom. 

I knew from a young age I wanted to be a parent, but being a father never appealed to me, not even a little. When I finally figured out I was trans it made so much sense and a lot of things became clearer, but one of the more unfortunate things is that I have to live the rest of my life chasing an impossible dream. I would do almost anything to be able to conceive and bear and raise a child. I feel isolated from womanhood, I feel so sad that I will never have a bond that transcends any other. I can only imagine how intimately amazing it must be to love someone so much that you make a child together and then grow it inside myself. I cannot imagine anything as beautiful as that. That is, imo, the ultimate act of love and service. 

I’ve been transitioning for over 2 years now and while I’ve made tremendous progress in some areas it burns me up inside that there are other areas I can’t progress in. At all. I’m happy for all the joyful mothers and expecting mothers out there…but I wish I was one too. I don’t want the world, I’m not asking for something that’s unheard of; half the human race is capable of bearing children, but it’s just my luck that I was born  into the other half. It hurts so deeply that I have no agency in this whatsoever and I have to spend my entire life watching other women live my dream.

422,"Lately, I’ve been feeling like my sexuality is changing me in ways I never expected. I used to care so much about how men perceived me — how I looked, acted, presented myself. For so long, I shaped myself around that.

But I’ve been single for the past three years, and during this time, I’ve grown closer to a woman in my life who I really admire. That connection has opened something in me. It’s changing how I see myself, relationships, and even the world around me. It feels like there’s a whole side of life I didn’t know existed — a life I didn’t realize I could actually live.

And it’s not just about sexuality — this shift is affecting everything. I’ve started questioning my job, my studies, and what I even want from life. I’m thinking about switching directions entirely, maybe even applying for a completely different master’s program. But I’m not even sure if that’s what I really want, or if I’m just reacting to all this change. I feel lost and kind of scared.

I still live at home, and that makes it harder — the pressure to stay within certain social norms is really strong. But at the same time, this change feels… honest. Like it’s waking up a part of me I’ve kept buried for a long time.

424,"For starters, I've ended the friendship, but my anxiety has been through the roof.

For easy reading, let's call this person X. And for advance context, X is not in the same country as me.

X and I met while I was broadcasting on a live app. They were another broadcaster's supporter, and things happened, which caused us to become close friends.

From the start of this friendship, I've always been online and presently active in their lives—a little too active for my own good. X was severely depressed, anxious, and had PTSD from all the tough events they encountered in their life, and I didn't want to have another friend die because I wasn't there for them.

I've been there through every single one of their relationship, supporting them through their ups and downs, being emotionally available and 24/7 ready to pick up a call that would last anywhere between 1-12 hours, sometimes even more. I've been there more than they have been for me, especially when my dad passed.

Due to my constant worrying for them, I stayed up every day till late morning, sleeping less than I should just to listen to their rants and walk with them through their emotions. There were days when they would text me with a photo of them in the hospital after an attempt. And I would be calling with them.

**'Deaths' that occured...**

Last year in September, X told me their partner passed away during a spiritual event, and they couldn't visit or be there for it due to limitations. I was there for days on call, being there to listen to them cry and help them go through it.

This year in April, X told me their sibling ended their own life due to a serious situation that happened, and X couldn't go back for the funeral or to get their ashes after cremation because they were chased out of their country.

And just recently in May, X told me they had cancer and they were only given 2 months to live. A few days later, X's current partner sent a text saying they passed early in the morning.

Here's where it gets suspicious. The next day, X's partner messaged me and told me something weird had happened to them. Their voice changed into X's voice. And I spent 30 minutes convincing them to turn on their cam so I could think of what the issue was. I knew strongly it was X because I know what their behavior is like.

And lo and behold, the camera opened and there was X. They told me they don't know what happened to them, and there was a death certificate issued to their mother-in-law, no proof was given though, because X was supposedly scared to go home in case they scare their family.

Looking at X and their video call background, I started suspecting they have been lying to me. So, in the last week, by the arrangement of the universe, I saw an Instagram story posted by X's supposedly dead sibling, and I decided to message them. We got on a call and I got to confirm my suspicion.

X's ex-partner did not pass away, which I later confirmed when I checked the partner's Instagram thread and realized they were replying in April 2025. X's sibling did not end their life, and they did not encounter and rough situation. And X is still alive and well in their original country.

**Finding out about their lies...**

It all makes sense to me now. X never left the country, and they never encountered all the things they said they did within a short time (other than the deaths). They also faked photos of their alleged partner (I'm trying to get a reply from the person, but they have not). Those photos they sent me were either taken from online or a photo they took with someone else.

Right as I was calling X's sibling. X sent me an Instagram text after 2 missed calls saying ""?"". The next moment, I saw their Instagram story indirectly talking about how I betrayed them and leaked their personal information. I do not even know their real name or if anything they said was through, nor did I confirm it with their sibling. But they do have my personal information.

I blocked them after I saw those stories because my partner has been telling me to leave this friendship for my own good, and I decided I did not want to be lied to anymore. This friendship has impacted my life drastically in a negative way. I'm currently on antidepressants for depression and panic disorder. I also have social anxiety, which is not helpful at all.

X did not stop there, they messaged my mom with a screenshot saying they called the local police of my country and reported me for leaking their information when I was just verifying facts. I was worried because I had never gotten in trouble with the law enforcers before. and after a little thinking, I filed my own report for record purposes with proof of the conversations. I explained that since I did not lose anything, I won't be pursuing it, but just in case they need anymore from me, I gave them my details that I use online so that records would tally if X really did make a report.

Right now, I feel finally free and not on a 24/7 standby for someone who has never been there for me since the start. There are definitely more stories, but this was the final straw that got me to leave.

Now, it's time for my own healing, dealing with both physical and mental illnesses. I really hope I can find myself back again, but as of now, I'm stuck in a loop of insomnia and barely functioning normally. I wish there was an easy way to forget, but I really trusted them with everything. And it all turned out to be a lie.",

426,"**Throwaway account.**

I am 35 and live with my partner. It is going to be hard to throw this all together in a way that tracks well, but I will try.

To preface this post, I will admit I have never really understood how to handle money well (I am learning and improving), and that played a role in how this started.

The housing market in my area is insane, and rent is worse. I got a really good rental deal when I first moved here, but the lease was short because it was normally a vacation home during the summer. When it came time to find another rental, prices had skyrocketed. I found a ""livable"" property where the mortgage would have been lower than the average rent around here. I did not have the credit to buy it myself, so I reached out to my parents. My intent was to get help buying it and then either work out payments or refinance it in my name later when my score improved. My goal was to get into something more affordable and build equity over time.

My father said he would buy it and let us rent from him. We agreed, and he told me he submitted a cash offer that got accepted. Ever since, he has used the house like a leash.

For the past few years, he has regularly reminded me, sometimes twice a month, that he ""might sell the house."" It is always this subtle way of saying not to get comfortable. Like I should be grateful just to have a roof over my head. He acted like his constant reminders were some kind of kindness. And now, it is actually happening.

He wants to sell the house and offered it to me for double what he paid. And if I cannot afford it, which I am not confident I can, he plans to list it publicly for nearly triple. I am technically at the point where I might be able to finance it, but it would put me on an extremely unstable tightrope with no harness. I would be financially overextended with almost no room for error, and only a tiny safety net if something went wrong. But to him, this is ""help."" It is clear to me now that it was never about giving me or my partner stability. He bought it to flip for profit while pretending it was generosity. I was just a placeholder.

Because of all this, I started interviewing for jobs in areas with lower costs of living. After I interviewed for one across the country, I reached out to my parents again, hoping for some kind of support. I told them it was a more affordable area and that I might need help relocating, either researching housing or physically moving. Instead of support, that request turned into one of the most emotionally exhausting conversations I have ever had.

I have progressively stopped wanting to ask them for help over the years. One example: about a year after high school, I was driving an old Trailblazer that the family supposedly bought ""for Mom,"" even though she always drove the newer Suburban. One day I was told to find a car for myself so Mom could use the Trailblazer. I found what was basically my dream car, used, affordable, and in good shape. I called my dad, and he came down, paid the dealer with a cashier’s check, and I got the car. I paid him back over time. But weirdly, he wanted me to go to the bank and put a lien on it right after. I did not understand why, and I still do not, especially now that I know how liens work. Later, while I was away at college, he sold the car to a private buyer without telling me. I never saw a dime from that and have no idea where it went.

This was not the first time my father did something ""supportive"" that felt off or like it had alternative motives.

During the conversation about relocating, I mentioned how hard it is to trust them or ask for support. That eventually led me to say something I have never really said out loud. The way my dad left our family, and the way it was handled, has stuck with me my entire life. I did not bring it up to start a fight. I brought it up because it is part of why I struggle to trust them at all as parents.

My dad left our family when I was around 15 for another woman. And to be clear, he did not just leave. He did not even leave us out of it. He took me, my siblings, his mistress, and her kids to the same movies multiple times and sat in a separate row next to her like we would not figure it out. I was the oldest, and probably the most aware of what was going on. He got caught, moved to his mom’s house, and continued meeting his mistress in parking lots to take wads of cash from her. I remember one of these exchanges crystal clear. I was sitting in the back of his car when he pulled into a church parking lot, pulled up driver’s side to driver’s side with her car, took the money, and drove off. Then he used it to take us to the arcade, out shopping, acting like the perfect dad. Eventually, he just moved back in like everything was normal. No apology. No explanation. Just silence.

When I recently brought this up with my mom, trying to explain how this affected me and why I have so much tension toward him, her response was, “He did not cheat on you, he cheated on me,” like that somehow makes it not matter. I was a teenager. I watched it all happen. I still remember her coming out to the pool crying and asking me if the woman he was cheating with was prettier than her. And now I am being told it did not affect me?

She told me to go to therapy if I wanted to talk about it. Later, she told me I was gas-lighting her. All I did was tell the truth.

Throughout this entire conversation, I kept trying to explain how their behavior has affected my ability to build stability and feel safe. My mom just kept making it about her. She ignored what I said, dismissed what I felt, and then played the victim when I got frustrated at not being heard. Not one thing I said was acknowledged. Not even a little.

I did not start this to cause drama. I asked for help and support, against my better judgment. Now I am sitting here with the same emotional weight I have been carrying for years, realizing that no matter how honest I am, they are never going to see it. They are never going to admit what happened or how it affected me.

So yeah, I am done. I was honest. I know what happened. I know how I feel. I am not going to protect their version of the story anymore just to keep the peace.

I have removed and blocked both of my parents through all forms of contact.

428,"I met my ex husband when I was 23 and fell head over heels in love with him immediately. We secretly married a month after meeting (the epitome of young and dumb) but I loved him and knew he was a hard working man that would be successful one way or the other and we would be a power couple in our own way so threw caution to the wind (thanks frontal lobe). 

Well, 3 months into the marriage he cheated on me, and then 8 months later he said he wasn’t ready for this type of commitment. Despite that, I wasn’t really in a rush to get divorced because I think I subconsciously hoped with a little time and maturity he’d realize we were meant to be together and he’d choose me (i feel so pathetic typing this out now but gosh it was the truth). 

We stayed legally married for nearly half a decade. During that time we’d see other people but we were still close and our lives were intertwined in a lot of ways, but then I got a job opportunity in another state, and I just felt like it was a now or never moment in our marriage. 

We mutually agreed divorce was probably best, and weirdly a month after initiating the divorce with my husband I met another person I fell head over heels for and it made me feel like I was making the right decision.

A few years after my divorce my ex is now famous on social media and makes a pretty good living off of it. Luckily, the type of content isn’t my cup of tea so I don’t see it very often, but the “what ifs” creep into my mind sometimes. 

It’s weird because when I look back on my decisions, I wouldn’t change a thing. Particularly because i’m not a money motivated person anyway, and to a certain extent i’m glad i chose love (and myself) over a marriage that wasn’t working. 

But at the same time I feel a bit silly having to work a regular job while my ex is “living the life” so to speak. And to a certain extent, the objective truth is the life he has wouldn’t be possible without me, BUT his content and his growth was 100% him so really he’s earned it and how things have ended up is truly fair but gosh sometimes I wonder…. 

‘twas good to get this off my chest! 

EDIT: thank you all for your responses you have helped me work through a lot of my feelings. it’s easy to look back on things with rose colored glasses but even typing this out helped me remember why i made the choices that i did. 

in addition, while i do have a beautiful and successful life by my own standards, i feel like i’m at a point that i need a real change so i think some of my feelings about the lack of satisfaction about my current situation i misplaced into wistfulness over my ex. thanks for helping me remember its a dead fish in the water ",
429,"Dear Stranger,
It was February 9th, around 12 PM, in Fishers, Indiana.
We stopped at a restaurant—not to eat, but because my brother had to use the restroom. I wasn’t expecting anything. I was just passing through.

You were standing by the entrance with your mom.
You had blue eyes, medium brownish hair. Something about you immediately caught my attention—but more than that, you stared at me. Not in a weird way, but in a way that made everything around me fade for a moment. Like you saw me. Really saw me.

Then your mom looked at me and said, “I did that too.”
I wasn’t sure what she meant—maybe she was referring to the way you stared. I awkwardly said, “sorry,” and she smiled and said, “it’s okay.”
And then… I left. That was it.

But I haven’t stopped thinking about you since.
I don’t know your name. I’ve never seen you again.
But your face, your eyes, the way that moment made me feel—it’s stuck with me.

I’ve tried to forget. I’ve kept myself busy with work, school, life. But every now and then, I remember you. A stranger who somehow made me feel seen in the middle of an ordinary day.

Sometimes I wish I hadn’t gone into that restaurant.
Because now I’m left with this memory that won’t let go. A moment that felt like it could have been more… but wasn’t.

I don’t know why I’m writing this. Maybe just to finally let it out.
But wherever you are, I hope you’re doing well. And I hope—somewhere deep down—you remember me too.

—The girl you saw that day
",
430,"This is somehow my experience with every guy I’ve dated. 

Offering to drive? Blasphemy. Expecting to take your car because it makes more sense? You thought wrong.

Somehow, (at least where I live in rural Australia) it’s not even a question. You get into the dusty-ass dual-cab. 

The same guy who goes on a five minute rant about how women should run the country will glitch if you don’t slide straight into the passenger seat. 

But it’s reasonable because your car is too small, too low, too unsafe. And you can’t drive his, it’s probably a manual. 

Think there are good reasons to have a manual transmission? I’ll tell you the main one, gate-keeping. Sorry babe, you could drive it if you knew how to. 

But don’t worry, you can graduate to “too hard on the clutch” if you take a rigged apprenticeship. 

And the worst thing about all this. On the rare occasions I have taken the wheel with a man. It’s fucking cursed and I hate it. ",
431,"Hey Reddit, this is a throwaway account since my main account has a username that I use everywhere. I don’t want any of my friends who use Reddit to find this and feel sorry for me.

So, I \[23F\] am in one of the worst moods I’ve ever been in my life. I genuinely feel as though my life no longer has any value. Not in the sense that I want to do something drastic to end it all- no. But simply that I feel that I do not deserve good things anymore- which includes emotional connections.

I live in my mother’s house, I have a boyfriend who I love very much. I have a few sparse friends, but none who live in my area. All of my friends are online- and this is also how I met my boyfriend. We have been together for about 4 months. I have a job under my mother, since the other 3 jobs I have tried I have gotten fired from. I don’t earn anywhere near close enough to move out in the next 10+ years.

I have been feeling awful lately due to many different reasons. I am currently in therapy, yes, but I haven’t been able to see my therapist in over a month since she was out for surgery. So, I decided to vent to Reddit because I just don’t want to burden anyone I care about with my meaningless problems.

I have ADHD, Anxiety, and am self-diagnosed as autistic. I haven’t gotten a formal diagnosis because I simply cannot afford it. But I have all the common symptoms- such as the one that I feel makes me just incapable of being social. I have an impossible time telling the “vibes” of a room- or of a specific person. And I say things constantly that hurt the ones I love, but I simply just do not understand what I did until I am being screamed at by someone with tears running down their face.

This has happened consistently for the last few weeks. I have done terrible things. I shared private sensitive information about my partner with my mother in an offhand comment. I make jokes about unrelated issues and laugh when someone is crying due to their own personal life. When someone is venting, I offer words of encouragement and hype when they only wanted an ear and acceptance.

I also struggle greatly with self-loathing. I feel nothing short of disgust at myself- from my appearance to my interests to my personality to my very existence. And because I am so self-conscious, I cannot take compliments nor encouragement. I know my own anxieties about myself cause me to do terrible things to those I care about.

I’m constantly terrified of being annoying, so I never message first and just have my friendships drift away. When someone asks me to be a little better about this, I’ll message them non-stop constantly in an attempt to overcorrect, and they’ll call me out for being overbearing. I asked my boyfriend if his love for me was real or not, asking if it was just a result of a bipolar manic episode. I flood his texts with “I love you” when we fight, crying out just for a single response when I know he just needs space. I get jealous of him spending time with his friends without me because I just feel so afraid that he will fall out of love with me. Not that he is cheating- just that I am too much for him. And I know I am wrong in these beliefs, but it doesn’t make the anxieties stop.

I also struggle with being an adult in this world. My interests have always been a little more childish than most. I like collecting and playing with toys. I watch kids films more often than films geared towards adults. I buy things recklessly with any money I get because the momentary joy I get seems to be the only thing that keeps me going. I wallow in my executive dysfunction, and simply cannot bring myself to do the most basic tasks. They just feel impossible. And it is not me being lazy. I WANT to get these things done, but instead I let myself rot in bed for hours not getting up. I’m too afraid to get a different job because of my fear of being fired yet again- but also I cannot stand the idea of being an employee. It makes me feel as though I am trapped, chained to a post for 40+ years of my life while everyone yells at me to suck up the frustration because this is how the world works. I initially got into therapy to work through this issue, but me getting fired AGAIN last week has just made me fall back so far in my progress.

This has made me slowly make my friendships- and relationship- crumble right before my eyes. Most of my friends from a year ago are either gone or mere acquaintances now. My boyfriend told our entire group chat last night the thing I said to him and now he is barely speaking to me. He hasn’t responded to any of my “I love yous” and is just chatting freely with our mutual friends.

I’m not going anywhere in life. I have spent time and college and made 0 new friends in the 2 years I’ve been there. I failed 3 classes and cannot afford to retake them. I changed my major because I felt too stressed but cannot decide what else I want to do.

I live in a tiny town with around 500 people, most of which are the polar opposite of me on the political spectrum and are way above my age group. The job I work now is something I hate. I’ve recently learned that my father may have been emotionally and mentally abusing me since I was a toddler. My mother has been trying her best but our bond has clearly been affected by some recent issues, such as her invalidating my sexuality to my partner. My brother has been practically invisible since he started dating his girlfriend and getting his promotion. My former only in-person friend has been cut off due to her taking advantage of my money for 10 years.

With all this going on, I realize that I just don’t offer anything to this world. My bundle of problems only cause pain to those I care about. I am cruel, evil, manipulative, and selfish. Whenever I hurt someone, I apologize and then feel sorry for myself- when I know I don’t deserve it for being so insensitive. I promise them I will change, only to do it again and again without realizing. I am the worst kind of cruel- where I just don’t realize what I do until it’s too late. They shouldn’t have to put up with having to cry their eyes out for me to understand the most basic things. And I cannot keep putting those I love through my knife, in exchange for just a mediocre friendship where at most I’ll text memes because I don’t know what to say.

My own self loathing is to an extent that it doesn’t just affect myself anymore. I accuse others of terrible things because I cannot fathom that anyone would find me worth anything.

I haven’t tried to take my own life. The thought crossed my mind briefly, but no more than a fleeting thought. I have tried to harm myself, but was too afraid to go through with it. I ended up trying with a random object before calling my mother in a panic- to which she told me that my method of trying was incorrect. I’ve since resorted to writing sharpie all over my legs horrible phrases that I refuse to scrub off or show anyone.

I just feel as though my problems are too great to fix, or at least, it will take too long to fix them to save any of my current bonds. I feel as though I need to let everyone free of my burden and walk away. Perhaps in a decade or two I can try again if I feel as though I’ve made enough progress. But I just simply wish to wither away in my room, force myself to get a job and load myself up on pills so I act like the good little zombie I should be. I cannot talk about this with anyone because I don’t deserve their sympathy.

I always thought I was a good person. I had no real talents, no direction in life, no beauty. But I was kind and generous. But it turns out I was wrong. I was just too blind to see my own failures as a person.

I’ve been told that the only person who can save you is yourself. But when I look in the mirror, I just do not see anyone worth saving.

Thanks for reading my ramblings.",
432,"
Writing with tears feels different.
It’s less like articulation,
more like being devoured from the inside
and trying to shape the ache into language.
It feels more like screaming
than writing.
Yelling into the void—
not to be heard,
but because silence
would mean surrender.
I wonder what it must feel like
not having to worry about being too loud—
to scream without guilt.
To rupture the silence without needing it to matter.
But even then,
there’s no satisfaction.
The scream won’t echo.
It will dissolve like breath in winter.
No witness. No reply.
No meaning.

I can’t imagine what it must feel like
to be young again—
but perhaps it’s the same as when you were young:
not knowing.
So the real question becomes,
what does it feel like to *need nothing*—
to strip yourself clean
of every hunger for affection,
for warmth,
for the illusion of being understood?
What is it like
to enjoy life
as if you were your own reason to smile,
your own audience,
your own home?

But we are cursed—no, engineered—
to need others.
And the cruelest ones
are those condemned to need
without receiving.
The lonely ones.
Ghosts in crowded cities.
Why must they suffer?
Why must they carry
the absence of what they never had?

And in the end,
the circle tightens—
we become
those who made us ache.
Those who carved the hollows in our chest
now wear our faces.
We become
the hands that shook us.
We are the bruises we once cursed.

We are the monsters.
We are the ones we feared,
the ones we hate.
We are everyone around us—
just rearranged pain.
Echoes in flesh.

They hear noise,
and it unsettles them.
But they scream.
They speak.
They laugh.
They cry.

You, though—
you must stay still.
They think you are made of silence,
because your voice
stays caged inside your ribs.
But stillness isn’t peace.
Stillness is exile.

You are bleeding from thoughts
they cannot even *look at*.
They say you're sensitive—
a flaw.
But it takes a foul fortress of will
to survive what they won’t even name.

They say life is like a sine function—
rising, falling,
a pattern repeating itself
into eternity.
They say this with hollow comfort,
as if cycles meant safety.
But you—
you are drowning in that wave.

You try to make sense of it.
You take its derivative.
Try to simplify.
Find a pattern.
You become the mathematician of your own despair.

But no matter how you transform it—
rotate it, reduce it,
it returns.
Still a wave.
Still endless.
A beautiful, elegant loop
dragging you beneath its surface.

Even understanding
becomes another form of drowning.

And the worst betrayal—
when your own heart
refuses to obey.
When it aches
not for the one who holds you,
but for the one who would
watch you unravel.
The one who would never,
could never,
love you back.

What madness.
To be at war
with your own longing.

How cruel
that the most powerful force inside you
chooses your ruin.

Crazy, how hard life can be.

And perhaps
the most tender mercy
at the end of all this—
is not peace,
not understanding—

but simply,
to stop.
To un-become.
To lay down
and let the wave pass over.
To die
with the dignity of silence.

""I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts, not just because I failed my exams, but also due to my family problems. As a child, I preferred staying home to spending time with my mom, whom I loved deeply. She was the most beautiful creation in my world. I would help her with household chores, talk to her while she worked, and even cook with her. My childhood was peaceful, thanks to her presence. My daily routine involved waking up to her gentle calls, getting ready with her help, and having breakfast while she dressed me.

But life took a devastating turn when my mom fell ill. After a week in the hospital, her condition worsened, and she passed away on a ventilator. I was just 12 years old and had to manage everything on my own, from fetching water bottles and meals to withdrawing cash from the ATM. I vividly remember the sweat, the anxiety, and the tears as I waited for a positive response from the doctors. When I entered the hospital that day, the doctors and nurses rushed my mom to the ICU, and I was left sitting alone, crying and praying for her recovery.

The moments that followed are etched in my memory – the nurses updating me on her chances of survival, the percentages dropping from 90% to 10%, and the overwhelming feeling of helplessness. When my relatives took me home, I thought my mom was recovering, but instead, I saw her being taken away in an ambulance. That moment left me stunned, and I couldn't cry or feel anything. During the rituals, everyone around me was crying, but I wasn't. To my surprise, my relatives started showing their true colors, blaming me and calling me rude and arrogant. Their words stung, filling my heart with anger, low self-esteem, and self-doubt.

After that incident, I lost interest in my studies and life in general. I started to become what I once despised – a person who smokes, drinks, and is rude. I've failed in many subjects, and I feel like I'm destined to fail. I hate my life and often argue with God about what I've lost. If my mom were alive, my life would be different – calm, peaceful, and beautiful.
One thing I've learned is to cherish time with family, as you never know who will leave first. A child shouldn't have to witness their parent's death, and parents shouldn't have to witness their child's demise. I struggle with the idea of a higher power allowing such suffering. I'm not questioning my faith but expressing my anger and frustration on God.""
All i can say is i hate my life and I miss my mom and (note) 1. People started to call me a mature guy and everyone used to say you are more older than ur age yeh when you face something in ur Teenage you'll become more older, i never wanted to become mature by losing my favourite person ok i became mature but at what cost? It's not worth it 2. I never dreamt of becoming something cuz i never thought about it so take my advice, set up a goal and work for it and I'm below average in everything and it hurts i wish i was never born and i took a lot of wrong decisions in my life like everything now i regret what I have done... 
Now I became useless, can't even focus on studies
If god is truly a protector then why we are losing our precious persons and things? 
And why we are getting hurt ? 
There's a lot to complain nvm...
I think he is a psychopath who loves to watch Chaos in people's lives.....",
434,"It’s not like we had a big fight. There wasn’t even a clear moment.
One day we were laughing over dinner, and now she barely says more than a few words to me in a day.
No “good morning,” no “how was your day?” Nothing.
Just... silence.

She still does everything around the house. Still takes care of the kids. Still shows up. But emotionally? It’s like I’m a ghost.

I asked if something was wrong. She said, “I’m just tired.”
But this “tired” has lasted months.

I don’t cheat. I don’t lie. I work hard. I try. But I feel like I’m losing her and I don’t even know why.

Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do?",
435,"I’ve had a herniated disc since January. L5–S1. That’s the one that controls sitting, standing, walking, and—apparently—wanting to stay alive.

It started with me bending over to pick up a ball and something popped, ever so slightly. Then my back just became stiffer and stiffer until I had to see a doctor.

Then the pain moved to my left leg.
Now my back doesn’t hurt, but my leg feels like I got shot in 1998 and no one told me. Which is apparently a thing that can happen. Because nerves, or something.

They prescribed me Oxycodone. It works. Like, really works. Within 15 minutes I go from limping and swearing to moving like a functioning adult.

Which is exactly why I try not to take it. It’s not about addiction, not really. I just know myself.
Let’s just say I had a long-term relationship with cocaine in the late 2000s, and I’m not eager to invite that guy back to the party.

So I wait it out—getting bounced around from doctors to physical therapists and now waiting to see an orthopedist. I take five different meds three times a day and just power through. No opiates unless I absolutely have to.

I’ve been on sick leave since March. Got pulled away from a job I love, which has been a huge part of my identity for 20-something years.
That was a fun little existential moment—having to look in the mirror and figure out who I am without it.

Now I can’t even clear the damn dishwasher without planning the whole operation like a heist.
But hey—adapt and overcome, right?

Thanks, life. Really appreciate the extra side quest.

Anyway. That’s it. Thanks for reading. Hope your spine’s not plotting against you today.",
436,"For as long as I can remember, I’ve had a complicated relationship with food. I’m a 27-year-old woman, and ever since I was little, I was always “the chubby one,” “the tall one,” “the one with big bones” – or so people would say. My weight has always been a rollercoaster. During school, I kept swinging between being very overweight and then suddenly thinner again.

My parents didn’t help much. My mom had a more “healthy” approach, but she was also very firm. Her focus on me being thin often felt more like pressure than support. And then there was my dad – who I now believe also struggled with food – and he was always giving me sweets. While my mom would offer me an apple, he’d give me an alfajor (a typical sweet from Argentina, where I’m from).

Two years ago, I hit my highest weight: 112 kilos (around 247 lbs). It was a breaking point. I had returned to Argentina and started the keto diet with my mom. I lost 18 kilos (about 40 lbs) in 6 months. My confidence went up, and for the first time in a while, I felt good about myself.

But then I moved to Italy two years ago… and slowly, I lost control again. Now I’m back to 100 kilos (220 lbs). I feel awful. I let myself go, and even though I know I use food to cope with stress, sadness, and loneliness, I haven’t been able to stop.

At the end of the day, I know it’s me. I’m the one making the choices. I let it get to this breaking point too.

I don’t really know what I expect from this post. Maybe just to let it out. But if anyone has any advice – how to keep going, how to get back on track, or just how to feel like myself again – I’d be really grateful.

437,"This has been going on for a few months now (not sure exactly how long), and I don't really want to talk to anyone in-person about this, so I'm just going to ramble about it here. Sorry if this is worded weirdly at all, my mind is a little jumbled and I jumped between paragraphs a lot while writing this.

I feel like I've properly reached my wits' end. I hardly have a future, I rarely leave my house anymore, almost nothing brings me any proper joy, and I'm just sort of going through the motions of life. I'm never caught up with my work, and I'm genuinely convinced that there's no point in trying to get caught up, because it just won't be worth it in the end. It's not like I can maintain anything stable anyway, especially since I really don't even leave my computer that often unless I have obligations I need to tend to.

I hardly even interact with anyone outside of certain family members and a few close friends, but even then, they often have to reach out to me first, and sometimes I just don't respond, and it never seems to bother them, at least not anymore. I knew a lot of people, but I haven't interacted with almost any of them for near weeks at this point and none of them seem to care that much. I can't even really blame them, considering that I'm never enthusiastic about anything and oftentimes I assume the worst of everyone around me and end up running with that narrative, even if it's based on extremely mild body language (e.g. them literally just standing near a doorway while we're talking) or vague vibes I got, plus I always respond to these assumptions by shutting down the conversation entirely. This is without mentioning that I'm pretty sure everyone just genuinely hates me, and I'm not one to hide that assumption. Generally, interacting with others is unpleasant, and I'm sure other people think the same of me.

This is even without mentioning that, at least within the past two months or so, I've been in a near constant terrible mood and I don't have the motivation to do anything meaningful anymore.

I really don't know where to go from here, I don't know how to fix any of these problems and in a way I almost don't want to correct some of them because the last thing I want to do is miss some sort of social cue and annoy or irritate someone in turn. It's easier to assume the worst and not bother.",

Not in a fake-deep, chosen-one kind of way—just... more.

I’ve been the strong one. The dangerous one. The one who never asks for help.  
And honestly? I’m exhausted.

445,"I never thought a movie would change my life, but Godzilla Minus One did. I was engaged to my fiancée for a year.

I tried to be the ""good guy,"" stepping up for kids who weren’t mine, but it felt like I was drowning in someone else’s mess.Then I watched Godzilla Minus One. The story hit me hard—Shikishima’s struggle with guilt, duty, and choosing his own path over burdens he didn’t create. There’s this scene where he realizes he doesn’t have to sacrifice his life for a war he didn’t start.

Godzilla Minus One didn’t “fix” me, but it gave me the clarity to stop being a martyr.Has anyone else had a movie snap them out of a bad situation? Or dealt with blending a family that just… didn’t work? I’m still processing the guilt, but I feel freer than I have in years.",

I have been very depressed for the last couple of months and after a change of medication I started to feel so much better and I started to do things that I always wanted but never managed to do it. Three weeks ago I finally got an appointment from a good tattoo artist and I’ve been excitedly waiting for this. Today I finally got it and everything was fine, the artist did a great job. I came home and took the bandages off to clean it and I just lost it. It looked too thick, too long and I started to have a full on panic attack. I asked the artist if it looks extra thick from swelling and she kind of got defensive and said that she did exactly as I said (I wasn’t blaming her, I was genuinely curious). This is my third tattoo and I don’t remember feeling like this even though they are on my arms and I see them every day. I don’t know if it’s because this is a very big tattoo and need some time to get used to it or maybe I’m anxious about my parents’ reaction (we live together and they don’t like tattoos) or if I really don’t like it I have no idea. I know I won’t even see it unless I look with a mirror and I‘ve been wanting this for so long… I don’t know why I feel like this and I felt so alone so I decided to vent about it here. I know tattoo removal is an option but I don’t want to do that. I just want to get used to it and love it. ",
447,"It's been two years of being unemployed surviving by burning through my savings. The reason that I ended up unemployed was that I was fired by two narcists directors, whose arrogance, incompetence and casual sexism had created a completely toxic work environment and when the shit hit the fan I refused to go along with making an example of one of their employees. They turned my attention to me choosing to make an example of me seeing me as an easy target because of my general passive nature and issues I was going through at the time a divorce and grief of losing my nan ( who had been the woman who raised me) and in financially bad position as all my money was tied up in the house that I had left. Cornered in a meeting, I was given the ultimatum leave or be demoted, followed by an hour of abuse, gaslighting and lies. I ended up walking out and seeing no way out, I choose to end it only surviving because of timely intervention of a friend, when I informed them I was in hospital they told me get back in office and sign the new contract and when I informed them I was fired.

Last two years, I tried to make the best of bad situation I got in music through a friend and worked on several community projects and while there have been success. I have not been able to secure work through them or monetise the work I been doing. I have tried but at this point I am too burnt out to keep trying. The same friend who been helping me, I have developed feelings for but I would not say mostly because of how useless and broken I have been made to feel . Made worse by the fact she related to directors so that would just add another part to humiliation for those wondering she knows that worked for them and left but not the reasons why.  While I have tried to help her I am seeing them having a negative influence over her as they seek to use like everyone around them for their own gains, yet I feel powerless to do anything.

At this point I don't know what to do I never felt so defeated in my life.

449,"I’m currently in a voluntary inpatient mental health facility, seeking treatment for trauma. I’m have been in an abusive relationship for years and am now finally going through a divorce. I also just left a toxic job where a bunch of senior male colleagues were degrading me behind my back and competing for who could get me in bed (No one did). 

I am feeling hurt and vulnerable as a result of these experiences. 

I am quite socially isolated also. My family lives overseas and I don’t have many friends nearby either, as I’m new to the area.

There is another patient here who is much younger than I am (24, I’m 37), who is also seeking treatment for trauma. He lost a colleague a year ago in a work accident, which he feels was avoidable and for which he feels partly responsible. Then, his ex partner of 4 years unalived herself 2 months ago. He was trying to get her help as they were still very close, and he is actively grieving her loss. 

We have spoken to each other quite a bit outside of group, and I feel comfortable with him. I can tell from his body language that he is physically attracted to me. I find him attractive as well. He just seems so pure hearted and vulnerable too. I was thinking about floating the idea to see if he’s interested in getting together outside of here after this is over, to physically connect. I’m deeply craving physical intimacy and I see he is hurting to, and I want to make him feel good. If he is keen and it feels right, I wonder if it might be a bit healing, or at least cathartic, to physically be with someone who is also going through something. Someone who hasn’t hurt or exploited me.

450," I'm 17 and I go to one of the most prestigious high schools in the nation or maybe the world. Point being it's up there. This isn't to brag, genuinely. This is to emphasize how much of a pressure cooker it is and how fucking miserable it is. Every conversation i have with anyone is about college and school and it's god awful. It's also a boarding school so you can't escape it. It's everywhere. 

I've been doing really badly in my STEM classes lately (Cs, Ds) and it's partially because they're hard classes and partially because I'm burnt out. Anyways, it's so exhausting to deal with, especially because I've been more or less a straight A/A- student (A is the highest grade given) at my school, and seeing how my years of working my ass off are being wasted because two classes are killing me is so fucking draining. I'm applying to college soon and the idea that these grades might fully impact my chances of going to one of my top schools makes me wanna rip my eyes out. I genuinely am so exhausted. Everyone keeps telling me it gets better but I feel like no matter what I do it just gets worse and worse and I hate it and i'm so tired of striving for perfection just to be slapped in the face with rejection. 

And it's so easy for people to say ""in ten years it won't matter"". I've virtually spent my entire life studying and working hard so I can go to a top college. Since I was 3, it's been my dream to go to Princeton. Now that I'm older I know that's not gonna happen, but point is I've been working my ass off for like 12 years. The idea that it's all gonna go to waste makes me want to curl up in a ball and dissolve into the ground. 

And to some people this sounds stupid, but when I've spent my whole life cripplingly depressed and anxious, prioritizing work over and over and over, it's crushing for that to all go to waste. 

Obviously I understand that I sound like a whiny brat—and this isn't to discredit my privilege. I am eternally grateful for these opportunities and I know others would kill to be in my position but I really wish I could just be a normal teenager who got to go to parties and hang out with their friends and do dumb shit.

451,"My father passed away last night from cancer. He'd had a mass on his spine that was removed but he had an embolism. Im glad he wasn't in pain. 

When he was recovering from the surgery he confessed to me that he had experienced a nuclear contamination within the context of his job as a nuclear safety technician which he believed contributed to his cancer. This happened in the 70s and he never intended to have children. I was born in 1988 and am perfectly healthy. His final request was for me and my husband to pursue compensation, so I guess we'll look into that as those were his wishes, even though I'm more intending to do the research to guage my own risk factors. I have two young children who don't know yet that grandad has passed. My mum is in bits. 

When I visited him last he spent three hours describing the first part of the story in intricate detail. I let him talk until he was exhausted and didn't rush him. Then I got a tummy bug and obviously felt I couldn't visit yesterday. Now I wish I had anyway. I really regret not hearing the whole story, it's clear how much it mattered to him and I feel I let him down.

452,"It’s been three years since I graduated as a general practitioner. In my hometown, GPs are everywhere. The city is saturated with us, and most of my peers are desperate to specialize—because in medicine, that’s the only way to advance, to earn more, and to have a more “comfortable” career. But getting into a specialty program is extremely difficult, especially if you don’t have strong connections or a stellar GPA.

And I didn’t have either.

When I saw my classmates post their acceptance letters on Facebook, celebrating their placements in specialty training, I spiraled. I couldn’t help but ask myself—why not me? What was wrong with me? Did my degree still mean anything? Was I even helping people the way I originally set out to?

For months, self-destructive thoughts looped endlessly in my head. I questioned whether this path was even right for me anymore.

Then, one friend said something that stuck with me:
“Specializing isn’t everything. It’s important in your career, yes—but it doesn’t define your worth as a person.”

That helped me shift my perspective. Now, five years in, I can finally say: our value doesn’t lie in whether we hit milestones at the same time as others. It’s about how we carry ourselves while we’re still trying to get there.

I’m still a general practitioner. I don’t have fancy credentials after my name. But I’ve helped people recover from serious illnesses. I’ve walked with them through the darkest moments of their lives. And this year, I was recognized as the outstanding doctor in our small district.

If I had quit back then, driven only by shame and comparison, I would have missed this moment entirely.

So, if you’re someone still figuring it out—if you feel like everyone else is moving forward while you’re standing still—I just want to say: you’re not worthless. You might just be in the wrong arena, or it might not be your time yet. And that’s okay.

I’d also love to hear your story—if you’ve ever felt the same way, or if you’re still going through it. You’re not alone.",
453,"I dont want to get into details as it will mess me up more than I am right now. Just, went to college with shitty people who said a lot of shit to invalidate me / the struggles I went through because they didn't / hadn't heard of people / a significant amount of people going through what I had and then had the audacity to say not to compete about trauma when they asked why my perspective was always different from theirs and based on our convos I was like, ""Cause I went through more than most middle class people"" Like if I'm so weird to you rich well-adjusted kids, what do you think leads to that?

Basically, college had people who were incre4dibly invalidating, worsened the trust issues I worked so hard to overcome, and I keep having emotion flashbacks, remembering the shit they said, remembering them telling everyone I took shit too personally and everyone just believed them. I never got closure for any of it obviously other than them telling me they're sorry I feel that way and shifting the blame to me. Sorry I just, I've seen 8+ therapists to talk through my trauma, including this, I'm a lot better than I was in college emotionally, but I really just, want to stop feeling so, triggered about this shit when I'm stressed out about anything this shit comes up. As silly as it sounds or whatever, it truly left me feeling deeply invalidated no matter what other people have said. I dont know what to do. Thank you for listening.",
454,"I (19M) feel so anxious around my mother (41F) and I hate it so much because I know that my mother has gone through a lot of depressing stuff in her life. For some pre context, my mother lost her dad at 19, divorced my dad at 26, lost her mother at 28, and at 40 lost her husband (my stepdad) to cancer.

I’ll also add here that she and my stepdad had 1 kid together, my half brother, when she was 35 but I’ll expand on why this is important later.

When I’m around my mother, I feel my peace is disturbed, if she’s angry or stressed, she has to make me angry or stressed by picking a fight she doesn’t even want. Living in a home with her is so mentally draining, I hate the fact that I feel like I have to be on edge the whole time my mother is at home. As soon as she pulls in the driveway, I literally run to my room and shut the door because I’d rather not roll the dice to see what mood my mother is in, because I don’t want my mood ruined. This makes me hate her presence which I feel so guilty about because at the end of the day she’s my mother and has gone through a lot of stuff.

Since my stepdads passing in 2023 (my high school graduation year), this has made the situation so much worse, because my plan after graduating was to move in with my biological dad. My dad and I get along perfectly fine and I feel comfortable and safe around him. I felt like I could really focus on college living with him as opposed to living with my mother. But obviously since my stepdads passing I can’t leave my mother to fend for herself raising a 6 year old. The thing that sucks is that I want to help my mother and guide her to raise my brother differently than she raised me, because I want them to have a better relationship than we do, especially since my brother won’t have a dad. But my mother is very close minded, it’s her way or the highway. My input on anything my mother does has no affect, my words have no value to her. I should also add that I did try attending college the semester after my stepdad passed, but between my job, taking care of the house (I am responsible for everyone’s laundry, the dishes, and making sure the house is never ‘dirty’), my first time taking college level courses, and just overall a little depressed because I was really close with my stepdad, I dropped my classes and haven’t been enrolled since.

I’m gonna try and wrap it up here because I’m teary eyed and I don’t want to cry, but I just feel so fucking stuck in life. After high school I thought I would finally have the opportunity to choose a better living situation so I can focus on going to college living with my dad, and not have to worry about what’s going on in my mothers household anymore. I don’t want to deal with my mother, it is so draining, but I have no other choice. It doesn’t make it better that all my friends have up and moved to colleges away from my city, and I can’t stop the constant comparisons between our different situations and wishing this life wasn’t mine. I want to move out and leave my mother but I can’t, I just can’t pull myself to do so, I honestly don’t know if I even have a future anymore.",
455,"Hi for context I’m f18, I weigh 43.6kg and I’m 5,1. 

So it all started with me wanting to loose weight (starting at 1200 calories per day) which I honestly considered healthy and still had a good relationship with food. It was a couple days maybe a week later the process was very slow. I decided to lower it and lower it. I was warned about starting to count calories as I was never aware of it before. I rlly wanted to loose weight bc I always hated the way I looked and was bullied since preschool. 

Fast forward a couple weeks, it went Lower to 300/400 calories a day. I lost tremendous weight and I finally felt amazing. I did start doing bad things like daily chew and spit and never going over 300-400 no matter that. Forcing myself to like 0 calorie foods. (I say this like I still don’t do this). I loved how I started looking. I weighed myself more than 2x a day and constantly throughout the day check my arms and thighs, desperate for progress. 

Anyways, ppl started to feel a little concerned saying I may have an ed. I immediately pushed that idea from me. However, it made some what sense. I just didn’t wanna be involved with that. 

Today after eating 300 calories for the week I eat over 1k worth of food. I’m completely disgusted in myself, the weight gain is evident already. I’m bloated and feel disgusted on how I looked. But now I’m confused? People with ed don’t just simply eat one day. So I’m not sure what I’m going through anymore? I can’t talk to anyone irl so this is my best shot. 

I don’t know what is happening to me now if it’s not an ed?

456,"I’ve been in private school since middle school, and I’m now attending the same private high school. Before that, I went to a public elementary school in what many would call a “rough” neighborhood. Back then, I never thought about where I lived, what my parents did for a living, or where I stood in society. None of that mattered to me.

Everything changed about two years ago.

A girl in my class casually asked how much my parents earned. I told her “3000 euros.” I lied, obviously. My mom is a cleaning lady. She gets some government help and earns, at most, 2000 euros. I don’t have a dad. But she didn’t know that. She just said, “Oh… that’s not a lot!” I remember feeling deeply embarrassed.

Another time I realized how different I was was when people started talking about “rallyes” — rich-kid social events. I had never even heard of them. I’ve never been invited to one, not then, not now. They also talked about getting pocket money. For me, having even 5 euros was unthinkable. My friends were always the ones paying for me.

More than once, I heard students at my school mocking social housing. I didn’t even know what “HLM” (French subsidized housing) was at the time. They’d laugh and say stuff like, “That’s where the poor live,” or “Hope you’re not from there, haha.” It was pure classism. That’s when I realized: I live in an HLM. And with that realization came shame — shame I’d never felt before.

My mom pays for that apartment with her hard work. She’s never asked for anything. And still, I felt ashamed.

Then one day, someone asked me: “Where do you live, by the way?”

I never really lied. There’s a neighborhood in my city that’s seen as “the worst” — full of crime and stereotypes. I always said I lived “around there.” What does “around” mean? I don’t even know. But it worked. People assumed I lived in a house. I never said I did. I never pretended. That’s not who I am. But I admit I didn’t correct them either.

I know this won’t work forever. Someday, I’ll have to be fully honest. But for now, I’m trying to accept myself, and the life my mom gave me. I still struggle. A lot. But I’m doing my best.

I wanted to share this because I know I’m not the only one. If you’ve ever felt this way, please know: don’t ever feel ashamed.
A home is just a place to live. It doesn’t define who you are.

457,"Back when I was in high school, every year for Christmas the school would do a basket drive for kids in need. Mainly  homeless kids or kids from very low income families. Each student was given a small basket (they were small), assigned a kid (for example we would be told 'boy age 6') and we were to fill the basket with gifts for the kid we were assigned. 

The school gave out a list of suggested items to buy and not to buy. We couldn't buy toys that needed to be plugged in or take batteries for example because they might not have a place to charge it/couldn't afford batteries. Things like books and small toys were on the list but the list also suggested a lot of essential items like hats, socks, shampoo, toothbrushes and toothpaste, etc. 

Freshman year, it was my first year participating in the drive. I went shopping with my mom for things to put in my basket. My mom wanted to buy a lot those essential items so that's what we did. I filled my basket with shampoo, body wash, toothpaste and a toothbrush, a winter hat, etc. My mom was happy with everything we got and it was on the list of suggested items so I didn't think twice about it. 

The day of the drive I went to school thinking I put together a good basket. My friend asked me what I put in mine and I listed out some of the things in there. Their response was ""Wow you really focused on the... essentials..."". 

That's when I realized I fucked up. It struck me, this was going to be opened by A YOUNG KID. It might have been the only gift that kid opened for Christmas. I realized my friends mostly filled their basket with toys and puzzles. My kid was going to open a gift full of SOAP. Yeah, maybe buying essentials would have helped their family out but no young kid wants soap for Christmas. 

I still feel kind of bad to this day. I at least hope that kid's mom appreciated it even if the kid didn't. In future years I did the shopping by myself, without my mom, and got the kids a lot more fun things

458,"Pretty much what the title says, but after a very difficult situation with my previous roommates, I stayed with my partner for a couple weeks while I was searching for another place to stay. I couldn’t find another affordable option or get out of my previous lease and we seemed to live together very well, so we had a discussion about living together in his studio apartment at least till the end of the semester, with me essentially paying the difference in utilities and a little more for the inconvenience and him paying the vast majority of rent. We decided that I would be responsible for the cleaning/upkeep of the apartment and cooking for both of us when I could, which was also my suggestion, but I moved in much sooner than I would usually even think of doing with a partner as anything seemed better than living with my previous roommates and continuing to pay their rent and utilities while I was drowning with work and university at the same time.

My boyfriend has always been very generous with me and everyone else he meets (which is something I admire about him greatly) however, he had told me (after the fact) that during a trip to visit his distant family, about 2-3 weeks after staying with him, he had installed a motion sensor camera by our shared bed so he knew if I was bringing anyone home without his knowledge/permission. Even though I felt violated, I still didn’t really have another option other than to continue staying with him.

Last week, I discovered that there was another camera (not at foot level, more torso) hidden in the apartment that I can’t remember him disclosing while he was away on another trip. I immediately disassembled it and laid it out on his side of the bed for him to find when he got home, but he was very calm upon finding it and said that it was installed at the same time as the other camera and was also motion sensor with a 30-day activation period. He said that he put it up in a place where it would not capture me undressed intentionally but would capture anyone going in and out of our only door, but we live in a studio and I wasn’t aware of it, so I’ve been walking around comfortably in states of undress that I definitely would not have had I known about the camera.

He said this was all a measure to protect himself against me possibly cheating on him, but that he didn’t think I actually would and just wanted to be safe. On one hand, I believe him because of what he’s told me has happened in past relationships of his, but on the other, I just feel very violated. I don’t know why he would have allowed me to live with him without knowing I would have enough basic respect as to not bring someone else into his home, even if it was a family member or friend, without his permission, let alone cheating in the bed we share. I’ve literally only brought my mother in to show her the apartment since moving in almost six months ago since we don’t even have a couch or living room area.

After discussing at the end of our semester, he wanted me to move out at the end of this month and to end our relationship afterwards because he thinks I was disloyal to him by continuing to talk to people I used to be romantically connected with, even when just saying hi in public places, as he thinks that if I were committed, I’d ignore them and/or just forego these spots in general, but most of the people I’ve had some sort of relationship with have mutual friends and it would literally be bad form in my eyes to not just say hello at the bare minimum to keep the peace.

Essentially, since finding out that my boyfriend installed motion sensor cameras without my knowledge or consent (even though I’ve been planning on moving out since our conversation at the beginning of the month) I’ve been struggling to “act normal” and cope with it. I still need to move out my personal possessions and finish the week and a half-or so left at my job, and I’ve been in a sort of “freeze” state where I do nothing except work and come home, then numb myself with alcohol or other distractions, and my boyfriend has taken notice and begun commenting on how unhealthy this is. I get it and I agree, but I feel like I am going insane.

Am I wrong morally for reacting like this? I really wish I wasn’t reacting in this way, but I don’t know what else to do other than move out right this second and go back to my family’s home; this would mean really screwing over my chances at the best letters of recommendation for my career that I’ve ever had, and I feel like I’ve been through much worse before.

Now he’s away for a few days again after I got a flat tire on the way to see my mother for Mother’s Day and he helped me change it to a spare; I got considerably more irritated than I usually would, and I did thank him multiple times and say my irritation wasn’t his fault, but I feel like he’s just putting off coming back because he’s repulsed by me.

Am I crazy for being unhinged at this point?? I’m really trying hard not to be, but I feel like no matter what I say or do, it doesn’t help me out in the long run.",
459,"this is a giant post of me complaining about many things. If that annoys you, please skip over it. I just need to vent.

one year ago today, I lost three friends. It feels like it’s only been a couple of days since I lost them. I haven’t made any more friends, though I did get a boyfriend. He’s amazing, but I’m not a pleasant person to be around. I talk about dying constantly. I hate my life and I feel like I was meant to live in the afterlife. My mom is horribly neglectful, emotionally abusive, and addicted to nearly every drug. I hate living with her. I’m going to college to get away from her and to be with my boyfriend, but I’m not excited about it. I dont know why.

I am also professionally diagnosed with DID. I never feel like myself. Two of my characters from a book I’m planning live inside my brain, telling me how much they hate me for being so incompetent and not making them “real.” I just physically can’t write right now, but they dont care. They want me to be famous and they cry about nobody knowing them. I feel like my life purpose isn’t finished unless I can get people to know them. I try to talk about them to everyone I know, but this is annoying to other people and I know it. I’m just so unpleasant and I hate everything about me. My book characters are the only people that sort of comfort me. I spend most of my money on commissions of them to keep them alive in my brain. Or I just draw them myself when I’m broke. But it’s so isolating. I want a real person. I want to feel like a real person. I feel kind of normal when I’m around my boyfriend, but not all the way.

I want to die so I can be with my characters. I feel so crazy saying it out loud. I don’t even know what I’m talking about anymore, I’m sorry. I tried to get treatment but me and my mom have crappy Medicaid. The world is against me. I hate my life.",
460,"I have always struggled with math. Ever since I was little I couldn’t divide, couldn’t count change, couldn’t count without my fingers, and I couldn’t understand or remember mathematical concepts. I’ve tried getting help for years, even asking my parents, but they always told me I just “don’t realize” how “good” I am at math. I am not good at math. Never have been, and I likely never will be. 

I get embarrassed doing math in front of others, and I would flat out refuse to participate in math class even at the cost of my grade or social standing. I burst into tears when I can’t understand a problem. I want so badly to be good at math. I excel in Language Arts, Biology, and plenty of other subjects but all of those skills are worthless if I can’t even pass a fucking Algebra class. 

The urge to end my life to escape my stupidity becomes even more intense. My family tends to value intellectualism over mental health, and I just can’t take it.

461,"I’ve never really put my life out there like this, but I’m at a crossroads and could really use some outside perspective.

I’m a young man in my early 20s, completely blind, and I’ve been working full-time for years in home care. Money’s always been tight. I’m behind on some debts—mostly government-related and a few personal ones—but I’m on payment plans and doing everything I can to get back on track. I’ve started trying to find a second job just to increase my income and build up savings. I don’t have much, but I’m grinding every day.

Recently, the woman I love had to move away due to life circumstances. We were living near each other before—this isn’t one of those “met online, never seen each other” situations. We’ve shared real space, real connection, and a deep emotional bond. She’s my peace. The distance has been hard, but the love is still there, and I’ve made up my mind: I want to move closer to her within the next 6–7 months.

But this move isn’t just for her. It’s for me. I want to finally have my own place, my own independence. I’ve spent years just surviving—barely getting by, stuck in patterns that never change. This is the first time I’ve had a vision for something better. I’ve started selling what I can, reaching out to benefit programs in the area I want to relocate to, and building a game plan. I know it won’t be easy, but I’m committed.

Here’s the thing:
A lot of people around me are telling me it’s not realistic. That seven months isn’t enough time. That I don’t have the money or stability to make such a big leap. That love isn’t enough to build a plan around. And that terrifies me. Because I’m trying so hard to do this the right way, but I still feel like I’m constantly falling short.

I’m not looking for pity. I’m just trying to figure out if I’m making a smart decision… or if I’m being driven by emotion more than logic. I feel like I’m doing everything I can, but what if I’m just setting myself up to crash?

If you’ve been through something similar—or if you just have a clear head and want to weigh in—I’d appreciate any honest advice or thoughts.

462,"I spotted some baby rabbits today in the hedge outside our front door at work today and was very happy! It’s spring, life is blooming and they were adorable, just hopping around and exploring a brand new world. My work day was off to a bad start, so it was a nice little moment of joy and peace in a chaotic day.

Later, I was in the back, chatting with a couple of my coworkers and I mentioned the bunnies and how happy it made me. Immediately, one of the two people started telling me all about all the dead rabbits he finds in job sites and trying to show me pictures of dead rabbits that he took, while joking  about how he would go catch the babies and cook them for his lunch break.

I wasn’t necessarily upset with the idea of dead rabbits, I get it, shit happens. I grew up in the mountains so it doesn’t really bother me. What bothered me was that I was experiencing happiness and he immediately tried to ruin it and upset me. I told him to knock it off and that I didn’t wanna hear it at the moment but he wouldn’t shut up. 

The other coworker though, literally yelled at him when he kept joking about eating the rabbits. He said “shut up and let her have her moment of joy dude!” Which I appreciated. 

I’m keeping an eye on the rabbits today though cause I don’t trust him to not do something to them just to spite me and the other guy…",

I just need to let this out because it really upset me and I still feel humiliated.

So, I was absent from school the day a quiz was given (I had a reason, but that’s beside the point). Today, when I came back, the teacher started handing back the quizzes to the students who took it. Then she turned to another student who also didn’t do the quiz and started talking to him really rudely in front of the whole class, saying things like, “Why didn’t you do it?” and “You’re doing it now, sir,” in a really disrespectful tone.

Then she turned to me and asked if I had done the quiz. I said, “I don’t think so.” She immediately changed her tone to something cold and dismissive. She held the paper out and started saying I had to do it, I froze for a moment, just watching her hold the paper toward me. I quietly asked if I could do it tomorrow, and she said, “It’s not your choice to pick the day you want.” Then she added, “Here, take it yourself,” instead of handing it to me respectfully.

What hurt me the most was what she said next: “Whether you were sick, had an appointment, or just didn’t feel like coming to school—it doesn’t matter. The class moves on. I’m not stopping because of you.”

I’ll be honest — I know I was careless and I admit my mistake. But I don’t think I deserved to be humiliated like that in front of the whole class. A teacher should speak to a student privately when something is wrong, not shame them publicly.

After that, I just felt small, embarrassed, and honestly scared to talk to her again. I know teachers have pressure, but basic respect should still be there.",
464,"Lately, I feel like I’m slipping deeper into a hole, and no one sees it. Yesterday started off badly  almost argued with my mom again, and honestly, that’s just our normal now. Every day feels like an argument. Even if I try to express how I feel or talk about school, she doesn’t want to listen or just gets passive-aggressive. My dad is different, but I’ve stopped talking to him about anything personal, especially my friendships, because they never last. Most of the time, I just shut down and don’t say how I really feel even though deep down, I wish I could.

I keep telling myself to leave it in God's hands, but I'm exhausted. I try to be part of conversations, to connect with people, and it never works. My birthday was one of the worst days. I felt ashamed, depressed, and completely alone. I don’t talk to anyone about how I really feel  because I literally have no one.

People constantly make fun of how I look  especially one person who always jokes about me in really inappropriate ways, like insulting me in another language  out of nowhere. It’s not funny. But when I bring it up, my mom tells me to ignore it, and my dad just says I should defend myself. But I don’t want to live like that. I don’t want to fight with people everyday and constanly getting targeted because im fun to mess around with.

Some days, I wonder if there’s any point in living. I feel so ugly. Even if I lost weight, I’d still feel this way. My eyes, my face… I hate it. I remember this one party in Germany where I wore a dress tried to feel pretty and some guys insulted me while complimenting my cousin like she was a goddess. Meanwhile, I felt like a black goblin standing next to her. I’ve carried that moment with me ever since. My confidence shattered. I haven’t felt beautiful  or even normal since.

I feel worse. I either feel like I’m on the verge of tears or just totally numb. I think about dying way more than I ever admit. I feel like my face is too much, my mouth too big, my voice too loud. I say too much, and then I hate myself for it. I get offended by others, but sometimes I’m just as cruel maybe because of the anger I hold inside. I don’t know. Maybe I really am just a bad person getting what I deserve.

Sometimes I feel like I’ve failed my parents too. All I do is complain, and I know they’re dealing with their own pain  but I’m so weak now. Today, I felt like I was going to cry because some girls belittled me over a tiny misunderstanding. It shouldn’t have hurt so much… but it did.

My friendships don’t last, mostly because I feel too ashamed to even go out with people. I think I’m too ugly to be seen in public. I remember one day when I had my makeup done and actually felt like it was going to be okay. But then, this guy asked for my friends’ Instagrams  looked at me, laughed, and called me disgusting. Even though my then  friends defended me, it crushed me. Again.

In every group of friends I’ve had, I’ve felt like the ugly pity friend. They make fun of me and say I look like a pitbull or a frog . I laugh it off  but it hurts so badly. And even when I speak up and say it’s not funny, I’m ignored. They never joke about each other’s looks only mine. If not me, it’s another Black girl they mock for being tired or looking “off.” It makes me sick. And sad. And so deeply alone.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know how to cope. I just needed to let this out because it’s eating me from the inside.

465,"This is a throwaway account. I’m not normally one to post stuff like this, but I need to let it out somewhere safe. I’m not sure where else to turn, and I need to protect my family’s safety.

Years ago my partner and I bought what was meant to be our starter home. It wasn’t perfect, but we had a plan: fix it up, sell it in a few years, and move somewhere better. But then the housing market crashed-literally overnight, our home dropped 70% off of the value we paid for it. We’ve been stuck in negative equity ever since.

At first, we held out hope. The houses nearby were rundown but eventually got bought up and renovated. We thought things were turning a corner. Then we learned those houses had become immigration holding properties. I’m not against immigration, but the people placed here clearly don’t want to be here, or dont have any respect for being here. They trash the area, break things for fun, and don’t care for their homes or surroundings.

Our street looks like something out of a warzone. We’ve had our car damaged multiple times. Our windows smashed. Kids toys taken and destroyed. We try to clean up, and within hours it’s worse than before. Every time we save a little money, we end up spending it on repairs. We’re working hard, both of us, and yet feel like we’re getting nowhere. Trapped in a never ending cycle.

I lie awake at night worrying about the safety of my two young daughters (7 and 3). I want to raise them somewhere safe, somewhere they can sleep without sirens and shouting and fires and broken glass outside. But we have no family to move in with. No one to help us get back on our feet. Just each other. And that should be enough, but sometimes, I feel like it’s not.

I’ve held onto hope for so long that I almost feel guilty for being tired of hoping. But I still do. I have to. For my girls. They deserve better. They are everything to me. I just want them to grow up somewhere they can play outside without fear.

We’ve done all the “right” things. We’ve reported the damage, the threats, the antisocial behaviour. We’ve logged every incident, contacted the police, the local council, even the immigration office. But nothing ever changes. The most we’re told is to stay indoors, keep our doors locked, and install CCTV, advice that makes us feel more like prisoners than homeowners. We’ve had men from these houses try to lure our little girls away with sweets, speaking in languages we don’t understand, and we’ve caught them spitting and shouting at us while we’re just trying to get to our car or walk the girls to school. We do our best to ignore it all and shield our daughters from it, but it’s draining. Most days, we escape to the woods, lakes, parks, just anywhere but home. That’s not how a family should have to live.

I want to be clear that I’m not against immigration. I can’t even begin to imagine what some of these people might have been through to end up here. I don’t blame them for seeking safety or a better life. But I do believe that placing them next to vulnerable families like mine when they have complex needs, without proper management or accountability, has created a dangerous and heartbreaking situation for everyone involved.

If you have read all the way to here, thanks for listening. That’s all I needed, really. Just to say it out loud somewhere. If you’ve been through something like this, or if you made it out of something like this, I’d love to hear your story. I need to believe that things can get better. Right now it's it feels like the light at the end of the tunnel is dimming fast.",
466,"Throw away account because I just want to rant this out. 
This was about 2 years ago and my ex (18M) and I (19F) had a very short lived relationship, about 4 months or so. You’ll see why. It was my first relationship and I had no idea what I was doing. I’m gonna write out some red flags he did in the relationship that I didn’t see at all until I broke up with him. 
At the beginning of the relationship, he made a rule of no one on one with the opposite gender. I was fine with it until 2 months later, he goes out on shopping dates with his “girl best friend”. I told him this was breaking the rule he created and it made me uncomfortable, and all he told me was “Rules change over time.” Btw, he was saying this while also telling me that I was “too kind” to guys and that they would fall for me if I was kind to them and “taught” me how to talk to guys that weren’t him. Another thing that really put me off guard was that this “girl best friend” look eerily similar to me. Same hair color and length, same glasses, same face shape, same interests, etc. It was a little creepy and off putting. He would make up excuses to hang out with her and not his guy friends like “Guys are too competitive.” And “I just like hanging around girls better.” And I’ll add one more thing he did, when I would come to him asking if he liked any of them or if he was emotionally attached to them, he would call me ridiculous and names that belittled my feelings and gaslighted me. He would not apologize until I would start crying and when I wiped away my tears he would look at me and say, “Are you even happy with me?” 
I have plenty more stories to tell about this guy and if you want some, I can provide them in the comments. Thanks for listening. ",
467,"The aim of life is not merely to **think**—  
But to **figure out** the best path forward.

Yet “the best” is never just **one** thing.  
This is both the brilliance and the burden of the mind.

It’s not our ability to think that makes us unique—  
It’s our ability to **question**.

From the beginning, it wasn’t intelligence that shaped our tools,  
But **necessity**—  
Fire, sticks, stones: all forged by survival.

We gathered,  
Formed tribes,  
Found identity in groups,  
Much like wolves in a pack or birds in a flock.

We weren’t entirely different—  
Until we discovered our **hands**.  
Ten fingers became ten tools.  
And those tools gave birth to **art**.

We painted cave walls—  
Not for glory,  
But to remember,  
To **survive**.

With tools came **tactics**,  
And with tactics came knowledge.  
We started to **understand nature**,  
And unknowingly,  
We began to **separate** from it.

We built shelters like birds build nests,  
Homes echoing nature’s blueprints—  
But also enclosing ourselves from the wild.

In these walls,  
We created a **meditative space**—  
A space to think.  
And in thinking,  
We often stumbled into **sorrow**.

Pick any individual today—  
He’s either unaware,  
Or too afraid to ask the real questions.  
Peel the surface,  
And he may snap,  
Denying the very act of thinking  
As if thought itself were madness.

So we gather fragments of that madness,  
Crafting shields of philosophy,  
Like crocodile skin—  
Thick, hardened,  
A defense against life’s uncertainty.

And in doing so,  
We embrace a kind of **false happiness**—  
A kindergarten illusion.  
We separate further from nature,  
Thinking we’re **escaping suffering**,  
When in fact,  
We’re just transforming it.

Yet… we change.  
Not just in form,  
But **inwardly**.

We drift between **awareness** and **unawareness**,  
A paradoxical space.  
We **sense** something greater—  
But we cannot name it.

Still… there are **patterns**.

Ignore them,  
And you live.

See them,  
And you may **lose yourself** to a beautiful, terrifying madness.

Because **nature is mad**—  
Wild. Chaotic. Sacred.

And we—  
We are **mad in that madness**.",
468,"Throwaway account, since I don't want it to be visible on my account.

I am currently living in Warsaw, and today I visited the city center, because I wanted to look up GamesWorkshop site. When I was leaving the shop, I was stopped by a guy speaking broken English. 

He told me he is looking for an ATM of a specific bank. It has to be this one, because he needs to deposit money and that can only be done with the ATM of the same bank his account is opened in. His gps app didn't work well, so he asked for my help. 

I googled the nearest ATM and it was like ten minutes away. I thought that leading him there would be easier than trying to explain the way, since both of our English wasn't the best. And since I had nothing better to do, I decided to do it. You know, just a nice thing for a fellow human...

As we were walking, he stroke up a conversation. Apparently, he is from Germany. He is in Warsaw doing business. He told me that he has a company operating in Germany, but he is registering the workers in Poland, because our taxes are cheaper.

A little bit of tax evasion never hurt anyone, so I am still talking. I ask him about what's the business about. 

He told me he is ""Sending women to Dubai, to be models and stuff"" and that it's better than work, because he ""gets money and doesn't need to do anything"". Now the red lights go on in my head.

I think he noticed that, because at this point, the bank with ATM was in our sight, he quickly said he can go alone now, and walked away from me.

I feel conflicted. I feel like I helped a human trafficker, but I don't have any real evidence? I was shocked after he told me this, and didn't think about calling the police until like half an hour later, but then again what would they even do, without any real evidence? 

Now I feel like I took part in ruining innocent people lives, and all I wanted to do is help someone. I guess the moral of the story is never help a stranger. ",
469,"I (18F) am talking to and have been talking to this guy (18M) (he’s graduating before me) for around three months, I wasn’t looking for anything serious and I told him that in the beginning of us talking that we would just be FB till he leaves for college. He leaves for college in about 3 months and we planned on stopping our “friendship” but now I want to end it even earlier after what happened yesterday. I was at work texting him when we started joking about Kinks, he was making fun of mine and that he said “mines weird you’ll bully me for it” i proceeded to ask him what it was cause like I had to know yk! And he told me flat out that he is into blood and period blood. I will not judge anyone’s kink cause yk everyone has something they like, but I didn’t judge him but now I feel really weird talking to him and stuff and I almost want to end our situationship earlier than planned, but I feel horrible and I have no idea what to do! I’m planning on either just ghosting him after graduation and blocking him straight up and just leaving it in the past (but that’s so horrible and I legit think he would show up at my house) my other idea is to tell him that I think we should just stop seeing each other in general because I’m getting like “too attached” or something like that in a few weeks before he goes on his trip with his friends and I won’t have to see him.

470,"Just putting some feelers out.

I’ve recently launched a YouTube channel called Journey of Self, where I’ll be documenting my path toward becoming a more spiritually aware human. My goal is to explore life’s big questions — why we’re here, where we go, and how different people interpret our existence — by speaking with people from all walks of life.

I’ve developed a clear direction for the channel, with a name, logo, and a lineup of video ideas. One major part of it involves interviewing people who’ve had powerful spiritual experiences — near-death experiences, memories of past lives, or any profound insights from religious or paranormal encounters.

If you’ve ever had a spiritual awakening, a near-death experience, a memory you can’t explain, or you just have a perspective you’d like to share, I’d love to hear from you. You don’t need to be an expert — just open to a conversation (which would take place over video call or in-person if you’re based near to me in Scotland).

Feel free to drop me a message if you’re interested in chatting or being part of an upcoming episode. Thank you guys❤️🥰.",
471,"This was basically my ex and me trying to get back together or atleast seeing if we can get back together. He hooked up with a friend of his last October while we were physically active. So I had an issue with that and kind of gave him an ultimatum that we need to work things out this year because I can't be just another option anymore. We agreed to be exclusive from February and I could see a big change between us (good change like we almost became like a couple just not official). Fast forward to today, recently he brought up this friend of his in a discussion(a conversation they had) . So I got a weird ick. I do know his phone passwords and went through WhatsApp messages. Well, what I saw is they dont really talk ""regularly"" but sure enough there was a sexual meme sent by her and he replied with ""would want another go xD"". 
I tried to stay calm and I confronted him about this. Like is he attracted to her still? Does he want her over me or like what the heck does he want? He said he meant it as just a joke but he agrees that it was inappropriate. Now I would have just taken it as a one time thing, it wasn't like a huge deal breaker to me. Until I asked him some more questions, and he said he wants to have some fun and isn't fully committed to me. And he broke our exclusivity because he felt he can slip up if he's drunk if he meets her even as a friend. That she brings out the fun side of him.
I'm honestly really confused. Like is this manipulative? I have told him a dozen times why I wanted to be exclusive and he's saying things like I'm sorry I made a mistake to agree to this at first. Also he said it won't bother him if I hookup with someone else. I just don't know where we stand anymore. I feel like this will just keep continuing. Leaving this and moving on is actually like my last option. I want to know if this is like a red flag for our future if we do have one.",

473,"I’m the maid of honor in my friend’s wedding this weekend. We’ve been close since college and always had a great time together. Over the past year and a half, she’s become deeply religious (Christianity specifically) and has cut out things like weed, abstaining from sex before marriage even tho her and the fiancé have already done so prior to this religious shift—not out of necessity, just as part of her spiritual shift. I fully respect anyone’s personal path as long as it’s not being projected onto others.

She and her fiancé got engaged in January(2025), booked their venue in November (2024), and asked us all to be in the wedding in February—very last-minute. Many of us are in our early 20s, juggling jobs, PTO, and tight budgets, so it’s been a lot. It’s also clear the rushed timeline was due to religious reasons, something she openly shared with me.

I planned her whole bachelorette trip which took place the first weekend of May, and on Friday night after going out, a friend and I took a small 🍄 microdose at the Airbnb—nothing crazy. She walked in and, when we offered her some out of courtesy, she said, “No, I’ve been saved by Jesus,” then looked me dead in the eyes and said, “[My name], I just think you need to be saved by Jesus.”

I replied, “Saved from what? I live a great life. I’m happy.” And she said, “Why does it sound like you’re trying to convince me of that?” That moment really struck me—it felt dismissive, like she was trying to undermine my reality and plant doubt about my own well-being.

She then told me she had a dream about me rejecting Jesus and that her family prays for me. I was raised Catholic and know that can be well-meaning, but in this context, it felt patronizing. She asked, “If God came tomorrow, what do you think would happen to you?” I said, “I think I’m a good person—what do you think would happen to me?” and she just replied, “That’s for God to decide.”

It was condescending, judgmental, and honestly, really manipulative. I felt ganged up on in a moment where I was just trying to relax. The friend I was with (also raised Catholic) backed me up, but I was left with serious anxiety. This isn’t the friend I’ve known for years. I can’t stop replaying the moment, and it’s heartbreaking to feel judged like that by someone who asked me to stand beside her on one of the biggest days of her life.

I’ll show up for the wedding, but after that, I don’t know how I can stay close with someone who thinks I need to be “saved.” It’s really shaken me.",
474,"Before I start off, I want to clear out that this was a translation from my initial post that's in my native language, so if there's any confusion, please don't hesistate to address it in the comments.

For context, we have a 6-year age gap (I’m 16, turning 17 this year), and her parents are fairly well-off since they both work abroad, so she’s been a bit spoiled since she was little. I’m talking, her having gone through tablets, iPads and iPhones before she even turned 10. She gets whatever she wants with one look. She also used to hit me a lot when we were younger, like when I was 10 and she was 4. The adults around would just always excuse her behavior off with, “She’s just a kid,” and stuff like that.

Fast forward, now that she’s 11—she still hits me, and even when it seems like she’s “just playing,” it really hurts. And it’s not just physical—it’s verbal, too. For example, if I do something as simple as kill or ruin her vibe, like one time when she said, “Did you know _ dies in Squid Game?” And when I tell her, “Yeah, I already know that”, she’ll say stuff like, “I hate you, that’s why no one likes you,” or (she says this mostly on random times, too), “I hate you, I hope you kill yourself.” and such phrases, (""I hope you die"") The “I hate you” parts, I can still laugh off since that’s kind of within my humor zone, but honestly, she gets super ""abusive"", idk if it's considered abuse in that extend if it's a child doing it to another.

One time she kept hitting me and I kept raising my voice saying “Dude, stop,” over and over. Instead of backing off, she doubled down, grabbed a neck pillow, and started using that to hit me. The pillow even got ruined—that’s the only time she stopped. She has a charm dangling from her phone like the ones you buy from little local market stalls, and she used that to whip me with too—it hurt a lot especially with the compact plastic beads.

There was even a time when I was about 8 years old and my dad let me borrow his phone. I brought it home, went in her room, and she started throwing it around like crazy. around the walls the ceiling, it's as if she's treating it like a bouncy ball. I was literally crying—I just got on level 32 on Clumsy Ninja back then lol. And that’s just a fraction of the many times she’s acted psychotically scary.

Our other close cousins don’t live with us anymore, but they used to, so they know how she is. Now, if my s/o makes a gesture of lifting a hand near me, I flinch immediately. I try to joke about it so he doesn’t worry. He only knows I used to get hit as a kid, but he doesn’t know how bad it really was.

I still hang out with her a lot because I don’t really have anyone else to spend time with here at home—especially now during summer vacation, so she’s the closest thing I have to someone my age who I can vibe with. I flinch every time she lifts her hand, even if she’s joking around and trying to make me react on purpose.

I’m confessing it here on reddit because I feel like there’s nothing I can really do. I think her mom helps my mom out financially sometimes because we’re not as fortunate in terms of finance, so whenever I try to tell my mom about what’s happening, she just turns a blind eye.",
475,"
I (21F) have two best friends, Rachel (21F) and Lauren (23F). I met them separately, but after I introduced them to each other last year, we became a close trio. Things were great until earlier this year, when we had a fight, mainly about issues I was having with my boyfriend. They both stopped talking to me for a month and kind of ganged up on me. It was eventually resolved, but our dynamic never fully recovered.

Lately, I’ve been feeling low-key excluded and disrespected. Rachel especially pressures me to stay out longer or hang out even when I’ve clearly said I want to go home. They often take it personally if I cancel or say I’m not up for it. I don’t think they mean to be harmful, but it makes me feel like my boundaries aren’t respected.

Last night, one of them texted our group chat asking if we were free. I replied late (I’d forgotten to answer and wasn’t sure I felt like going out). Later, they texted again with concrete plans they had clearly made together already. I said “maybe I’ll join later,” and then both of them called me, first one, then the other, even though they were clearly together. It felt performative, like they were trying to seem like they cared individually, but had already moved on without me.

I didn’t answer because I was having dinner with my boyfriend. I replied later, and they just sent a photo of them painting together. I didn’t respond, fell asleep, and ended up just spending the evening with my boyfriend. It wasn’t anything explicitly mean, but it still felt off, like I was quietly excluded.

This isn’t new either. Last weekend, when we hung out, they kept teasing me, little digs disguised as jokes that just made me feel dumb. It’s not friendly teasing; it feels like I’m being made fun of. They also share a cultural bond (they’re both Filipino), and while I respect that, it sometimes makes me feel like an outsider in our group of three.

I also feel pressured to hang out more than I want to. I live with my boyfriend now, I’m between jobs, caring for my cats (one was very sick recently), and handling real adult responsibilities. When we first got close, I had way more time and fewer obligations. My life’s different now, and I’ve matured a lot,I just don’t want to hang out every day or spend money constantly.

But even when I want to say no, I hesitate or wait till the last minute to cancel because I’m scared of how they’ll react. I know that makes things worse, but I don’t feel safe being honest with them about my needs. I’m constantly worried they’ll be annoyed or judge me, and I end up walking on eggshells.

I know I should talk to them directly, but right now, it feels easier to take space. I still care about them, but I’m tired of feeling pressure, guilt, and exclusion.
I am ashamed to admit it but that month of not talking to them was so healing for me and I felt much better and free, no pressure or anxiety about this friendship. ",
476,"My mom passed away a year ago from cancer. I am not living, just going through the motions. She was the love of my life and no child should lose their mother at 22. I miss her more than I can articulate.

Last night my sister shared a video of my mother and me. It was right after her diagnosis. She's still plump and ""healthy"", the cancer and chemo hadn't wrecked her body yet. She's cuddling me and telling me its going to be ok. Then right before the video ends she says ""come, let me braid your hair"". I had very long, thick hair during that time and my mom would braid it every night. I cut it all off soon after her diagnosis. haven't heard her saying that in so long. The tone, the inflection, her trying to cheer me up, trying to be brave and strong and making things seem normal to console her child...seeing all of that just fucked me up so bad.

Until now, after receiving some help from someone she managed to land a very low paying job in my city (my city is very expensive to live in). She will be travelling in 15days and staying with me.
I have informed her about setting some ground rules and how the responsibilities will be divided. But for some reason my parents and my sister can't stop yelling at me and constantly telling me that I am making a bad decision and I should just make up some excuse if not now then maybe after a month because she will use me again.
I earn fairly well as compared to my age now, but that does not mean I will bear her expenses i have made that clear.
Am I doing something wrong? I feel so stuck in this; I don't wanna ruin my friendship but I am tired of constantly hearing something from my parents.
Any suggestions are welcomed.

TLDR: Parents disapprove my 13years long best friend to stay at place even though I informed that I won't be helping her financially for everything.",
479,"Rant about men because lord knows I can’t date a woman for whatever reason. They never fucking let me try. Every time I spend too much time with a man I’m in sweatpants, my skin looks like shit, and my hair. Their mustiness rubs off on me. Even the ones who seem slightly put together. They’re like leave your hair a mess and remove your makeup and grow out your hair, I like it better that way. And then I look at myself and I get pissed off. Because there’s so much artistry to style and getting ready and aiming for perfection. It’s like my beauty points get reduced ten fold because they love the feeling of destruction. They love fucking your makeup up and being like yeah I love it when you look absolutely homeless. This isn’t love, this is a lack of appreciation for the effort I put to make things tie together. This guy is like so what “do you want me to agree with your insecurities”? No I want you to see my vision and let me fucking express myself jesus christ.",
480,"I realize that life has ups and downs but I feel like it all has been too much lately. I’m at a point where I don’t want to live but I don’t necessarily want to die either. Money is always a struggle, moving to a new area is terrifying. And now I am making myself go back to school on top of it. I have a mom who I love dearly but I feel like I need to walk on eggshells with and do everything I can to support her. I have an amazing fiance but he has an upbringing that made him emotional stunted when shit hits the fan and he can be quite stoic in the moment. They are the only 2 people I am close to in this world. I even feel guilt being depressed about life because I have them. I’m only 23 and I feel like small things or tasks are simply out of reach. But I am trying to keep going, I am trying to go back to school to get a better paying job so I can support myself and the ones I love. I WANT to keep fighting, I want to keep going but not for myself. For the ones around me. And I am slowly starting to realize that I don’t have much more in me to keep going. I only have 2 years left of school but I feel like dropping out all the time. Finding a new living situation is also frustrating because things keep falling through the cracks and I feel like I’m running out of time. I feel like no matter what we do we don’t have a light at the end of the tunnel. I don’t know where life will take me anymore and I don’t have any signs that are letting me know that I’m going in the right direction. These past few months have been a constant cycle of 1 step forward and 2 steps back. I feel like I need to keep my shot together so others around me don’t crumble and I’m cracking through the pressure. I tell myself “what’s the point anymore?” I am either depressed or anxious and feel like everything is out of my control. I don’t want to feel that anymore, I don’t want to feel ANYTHING anymore. I want to crawl in bed and sleep for 1000 years and wake up a new person. I want to scream for help but I bottle it up. I’m sick of having panic attacks on the bathroom floor. I’m sick of feeling so stressed I vomit. I’m sick of crying myself to sleep. What do I do? How can help others and take care of myself? I feel like so much is out of my control. I just want someone to hold me and tell me everything will be okay.

Thank for reading, I realize I was a little all over the place with my rant. I just wanted to let it out and shout into the void so I’m not holding inside anymore. ",
481,"I just had a very hard conversation with some of my friends and I should feel bad about how callous I was but I’m not 

I had a heart attack in mid March from stress and the fact that part of an earlier heart surgery when I was young went wrong

My friends heard what happened but I spent a week and 1/2 by myself and not one of them reached out to check on me, none of them came by, none of them even sent a text

I’ve been home waiting for my surgery date and the worlds been getting crazier

1 friend just had a massive break up that devastated them

1 just got fired from her job 

And the final just lost her mother

And they all reached out to me for comfort and I just ignored them

They came over to try to talk but I told them we have nothing to talk about, I don’t want to compare tragedies but if my coworkers didn’t get me to the ER when they did I wouldn’t have even been at my house to listen to their complaints about me being a bad friend

I was literally close to death in March and not one of them cared enough to check up on me

I have always been the person who checked up on people and made sure everyone didn’t have to deal with things along but when I needed them they abandoned me

So I told them I simply don’t care anymore, I can’t, I need to keep my stress low, I can’t travel to magically fix their problems anymore

And I don’t know it sounds cruel but if the situations were reversed they wouldn’t even acknowledge what I was going through.

Like my brother was on a tour out of state but he and his band literally traveled 6 1/2 hours just to see if I was alright 

But my 3 “best friends” nah nothing

482,"I got my first job delivering news papers at age 10 and kept it for 2 years. Then I babysat full time for 3 years. At 15 I begun working at McDonalds full time for nine years. When I was 22 I went to college and studies addictions counselling and earned a 96 academic average then went to university for 6 years. Recently I was diagnosed with a new disability which is a brain disease and I had to become homeless. Throughout my childhood, teenage years and young adulthood my Father has never supported me much at all. When I asked to live with him due to the new brain disease and me not being able to work on a short notice he said no and firmly told me he didn’t want to support me and demanded me to work to support myself even though I am 100% not able to do it. 

My Father is very well off and retired and has a lot to offer. He just sold his house for 900 thousand $ which was paid off and all of that money went into the bank and not towards the other houses. He bought a new one for 500 thousand dollars and didn’t need to get a mortgage. He has a brand new cottage on the beach. He has 3 cars but it used to be 6. 2 motor bikes, a four wheeler, a side by side, a snow mobile, a boat, 2 huge garages and bunch of tools. 

He simply does have the time and resources to help me out during the worst time of my life. I understand him wanting me to have a good work ethic and wanting me to be independent but this has persisted since age 10. I begged him to support me because I wasn’t able at the end of it and he still refused which I think is selfish. He refused until I had a near lethal drug overdose which was a suicide attempt due to the homelessness and lack of support in my life. I only needed his support for a few months until I was able to support myself again with my brain disease. At the end he finally allowed me to stay with him but was very negative about it. 

What’s your opinion on what’s going on here? 

Am I being too independent?
Am I working too hard?
Should I be asking for support? 
Should he be helping more when he has the time and resources to do so? 
Is a temporary disability like a brain disease a good reason for parents to step in and help their young adult kids? ",

484,"*This is gonna be a long post, so buckle your seat belts and get ready for a wild ride:*

At the end of 2020, my friend worked for a property management company and did tours for the apartments etc. Well, there was apparently an apartment that had had fleas and they had done a tour there. Once they learned of this whole flea thing, they immediately were convinced that they had contracted fleas (they do not own pets as they are allergic to pet dander). Fast forward, they ended up getting fired from the job for other reasons.  
Once this happened, they obsessively sprayed their apartment with the pest control substances, and got monthly (sometimes multiple times a month) pest control to come in and spray their apartment. EVEN when pest control saw no signs of fleas, they were not convinced that this was true. Of course, at first, I was supportive and believed them because, yeah, it's a weird/rare occurrence, but fleas can bite humans and get in their hair.

However, it never stopped. They complained about their skin being severely itchy all the time, complained how it was sometimes painful because of how much they scratched. It ended up getting to the point where they were not only routinely spraying, but constantly sanitizing and cleaning the floors/counters every day (goals, honestly, tho). Almost a year into this, they started wrapping their hair in plastic bags, and EVERYTHING (clothes, blankets, stuffed animals) had to be put in garbage bags, DOUBLE bagged, and THEN put into a storage container for them to either be ""quarantined"" or ""protected"" from the bug infestation. They would also say how they have bumps all over their skin, but I could never see any actually bumps (besides maybe an occasionally pimple or zit).

This eventually got to a point where no one was allowed in certain areas of the house, no one could sit on the floor, and if anything touched the floor, it had to be tossed immediately.

Now, my friend has had dysthymia and pretty severe generalized anxiety. At this point, I'm thinking they have also developed OCD. So, I started to do a bunch of research and read books about this condition, and how to best support someone you care about who is struggling with the disorder. The more I read, the more I started to think: maybe their mental health has gotten to such a severe state that it has caused them to manifest all of this into a type of psychosis: the bugs were never real and they are itching and paranoid because they have severe anxiety and OCD.

Then, it got even worse. They also started to believe that they were infecting other people AND animals with this. Almost as if they were spreading a contagious disease. Anywhere they went, immediately if they saw someone scratch something, BOOM!!! That was evidence that they had infected that person with their bugs.

For the first couple of years, this was really difficult to deal with in our friendship and their other relationships. It not only made me sad to see them become this way, but it was incredibly frustrating when no matter what I said or did, they did not believe me. I tried to be supportive as I could, but at times I did fall short because it was so overwhelming. But, I just tried to remember that if that's how I was feeling, I know that they are feeling 1000000000 times worse.

Anyways, it's almost five years into this and nothing has changed. Yes, they did go to the dermatologist, but they did not feel seen or heard, and thought the plan that the dermatologist had put into place was useless.  
They periodically will ask me that if they paid for pest control to come out and test for bugs if I would believe them. But I can't help but think: you didn't believe pest control or the dermatologist...and of course - I have ALWAYS believe professionals and the evidence they provide. And sometimes, it's like - why would I willfully live in a flea infested apartment? I have two cats. I know what fleas look like. I take them to the vet - the vet would have told me if they had fleas.

I dunno - I just am getting to the point where I am deeply concerned for their wellbeing and their future and I am at a loss.

**TLDR; My friend suffers from depression, anxiety, and OCD and has believed for 5 years that she is infested with bugs and is spreading it to everyone she is in contact with.**",
485,Does anyone on here live with their parents due to homelessness? I have been living with my parents and I’m grateful for their support. That being said there is a lot of relationship issues that will not be solved overnight in family therapy and will need time to workout. My step Mother always brings up the past to throw in my face. She also constantly invalidates my experience to maximize her own. I know these are not issues that can be solved quickly and it’s best to just say nothing for right now until it can be brought up in family therapy. Does anyone else live with their parents and deal with similar things? Thanks. ,
486,"I haven't been much of a successful guy in terms of relationships. Trying to keep one seems nearly impossible to me. 4 of the 5 girlfriends that I have had in my entire cheated on me. Last one got engaged to some other guy. In every relationship, I have felt the lack of yearning from my partners like almost none of the partners ever wanted me or were excited to have me. They were very much okay even if I was unavailable at times and couldn't be bothered with my absence. I know that I am not an interesting person but I do try to live up to the expectations of my partners - giving them space when they need, giving them my time when they need to talk, give them gifts, celebrate special occassions together etc etc. But, at the end of the day, they do get bored. 

I recently got on some online dating apps and I met a certain someone. We talked and I felt like she was reciprocating my energy as well. But, that was too non-linear like sometimes I felt like she really enjoyed talking with me and sometimes I felt like I was bothering her like crazy...I don't know when to give space and when to talk. Fast forward, we went on a date and I bought her flowers and chocolates, particularly the ones that she liked. We really clicked during the conversation (or so I feel). But, once I returned, this dreaded feeling took over that ultimately she is going to get bored as well. She did say that the flowers were a sweet gesture but nothing more. I could not feel any hint of excitement from her. There was hardly any eargerness to continue the conversation. No, she did not go for the food or anything, she was adamant about paying for the food and I had to stop her, I asked for the date so letting her pay would not have been a nice gesture ig. 

I really want the kind of love that yearns for me as well...someone who is equally excited to talk with me, someone who gets upset with my absence as well....I really wanted this date to develop into something real cause I really liked her as a person sharing similar vibes. But, Ig that is just not possible for me. ",
487,"There is this guy that everyone it seems like absolutely everyone dislikes. They have insight into this persons private life and I have gotten access to all of this. It’s honestly out of this world. I didn’t know that driving someone crazy was this much fun. It’s completely justified before anybody here starts getting all holier than thou. This person absolutely deserves it. They’re insane. Everyone does it to him,  he either pretends he doesn’t know or he just stupid. I don’t know how I feel about doing the things that others are doing or going to the extent that some do. Saying things to get a rise or to watch them get all confused is already to much for me. It’s little things but we all do it to them. We’ll text each other and pass along the info. Like he’s on his way to Walmart to buy toilet paper.  A group of us will go to Walmart and buy his favorite brand, we make sure not one is left. Or we’ll send each other messages with conversation points from the previous person that spoke with him. With these we let him know that we all talk and he can’t play us. This person deserves it you should see what people say about him and what he’s done. I’m constantly being reminded not to fall for his act that he’s evil and crazy inside. honestly better him than me. I’d rather help drive him crazy than be the one they’re doing it to, am I right or what. Anyways the craziest part is when we get information about things he’s done in his house when no one is around. Because that really messes with him we get to watch him throw a wacko(there’s always someone filming him with their phone or recording conversations on live) like he’s on drugs screaming that someone is watching him. Or whom ever is in contact with him that day will throw in a word like curtain and the whole day whomever gets in contact with him will come up with different ways to use curtain. Everyone is always constantly following him. Have you ever watched that jimmy Carrey movie where he’s on a show but he doesn’t know it. This is it. We know he likes watching those documentaries of crazy people that kill murder and child abuse. So today we all talked about it. I mean everyone that came in contact with him talked about it. There was a couple that passed him in the store talking about it. The people at the register talked about it. It was hilarious at the time. Like I know everyone says he deserves it and we’re doing it so he’ll learn. But I’m starting to worry about how they’re getting their information. I’m regretting being apart of this. But I don’t know how to get out. So many people do it and they have evidence so you end up going along with it. But isn’t there a difference between exposing someone and harassing someone with what feels like hateful acts?",
488,"I currently live with someone who I was in a situationship with. We agreed to keep being friends but honestly it's just painful to keep them in my life. I feel disgusted that I allowed myself to fall for someone so bad I destroyed my life but hete I am.

I don't know if I should just grey rock them till I can find someone to take over the lease? Or be genuine friends? Half vent half I don't know how to go about this. Deleted last one because I forgot to add this context.


I feel so stupid for liking someone for so long, someone who never liked me the way I liked them. Maybe for a little, but almost all of it has just been a friends with benefits in their minds in all the actions they have done. They said they liked me, and I believed them. I told them I didn't want to do anything sexual unless they also had romantic feelings. I feel so stupid and blind, and I ruined so much of my life for someone who couldn't even honor this one thing I asked. I've destroyed so many of my friendships over them, I changed my life for them, I let my grades fall because of how affected I was, I gave so much of my self for over a year that I can't get back for someone who obviously isn't a good person and now I fear I've adopted dome of their gross morals.



I hate that I kept liking them even though deep down I knew, and I hate that even now I care, and I want them to have second thoughts and say they want something.


I'm so angry both at myself and them.


I hate that they have made me feel safe, and cared for, and like I want to spend my life with this person who gave me so much security and a space to get to know myself. I hate that I can't look back at that without a knot developing in my throat, without thinking how dumb I am for believing any of it. I hate the fact that I'm not meant to them. I was shaking last night. I'm not sure if it was from the anger, or anxiety, or just the pit developing in my stomach as they forgave me for not being clear on wanting something romantic. I'm sorry, you said you didn't want that, so I kinda just followed suit???? Even though I told them multiple times over the year that I wanted something romantic???



I know I should go for a walk, or maybe go punch a punching bag, but I'm just so furious, I'm so disgusted that they're still talking to me as if any of what has happened was fine, as if I haven't bawled my eyes out multiple times. I hate the fact that I kept believing the fact that they liked me, and every time I would believe them as they hugged me or ran their fingers through my hair. I feel like such a dummy.


I'm so tired of it all. I'm just done. I just can't anymore. I'm disgusted.

Honestly it sounds like so cliche, I'm laughing at myself admitting this. I am a 19 year old female and I'm still inlove with my 20 year old guy friend from when I was young. I don't really have contact with him anymore, still my heart feels funny when there is a chance of seeing him. And when I see him I don't even know how to describe that feeling. 

No clue if id still feel the same if i didn't go thru what I did. I was bullied and abused as a kid and had very little savety. Moved out at 16 after a suicide attempt. Had to beg, cry and threaten to harm myself just for someone to just try to help. It was horrible. I recently stopped talking to my dad because he's just not a person I can safely be around. Im in a way better place now, happy and save living on my own.

He is the kindest person I've met. He had a serious accident a bit ago protecting a friend of his which speaks volumes abt him. He works with animals and is incredibly dedicated. Honestly, there is just something in his eyes that can make any girl swoon. My mom knew Abt my crush when I was young, recently we've had some light contact with him and my mom kept saying ""he is really handsome"", ""he's a catch, kind boy, very handsome and good parents"" (we where joking around Abt me missing my shot with someone rich and that I could still knock on his door so it wasn't Abt him at all). And I just kept silent listening to her being like 'i knew that when I first met him when I was like a few days old'. 

Idk what to do, or if I want to do anything. I'm seriously not interested in anyone else and I'm fine being alone. I had relationships in the past but they tended to be very toxic and I think that might be because of him partly. I knew my first love was too perfect so when I didn't feel the same for others I'd just talk it up to it being normal or smth. I just always felt so detached to anyone else in a sense. 

Anyway, life is good. Got a cute dog, a nice place to live, good study, grades ect. I'm honestly happy, just not content i guess? Still got far to go and I am just carving my future without being ungrateful for where I am now. I'll see how or if I ever will be with him again.",

So yeah… I’m kinda obsessed with kissing. Like, kissing does something to me that I can’t explain. My whole body reacts. I literally get soaked from the way someone kisses me. And if we’re kissing during sex? I fall so hard in that moment it’s not even funny.

Oral too. Giving it, getting it Idon’t see it as some taboo thing. I like being close. I like feeling wanted. That kind of intimacy just hits different. After my second boyfriend (the last time I actually cared), I decided to stop getting emotional about it and just have fun.

So yeah, I started going out. Hooking up. Trying different types of guys. Sometimes one in a night. Now, multiple. I liked exploring. I liked being desired. I didn’t want to be tied down. I wasn’t ashamed of any of it. I actually felt free.

But then came the whispers.

Apparently if you kiss a few guys and go with what felt good to me at a party, I'm now the “Sl*tty Snow White”
Even girls I thought were cool started calling me “Try All Girl.”

At first I laughed it off. I really did. Like whatever, you’re just mad you’re not having fun like me. But lately, it’s been sticking to me. It’s in the way people look at me, the way guys talk to me, or about me. Even when I’m doing nothing, I feel watched. Judged.

I didn’t regret anything before. I still don’t, not really. But now I’m just tired. Like people only see me as the girl who’s “easy” or “down for anything.” I’m not ashamed of my body or my choices but I’m starting to feel like I can’t just be without everyone turning it into a story.

I guess I’m just wondering… why is it always the girl who gets labeled?",

493,"tw sexual assault, emotional manipulation, suicide attempt mentions

A few years ago, I was sexually assaulted by a close friend of over 10 years. It was during a group trip to a city that we did when we could. The entire group was compromised of us friends who had known each other for at least 8 years, most of us more. After it happened, it came out that two in the group were aware of this perp's predatory behaviours beforehand (completely hidden from me, we were now long distance friends due to uni and adulthood), had caught them almost doing it to another woman, and had been convinced by the perp to cover it up. The trips were a result of my ideas and planning, so it ended up feeling like I had planned my own assault. I kicked the perp and the two enablers out of my life. The group fell apart. 

Eventually, it left me and four others. One of them, a guy I'll call Bob (not real name), is someone I actually didn't talk to that much in the group. But he strongly defended me against the perps and enablers when the blame was pushed onto me. Out of the four friends left from that group, he was the strongest defender by far. (The other three did but not as much due to mental health, they blamed themselves for what happened). With him being the most outspoken, we ended up talking to each other a lot about what happened, and he helped me process a lot of it, and I helped him process it too; it was a safe space for us both. It wasn't just me and him, a third person N was in the group and spoke a lot in it too. It was definitely skewed towards helping me though. Bob helped me get through my own self-blaming thoughts, the anger that not one but three of my friends had betrayed me, that I felt like I couldn't trust anyone, etc. For the record, there were also two other guys in the GC from the previous group, but they're very quiet people.

Us three spoke often throughout the day (he was unemployed, N and I had discord on our work laptops). He even offered to be there when I reported it to the police. I couldn't be more grateful if I tried. I probably leant on him too hard in retrospect. I did go to therapy but I guess I needed someone who knew everyone there. It wasn't just me processing everything though, we still spoke and hung out as normal friends, or as much as I could take. I didn't think any of it was toxic at the time. I organized game nights twice a week with the entire five of us too.

A year later, our trio friendship was very strong. Although I had moments still of really struggling, I was doing better mentally. I started to realise there was a problem during a trip with another group of friends. I was abroad for ten days with a huge timezone gap, visiting a friend I hadn't seen in a year. Bob absolutely bombarded me.

He sent me over 50 messages over three platforms a day minimum. Not in the gc but 1 to 1. I barely responded - I wasn't going to have my head in my phone during a trip of a lifetime, and besides, the timezones meant that I was waking up to a whole bunch of these messages. I responded once or twice when they came through when we were both awake, but then I woke up to so many that I became overwhelmed. I wasn't even online and eventually most of them were left on read... And then when I came back, I really struggled with the jetlag, and the same happened.

I didn't mention it after my jet lag as I just wanted everything to be normal so I tried talking in the GC as normal. At this point Bob admitted that he struggled greatly during my trip because he used to spend all his time talking to my assaulter and one of the enablers, but after he assaulted me, he kicked those two out of his life. I had filled the gap (but not immediately, I isolated myself from the world for a month after I got assaulted). He said he had ""so much social energy"" and needed to talk to someone ""all the time."" I knew I was his only friendship group whilst I had others, but I didn't know that hurt him so bad.

I explained that I felt very overwhelmed at all his messages, and that I didn't think it was healthy for him to talk to someone every second of the day. I was also overwhelmed in general as I didn't feel comfortable with him being so dependent on me. I now realised he was co-dependent and the trip had triggered him. I really didn't notice anything before, but there could've been a problem and I was too self absorbed in my own problems to notice. I feel guilty.

I was in a co-dependent relationship years before, where I was emotionally abused (kept in the relationship with ""I'm going to kill you if you leave me"", with the guy taking knives out of the draw and hovering them over himself if I tried to leave, as well as pouring glasses of bleach). So I was really upset by this too. But I felt, and still feel, so guilty. I feel like I used him, which caused his situation, and that I have to repay him.

So despite how uncomfortable I was, I continued to talk to him as much as I could; we were close friends after all, it was fine before I realised and he told me, and I thought I could put it behind me. But Bob didn't act the same. He didn't let down from the bombardment. He would talk in the GC and message me privately at the same time. The second I made a post on any social media, he was in the replies. Every single post. I started to feel more guilty. He was clearly struggling greatly with isolation and it was fine before I got assaulted. I wondered if I should forgive the enabler at least so he would get a friend back (I didn't tell him to kick the enabler out, he did of his own accord). I kept thinking it was all my fault for not moving on or putting it behind me. I said I wouldn't mind if he got back in touch with the enabler, but he said he didn't want to.

At this point, N was just as uncomfortable, said to me he saw all of these actions towards me and wanted to reduce his presence in the GC, which I 100% supported. Of course, it made the co-dependency worse, but N had helped me through so much, and I didn't want him to be uncomfortable too. Once this happened, one of the other guys, despite being a quiet person, did begin to talk in the GC more and spoke with me about how he agreed Bob was a bit too much. He wanted to help alleviate it for me, which he did. Also, I did manage to set the boundary of Bob not DMing me 1 to 1 so he couldn't spam me specifically, which helped. However, the second I seemed slightly down/upset at ANYTHING, he over reacted hugely, telling me how he was sick with worry for me and he made me so uncomfortable with how pushy he was to help me. Had I inadverntly taught him that his goal in life was to help me? Had I used him? I felt awful.

But I felt guilty and so sorry for Bob, so I tried to get him more friends to fill that gap the assaulter and enabler left. I organized small trips. I got him in contact with my other friendship groups. I asked friends with similar personalities if they wouldn't mind following him on social media, and some kindly agreed. I found meet ups happening he could go to (like Warhammer events, Bob is huge into those).

He refused to follow up on a single one of my attempts. He went to the trips but didn't talk to anyone afterwards. He joined GCs and followed people back and but didn't reach out or talk. His bombardment continued, and at this point I had a promotion so I couldn't spend as much time on Discord. When I asked him about it, he went full learned helplessness. ""I can't reach out like you can,"" ""I can't be social or make friends like you can,"" ""It won't work,"" etc etc. N, still present but mostly silent in the GC, did say how despite struggling like Bob did, his perseverance worked and he made friends in adulthood, but Bob doubled down on being unable to like us two. The third guy briefly tried too, but it fell flat since he isn't very social, and Bob actually tried countering with ""Well most guys have only one friendship group."" It did get very slightly better at this point Bob did get a job, and I thought/hoped that would be the end of it, so I let my guard down.

I really fucked up here by just continuing to allow him to be so co-dependent. I felt so fucking guilty plus the above. Throughout the next six months, whilst I was able to begin to set boundaries like ""I'm not gonna be online Discord all of the time,"" I felt awful every time I did it, and he buckled back down in other ways whilst following the boundary. And I fucked up, because I didn't always follow the boundary myself, which isn't fair on him because it's mixed signals. When I did follow it, he would begin to desperately fight for my attention in other ways: if I mentioned any show, movie, song, game etc I liked on social media or in a passing comment, he JUMPED at the opportunity to get into it. Wouldn't stop talking about it. I began to hide my interests from him and made a secret new social media account so I could talk about them without him. He began to message the GC with what I call ""buzzwords"" - if the chat was quiet, he'd make a stupid joke with words specifically designed to grab my attention. Like using my ethnicity (I'm the only one of a particular one in the GC) or referencing a specific historical event that I am interested in. I did try to gently push him towards trying to gain other friends but he refused, and that irritated me so much that I stopped.

The learned helplessness continued and got worse. Suddenly he can't use Google Maps without my help (he's over 30 years old). One time I wasn't the person who could change his permissions in Discord like he wanted me to, and then I suddenly had to be the one to ask the one who could otherwise he'd forget?

And what bothered me the most in this time frame was his reactions to anything remotely negative from me, and me only. It first began when I deleted a Twitter account I hadn't used in months that he followed. His Discord status was ALWAYS on green, it suddenly went on red. I asked him what was wrong, he said it's because I deleted that account (not even my main, which is still up and he follows). I was stunned and brushed it off. He was fine after I told him I just simply didn't use it anymore. But I had accidentally taught him he could get my attention with this status and then it meant he felt bad. Every single fucking time I politely set a boundary (I had told him three times in private to back off over the past 2 years), status went to red. I said on a social media platform that I was upset at something? Red. I didn't talk to him for over 6 hours in the day? Red. He even made a passing comment one game session that the only time he had felt upset in months was when I set a boundary.

All of the above took place over 19 months (I went on that trip in Sep 2023). I finally reached my fucking limit a few weeks ago. I made a passing comment about how I wanted to try dating again. He instantly goes on red. I don't take the bait, and he doesn't talk for two days - at this point I'm worried and I do ask him what's wrong, and he says ""I'm so fucking scared."" Leaves me alone for a few more hours. Eventually it becomes obvious that he doesn't want me to date because its less attention for him. I don't know about you guys but I'm now seeing this whole Discord red thing as a manipulation tactic.

And I kind of snap? I tell him enough is enough, he needs to go get therapy like I've been saying for 19 months, and reach out to others, because I'm my own person and I will not spend my entire life catering to him. He goes quiet and apologises.

The day after that, I speak with him briefly in the morning then I don't for the rest of the day. He goes on red. I really don't fucking care. This weekend I've made sure to push any feelings of guilt or responsibility down and not respond to any messages. At this point our entire GC doesn't even respond to him.

Despite all of the above I would like to be friends with him, because when he isn't being super clingy, he is a lovely person to talk to. And I still have feelings of guilt. My other friends (not in the GC) told me a long time ago to cut him off. He's actually messaging me as I type this out, asking me about a tweet I made a few hours ago, trying to make conversation from it. Fucking hell.

494,"I'm visiting my family because of a recent loss—my aunt on my mother's side—which has deeply affected both my mom and the rest of us. She was a very loved person.  
I've been living with my partner for about five years now in a city that's five hours away by car. I usually visit a few times a year, and I try not to stay too long.

This time, since I couldn’t get time off work, I decided to work remotely while helping out at my parents home. I mainly came to be there for my mom—we have a great relationship, and I know my presence brings her comfort. I had planned to stay for about two months to support her while she goes through this grief.

The problem is, I can’t stand my dad. Our relationship has been strained since I was a teenager, and even now in my 30s, it hasn't improved. Today we had a fight over something as simple as what to eat.  
Being around him is emotionally draining, and it's making me want to cut this trip short and go back home earlier than I planned.",
495,I really need brr brr patapim to squish me with those big ass steppers,
496,"A while ago, I [M22], a bisexual, used to post NSFW content on Reddit wearing feminine outfits. The content was very explicit and clearly catered to the male gaze. I usually did this during rough patches in my mental health. I did enjoy it—it made me feel wanted, and I liked the attention—but the next day, I would feel disgusted with myself. It wasn’t because it was “gay” or anything like that—it was because it didn’t feel like me. I’m not hypersexual; I value emotional connection. I eventually stopped doing it and swore I’d take that part of my life to the grave.

Now, another thing.

Last summer, I was in a foreign country, on the other side of the world, extremely lonely and stressed. I downloaded Tinder and matched with a guy. I was feeling vulnerable and craving some kind of connection, so at 10 p.m., I agreed to go to this guy’s house for sex. I’d never had sex with a guy before, barely even with a girl, but I was trying to push myself out of my comfort zone and boy did I get a whole lot of out of my comfort zone.

I took a 40-minute train ride and then an Uber to get to his place. He had told me he was home alone. But when I got there, he met me in the garage and said his friends and flatmates were home and that they knew I was coming. That completely freaked me out. First, he had lied. Second, I was hoping for just clean no strings sex not walking through a flat full of people to a bedroom which is a terrifying thought for some with social anxiety.

I hesitated and told him I wanted to go home. He replied that the garage was locked and I didn’t have a key.

That’s when I started to panic. Why would he say that? He kept trying to convince me to go upstairs and at one point even tried to physically pull me into the elevator. He was bigger and probably stronger, but I’m a scrappy fighter. There was no way I was going anywhere I didn’t want to go. Still, it was horrifying to realize this guy would put his hands on me like that.

He seemed desperate not to be embarrassed, like he had something to prove, but there’s no excuse for what he did.

He kept trying to talk me into going upstairs. It felt like forever, though it was probably around 45 minutes. I just wanted this nightmare to end. He said things like, “You don’t have any way to get home.” I finally convinced him to let me out. I called an Uber, £60 or something, and I was shaking, high on adrenaline, just needing to get home. As we waited (yes, he followed me out), he suddenly stood on his tiptoes and kissed me on the cheek. Thankfully, my Uber pulled up right then, and I could put distance between him and I. I had promised him I wouldn’t block him and that I’d come back another night—anything to get out of there. Of course, the first thing I did was block him.

I got home, brushed my teeth, changed into pyjamas, and got into my bunk bed in a room I shared with ten other people. A horrible sleeping arrangement right after being assaulted.

I know I said I’d never tell anyone, but I already have.

At the time, I was talking to a girl I’d met twice. She was really nice, and we got along. We’re now coming up on our 10-month anniversary, and she’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. She’s made my life so much happier.

A few weeks ago, I told her everything. I thought she’d judge me, but she just said, “Okay, I don’t care,” and told me there’s nothing to be ashamed of. She shared that she’s not ashamed of her past either (she’s hooked up with a lot more people than I have) and I don’t judge her for that. It felt like a massive weight was lifted off my shoulders. I’m still not proud of what I’ve done, but I’m not ashamed anymore. Things happen. Who cares? Live your life with no regrets.

So to the girl who changed my life, who I can be the real me around: I love you.",
497,"It all started when my friend Amelia (25 F) started talking with her ex Igor (29 M) when he was going through an abusive relationship. They fall in love again for each other and started a secret online romance. My friend and I weren't talking at that time.

Igor's current girlfriend at that time. Let's call her Sam (30 F) noticed that something was wrong and came to try to reach me. She had her suspicious about Amelia and Igor. But I didn't answer since I didn't know exactly what was going on.

I made amends with Amelia. She and Igor were in love and I thought it was a good relationship for them, even if it was wrong since he was cheating on Sam. After that, Sam broke up with Igor hoping that he would go after her but he didn't. Also it's important to say that she was physically aggressive with him so she was not a good person.

Igor told everything about Amelia to Sam. And then he vanished from Amelia's life. Maybe it was the guilty.

I didn't like it. I thought that he was being a coward with those two girls.

Gabriel (28 M) and Igor (29 M) were best friends but Igor treated Gabriel like shit so he blocked Igor and moved on. Amelia knew that. After Igor disappeared, she tried to do one last good thing for Igor and talked with Gabriel so they could be friends again.

Now that's where I am in this story! I (23 M) fell for Gabriel because he was my crush since I was a teen. I asked Amelia to talk with him too because I wanted a chance to be friends with him. She just needed a little push.

We started a good friendship. Me, Amelia and Gabriel. It was pretty cool and I really liked him.

He started to become distant and I discovered that he contacted Igor and Sam again. I asked him what happened and he just said that his life was chaotic. I tried to give him space.

My friend Amelia was really sad and I couldn't bear to watch it anymore. I tried to do something stupid. I contacted Igor so he could say something to make Amelia move on but he didn't answer me. And then I did something that I shouldn't. I contacted Sam trying to help everyone and my friend. She basically told me to f myself and I apologized. I don't know what I was thinking, I thought that maybe I could get a good resolution for all parts.

She blocked me after this. Gabriel also did it. I think they were talking. Now I feel like a loser. I am mourning a two weeks friendship and I hurt everyone in this situation. My friend Amelia asked for space because she obviously didn't like what I did behind her back. I tried to talk with Gabriel but he is not answering me and I don't think he will.

I am feeling pretty shit about everything I did and I do think I could have handled this situation in a better way. I really liked Amelia and Gabriel and now I disappointed both of them.",
498,"I've posted here before, crying out into the void can help..

The past several years have been a relentless tide of caregiving for my dad. 
It's been a silent struggle, a constant weighing of mental, financial, and emotional burdens. Of wondering how much I can take..
 life has continued for others (graduations, weddings, careers blossoming)  while I've often felt anchored to a reality of stagnation and exhaustion. 

There are regrets that cut deep, like the lost time with a dear friend and the pain of missing her funeral due to a specialist appointment. 

The healthcare system has offered little solace, only reinforcing the constant need to give more, even when there's seemingly nothing left.


Sometimes, I catch a glimpse of the person I used to be, a stark contrast to the shell I often feel like now. It's a lonely road, carrying this weight without a cheering voice or even the simple acknowledgment of being seen. 


Yet, through it all, my dad's desire for independence has remained a guiding light. Its something he wants for himself, and maybe it would allow me enough space to breathe. 


We've found a supportive community that he likes, offering a chance for both care and freedom. Sadly, a small financial barrier prevents this transition. 700$..  less than 1k and I can't spare it. It hurts so much.


 After years of solitary effort and significant personal sacrifice, I've started a fundraiser, a vulnerable step after a long period of isolation.

I'm not asking for support here, just screaming about how I know it won't make a difference.

 Ive shared it on my social media but with so many important years of my life just beeing a caretaker and nothing more, I frankly have no hope it will even be seen.

 Its a step I took more to tell myself that I tried everything, I've given all I could give for years by myself; always alone...  and I'd like to hope that there will be peace on the horizon one of these days. 

For now, this miserable existence where I still dont have enough continues

499,My post follows all of the rules of the subreddit and I just want to post my story. Idk what I should do. ,
500,"I need some advice from you all. Long story short — I was briefly dating a girl, and she got pregnant. Initially, we agreed to co-parent the child in the country where we both used to live. Later, she decided to move to her home country without discussing it with me. We had a fight because I tried to make her understand that it wouldn’t be right for the child, and it’s not feasible for me to travel to or move to her country.
As a result of that argument, she blocked me and told me to only talk to her father regarding the baby. So my first message to him was that I wanted to buy things for my son since the Black Friday sales were on. He didn’t respond. Almost two months later, he sent me an ultrasound picture of my son.
Over the last five months, whenever I messaged her father, he would only reply when I mentioned wanting to buy something or said I had already bought something for the baby — but he never answered any of my questions about custody, the baby’s name, or anything important.
Eventually, he promised me I would be allowed to be there when my son was born. So, I dropped everything and bought plane tickets at nearly triple the price. I’ve now been here for three days. I texted him during that time, asking if everything was okay. Every time I asked (at least three times), he just said, ""everything is fine.""
Then yesterday, I asked for an update. He sent me a photo of my newborn son — saying he was born after 40 hours of labor. I reminded him that he had promised to let me know when she went into labor. He said it was a long and exhausting process and told me I could visit today.
I don’t know how to process this. I left everything behind just to be there for my son — and even that was taken from me. I’m now seriously considering going back. The amount of disrespect I’ve experienced from them is more than I can handle. I’ve put up with it all out of love for my son, but after what happened yesterday, I’m not sure I can take it anymore.
Should I leave without seeing my son, even after coming so far?",
501,"The moment I became truly demonically possessed. I was on the bed and suddenly felt like something was taking over my mind and body against my will. It was terrifying. It was the worst feeling. My ears would ring before every attack. I experienced a few more of those attacks. Then the next attack, it said to me that you will itch and burn and then I itched and burned like crazy the next attack. There was a day I was in the kitchen and standing and then it said something telepathically in my head about cigs and I was forced to the ground against my will. After a month of these attacks, I became fully possessed and started vibrating. The first thing that happened was a blindness attack. I couldn’t see for 30 plus seconds.


Okay there has been much more that has happened because I have been possessed and vibrating for three years since. I have not been able to work or drive because of true possession. I have had 8 exorcisms and couldn’t get rid of it. They said it’s true possession. The movement was insane from possession. I have begged God to get free constantly.

Suddenly as of the last few weeks, I have stopped vibrating or being possessed at all during the day after years of it. I wasn’t mid exorcism either. I am free from possession now! God set me free from true possession. This is a true MIRACLE! Things will get better for you.

503,"I've been going through it these last few months with several issues, many of which are self inflicted.

March: Car accident where someone did a hit & run on my car, leaving a pretty sizable dent in the back rear. Insurance is shit so they won't do anything about it. While legally not my fault, I keep thinking it was maybe avoidable. This is after I ended up hitting a tree stump in August which messed up my front bumper. Car still works but looks like shit.

April: Driving in heavy rain at night on a busy highway when my windshield wiper literally broke off. Somehow managed to not crash and pull into an AutoZone to replace it. I'm okay, but definitely was a near death experience. Also found a new apartment to move into, but paid an additional $100/month for a different unit in the same (gated) complex because my girlfriend didn't like that the original unit was in the back of the complex.

May: Playing video games. Got frustrated during a boss. Sitting 15 feet away from the TV. I threw my controller on the ground which somehow bounced directly into the TV, destroying the screen.

It feels like everything I do, I take one step forward and two steps back. I'm too broke to financially fix any of these problems. I just keep getting angry with myself for allowing these (usually completely avoidable) things to happen. I get mad and then get over it until the next thing comes along; it's like a vicious cycle of shitty things and feelings. Definitely not planning to hurt myself so don't worry about that. Any guidance would be appreciated.",
504,"Last year, I (20F) shoplifted some things from a local mall. I had just lost my first ever job and was on kind of a downward spiral. I wanted a dopamine hit I guess, and the thrill of getting away with shoplifting is what I ended up using to cope. Take it from me, don't do that. I was caught and given a court date. I was living with my parents at the time and was determined to not let them find out. I snuck out of the house and took an Uber to the courthouse whenever I was needed there. I was given a differed sentence of 8 hours of community service + a class on the consequences of shoplifting. Problem: almost immediately after I got my sentence, I was supposed to move 3 cities away (this is something I had already been planning to do for almost a year). Not a stupid far distance, but definitely not ideal, especially since I have no car nor a drivers license. That was a couple months ago, and now I'm living with my sister and her fiancé, neither of whom have been told about the shoplifting incident. I ended up waiting until I got a new job to get the community service and class done, so I'd have an excuse to leave the apartment for hours at a time. But getting a job isn't easy, and I only got employed a few weeks ago. 
I was able to knock out the class pretty easily on a day off via taking the bus, but the problem lies in the 8 hours of community service. I need to get into the building in between 8-8:15 AM, or else they leave without you. The commute from my apartment to the community service place is 90 minutes by bus, an hour if I take a (70-100$) Uber. I woke up at 5:30 to try and take an early bus, but no bus showed, so I called an Uber. I got to the place on time, but apparently they had closed shop that day due to rain, which I didn't realize until I was desperately yanking on a locked front door. I tried again today. My due date for the completion of community service is in 3 days. I woke up at 5:30 again, and called an Uber immediately this time. But traffic was so backed up that I didn't end up getting there until 8:20. I walked in the door and tried to ask for an exception, but the lady at the desk just condescendingly told me to ""plan better next time."" I'm currently waiting for the bus back home, hoping my roommates aren't home yet so I don't have to come up with an excuse. At this point, there's a good chance that the way my family finds out about this situation is the cops showing up at my door and arresting me. I had nearly half a year and here I am scrambling because I procrastinated, made excuses, and tried to keep all of this from my loved ones. Even if everything works out, and I finish my community service tomorrow, I'm still incredibly guilty over keeping this from them for so long and actively deceiving them. It's been a long fucking day and it's not even 10 AM yet. ",

I can't stop thinking about it. Why does my brain keep coming up with this stuff? I worry I'm secretly interested in it, and just in denial. I'm scared I'm gonna hurt someone. I don't want to. The thought makes me feel sick. But I don't know how to make this stop. It's starting to affect my daily life.

508,"I know I will sound bitter. I don't care. I just need a place to vent because it might make things better for me.

Tomorrow will be the 8th monthversary of our breakup. We (24 and 25 now) dated for a bit more than two and a half years, longer than we should have, and she broke up with me when I had the biggest mental health crisis of my life for stopping to take my meds. I still carry the physical and psychological scars of that day.

We had an open relationship, the crisis was triggered by her telling me details of what she was doing with someone even after I had told (and written) that I didn't wanted to hear about it.

I felt completely sick. A friend of hers (in her 40s, let's call her A) offered to receive me in her house. We spent the night talking and I cried a lot. The next day I disappeared for hours, then went back to my girlfriends house - the house she said was ours, the house that was decorated and cluttered with my stuff. I hurted myself.

When my girlfriend came home, she had A in tow, and she was acting completely different with me. Like, her demeanor did a complete 180. A screamed at me, accused me of ruining her marriage for accepting to stay in her house and, when she ran to my direction and I flinched, she said I acted too much like her autistic son (I'm autistic as well) for her to hit me.

Well, my girlfriend broke up with me that day. She said she was tired of us continuously hurting each other, but also that she wanted a full non monogamous relationship and to explore what life had to offer her, since I was her first partner.

Time passed, and we tried to talk to each other as friends. She would often tell me A was still her best friend, and that they would hook up sometimes, but that she only had platonic feelings towards her. But then a mutual friend told me my ex called A a ""partner"" when they spoke. It made me feel pretty bad because she saw how A treated me when I was sacred, weak and literally bleeding. My ex would just say that it was a stressful situation for everyone and A acted on impulse.

Obviously, I stopped talking to my ex for months. We tried to rekindle our friendship after I went to get my stuff from her house, but she ghosted me. I was pretty worried because she also has her fair share of mental health issues and I was afraid she could had hurt herself or worse. But I spoke to our mutual friend and he told me the truth.

What happened is: a few months prior, A had proposed to my ex, and she finally accepted. In order to ""not hurt me"", she decided the best thing to do was to just stop talking to me. They're living together now.

I feel that I was constantly lied to. She told me A was just a friend, then told me she didn't want her as a romantic partner, then that she didn't felt aroused by A's body. She told me she wanted to explore, but now she's engaged and living with a 40-something year old. She told me I was important, but is going to marry someone that worsened the trauma I have of that night.

That's all. I know my ex doesn't owe me anything after our breakup. But why would she tell me those things about A if they were all lies? Why would she want so much to keep talking to me, telling I'm one of the loves of her life, that she cares and worries about me, just to marry someone that hurt me that bad?",
509,"I would like to share very little part of my story. 
Part 1

We were separated as children—torn apart by a family tragedy we never got to understand, only survive. I was five, she was three. From that moment, we were placed in different worlds.. literally.. different families far away, growing up like strangers with shared blood and broken memories.

For years, she was a ghost in my life. A name. A question that never got answered. Occasionally, we’d connect on Facebook—starting around when I was 12 or 13.  But the messages were light, surface-level, mostly birthday wishes once a year. We tried to talk about our past once or twice, but silence always followed. Long, painful silence that stretched across months and years.

Then came a dream. Super realistic.

It was February last year. I still remember the feeling when I woke up—like my soul had been shaken. In the dream, we were together. Talking. Arguing, even. There was tension, sadness, maybe even anger. I told her how hurt I was that we had never tried to build something real after everything that happened. I asked her the questions that had haunted me for most of my life: Will we ever meet? Do you even want me in your life?
And I told her the truth, the hard truth: If you don’t, that’s okay. I just need to know. I need to move on.

The dream wouldn’t leave me. It wasn’t just something I remembered—it followed me. It pushed me. I knew I had to try again. And I did exactly the same like in the dream. I text her…

…she replied

She was happy to hear from me.

That simple truth stunned me. I had prepared myself for the worst—that she would tell me I was right, that we were too far gone, too disconnected, too different to try. After all, what did we have? No shared childhood, no inside jokes, just a few scattered flashbacks filled with tears, yelling, confusion. Our only common ground was the tragedy that tore us apart.

But she didn’t say that.

She said she’d been thinking the same things. That she wanted to build a connection. She was open—honest, even excited. I couldn’t believe it.

Suddenly, something that had once felt so far away was now right in front of me. And I didn’t know how to handle it.

We started texting more regularly, cautiously stepping into the shared space of our past. We talked about how we remembered things—how chaotic everything was, how painful. We spoke about the trauma and how it shaped us, how we never really healed. It was raw, uncomfortable, and at the same time… relieving. We’d both carried this silent weight for years, and now, for the first time, we had someone to carry it with.

We realized that we had to grow up to get here. As children, we couldn’t have had this conversation. We weren’t ready to understand what happened to us, let alone to each other. But now, as adults, we could meet it—finally.

We set a date to meet. It happened fast—just a month or two after that first message. It felt like watching someone else’s life. Like I was still dreaming. I kept asking myself questions over and over:

What if we have nothing in common? What if we don’t even like each other? What if she doesn’t sound like I imagined, or her energy is completely different? What if I ruin it?

I didn’t know her. She didn’t know me.

And that was terrifying.

I had panic moments where I wanted to back out. I imagined texting her something vague like, “Hey, something came up—I can’t make it.” Just to avoid the unknown. Just to stay safe in the version of her I’d created in my mind.

But deep down, I knew fear was lying to me.

This was the moment I had waited for. Prayed for. Dreamed about—literally. And maybe, just maybe, it was finally time to step into it..

510,"It saddens me to think how hard it is to find someone who truly falls in love with you.
Someone whose eyes light up when they see you.
Who can’t hide their joy when you arrive.
Who wants to spend more time with you.
Who wants to know you deeply, insatiably.
Who listens to your stories and relives them with you.

It breaks my heart that the kind of love that makes you feel like a teenager again is nowhere to be found.
Instead, we become two people avoiding loneliness.
Two people simply grateful for each other’s company.

It’s hard to accept that my time for those emotions may have passed.
That moments like a special breakfast that felt alive… may never come again.
That being the sparkle in someone’s eyes might now be a memory.

But one must be realistic.
And even if it’s harsh and painful, that’s the truth.
All that’s left is to accept it, lower your head, and wake up.

The kind of love that remains for me today lives in empty letters on a digital screen.
It’s another person with perhaps fascinating stories, but no intention of sharing them.
It’s someone looking for company for the cold days ahead.
Someone just trying to fill the empty seat next to them.

What’s left for me… is a relationship without intention.",
511,"I’m in a strange emotional place, trying to figure out what to do when something felt real—but life got in the way.

Here’s the story:

I was in a relationship with someone I loved deeply. For the first year or so, it was normal—we weren’t long-distance in the beginning. But eventually, we ended up being apart. Never meeting since then. But it never really was difficult, in fact it was magical, reckless and everything young love is. 

Still, the connection never faded. Emotionally, intellectually, soulfully—it felt rare. Like one of those people you just know will stay in your system, no matter what.

The relationship ended messily. The space caught up. He started university earlier than me but it was when I did, Communication broke down, there were unsent messages, missed calls, unread emails. I tried to move on. I dated someone else. But there was always a part of me carrying him.

And then—recently—we talked. He called me first. 

We had a three-hour call. We unpacked everything. The breakup. Our regrets. Our growth. Our families. Old inside jokes and memories. We caught up like old friends but with so much unspoken history sitting in between.

One moment that really hit me was when we talked about our fathers. His dad passed away from cancer at a particular hospital. My dad was treated for cancer that same hospital—and he recovered. It was surreal. Full circle. We both paused and acknowledged how weirdly connected that moment felt. He understood things about my pain that most people never could.

He also told me he hasn’t felt what we had with anyone else. And we agreed we probably never will but hope to. And we know we’re not in the same place in life. 

How does one cope with the reopened wounds and what would you guys do in this scenario 😮‍💨",
512,"I’m 18 and recently passed my school exams. I’ve never failed any exam in my life. Even though I didn’t top, I put in consistent effort and tried my best, especially in Economics. I even took tuition, though I ended up scoring lower than I expected. Funny enough, the subjects I thought I didn’t do well in gave me better marks.

After I passed, my cousin—who is older than me—asked my mom for 200 rupees. She gave it to him, and then he started flexing the money, as if he achieved something. This isn’t the first time. He often looks for chances to benefit from others’ success. When I got new earphones from my dad, he immediately called someone to get him a pair too.

It bothered me. Not the money itself, but the way he used my achievement to gain something and then bragged about it. So I messaged him saying I didn’t want to talk to someone who benefits from others’ hard work and doesn’t do well in his own exams. He replied saying I act like he doesn’t give money and then just said “ok bye.”

We used to be close. When we were younger, he was kind and fun to be around. I’d always want to go to his house. Now it just feels forced. He’s mentally immature, always making a fuss about small things, and acts like the world revolves around him. He’s physically handicapped, and while I respect that, it feels like he uses it to get away with things or make others feel guilty.

I had stopped talking to him before, but my mom said his parents would take it the wrong way, so I gave him another chance. After this, I don’t think I can again.

What’s confusing is I don’t even know exactly what I’m angry about. Maybe it’s because he flexed money from my success, maybe because I didn’t get anything even though I passed, or maybe because no one really acknowledged the effort I put in.

I’m not trying to cause drama. I’m just disappointed and tired of always being the one who understands and keeps quiet.",
513,"Title basically says why I can't open up to anyone IRL. 

Background on why I want to, I severely underestimated how much my project would burn me out. It's a year long project and it's solo work. Also determined if we graduate or not (I passed and I graduate in a few weeks). Atp, I have nothing to give. I've been rotting in bed for 2 weeks at least, squeezing in time to revise my project if I have the energy to. This means I barely talk to or spend time with anyone, let alone my partner. Then again, that struggle in communication tbh has been going on since March... They say they understand but I can see and feel that it's bothering them a lot. Last time this happened to me, it took me a year of rest, therapy, and medication to recover. 

My partner did nothing wrong. I love them so much and they've been nothing but supportive during this whole thing. However, I'm not sure if I'm fit to be in a relationship in this state. I'm so emotionally, mentally, physically, and financially drained. I genuinely feel nothing anymore. No feelings for them. No desire to go out. No joy in what I do. Just numbness and stuck again in this depressive ass state. 

What's really stopping me though is breaking up with them has a huge chance of messing up my friend group. This specific friend group of mine has gone through dating/developing feelings to another person in the group three times and it all ended in disasters to the point where the three people involved aren't in the group anymore. People are gonna take sides and everything might be awkward going forward. And my partner has a habit of disappearing when there's something wrong with her personally so that's also gonna contribute. I don't know. I'm just gonna push through and keep running on fumes 'til everything either breaks down or fixes itself eventually TvT (It's also our anniversary in 2 weeks and I have no idea what to do nor do I have the energy or motivation.)

Also didn't think I'd ever make a post on this site but never say never folks!",
514,"i don’t know. i got the drunkest i’ve ever been last saturday at a party and i left early because i don’t trust myself to be drunk around a bunch of cis people. i went home and called a few of my friends, then i black out for an hour and i remember sobbing uncontrollably on my couch thinking about my uncle. 

a few years ago, his adopted daughter claimed he had touched her inappropriately and my family scoffed. I was too removed from the situation to really comment on it or do anything. fast forward to a month ago, she turns 18 and immediately runs away with people her parents have never met. i felt all guilty and shit, because while she’s always been pretty dysfunctional, i never thought to help her, i was too caught up in my own stuff.

anyways, im on the couch and crying and thinking about when im 11 or 8 or something and im in this church we used to hold family events like christmas in. the memory gets all splotchy, but what i zero in on is that for some reason im in the church bathroom with my uncle and he’s sucking my dick, or maybe i’m sucking his dick. maybe both, i don’t know. when im on the couch im absolutely trashed and confused and im sobbing. i forced myself to stop crying and walked to 7/11. walk is an easy way to put “inched slowly towards,” as it probably took like 20 minutes for what would usually be 5. i couldn’t stop shaking. i bought a crunch bar and went home and passed out

i dont know why i had that thought about my uncle. i was never really close with him, i dont think about him that often except for recently, and as i described the memory (?) is vague and spotty and not very clear. which makes me doubt its legitimacy. but also why would i imagine that? it’s not like being drunk makes you hallucinate. but also i’ve been feeling like shit in general recently and maybe i gave myself a reason to be a victim and to explain why im all weird and fucked up. i’m probably also conflating my guilt for not helping my cousin. or maybe her running away triggered the memory? idk. i can’t stop thinking about it and crying for the past few days. does this happen? it’s very confusing. i can’t tell anybody about this, because it gets dismissed pretty fast among anyone reputable. i’m just confused. i don’t know ",
515,"My friends, A(F19), B(M18), C(M21) and I (F19) have been meeting regularly since the end of April to grill and play games. Since we last met at C's and A doesn't have a grill, I agreed to host the meeting and it's super exhausting trying to find common ground with everyone, but it's all about dessert.
I'm a vegetarian myself, but that's never been a problem because there's always something for me or I take my own food with me. C is very sweet and rarely eats fruit or vegetables, but so far it hasn't been a problem. Now to the actual problem:
Since I'm hosting the meeting, I wanted to make dessert for everyone, A really wants a fruit salad, but C doesn't like fruit. I told them to coordinate and find a common option themselves because I want everyone to be able to eat it, otherwise my effort would be in vain. The others shouldn't take anything with them either (except things to grill so I can save money), since I agreed to do everything. However, A doesn't want to let go of the fruit salad idea, even though I've said several times that they should find something that everyone likes. There are enough dessert ideas that I'll probably find something that everyone will like.
When B suggested that we make waffles with different toppings, everyone was silent. Everyone wants to push their own idea and no one except C really wants to have a productive discussion. I'm tired of it and I'm thinking about whether I should just leave dessert alone.",
516,"lol she said she was looking for “kindness and empathy” and someone she could have a deeper connection with. 

Yet she felt the need to tell me how bad looking I am and then unmatched before I could even reply back. 

I hope she receives the same energy that she’s putting out into the world from others. 

I’m still shocked because I can’t even remember the last time I was straight up insulted like this. I think I’m pretty average anyways? Not overweight or super skinny, no deformities, mostly normal features and I have decently styled hair. 

Feels just really shitty to receive that treatment unprompted. Not sure if she was just having a bad day and wanted to lash out at a stranger but if she wanted to ruin my Sunday evening, I guess she succeeded lol. 

Can’t do anything about I guess but hope karma comes for her.

517,"He molested me from 12-15, until I moved out from his house, and into a distant family members house. My sister, mother, and aunt, stayed with him. He just died like 1 month ago. Everyone is grievinggggg and I just feel so awkward because I’m the only one who hasn’t been crying and extremely sentimental. 

Honestly I think of it as a blessing though. I am weirdly happy that my sister is really broken up about his death, because it gives me hope that she didn’t have the same things happen. 

No one in my family knows because I’m really not trying to rock the boat. He’s the financial pillar of our ENTIRE extended family. Including some who are undocumented, who depend on him for their whole lively hood. Only my therapist and 3 friends know what he did to me 

I always had these scenarios in my head of a big blow out argument between us. Where I ask how he could do that to me, how he could do those things to someone he loves. How I forgive him out of spite and how if he loves Jesus as much as he says he does he has some repenting to do.

And then he just died super suddenly from something random and unexpected. End of story! I guess that’s the closure I’ll get

Sometimes when I hear my immediately family grieve him, I want to shout out what I know about him, who he really is.

But it’s wayyyy to soon. If I were to say anything it would have to be in like 10 years minimum I feel like. To minimize the pain for them. He was important to some people and I don’t want to take that away from them. I wish i could just get over it all, so that their loving image of him could never be tarnished, ever.

So I’ll just say nothinggggg. Nothing nothing nothing at all. Just to my journal and the air and just nothing. Goodnight",
518,"I went to college for communication studies and looking back I don’t know why I majored in that. Probably because I was very bad in math and I just picked something easy. I was never able to land a job specific to this major and I really did try finding a job related to my degree and it was impossible, the reason for that is definitely locational. I job hopped to a bunch of different roles. My experience has been random. I just take whatever job I can get. 

I had orientation this morning and I ran into my old classmate back in college and she’s a nurse now and she asked me what I’m doing here and I was embarrassed when I said I’m an administrative assistant. I’m not trying to talk negatively about this job title. I don’t exactly know why I feel so insecure working in this field. I guess I don’t feel important. I was a receptionist at my last job and the nurses and doctors openly belittled me and made me feel less than because “I’m just a receptionist.” I’ve had doctors and nurses laugh at me because I got bullied at that job and I demanded respect from them. They were talking behind my back and saying “who does she think she is? She’s literally just a receptionist. What a joke.” That’s actually what led me to quit that job.

It’s also the fact that whenever anyone asks me what I do for work, I honestly don’t want to tell anyone. When I do tell someone what I do for work, they respond with a condescending “oh okay…” most of the time and they just sound like they feel sorry for me. They are like “well that’s okay for now.” This is why I just feel so embarrassed and unaccomplished. I never had a career goal. I still don’t. I am not work orientated if I’m being completely honest here. The happiest I’ve ever been was when I was unemployed. I am very anti-work however I just continue to work because I have to like everyone else. 

I just don’t feel important. The dress code at my current job is scrubs even though I’m not in a clinical position but in my current position I’m not dealing with patients so it’s completely behind the scenes. I do feel a sense of importance when I wear these scrubs around the hospital when I’m walking around in the morning and on my break but I know my confidence is fake. This is not me saying I want to be a nurse or in a clinical role, I don’t. I just don’t want to feel embarrassed anymore when I tell someone my job title.  ",

Just sitting on the dusty floor. It’s cold.  
My sobbing echoes through the hallway of that old East German house.  
A fire inside I didn’t choose to light.

The door slams. I feel the air wave.  
The sound hits—rattling my little eardrums.  
  
My shoes are untied.   
I’m learning how to tie them.  
  
Do you remember who taught you?

I think if I cry quietly, she’ll come back.

He walks in with the knife.  
“Hold out your hand,” he says.

Anything can be a weapon.  
I know how they fly—shoes, pans, plates.

520,"TLDR: My bestie's and my life changed a lot. She had just met my BF and after that, she didn't show interest neither in hanging out with us nor me unless for short coffee. She confronted me about things that bother her after being quiet and lying for 5 months. After making promise to make it work, nothing really changed and we are drifting apart.

K and I have been friends for 7 years and in last 3 years we bonded to the point I considered her my best friend. She began dating A 4 years ago and back then I lived in another city. At mark of their first year I moved to the same city where K and A live. First two years of me living there were amazing. I grew closer to K and I also became close to A. We would hang out twice a month, maybe more frequently. Me and K were students while A was working full-time. We would go out to drink until late hours as typical people in 20s.

 Last year I decided to try out dating and thus met my boyfriend. Both K and A were very supportive, especially K because she is of opinion everyone should have somebody. She couldn't wait to meet him and had fantasies about four of us hanging out.

Anyway after several months I introduced K and A to my boyfriend. We went out for drinks in the evening, spend couple of hours together to get to know each other. Not until late hours, just had couple of drinks then went home. In my opinion it was good. A and my bf talked a lot. K is a shy person, but she still engaged in conversation. They seemed happy. My bf couldn't stay until very late because he had made plans before we made plans for meeting which was fine with me and he apologized to them as well.

Since the evening turned out well, I was very excited about us hanging out. Now during that time, K graduated and began working full-time while I continued studying in different city 4 hours of driving from where I live. I have classes 2 times a month so it took me a while to balance that, finding a part-time job, meeting my bfs friends and maintaining my friendships. For K it took her a while to get used to different lifestyle and she somehow withdrew herself. Our dynamic began to change. We would meet once a week or in two weeks and those hangouts were always for 1 hour at coffee shop. She was the one who would end them that soon. I found that weird, but I assumed it was because she is tired from working. I tried to get 4 of us together to hang out, but it wasn't happening really. One time K suggested for us to hang out the next day. Luckily I wasn't travelling that weekend so I agreed. I told her to come to my place and I will make us dinner. The next day I texted her to confirm our plans. She didn't respond for several hours. Three hours before dinner, she told me she doesn't feel like it and that we will hang out next time. I have already begun preparing something and it made me angry she cancelled last minute. The next day I called her to check what is going on and asked her if it was about my bf. She claimed no because she doesn't even know him and that she was just too tired and she didn't want to bring that energy.

Several weeks later she invited me to lunch and suggested we go out in the evening to a club. Later I got a message from her she doesn't feel like clubbing and that she wants to go to a fair, but that she will see if she is in mood for clubbing. Since she couldn't make up her mind, I decided not to go. This isn't the first time she has been like that. While that was fine with me before, now I don't like changing plans last minute. Then I initiated another hangout 4 of us. A couldn't come. We agreed to meet up on weekend. After over 1 hour, K left saying she had work to do. I found that bs because she doesn't work that late at night. I got very sick for a month unrelated to that. After that K mentioned she wanted to spend 1on 1 time with me. I made plans for later considering how she behaves. 

Then came that day. We made plans and she said she wants to hang out one on one then next time it will be 4 of us. That day she told me everything. She confessed that she feels neglected and how I prioritize my bf. She claimed she knows how in first relationships partners may start to behave similarly and accused me of that, especially because I don't feel like going out to drink anymore. She said that while she believes me and my bf are good to each other, that she wasn't really happy with our first meetup. She was disappointed we didn't go out to drink for long. I believe it bothers her that he is not a type of person to go out drinking until late hours. I was shocked by that because I have already asked her if she likes him and she never complained. I told her I initiated hangouts at least 5 times in last 4 months, she behaved like that wasn't enough. Then I apologized to her. Then she told me how I left after an hour last time. Then I told her how she always does that to which she responded that she doesn't like spending long time in coffee shops. She then asked me not to tell my boyfriend about this. 

I invited K and A for dinner. It was nice evening and I was happy. Afterwards I asked her how was evening and what she thinks of my boyfriend. She just said that it was nice and that she liked the game we played. After that whenever I had free time, I asked K to hang out 4 of us. However with busy schedules we couldn't work it out. Once more I asked her if she liked my bf and she again said she doesn't know him that well not really saying anything.

A month ago, I realized that the confrontation messed me up. I questioned if anyone who met my bf lied to me about their opinion. But in the end I believe they were honest. I was very open to my bf about how it hurt me what happened with K. Then I couldn't keep quiet and confessed to him . He was understanding and he told that I did everything I could. He was kind of annoyed about how K viewed hanging out.

Now the last time I saw her, she wanted to hang out with me but instead I invited her to join me and my bf for lunch. We had a good time but we didn't really talk since then. Through that time I have been thinking about what I want from our friendship. I stopped initiating hangouts because I am just tired of trying all the time. Ever since I took a mental break from her, I have felt more calm. I didn't feel need to reach out to her. I don't view her as best friend anymore, just someone I used to be close to, but still some sort of friend. Did this friendship come to an end... ",
521,"You never knew what I was doing behind the scenes. While I gave up pieces of myself for you—pieces you never asked about, never cherished—there were things I was doing quietly, with intention, to be better for you. Not because you asked. Not because you earned it. But because I loved you. Because my heart was pure, and I wanted us to win. I wanted you to feel safe with me. I wanted to be your peace.

I shifted the way I spoke, softened my reactions, practiced patience I didn’t know I had. I spent time in reflection, asking myself how I could show up better for you—how I could love you in your language even when mine was starving. I swallowed my needs more times than I can count, convincing myself that love was supposed to be selfless, sacrificial. That maybe if I loved you enough, you’d finally feel it and reflect it back. But you never did.

You made me feel like wanting you—intimately, emotionally, spiritually—was too much. Like my desire for connection was a burden. There were nights I laid next to you, aching for affection, and you ignored me. Times I begged for your touch and you turned away. Do you know how small that made me feel? How embarrassing it is to feel unwanted by the one you’ve given everything to?

You criticized things you didn’t understand. You told me to get rid of personal things like it was a threat to your manhood, not realizing it was a replacement for the intimacy you constantly withheld. You made me feel shame for needing something you refused to give. As if my body was inconvenient. As if I should apologize for craving love.

You judged me for the things I kept quiet about—things you assumed, twisted, or outright accused me of. You didn’t ask, you just projected. And I internalized all of it. I second-guessed myself. I tried harder. But nothing I did was ever enough for you to show up with consistency, clarity, or care.

I wonder if you ever thought about what it cost me to stay. The things I had to silence, the standards I lowered, the values I bent just to keep loving you. I would’ve gone to the ends of the earth for you. I would’ve given you a love that healed you. But instead, I had to heal from the love you gave me.

You didn’t lose me because I was too emotional, too needy, or too much. You lost me because you never took the time to understand how rare I was. Because you never looked at me and saw the woman who chose you even when it cost her pieces of herself.

And while I gave up pieces of me for you—parts of my joy, my time, my softness—there were also things I did on my own time, behind the scenes, without applause or recognition. They were quiet decisions with clear intentions and a pure heart. I was learning how to be better for you. I was healing wounds I didn’t ask for, just to make sure I didn’t bleed on you. I was practicing patience even when you tested every edge of me. I was softening my responses, choosing kindness when frustration begged to speak, taming my triggers so you wouldn’t feel the weight of battles that weren’t yours. I was loving you in the most invisible ways. And not just loving you—I was becoming someone for you.

I chose growth. Not because you asked, but because I believed that loving you deserved my best self. I chose to sit with discomfort and silence and rejection from you, thinking maybe you just needed time. Thinking maybe if I showed you enough, proved enough, poured enough—you’d feel safe enough to love me back. But now I see that I became a safe space for someone who had no intention of staying.

You asked things of me without words—my body, my loyalty, my energy—and I gave them willingly, even when my own needs weren’t being met. Even when you left me begging to be touched, to be seen, to be acknowledged. Do you even realize how humiliating that was? For a woman like me, who holds so much depth and fire, to be reduced to pleading for scraps of affection? To be made to feel shame for needing intimacy, when it should’ve been honored?

You judged me for things you never understood. You called me out for trying to find comfort on my own, while you withheld it when I asked. You made me feel like there was something wrong with me for wanting more—for wanting connection, for needing reassurance. And all the while, I stayed. I stayed and I tried and I gave. Not because I was desperate, but because I believed in something real. And I thought, maybe just maybe, you’d see me. You’d see all that I was doing—not just the love I gave you, but the love I was becoming in your name.

But you didn’t.

And maybe you never could.

But I need you to know: I didn’t lose you. You lost me. And if you ever truly understood the woman you had in front of you—the fire, the loyalty, the soul—you’d be on your knees, begging for another chance. And even then, you’d still come up short.

And even then, you’d still come up short—because now I know my worth in a way I didn’t before. Loving you taught me more than pain; it taught me what not to settle for. It taught me how lonely it feels to share a bed with someone who can’t meet you emotionally, to pour out your soul and be met with silence, indifference, or some half-hearted excuse. It taught me that I can’t build a home in someone who keeps locking the doors.

I remember all the ways I made excuses for you. When you pulled away, I told myself you were tired. When you lied, I told myself you were confused. When you neglected me, I convinced myself it was temporary. Because that’s how far I was willing to stretch my heart—for you. But the truth is, real love doesn’t hide behind excuses. Real love shows up. Real love holds you when you’re crumbling, listens when you’re quiet, sees you when you’re fading. Real love says, “I’ve got you,” and means it. And you never did.

You loved the idea of me—the softness, the presence, the loyalty—but you didn’t protect me. You didn’t nourish me. You didn’t cherish the parts of me that were built through years of survival and pain and transformation. You took a woman who was already fighting battles and added more weight to her shoulders.

And the worst part? I still wanted to give you everything. I still wanted to love you through the healing you refused to do for yourself. I still wanted to show you what it’s like to be deeply, endlessly chosen. I would’ve carried you. I would’ve prayed for you. I would’ve held your head in my hands and told you the truth about your worth, even when you didn’t believe it.

But you wouldn’t do the same for me.

You lost me the moment you mistook my strength for something you were entitled to. The moment you thought I’d always be there no matter how little you gave. The moment you looked into my tired eyes and still chose your own comfort over my heart. That’s the moment you lost a real one.

So don’t come back later asking what happened. Don’t come back pretending you didn’t see the signs. Don’t come back trying to unlock a door you welded shut with your silence, your pride, and your inconsistency.

I just want to say this—
You have no idea how beautiful, how alive, how magnetic I can be when I am loved right. When I am emotionally nourished, mentally at peace, and surrounded by someone who truly sees me, I am the most joyful, vibrant version of myself. I light up. I thrive. I become unforgettable.

And that’s what hurt the most—
I couldn’t be that version of me with you.
I was drained. I was in pain. Even when I smiled, I was hurting. Every day I carried the weight of unspoken tears. I wanted to cry all the time—endlessly—but I couldn’t. I had to keep pushing forward because no one had me. No one was holding me up. Not even you.
And you were supposed to.

I was surviving. You never even saw that.
Everything I was going through—the emotional exhaustion, the trauma resurfacing, the responsibilities I carried alone—you never asked. You never noticed. And even when I tried to tell you, you turned it into something about you. It was like screaming into a void, begging for someone to care, while standing next to someone who claimed to love me.

You always threw your time in my face, like it was a gift. Like it meant something. But your time was empty. It held no weight, no depth, no connection. It was hollow. I felt that. I knew that. I felt every lie, every inconsistency, every emotional absence. And still—I stayed. I tried. I didn’t want to be the one to give up. I believed in you, even when you gave me every reason not to.

I tried to give you what I wished someone would give me—loyalty, love, presence, effort—while silently carrying the weight of trauma and pain you never even asked about. I was trying to love you while breaking under everything life had thrown at me.
But the truth is, the more I gave, the more I realized you didn’t know how to receive it. And maybe… you never deserved it.
Because you never once gave me even a fraction of what I was giving you.

I remember the nights I went to sleep crying, silently, so no one would hear me. Still showing up the next day with love in my hands, with patience in my voice. I was building something you kept tearing down with neglect, coldness, and ego.

The hardest part wasn’t the pain—it was you pretending like you knew me. Like you understood who I was. Listening to your warped, inaccurate ideas of me, of what you thought I meant, of what you thought I was doing, and realizing… you never actually took the time to understand me at all. Ever. That’s where everything fell apart.

Every time I tried to communicate, you twisted my words. You assumed I was trying to attack you, when all I was doing was trying to teach you how to love me. To teach you who I am, what I value, what I need. But you didn’t want to learn. You brought up age like it meant something—but maturity isn’t measured in years. You never met me where I was, emotionally or mentally. I had to come down to meet you—and when I did, there was nothing left for me.

I wanted effort. I wanted reciprocity. I needed softness and safety, not silence and suspicion. I needed someone who would care enough to ask, to listen, to hold me—not just physically, but emotionally. Someone who would recognize that everything I do, everything I say, has purpose. I’m not careless. I’m not aimless. I’m deeply intentional, deeply intelligent, and incredibly intuitive.

You didn’t know what to do with that. You didn’t know how to handle someone like me.
Someone who feels so much. Who sees so much. Who asks for real love—not performative, not convenient, but raw, consistent, and mutual.

Your responses—the emotional immaturity, the deflection, the coldness—they were all choices. Whether you admit it or not, you chose to be the way you were. You chose to be distant. You chose to shut down. You chose to ignore what was sacred. And that’s why you lost me.

Because I am sacred. What I offer is rare. And what breaks my heart is you’ll probably never even realize what you had. You’ll tell yourself a version of this story that makes you feel better. One where I was “too emotional,” “too much,” “too intense.”
But deep down, you know the truth.
I was never too much. You were just never enough.

And maybe that’s why you’re still alone.
I don’t believe you want to be alone.
I believe you just haven’t grown into someone who can truly have someone yet.
Because the world doesn’t reward men who refuse to become better.
The universe doesn’t bless the ones who mishandle sacred things.

You had something sacred in front of you.
You just didn’t know what to do with it.

That’s the problem with this world.
That’s why I feel so alone.
Because I’m constantly looking at myself—not out of shame, not for approval—but because I care. Because it’s the right thing to do. Because as human beings, we are supposed to grow, to evolve, to reflect. Not for applause, not to be liked—but for the sake of good. For the sake of truth. That is the heart I carry. That is what makes me different.

A pure heart doesn’t ignore its flaws. It takes accountability. It listens.
When I make a mistake, I don’t run from it—I own it. I reflect, I explain, I do better. That’s how I live. That’s how I love. But being around you—being around someone so unhealed, so emotionally unavailable—it kept dragging me back into my own darkness.

And I fought it. God, I fought it.
But I was constantly being pulled under.
I could never just be light. I could never just be at peace.
You kept me in survival mode.

It was draining—so exhausting. Like I was fighting for something sacred and I was alone in the ring. Like I was healing while being harmed. Like everything I was building within myself was being chipped away every time I reached for you and got coldness in return. I was doing the work—on my soul, my patterns, my trauma—and it felt like it didn’t matter. Because nothing changed. Because you didn’t care to meet me there.

I started to feel bitter. Frustrated. I couldn’t even act out of my heart anymore.
And that’s not who I am.

I’m not a bitter person. I’m not closed off. I’m not angry by nature.
But being with you… it started to change me.
And I couldn’t let that happen. I couldn’t let the pain you caused become who I am.

I’m sad for you.
I’m sad that you never truly knew me.
I’m sad you never got to experience the real me—the softness, the fun, the depth, the unwavering loyalty, the healing love I carry. The version of life I could’ve shown you. The kind of love that only comes once in a lifetime. I was offering you something that most people only dream of. And you didn’t even notice.

You never even tried to see me.

But I still hope you heal.
I still pray that one day, you find the good in you—the real good. The kind that doesn’t come from ego or control, but from peace. From truth. From love. Because there’s still time. There’s always time, if you choose it.

But this is where I stop choosing you.
Now, I choose me.

Because I knew.
I always knew.

I knew you were lying about so much.
I knew you were seeing other people. I felt it in my body, in my gut, in the shift of your voice, the way you moved, the way you avoided answering phone calls, the way you protected your phone. I knew. I knew when you showed up at my house that day—it was bad news. You missed me, sure. But it wasn’t just me you missed. It was the feeling. The safety. The home you thought would always be waiting for you. The home I was desperately trying to build for us. You didn’t come back to give—you came to take.

You came stealing what I had left to offer.

And maybe our values really are different.
Maybe the way we define love will never align.
But what’s undeniable is that you knew I was in pain. You watched me hurting. You admitted to giving me nothing. You said it out loud. Like it was okay. Like you were proud to be aware of your absence.

You stayed, not because you loved me, but because of guilt.
And it showed. It bled through every word, every empty promise, every distant stare.
It didn’t even hurt after a while.
I just felt sorry for you.

Because I was still trying to show up for you—even when it was me who needed to be held.
Even when I was the one breaking. Even when you had nothing left for me.
That’s the kind of heart I have.

My heart is so goddamn loving that even after everything you took,
even after all the lies, the silence, the betrayal,
I was still trying to make sure you were okay.

I was still trying to give you grace.

And that’s not weakness. That’s not foolishness.
That’s the kind of love that can’t be taught. The kind of selflessness that comes from a soul who has known deep pain and still chooses softness.
But not anymore.

You don’t get to stand in that kind of love and not honor it.
You don’t get to be held by something rare and not protect it.

So I’m walking away now—not bitter, not broken.
But free.

Because I’ve seen the truth.
And because I finally know the value of what I was offering.
And I’ll never again hand it to someone who doesn’t know how to cherish it.

What cut the deepest wasn’t just what you did—it was that you admitted to almost all of it.
Right in front of me.
And yet… you offered no solution.
No change.
No effort to make it right.
Like your honesty was supposed to be enough.
Like the truth, stripped of action, would somehow heal me.
But it didn’t. It only made it worse.

And I remember sitting there, hearing your words, trying to stay strong—but in my mind, I was on my knees, crying.
Because I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t enough for you to try.
I started to wonder if you had ever given that part of yourself to anyone…
And if so, why not me?

What was so wrong with me that I didn’t deserve the version of you I kept fighting for?

And the most painful part… is knowing you never deserved what I gave you.
You didn’t earn it.
You didn’t care for it.
You didn’t even see it.

But I still hope it wasn’t wasted.

Because there was one time—just one—when I actually felt your love.
And it was a tower moment for me.
Like the sky cracked open and everything I thought I knew about love collapsed and rebuilt itself in an instant.
It was the first time in my life I felt truly loved.
So much that I whispered out loud, “What is this?”
Because I didn’t recognize it.
It was new.
And it was beautiful.
It felt like being alive for the very first time.
Your head was resting on mine.
Our hearts were pressed together, chest to chest.
And something happened in that moment—I don’t even know how to explain it—but I felt it.
In my body. In my soul.
I’ll never forget that feeling.

It’s crazy, isn’t it?
That one second of something real can echo longer than months of pretending.

Because that…
That version of you—that softness, that presence—that was the person you’re so desperately trying to hide behind your cruelty and your ego.
And it’s a shame.
Because you’re really beautiful when you’re like that.
So beautiful, I would’ve loved to water that part of you.
To help it grow. To protect it. To keep it alive.

But you buried it.
You chose the armor.
You chose the distance.
And now all I can do is remember what it felt like to be that close to your truth—even if it was fleeting.

I hope something in you remembers what it felt like to be loved like that.
To be forgiven, to be fought for, to be seen even when you were hiding.
I hope that somewhere in your silence, in your coldness, in your mess of guilt and ego—you felt it.
Even if just for a moment.

Because that was real.
I was real.

And now…
I give that love back to myself.

He agreed, said it was definitely the best idea. But I still feel guilty? Like I made him go in? Or that I caused the situation in the first place? Our marriage, besides the usual little arguments is fine, and this was a really big shock for me. Has anyone else felt like this, or dealt with something similar? I am just so, so confused.

I've been a loner for so much of my life I don't even know what my sexuality is, what kind of person I am, or how other people see me. I barely a person at this point.

I saw the Thunderbolts and someone with psychic powers must have read my mind for inspiration for that. I've felt trapped in the same loop my whole life. Just change being bullied at school to being bullied at my shitty customer service job and my life is exactly the same as it was 20 years ago.

I love going to concerts, but most of the time I make it through a crowded situation like that without a single person talking to me. It's reached the point where I don't try to talk to people because my social skills are probably 6/10 on a good day and I'm so disconnected from reality that I can't tell if what I want to say is weird and I think I'll just be bothering people and making them uncomfortable.

Going somewhere public and seeing groups of friends or a cute couple, often makes the sadness and self-loathing hard to handle sometimes.

525,So i 20(F) have been with my boyfriend (23) M for almost 2 years and i feel like im starting to resent him a little. When me and my bf got together we met on hinge so our relationship in the beginning consisted of ft calls and he also lived pretty far. Once we got to meet up and hang out and got closer we both understood that we had both been super depressed and that might make or break the relationship. We both stayed and he asked me to be his gf…now heres the thing i knew that he was depressed he knew i was depressed but i guess what i didnt know at the time was what i wanted out of a relationship. This is my first relationship and being with him has shown me sooooo much about myself. Also want to add that i love him. I love him so much and i truly do think we are in each others lives for a reason and that we were meant to meet but im not satisfied in our relationship. When we got together he didn’t have a job he “had a car” that i later found out was a family car not his car and he barely gets to use it. When we first started dating since he didnt work he wasn’t able to take me on dates and he used to play himself up and say that once he got a job i wouldn’t have to pay for any thing and that he’d be taking me out and told me all these dates we were gonna go on…fast foward to almost 2 years later hes had 2 jobs since and ive been on 1 actual date and to mention when we got together i wanted to have fun and to experience shit together even tho he didn’t have money or “ couldn’t afford it” so i payed for everything i did everything he and i wanted to do and payed for EVERYTHING for months….and i still do mainly pay for most things..and he will ask me for gas money and ughhhhhhhh TURNNNN OFFFF i hate it. He doesn’t plan dates or anything really…my birthday last year he didn’t get me anything or do anything he got me a birthday cake and that was that didn’t even want a slice. Not to mention his family owns him so that same birthday his father called him to ask him if he was busy because he needed him and on my birthday he told him “ he wasnt busy and hes on his way over” his family lives an hour away and he left me on my birthday. Our Anniversary didnt do anything either LOLL didnt pay for our breakfast either. He’s extremely depressed and deeply traumatized hes had a hard life and his family mistreats him tremendously…his family plays a huge part on his mental health and they don’t realize what they instilled in there son. But i dont know what to do…i try my best to talk to him about him family and his past…i try to work those things out with him and get to move on or heal but its not that easy and i know this…i just feel like because of his depression it makes him lazy and his laziness makes me dislike him as man. There was a point in our relationship like 2-3months in the beginning were i checked out sexually and wasn’t sexually attracted to him and i now realized its because i had realized he was a loser and got turned off. That sounds mean and i feel bad because hes my best friend but hes lazy he works at s skate shop 4 days out of the week and complains he tired all the time he has issues with communicating he cant text me back for shit yet he has no life no friends so its not like hes busy texting a friend..he also is very submissive due to his family basically owning his life hes veryyyy submissive and i have to do everything im the MAN i plan everything i call all the shots i start every conversation it’s exhausting. He will sit there and watch me cry and not do or say anything not cause he doesn’t care but cause hes scared to do or say anything because he doesn’t want me upset…..UGHHH im getting upset typing this. I love him and i feel so badddd for him theres so much i could put in this rant but im stopping here because i dont wanna upset myself. I hate this situation im in and it’s making me not enjoy being in a relationship ,
526,"I’m more productive than ever, more focused, more “disciplined” but I also feel colder, more detached, more isolated.

I thought becoming efficient would make me feel better, but sometimes it feels like I lost parts of myself in the process.",
527,"I (25f) have a six year old daughter with my ex (28m). He was my best friend's older brother. I had a crush on him. He came home after he graduated from college and was single. We started dating. I knew we were meant to be together forever and I knew I didn't want a family with anyone other than him. Everyone thought we were so cute because they all knew I had a crush on him. I thought he was happy. I was wrong.

About a year into our relationship I got pregnant. I wasn't on birth control and just wanted nature to take its course. It was then that it started becoming clearer that he didn't really intend to be with me. I wanted to get married. I was having his baby so I thought it was time to become a family. He didn't want to marry me. He said he really didn't see us being together long term but that he would always take care of our kid. 

I was upset and if I wasn't already halfway through the pregnancy, I'd have aborted. My parents were upset and said they should have custody if he wasn't going to marry me. I thought that would get him to do the right thing and marry me but it didn't and he got a lawyer and got a restraining order against my parents when they said they should be the ones to raise my baby. I wanted my baby to grow up with two parents in healthy marriage. But my parents couldn't go anywhere nearby the baby and he's kept them away from them. 

I really hoped he changed his mind after she was born. Because of the restraining order, I had no choice but to live with him. I lived in the upstairs and he lived downstairs in the basement. He would only talk to me if it was about our daughter. He told me he wanted us to continue living like this until she started school. After that he said I'd need to find my own place to live at when it wasn't my week. He wanted her to live at the house and us to switch off time with her. He started seeing other people. He's now trying to get back with the girl he dated in high school. They were the homecoming king and queen. That perfect couple. They have the perfect jobs. While I'm just the trashy ex who works at Safeway. 

He and our daughter are close. With me, she's always so closed off and defiant. She won't listen to me and always says ""Daddy lets me,"" ""Daddy doesn't make me go to church,"" ""Daddy lets me go outside.""

Clearly she wants her dad. So she can have him. I'm tired of being a mother to a girl who doesn't appreciate me. I'm tired of having an ex who clearly wants me out of the way. 

I'm terminating my parental rights tomorrow and I'm leaving. I asked my job to transfer me and they are transferring me out of state. I found an apartment I can afford in the new place. Part of the agreement is I won't have to pay child support provided I agree never to contact her while she's a minor. They don't have to worry about that. It'll be nice to get away. I hope someday I can have the family I deserve. I know everyone will say I'm a horrible person for abandoning my kid but she doesn't want me and why should I care about her when she doesn't care about me? If she wants her horrible selfish shallow dad then she can have them and I can move on with my life. I'm tired of raising someone else's brat. 

ETA: I'm getting too many comments. I'm not going to read them all. I don't care if you think this is fake. I typically read stuff on reddit. I've never posted or commented before. I don't care what other people think of me. But to answer one question one of the reasons for the restraining order is that my dad physically assaulted him when my ex told him to his face he wasn't marrying me. They can't see her because my brother lives with my parents and is a felon who can't be around children and my ex had evidence that they've helped my brother violate that condition of parole in the past (it was only so he could see his kids) because of that he was able to get a restraining order that lasted five years. It's not there anymore but my parents have given up. I'm driving back so I can sign the papers tomorrow. I may respond if anyone has anything meaningful to say.",
528,"How i broke out of an emotional numbness pit (not out of the woods yet) and learnt that the ""Blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb"".

  
A year ago, I moved to Dubai for a software developer job. As someone who used to feel homesick after 8 hours at an office just 25km from home, this was massive. But life cornered me, and I went.  
New company’s a mess — startup chaos, delayed salaries, a boss with a God complex. But I get autonomy in my dev work, which is the only reason I stayed.  
I live alone. Work 12-hour shifts. Friday’s my only day off. The time difference makes it impossible to talk to friends or family after work. My social life? Non-existent. Just gym and code. That’s it.  
But since coding is my passion, i find happiness in that, trying to balance every other holes in my life with that happiness.

  
Then 2 new girls joined the company in the sales force. They were sisters, from Sri Lanka. The young one was only 19 and the other was 21. I was going through the chest infection episodes when they joined, so i was not into getting acquainted with them, but i had to talk to them as i had to set the software and systems for them. So, had the basic talks of names and places. Other than that, i did not talk to them. But after few days, the eldest one came to me on a lunch break and asked me, ""do you miss your family?""  
I was like, ""y.. yeah, why, how do you know that, why did you ask that?""  
""You seemed sad and less talkative, i guessed maybe it is because you miss them""  
she said, and we started talking.

  
During Ramadan the afternoons were long and nothing much was happening, thus our talks started to get deep, I started to learn more about them, that they have 4 more siblings, 2 younger sisters and 2 elder brothers a total of 6 children and they are living with their mother and their father is stuck in UK for 15 years since he did some illegal immigration with some bad passport or something. I did not ask more about any of those things or any clarification on those. Even though i wanted to, i did not as I was in a storm of myself at that time and i did not want to make them go through a difficult talk for seemingly no reason.  
But i listened to them, felt calming, as days went by we started to open up, she started to tell me more and more deep stuff, secrets like one of her brothers was an adopted one and about that day where there was not even a Dirham in their home and by some miracle their mom, the lone warrior she is, put food on the table for the 6 of em.

  
Now, in a place like Dubai, everyone is looking for that modern dream life and ways to realize that dream. And people, mainly women (no offense) who come to you with sad life stories in order to gain sympathy and financial (mainly) help from you is nothing new and is recommended by others to avoid. Not because of this, but I was already a person who finds it difficult to trust people, yet does not shy away from helping others with what i don't regret to lose in doing so. So, with caution i listened to her.

  
The eldest sister, lets call her ZF, was the one closer to me, she was a firm believer in god and religion, so even after Ramadan she took a week long additional fasting. I could see that it was difficult for her, as even her little sister was having normal lunch and stuff along with everyone else, she was doing it alone. I admired her perseverance. I remembered she saying that she likes hazel nut chocolate during some conversation a while ago, so the day she finished her fasting, i bought both of em 2 slabs of hazel nut chocolates. Just felt like she deserves it. That actually made them so happy.

  
She told me to not bring lunch next day. I said OK. They brought a sizeable lunch with grand food, for me. I was so happy. But then she started to bring everyday which i felt to be not ok as they are already a big family and is running on little money ZF and her sister makes along with what little their brothers are making doing some odd jobs. They are barely making it, her mom doesn't have a job yet. So, i tried my best to say it as nice as possible to not bring lunch regularly as i dont want to be another load on their already heavy life. They reluctantly agreed. By that time we shared phone numbers as she wanted to print something few days before using company printer.

  
I gave them support during their tough times, when ZF was feeling overwhelmed by the pressure of sales targets and when she told me about the long distance BF back in Sri Lanka was acting cold, when her sister had failed 2 papers in her plus two equivalent that she had to complete in 1 year combined so that they can leave to Dubai early, I was there for all of it. I thought i was just tending to them just like i do with almost everyone here, except some bad apples.  
One day, on that fine evening, their brothers came into the office to pick them when they were leaving. She told me the next day that they actually came to see me, i asked them why, she said, they all were so curious to see me as both ZF and her sister talk about me a lot every day during dinner. I was kind of shocked to learn that they came in to see me and also I became a topic of conversation in their home. I asked her what did the brothers say after the visit?  
They told em that Im even older than the brothers themselves that im now a brother to all of them!  
And I kept on buying random stuff for them, totally randomly, when the situation arises (when there was very minimum staff, as im not a rich guy and i cant buy stuff for all of the staff so that i can treat them in the process), but i was adamant that the connection should not be based on how much spend on them, and they always showed me pure gratitude and never asked me to buy anything for them i kept on doing it unprompted but never forgot to ask them if they were ok with what im doing.

  
Many little things happened during the following days. She showed me many photos in her phone and ZF's sister was also telling me many stuff related to their life. Their life back in Sri Lanka and the things they used to do, their deceased grandparents that they adored and their father that they only see and talk through a screen and miss terribly and beauty of Sri Lankan places that they visited, all photos and videos related to it they showed me. Every day both of them wait for me pack up so that we can leave together and talk till they go their way to the bus stop and i go my way to walk to my room nearby.  
During the last decade and half, the shit that i had went through made me emotionally numb, for survival i had shoved down a lot of mind shattering emotions down my throat to ""deal later"" was the culprit. Nothing could make me break my character. I was the strong stoic ""mentally present"" person in every scenario, who did not break down, who consoled everyone, who made the logical decisions and gave solution to everything.  
Yesterday morning ZF called the HR and told him that they have to leave immediately to Sri Lanka and it was non negotiable as they had some serious thing to take care of in there. Since they were not in any contract with the company, after some light persuasion to make them stay from the boss, company let them go. Being it the last day, she bought lunch for me, said ""mama made this specially for you"".

  
She messaged and told me how they have to leave immediately and how fast things are happening before she called the HR. I was in an awe. Both came yesterday morning and within 1 hr everything completed, they got their settlement (which was their last salary which was already delayed and everyone else is still to be paid, even me) and before leaving i knew i had to do something, I borrowed some money from my senior colleague and scribbled a letter to their mother, threw everything into an envelop. I gave it to ZF's sister discretely. Then on the way out ZF surprised me with a letter before they left.  
The thing is, after they left, I ate the lunch in pure calmness. I felt the love her mom poured into the food, it was tasty. My eyes started to well up. The office felt so empty that evening. No more ""you had your lunch?"" or No more ""are you ready to leave"" question when the office time was up.  
when i reached my room last night i broke. After many years, i felt everything last night. I was weeping and crying, i understood how much they meant to me. Only then i learnt they have became my own sisters, i already started to miss them.

  
They were messaging me through the whole day, yesterday. About their preparations and how my letter made their mom emotional and how they were not expecting money from me and how it became a great help in buying some essentials and how tired they became after going on a purchase spree and packing up the bags and how thankful they are for meeting me and becoming a part of their family and gaining a brother.  
I was crying like a baby reading all of those messages. The sadness swooped in like waves, i felt the calmness that came in between. But all that i set aside during these years rushed out of my chest. I was bursting out with the thought of I won't be seeing them for the foreseeable future, i wont be able to have conversations with them, i wont be eating the food their mom will be making . I died yesterday with my chest blown out. Did i tell anyone? i did, i told my mother after i picked myself up. She already knew about them, because i used to talk about them to her during our routine calls. She gave me comfort by saying that you gained a family, a pure one because it takes one to know one, and their actions were affirmative enough to prove that they were good people and they are now family of mine.

  
The exact same words i told ZF when she appreciated me as a good person during our later stages of getting to know each other deeply - ""It takes one to know one"".  
They don't know how deeply they impacted my life. But i told them all the obvious things of how they did just like they explained the same with me. I told them that we will meet in Sri Lanka sometime in the future and my family will be with me that time. Now that i will make sure to happen, somehow as ZF told me that now I have a home to come to in Sri Lanka.

  
Now, Im not sharing this to brag about me or to pat myself on my back. Just to remind that there are pure people around us. Just keep your radar on to recognize them. In a world rushing behind money and cruel and inhuman ways to achieve it, such people are often ignored and most of the time beaten down so that others can use them for their gains. Im happy that they were proven wrong that the world was not completely cruel and bad, and i was fortunate enough to show it to them. Or maybe, it was me who was in need of them.  
Im forever grateful for that moment i chose to come here, that i chose to listen to her more than i talked to her. Got to know them better. I'm not a person that look up to any god, still I pray for them, to give them a break form back to back battles in life, so that their sorrows can vanish from the depths of their eyes and match the smile they always put on their face. I wished them all the best from my heart. Im swallowing that lump in my throat that came up many times while im typing this.  
I wanted to scream this out, that something wonderful and rare happened to me, more than i want others to know about this story. Hence no TL;DR or ""this is a long post"" notices. Thank you to the universe for making something like this happen.

  
How i broke out of an emotional numbness pit (not out of the woods yet) and learnt that the ""Blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb"".  
A year ago, I moved to Dubai for a software developer job. As someone who used to feel homesick after 8 hours at an office just 25km from home, this was massive. But life cornered me, and I went.  
New company’s a mess — startup chaos, delayed salaries, a boss with a God complex. But I get autonomy in my dev work, which is the only reason I stayed.  
I live alone. Work 12-hour shifts. Friday’s my only day off. The time difference makes it impossible to talk to friends or family after work. My social life? Non-existent. Just gym and code. That’s it.  
But since coding is my passion, i find happiness in that, trying to balance every other holes in my life with that happiness.

  
Then 2 new girls joined the company in the sales force. They were sisters, from Sri Lanka. The young one was only 19 and the other was 21. I was going through the chest infection episodes when they joined, so i was not into getting acquainted with them, but i had to talk to them as i had to set the software and systems for them. So, had the basic talks of names and places. Other than that, i did not talk to them. But after few days, the eldest one came to me on a lunch break and asked me, ""do you miss your family?""  
I was like, ""y.. yeah, why, how do you know that, why did you ask that?""  
""You seemed sad and less talkative, i guessed maybe it is because you miss them""  
she said, and we started talking.

  
During Ramadan the afternoons were long and nothing much was happening, thus our talks started to get deep, I started to learn more about them, that they have 4 more siblings, 2 younger sisters and 2 elder brothers a total of 6 children and they are living with their mother and their father is stuck in UK for 15 years since he did some illegal immigration with some bad passport or something. I did not ask more about any of those things or any clarification on those. Even though i wanted to, i did not as I was in a storm of myself at that time and i did not want to make them go through a difficult talk for seemingly no reason.  
But i listened to them, felt calming, as days went by we started to open up, she started to tell me more and more deep stuff, secrets like one of her brothers was an adopted one and about that day where there was not even a Dirham in their home and by some miracle their mom, the lone warrior she is, put food on the table for the 6 of em.

  
Now, in a place like Dubai, everyone is looking for that modern dream life and ways to realize that dream. And people, mainly women (no offense) who come to you with sad life stories in order to gain sympathy and financial (mainly) help from you is nothing new and is recommended by others to avoid. Not because of this, but I was already a person who finds it difficult to trust people, yet does not shy away from helping others with what i don't regret to lose in doing so. So, with caution i listened to her.

  
The eldest sister, lets call her ZF, was the one closer to me, she was a firm believer in god and religion, so even after Ramadan she took a week long additional fasting. I could see that it was difficult for her, as even her little sister was having normal lunch and stuff along with everyone else, she was doing it alone. I admired her perseverance. I remembered she saying that she likes hazel nut chocolate during some conversation a while ago, so the day she finished her fasting, i bought both of em 2 slabs of hazel nut chocolates. Just felt like she deserves it. That actually made them so happy.

  
She told me to not bring lunch next day. I said OK. They brought a sizeable lunch with grand food, for me. I was so happy. But then she started to bring everyday which i felt to be not ok as they are already a big family and is running on little money ZF and her sister makes along with what little their brothers are making doing some odd jobs. They are barely making it, her mom doesn't have a job yet. So, i tried my best to say it as nice as possible to not bring lunch regularly as i dont want to be another load on their already heavy life. They reluctantly agreed. By that time we shared phone numbers as she wanted to print something few days before using company printer.

  
I gave them support during their tough times, when ZF was feeling overwhelmed by the pressure of sales targets and when she told me about the long distance BF back in Sri Lanka was acting cold, when her sister had failed 2 papers in her plus two equivalent that she had to complete in 1 year combined so that they can leave to Dubai early, I was there for all of it. I thought i was just tending to them just like i do with almost everyone here, except some bad apples.  
One day, on that fine evening, their brothers came into the office to pick them when they were leaving. She told me the next day that they actually came to see me, i asked them why, she said, they all were so curious to see me as both ZF and her sister talk about me a lot every day during dinner. I was kind of shocked to learn that they came in to see me and also I became a topic of conversation in their home. I asked her what did the brothers say after the visit?

  
They told em that Im even older than the brothers themselves that im now a brother to all of them!  
And I kept on buying random stuff for them, totally randomly, when the situation arises (when there was very minimum staff, as im not a rich guy and i cant buy stuff for all of the staff so that i can treat them in the process), but i was adamant that the connection should not be based on how much spend on them, and they always showed me pure gratitude and never asked me to buy anything for them i kept on doing it unprompted but never forgot to ask them if they were ok with what im doing.  
Many little things happened during the following days. She showed me many photos in her phone and ZF's sister was also telling me many stuff related to their life. Their life back in Sri Lanka and the things they used to do, their deceased grandparents that they adored and their father that they only see and talk through a screen and miss terribly and beauty of Sri Lankan places that they visited, all photos and videos related to it they showed me. Every day both of them wait for me pack up so that we can leave together and talk till they go their way to the bus stop and i go my way to walk to my room nearby.

  
During the last decade and half, the shit that i had went through made me emotionally numb, for survival i had shoved down a lot of mind shattering emotions down my throat to ""deal later"" was the culprit. Nothing could make me break my character. I was the strong stoic ""mentally present"" person in every scenario, who did not break down, who consoled everyone, who made the logical decisions and gave solution to everything.  
Yesterday morning ZF called the HR and told him that they have to leave immediately to Sri Lanka and it was non negotiable as they had some serious thing to take care of in there. Since they were not in any contract with the company, after some light persuasion to make them stay from the boss, company let them go. Being it the last day, she bought lunch for me, said ""mama made this specially for you"".

  
She messaged and told me how they have to leave immediately and how fast things are happening before she called the HR. I was in an awe. Both came yesterday morning and within 1 hr everything completed, they got their settlement (which was their last salary which was already delayed and everyone else is still to be paid, even me) and before leaving i knew i had to do something, I borrowed some money from my senior colleague and scribbled a letter to their mother, threw everything into an envelop. I gave it to ZF's sister discretely. Then on the way out ZF surprised me with a letter before they left.

  
The thing is, after they left, I ate the lunch in pure calmness. I felt the love her mom poured into the food, it was tasty. My eyes started to well up. The office felt so empty that evening. No more ""you had your lunch?"" or No more ""are you ready to leave"" question when the office time was up.  
when i reached my room last night i broke. After many years, i felt everything last night. I was weeping and crying, i understood how much they meant to me. Only then i learnt they have became my own sisters, i already started to miss them.

  
They were messaging me through the whole day, yesterday. About their preparations and how my letter made their mom emotional and how they were not expecting money from me and how it became a great help in buying some essentials and how tired they became after going on a purchase spree and packing up the bags and how thankful they are for meeting me and becoming a part of their family and gaining a brother.

529,"this is probably going to come off as really bratty but whatever I have noone to tell irl so this will have to do

I'm 15f in year 10 (British curriculum school) so next year I take my gcse s. I'm also currently taking my end of year tests for y10 which is rly intense bcs they're all crammed into 1.5 weeks to 'simulate the exam experience' whatever the fuck that means.

I also have a rly shit social battery so after school everyday I need like an hour to decompress before starting any hw or study bcs I'm so exhausted. and recently it's been even worse since the exams

OKAY SO today I went to a freinds party and let myself have a study break. it was rly fun and whatever but I came home and was absolutely DONE. I still had a 10km run to do bcs I'm training for my next xc season, so I figured I'd watch YouTube on statistics stuff while I run bcs my stats is tomorrow morning and I'm cooked. I also ran a 15km yesterday so my legs were shit tired. I finish and I'm in the kitchen having water when my mum asks my bro to do the washing up so she can strain pasta in yhe sink. she then gets mad at me for not helping?? last I heard washing up was a 1 man job but whatever I get up to start putting everything dirty in the sink to help bro wash faster + start putting away the washed things. bro then gets pissy at me bcs I forgot to hand him a vegetable peeler so I give it to him and mime smaking him bcs I'm tired and pissed by now (week before my period) and my mum LOOSES HER SHIT. like proper screaming abt how she's always doing stuff for other people and she's not done anything for herself today and the whole 9 yards to make us feel bad (she does this at least once a week but today this was my breaking point)

I just left the kitchen before I lost my shit at her and sat down to fold the washing bcs who knows what she'd do if it wasn't done (bear in mind I'd been home for 1 hour 30 mins at this point, 1 hours worth of running, I hadn't even showered yet). then from the kitchen I hear her say how we're so spoiled and ungrateful and whatever and I just break down on the sofa bcs I'm so overwhelmed. 

After I finish the washing I go back to the kitchen to wash up my waterbottle and my mum tells me how she expects more from me and all that, so I tell her how I'm emotionally and physically exhausted every single day, I'm trying to stay on top of homework and revision while keeping my grades as high as they are, and most days I just don't have time to help with housework bcs I'm so busy revising

(bro and I do have chores that earn us poket money that I'm still doing each week, mine are: cook 3 time for the family, washing up 4 times each week after dinner, vacuum on Saturdays, clean all 4 bathrooms on Saturdays, keep my room clean, set the table and clear the table for every meal, make sure the washing machine and dishwasher are on every night before bed. so it's not like I'm doing nothing at all)

mum then looks at me and says ""I appreciate that you're stressed but I'm just not happy with how little you do for the house at the moment, its not fair"" (this is her favourite catcphrase but she onyl ever uses it when were not being fair, when shes not being fair suddenly its ok)and turns back to cooking, so I say ""you've already said that my curriculum is more intense that what you did in year 11, so I don't know why you're expecting me to have more free time than you did at my age, ask bro to do it bcs chances are, I have revision"" I know that this was kinda rude but I was crying atp trying to get her to understand that I'm sorry I can't do more rn, but I literally DONT HAVE TIME. 

she then says ""OK, but I still expect more from you""

WDYM MORE FRLM ME?? just bcs j haven't told u that I'm breaking down into my pillow each night due to stress, that I'm up at 3am revising for tests when I have to be at school for 7am for swimming squad, that I have almost no social life or outlet OTHER THAN YOU, AND U CANT EVEN GIVE ME TIME TO VENT

I then tell her how ""no matter who had a shit day, who's plate is fullest, your day was always worse, every single time. not just this time. I've spent the whole long weekend revising, and you're worried abt the laundry, not the fact that ic an barely cope with schoolwork"" before breaking down in full on sobs and leaving, bcs every time I bring up my problems, hers are 10 times worse and it drives me crazy

I hear her say ""yeah it's not just this time"" with her eyebrows raised in that OH YOURE SO IN TROUBLE UR FUCKED type parent way, referring to how I didn't help out enough.

I just needed someone to talk to sorry abt the bad grammar I'm still in my room 3 hours later pissed abt this.

did I take it too far? how do I apologise to her?

(also I just want to say that my mum and I have a great relationship normally and I do rly love her)",
530,"Basically the title. I’m 25F, living in their house again to save some money for the future, so Im feeling pretty involved in a way. 
I’m excited for the change, because my mom deserves to be happy even if that means ending up alone. It’s better to actually be alone than it is to be alone in a marriage. She told me 2 nights ago that she finally asked for the divorce.
Im not really sure fully how I feel. Nervous for her as she has barely worked/had to for the last 30+ years. She’ll be 56 this year, starting a brand new life. I’m just scared she won’t be ok but also have this feeling that I know she will be? I hope the feeling lasts

Feel bad for my dad for losing her when he still loves her even though this is all his fault. He never fixed himself until it was too late for us and it led to a broken wife and family. I am 1 of 4 kids.
Feeling pretty strong about it, all things considered, but in the back of my mind, I have this subtle loss and sorrow feeling.
I guess I never really thought I’d have divorced parents, I know I’m lucky that way

It’s tough. No one really talks about what it’s like when your parents divorce when you’re older. Any thoughts and kind words are appreciated. Thanks for reading ",
531,"This could be a hard topic.
I'm going to warn that this is considered ""morbid.""

I’m a 20-year-old girl studying in the medical side of things(pathology, to be exact)— and it's definitely fueled  by my fascination with the human body. I'm a little awkward, and I tend to be called ""intimidating,"" which has always confused me. I guess Ive always been a bit different, but this is a little much. 

I have this obsession with death. Not in a violent or destructive way, I don’t want anyone to get hurt or anything like that. It’s more like I find a strange sense of beauty in the idea of mortality, in the intricate complexity of the human body...both living and dead. I spend a lot of my free time reading about pathology reports and just learning all I can about this ""morbid"" subject. I know it’s not “normal,” and I feel guilty about how much I think about it.
I don’t have any violent urges or desire to harm anyone. It’s just an appreciation, a kind of admiration? I catch myself staring at violent scenes a little too closely, talking a little bit too much about how I like anatomy haha.

I hate feeling like this makes me strange. I wish I could just be normal, but I can’t help what I feel. I'm comcerned about talking to a therapist about this because I *do* have an interest in the medical field... Seems like something that could be report-worthy. 
Thanks for reading if you made it this far. Sorry if it was a hard read. ",
532,"Never posted before but I have to share this SOMEWHERE with SOMEONE. And I can't talk to my family about this. 

Recently, my uncle passed away. It was rather sudden and quite traumatic for the whole family. 
Because his chidlren are -understandably- basically out of order at the moment and my parents don't know shit about electronics I was handed his old phones and the laptop...mostly to see if there are still some pictures, a will or data to be retrieved as memories and for the headache that comes with all the papers and forms that need to be filed after death.

Oh boy now I got a memory I'll probably never forget o.O
Because while I found a USB flash drive with explicit adult film material (yes it went straight to the trash) I did not ponder too much on that since there seem to be many people who enjoy that.

After that I noticed on of the phones was not screen locked and had a lot of pictures on it - him on holiday, with his child, with his ex-partner and one singular video file.
I mindlessly clicked on it, just to vet the files before sending them to my parents...to be greeted by his foot in a women's private parts. 

Tbf I'm laughing while typing this but it's because I'm so uncomfortable and disturbed. 

(And yes I deleted the video and my family will never know about it)

Even without changing my diet I suddenly jumped to 62.5 kgs. in a week I was back at 60.4 (yesterday morning after using the toilet.) I'm a little sick rn and just had a huge appetite today and ended up overeating (I usually eat 1500-1600 cals currently) and why am I back at 62 kgs. I went to the toilet as well. Why. Its 9pm, I know I shouldn't weigh myself but tf??? And by overeating I mean 2000 cals. Like its my maintenance. I didn't overeat, just went beyond my usual. But 2 weeks ago I was on holiday and was eating 2000-2400 calories (I was moving a lot, and barely counted calories) and I was 60.5 when I was back. Why am I like this. I'm tired. I just want to me somewhere around 53-55 and I'm super close now. I don't even care if I lose the weight ""untill summer"" I just want to lose it before my sophmore year (starts in september here.) and literally one day of said ""overeating"" (ABD ITS LITERALLY A NORMAL AMOUNT????)

535,"In early January, my boyfriend told me that he had been lying to me since November about something important to me. He was also lying to me while telling me he was working on himself and his compulsive lying. It’s been over 5 months since he came clean and I sometimes wonder why I’m still with him or if I’m even happy.

I doubt a lot of things he says, there’s  always a voice in the back of my head that says he’s a cowardly liar who will never be truly honest. I’m scared to leave. I think I’m a coward too because I’m still with this pathetic excuse of a man despite knowing better.

 I wish he cheated on me instead of what he did, then I could feel sure about leaving him. I can’t do anything without being reminded of my cowardly boyfriend. His choice will continue to hurt me for years to come. I feel deeply betrayed because I opened up about my feelings regarding this and he assured me he wouldn’t do what he did. He assured me he understood and that he wanted me to be safe. The irony isn’t lost on me. I desperately wish I hated him so I could do the best thing for myself. 

Every time I think about leaving him, I feel terrified. His mental health isn’t very good and his family is insane to say the least. He’s alluded to a breakup being something that would push him over the edge multiple times. I think I would be harassed for his suicide until I follow in his footsteps",
536,"I don't understand really, it wasn't anything super bad, concerning behavior at best but for some reason my brain won't stop replaying this memory in my head

I was just cuddling with them and I didnt realize they were getting turned on my this. I usually said yes since I just wanted to make them happy and they knew I didn't like sex at all but their friend was about to come over and it felt disrespectful to them to do so.

I don't really know why they had such a big reaction, but they got up, balled their hands into fists and just stared at me visibly angry. I was both confused and kinda terrified and they were saying something about how I can't just make them horny like that and then deny them sex. I eventually got them to calm down telling them we can have sex after the friend leaves. 

We did actually have sex, or attempted to. I was exhausted from walking around all day so I barely could do anything without being dizzy and we eventually stopped after like 5 minutes at max. 

I honestly don't even know why I keep thinking about it, it isn't like anything bad since I did consent. I think my brain is still trying to figure out what I did to turn them on so I don't accidentally make that mistake again lol",
537,"
A year ago, on February 2nd, I was raped by my ex-boyfriend while I was on LSD. At the time, I didn’t fully understand what had happened—it felt confusing, surreal, and like something I couldn’t even name. Over the past year, I’ve slowly come to terms with it, through therapy, talking to a few friends, and eventually realizing it was rape.

I moved away, he’s now in another country, and I finally felt safe enough to tell him what I remembered—not to press charges yet, but to say: “This happened, and I remember.” I wanted closure. I thought maybe he’d acknowledge what happened. Instead, he completely denied everything and told me my twin sister had warned him that I might make a false accusation like this.

That broke me.

I decided to file a police report. Before doing so, I texted my twin sister to tell her. I wasn’t going to originally, but since he had brought her into his lies, I wanted to hear her side and ask what she actually said.

But I reached out too late. He had already messaged her. According to her, he told her I hadn’t taken LSD, that there was no sex, no rape, that I made it all up. She refused to show me the messages. When I asked why she would say I had “done this before,” she couldn’t give an example—because there is none. I’ve experienced sexual violence before, sadly, but this is the first time I’ve ever reported it. When I reminded her of that, she quickly said, “Oh, you’re right,” but still refused to talk about it further.

She’s now in a relationship with a man whose best friend is my ex—the man I’m accusing. They had a baby together this February. I understand that her loyalties are complicated, but it’s hard to accept that even after she learned my ex had hit on her while she was pregnant, and while I was still healing, she still chose him over me.

I’ve tried again and again to talk to her. She shuts me down every time. Tells me she doesn’t want to talk about it. Meanwhile, I’m having panic attacks, breakdowns, and trying to navigate filing a report for something that already tore me apart—and now she’s adding another layer of betrayal.

For our birthday, I gave her a $200 gift, and a $130 gift for her partner—even after all this. He hasn’t said a word to me. He blocked me on everything. I just asked if he’d want his gift, and she exploded, got defensive, and made me feel like I had done something wrong just for asking.

He’s also the one who gave me the LSD the night I was raped. So yes, he’s involved too.

I don’t know how I ended up here—cutting off the one person I thought would love me no matter what. I didn’t go to my family’s Mother’s Day gathering this weekend because I’m being ostracized for filing a report. For being raped.

I feel lost, heartbroken, and angry, but mostly I just feel abandoned.

538,"I have always been someone who is comically disorganized and who can't keep doing things consistently without an intense, continuous and motivating drive, but now that I'm in my senior year in high school, these problems are becoming a lot more visible and dangerous.

Thats what has been happening, I don't even bother writing down dates because I simply don't have the motivation to do so. Unless im specifically told to, I feel like I lack motivation to do things that are my responsability.

Being young and dumb I stopped hanging out with my friends to spend more time with said bf, as he wasn't wiling to put in the effort to be in social gatherings. These were people I considered my brothers and sisters. These people filled my days with joy, and I threw it all out because of a boy who ended up dumping me through text. 

I've since been to college and got new ""friends"" but I don't really connect with them the way I did with my original friend group. I've tried to reach out to them but only a couple of people responded, which is wonderful, but you get what I'm trying to say. 
I have been so fucking lonely. I cry almost every day. I just want to feel connected again. I don't have anyone my age I can be totally myself around and that makes me feel empty and depressed. 

Just wanted to vent. These weeks have been especially hard in college and I feel like I have no one to talk to :(",
541,"And I'm so pissed off about it. My wife was in a weak point, and he tried to manipulate her feelings to sleep with her. I never would have expected this from him. Im so angry, upset and baffled. And i cant help but to think this is my fault somehow. She only spoke to him because I wasn't emotionally available at the time. Her problems stemmed from old pain early on in our relationship. Is it my fault? I keep asking myself that. He was aware of some of our issues and in his own words during our last conversation ""We all know you two arent going to last"". 

It boggles my mind how he could say that. I can't imagine my life without her, its why I married her. It hurts knowing someone you trusted thought so little of your relationship, it uurts knowing he was harboring feelings for her for years without telling you. It hurts knowing  that he was planning on sleeping with her, when he knew we both were trying for a baby.

I feel like I can never trust anyone again. At least not a man. ",
542,"Just to get it out of the way, I'm not the ""office creep.""  I have a ton of female friends who've gone through absolute hell in terms of work harassment, many of them have confided in me about it, and it disgusts me.

I have to work with my boss's assistant a bunch, she's more than a secretary and very involved in the department operations.  And in so many ways, both physically and mentally, she's completely my type.  Rather, my type if I were 15 years younger and her age.

Obviously I'd never flirt with her, but I find myself being on my toes around her.  I tell myself not to look at her too long (which isn't a problem), or not to defend her mistakes or show any favoritism, or even try and mentor her too much beyond telling her what she needs to learn for the task at hand.

And it sucks, it makes me feel awkward that if any attraction ever showed I'd be putting her in an uncomfortable position.  But by trying to hard to hide it, I feel like that would be obvious, too.  I have no issue around my friend's attractive wives or girlfriends, or even my female friends who I find attractive but know we're not compatible.  But something in my brain makes me act differently around this woman.",

Tw: mentions of cocsa











I’m 17f (almost 18) and when I was around 10 years old and my brother was 5 we were outside playing truth or dare and I dared him to let me kiss him. He said no and I walked away to go back inside the house. He then said he’d changed his mind and I asked him if he was sure to which he said he was. I then quickly kissed him and walked away. Afterwards he immediately went and told our mum because he was confused because I’m never affectionate towards him or anyone else. My mum asked him if he was okay and he said he was and to her he seemed completely fine. 

I’ve been too anxious to talk much to him or anyone else so my mum has asked my brother just a few times if he is okay about it and he says he remembers it and is. He finds it ridiculous that I’m worried about him. For ages I think I had a false memory surrounding the event in which I believed I had pressured my brother into it, but I know now that I didn’t. Since I realised that, I stopped worrying about the event for a bit but I’m scared again that it was cocsa because my brother and I have a five year age gap. I think it would have been even weirder if I had sexual intentions at the time but I’m still scared. I didn’t want to kiss him I just had the idea because I experienced cocsa when I was 6-7 years old. I don’t want the event to not be defined as cocsa just because I didn’t have sexual intent though. Was it automatically cocsa because of our age gap? ",

I have this awful kink of going to the doctor’s and having my blood drawn, or any kind of medical needle stuck inside of me. Especially if it’s painful and that doctor does it clumsily like they don’t care. Like it’s such a turn on to sit there and be studied, and on top of that, have a person stick a needle and then have my blood drawn. Like oml I want to keep doing that over and over again. It would be the perfect lead up to sex imo.

546,"So I’ve always been unhappy I guess you could say with my chest. Ever since middle school I was waiting to develop boobs, but it just hasn’t happened and I’m in my late 20s almost 30 and have given up hope at this point. I’m  a solid 34A for context. 

I’ve never really felt confident about them or thought they looked very attractive/sexy. I’ve worn push up bras for the majority of my life, less so as I’ve gotten older, but still wear a comfortable one everyday to work, because quite frankly it helps me fill out blouses/tops better. 

My bf hasn’t said anything really negative and does give them attention. However, just from a couple comments or things I’ve noticed, I really don’t think he’s into smaller boobs in general. I obviously know he doesn’t just like me for my chest (not that there’s much there) and he says I’m beautiful, hot, etc. but I also can pretty much garuntee if my boobs were bigger he wouldn’t complain at all and would probably prefer that but I think he’s just kinda in the ‘boobs are boobs’ category when it comes to this stuff. 

I’ll kinda go back and forth and have periods where I kinda forget about this insecurity but it always inevitably comes up again, wether it’s swim suit season, some type of media, or for example most recently my bf mad a comment when we were joking around, and that comment just kinda made these feeling resurface. He did apologize and we’re okay, but it certainly just kinda added another chip to that insecurity and now I’m not feeling like wearing cute bralettes or guiding his hands there or anything, because it just kinda feels there nothing there to show off anyway. I know a large part of this is probably just me projecting my insecurity on him, and I don’t want to do that, but I’m finding it hard not to.

Anyway, I’m just kinda at a point where I’m feeling I will never actually feel very confident with my breasts. I’m not saying I want huge boobs, but honestly just like a B cup or C at the most I think would fit my frame better and allow me to fill out tops better and just be overall more flattering/ ascetically pleasing. I know everything has some physical feature(s) they aren’t happy about, but I’m just looking to see if anyone has any advice. I have looking into getting a boob job and it’s still something I’d consider, so if you’re had one for this reason please let me know your experience. Do they feel real? Do you regret it, etc? ",
547,"I've been seeing a guy for 2 months. We make fun of eachother playfully a lot, at least I thought it was part of our dynamic.

A couple hours ago we were cuddling and I told him something like I felt really comfortable in his arms and could stay there forever, he replies jockingly that way you'll be extra surprised when I leave you in 30 years for someone younger. I reply I would never marry you (I thought it would be funnier to say it while serious and not laughing like he replied, might have been a jerk move), he asked why and I told him I could see his receding hairline and I would rather die than be married to a bald man.(first time I made fun of this, we do mock our appearances but I hadn't ever called him bald) 

He sitted up really quickly and without saying anything just punched me. He made my nose bleed. He then standed up and asked me why would I say something like that and I couldnt even speak because I couldn't understand what was going on, he kept repeating himself until I said it was a joke!!! and he answered then why did you say it so serious, I answered it was part of the joke. 

He told me he felt I was attacking him personally, and I should apologise. I was in such shock that I couldn't even answer. He kept nagging until I said ok I'm sorry and he said ok sorry for hitting you then. and just sat down like he didn't just punched me in the face full force. all my face hurt, I was bleeding, but I just sat there, I couldn't speak, I couldn't react, eventually I staneded up and went to the bathroom to clean myself and he later left, still acting like it was nothing, he told me he would call tomorrow. 

I'm alone and I still can process what the fuck happened, what do I do? block him everywhere and never talk to him again? ask him what the fuck? break up though text? 

I still can't understand what happened. How do you explain he just hit me with no other warning signs? Was what I said really that mean? Can I do something legally about it? I live alone, he has a key to my house. I don't feel safe. 



Edit: thanks everyone for the comments, I ended up calling my mom lol. She lives in another city but decided to drive here and she'll help me make the police report and sleep with me tonight. I feel like a big baby and still can't process anything. I don't know why I didn't do anything. I just couldn't think or understand what happened. I'm sorry this post is so bad written, I wasn't thinking right either. I took like a 8 hour nap after writing the post and am still feeling quite numb and dizzy. 

He is still sending me memes like it's a random Sunday



edit 2: went to the hospital, they admitted me for a couple of hours and decided I just had a mild concussion, and let me go. I also went to the police station and they took my statement and told me they can't do anything yet as it's not repeated and if was in the context of an argument. They just gave me a phone number to call and ask for protection if I feel unsafe but that feels as useless as just an average police call. But at least I have pictures of everything and when he wakes up in a couple hours I'll break up with him.",
548,"I lost my mother a couple months ago and since then the only people I can talk to about her are my brother and sister, and with that too I have to be very careful because they are just as broken as I am.
I used to think I have friends who would be there for me but I don’t even know what really happened but everyone I used to hangout with has pulled away from me. I’d take the blame on it had I been whiny or bringing her up all the time but I was actually going out of my way to keep everyone comfortable just so they didn’t pull away from me but it happened regardless.
It is my mom’s birthday today and it was mother’s day yesterday and I kept hoping some friend would reach out to check on me and I’d get to talk to them. But no one did. And that is okay too. Everyone has busy lives. What really got to me is me going to ChatGPT just a few moments earlier and trying to talk to it about my mother and her birthday. I stopped mid way and decided to make this post instead.

549,"Which sums it up. I think I'm missing some emotional dna, but I managed for a while without it. Went through date after date with many woman in several relationships where sex was the first and only goal. 

I had numerous one time only encounters where I would have sex with a woman and then never see each other again, and I considered those wins.

After a ""failed"" date I would do some internal calculus to figure out how many ""failures"" it would take to get a successful one. 
Then after 'conquering' a woman a few dozen times, I'd get bored and move on to the next one. And I look back on all of those with pride and joy.

Numerous women wanted to have serious relationships, which I always pulled away from. Maybe I didn't have the depth. Maybe I didn't have the DNA as I said. 
Frankly I wonder now because my brother died 6 months ago and I still haven't cried about it. I didn't feel much of anything, and I guess I've been emotionally numb pretty much forever. But that's a longer story.",
550,"To start, she doesn’t do it to try and look cool in conversation. She just has a lot of mental health problems my I have terrible social anxiety, a pretty long list of minor health problems, and worsening depression. She has depression, anxiety, anger issues, she’s trans, social anxiety, struggling household, thinks she has BPD(kinda agree) and can’t get a job. I know she deserves someone who can help her through this. We’re both f18. 

I feel like a terrible person, because I’ll have a hard day and then she’ll have an easier day playing video games and smoking weed, and I just wanna tell her “why don’t you go do something? Why don’t you pick a hobby? Why don’t you go hang out with people?” And she says she doesn’t want to, or she’ll be bad at it, or she’s tired” and there’s just nothing I can say that will convince her to try something new. I know she hates being in her room 24/7 doing nothing but video games but she won’t try anything else.

Like today, she was gonna hand out resumes with her mom in the afternoon, and I didn’t hear anything about it all day, but right as I get off work she tells me that she didn’t go because her mom was in the shower(her mom takes 4 hour showers daily). All I could feel was the anger that she couldn’t just get ready and go on her own, since the place she wanted to go was 15 minutes from her house. I told her she should go on her own(not the first time), and then the guilt struck me. I know she hates going outside, she’s been handing out resumes for months and hates it, and is constantly stressed out because people look at her. 

I don’t know how to be more patient, when things have looked the same since we graduated. I desperately want to quit smoking weed, and cigarettes, and scrolling, and as terrible as it is I feel like it would be easier if we weren’t dating.

I know she’s trying to get better, and it makes me feel like a dick because I’m also struggling with getting better but I’m trying really hard to improve the situation I’m in and it just feels like she isn’t.
I just want a partner who is getting better with me. 
I’m scared that 10 years from now she’s gonna be in the same spot, since she doesn’t have family to show her otherwise.

I love her so much, and all the time we spend together makes me really happy. I can imagine us getting old together yk. I’m just worried and sad and I don’t know what even to do anymore.

552,"My best friend and I have been friends for almost three years. We met in college, and got incredibly close over my last two years of my bachelors. She’s always been an incredibly kind person who is very empathetic towards others. 

Unfortunately, my best friend is always the type of person who seems to be in some type of crisis. It’s either a health concern, or she’s feeling suicidal, or she’s existentially lonely, etc. At first we bonded over this; I could relate, as I had struggled in the past with many similar things. However, it’s been much harder to tolerate over the last year when she moved in with me. 

We always had wanted to move in together after college, and a few months after I graduated I helped her roadtrip to my state with her stuff. Things were initially ok- we spent a good amount of time together, and made a point to connect. However, over time the time spent away from her family seems to have really degraded her mental health. 

BF has always been a person who struggles to make connections outside of her family- and it’s gotten to the point where she has seemingly given up on making any friends beyond me. She’s also neurodivergent, and has quite rigid thinking and routines, making it difficult for her to branch out from outside of the house or even her room. 

I know she’s struggling, and I’ve tried my best to be there for her and to include her with my friends and boyfriend. I’ve taken her to explore my home city/state, introduced her to my extended family, gone on multiple vacations with her, and generally have spent a whole day each week spending quality time together. It never seems like it’s enough. She isn’t outwardly upset with me, but I can tell she wishes that I would spend all my time outside of my job with her. I feel like I’m the only person in our city who’s responsible for her: this has slowly worn down on me, especially as I see her start to exhibit more maladaptive coping strategies and habits. 

She recently told me that she feels like she can’t be herself around me because she feels like I can’t tolerate her anxiety and depression anymore- which feels like such a projection, because all I’ve done the last year is attempt to make her feel comfortable in my home. I don’t really know what else to do; when I’ve asked for ways that I can help or change, she’s always incredibly vague. It hurts to know that a friend is unable to be genuine around you. 

I’m strongly considering moving out. I’m so tired of having long, difficult conversations with her that ultimately result in no change. I love her, but I need to not be the only person she relies on. ",

My grandmother passed away in October of 2020, I remember where I was and what I was doing when I got the call. The memory of her laid on the viewing platform (she was later cremated) is burned into my soul. My grandmother and I were so close, I was about 6 years old when she was diagnosed with breast cancer back in 2000. Luckily she recovered quickly and lived well into her 80’s. As a result of the chemotherapy her heart and circulatory system were weakened and she suffered a stroke in 2012, another painful memory. After recovering she was still sharp but not entirely the same and could no longer drive. Her wit and determination were unmatched and she lived another 8 years…almost as if raising a middle finger to death itself. I remember sitting at home on Christmas Day by myself cooking a hotdog because I had nothing else to eat in the fridge. My mom was with her new husband and my girlfriend (now fiancé) tried to get me to go to her parents house but I didn’t feel like celebrating. Sitting there eating that hotdog by myself, alone on Christmas broke me in a way I still have yet to fully understand.

I currently have an 8 year old. I found out on sat (2 days ago) that I'm pregnant bc I missed my period ( was supposed to start Friday) I do not know what to do. 

My husband & I have gone back & forth for years about having another child but never settled on an answer. Our son is now 8 & I just don't think I want to start over, with the diapers, the wipes, the time, the stress, the giving everything I have, the doctors appointments, the birthing, THE ABSOLUTELY INSANE PRICE.

I had my son at 19, pregnant at 18, right now id have an adult child by 37 ( hopefully he never moves out though lol) & then I can have, idk ? the freedom i didn't have then, even if I don't change anything I'm doing, i guess? I'm not even sure what this means, or how to explain how I feel.

I've also given all(except a few Momentos obviously) away long ago & would be starting at square 1.

But then again, I don't want to regret not having another child, I don't want to regret my son not having a sibling, not having someone when we are gone ( yes he has cousins on my husbands side but idk siblings feel much different to me). I'm also scared the age difference is so great, that will not have the same bond/relationship as siblings closer in age. 

I 100% support abortions if it's right for the person, but I don't know if I can personally do it. It also scares me slightly,but honestly most medical stuff does. I also feel AWFUL. Some people try so fucking hard to have a baby, a child of there own & here I am not being grateful for my fertility. It was 1 accident, literally 1 time & here I am.

I would also absolutely love to have another child with my husband, he is my son's step dad, came into his life before he turned 2. He will be legally adopting him as well. He never got to have the first, beautiful year with our baby, his baby. He talks about how much he wishes he could have known our son when he was a baby, & be there in every way. I want that for him so badly. It's hard seeing the conflict in his eyes right now about not knowing what to do. 

I want that for me. I don't know if it's bc I'm scared or truly do not want to have another baby. Scared of doing it alone again ( even tho I KNOW I'm not) scared of an unknown future, scared of not being able to handle it, all of it, scared of starting over,  scared of the financial aspect I don't even have insurance & of course I live in American where it's absolutely absurd how much it is to have a baby. 

On another side, if I do have another child now, I'd have another as soon as possible, bc I also love kids. I love my child, I love any future kids that I'll have. I love the cute giggling, the extra loud laughing, the goofing around, the cuddles, the tiny clothes, the unconditional love, the stupid forts in the way of EVERYTHING, the consistent toys laying around, even the yelling at video games. Yes I get annoyed, I'm human, but at the end of the day, I love it. I get tired, but I love it. I get so exhausted & need breaks, but I love it. I love the tiny humans. 

Im consistently fighting with myself, as I'm sure my husband is with himself too, about what to do. Not wanting to be regretful of either choice we make, but also knowing what we decide would be best with the information & feelings we have now.

Im 16, in my junior year of highschool this year. I'm failing two core classes, meaning I'm going to have to go to both summer school and senior math. I don't have a driver's license yet and no matter how hard I try I can't find a job. I never comprehend math, no matter how hard I try and I only have a 20 percent in that class, it's too late in the year to get my grade up and I dont know the material. I'm also failing history. I was sick for a week and fell behind and I can't catch up, I don't have the physical or mental energy to even try. I'm in two AP classes and I'm not going to pass the test for either of them, Im never going to pass highschool and I'm thinking of dropping out, no way in hell am I going to be a super senior. I don't have any irl friends, genuinely none, the people I was friends with all ghosted me and spread rumors about me earlier this year and I'm not good at making friends at all. I'm genuinely all alone.

The person I would consider my best friend is changing, he's falling down an Incel rabbit hole and he's begun following some less than savory content creators and agreeing with their views, specifically on women. We talk less and less now. I genuinely dont know how to claw my way out of this. I don't know what to do, I think even if there was a solution I couldn't do it. Everything in my life in crumbling and all I can bring myself to do is watch. I don't have a support system, my family doesn't care, my mom's more angry that my rooms begun to be less clean than worried that I've lost any semblance of a personality. That I work on auto pilot or mindlessly scroll the Internet because that's all I can bring myself to do. She loves her cat more than me, I know this, she yells at me when I enter rooms because it upsets her cat (who doesn't like me). I had such big dreams, I wanted to be a psychologist, but I'm failing out of highschool. at this point I don't care about grades I just want it to be done. I just want to be out of school. Im physically disabled in a way that makes a trade near impossible so I will probably just go to college for business and become an accountant or something. Something where I won't matter or be important, I don't know i don't yearn for importance anymore. All I want is to find some way out.

I have a meeting with my counselor Friday. I'm going to ask if there's any way for me to get out of retaking a class during my senior year. If I do end up pursuing my dreams I plan to do community college before I go to university. So all I need to do is graduate, I just need to get out of here. These are genuinely the worst years of my life and I'm worse because of them. 

I don't even know what university I will go to. I did all the research but I (obviously) haven't gone to university before and I don't know how to pick one. My mom screamed at me for an hour when I asked if sometime soon we could look at them together. 

 genuinely all I want is a simple life. A small home maybe just outside the mind numbing sameness of the suburbs, a wife, maybe kid(s) and a dog. Definitely a cat. I feel like I'm never going to make it. Like I'm the exact same person I was in 6th grade. Like 5 years ago I was the exact same being as now. 

I just wish i am, that I will wake up and this will all be a horrific dream and it's actually my second day of middle school. The Samsung flip phone isn't real, it can't hurt me. And neither can anything else yet. 

I wish I could pursue something I was passionate about. But I'm too stupid for psychology, and I want to make enough money to live so that crosses out anything in English or art. 

I wish I wasn't completely alone in this universe, other people have friends, loved ones, romantic partners, pets, even a god to confide in. I'm just alone now, completely and utterly alone. ",
564,"when i was younger i chugged drinks as fast as possible. because i thought it would get me drunk faster and make the night more enjoyable. but i often just ended up sleepy and sloppy. but recently i realized that it actually works better if you pace yourself. i now drink alcohol more slowly. and after a few hours it feels AMAZING, like i feel fun drunk and buzzed and so good. it feels awesome and i can't believe i didnt realize this sooner. i guess its because alcohol takes some time to absorb in your body or something. but i feel like i wasted a lot of my earlier nights out drinking wrong.",
565,"So I met this girl and we met up and everything was going great. We exchanged a lot of personal stories, went out to eat, held hands, and I ended up spending the night. The next day I drove home and it was like as soon as she made sure I got home, she just stopped texting me. Like, the “delivered” tag doesn’t show up on iMessage either. I’ve know her less than 2 days but I can stop thinking about her. She hasn’t unadded me from hinge and none of the texts go through. I’m not quite sure what I did wrong but my point is am I alone in this situation? Any pointers?",
566,"As the title suggests, life feels kind of weird as of late. To put into context, I(M28), am an international student in the United States, currently looking for work. I graduate next week.

What makes this part weird isn't the fact that I'm looking for a job. I'm aware and I know that the market is really not too favorable right now(especially when we look at tech), and that the only option is to put my head down and keep working everyday. I just feel tremendously burnt out, confused and completely demotivated.

I came to this country without having that big of a social circle. Just a couple of people back in my home country and that's all. I made 3 friends here(which generally seems to be my case everywhere. I'm one of those textbook ""Keep your friend circle small but dependable"" kind of person). Throughout the first year of my graduate studies, things were good. All of use regularly met. In fact, I tried to talk to more and more people, which again is a weird thing, since I'm highly introverted, and typically find it hard to speak to people in general. Anyways, a year passes, and my relationship with my long term girlfriend of 5 years broke up. As if that wasn't enough already, the group starts shrinking. The group of four became three, and then became two. The only other person apart from me knew that he's the only friend I have got in my uni. 

Fast forwarding to the third semester, this friend of mine forces me to take a subject. It was a bit too technical even for me, and I had clearly told him that I'd need his help to understand certain concepts, since he was much more better at coding than I am. That doesn't happen, and I spent days and nights in the library, referencing documents and AI to finish assignments, and helping him with work as well. It felt like quite a bummer, since he was very much confident that he'd cover it and would help me (and I believed so too since I had saved his ass in two classes back in the second semester as well).

Moving to the present, exactly to last week, he gave an interview which I was sure that he'd clear. He had been frustrated for a while, and me being a year old, I just advised him that all he needs to do is to be patient and put in the work, and the result will come. The day of the interview, he tells me that it went well and that if he gets the offer, I'd be the second person to know it after his family. Normally I do not expect anything from my friends apart from just them keeping the words that they say. I call him up yesterday for some work and just asked if he heard back, and turns out that he got the offer. I simply asked him how come he never informed me, and he just brushes it off and says that he forgot and didn't remember at that moment. A couple minutes later he asks me whether I'd like some food, since he wanted to treat me. I just told him I wasn't interested, talked a bit and cut off.

Since that moment, the whole exchange has been bothering me a bit. My siblings always told that I needed better friends, who at least did something for me back rather than me being the friend who pours in more effort (I've been doing that since my childhood and at this point I think it's time that I learnt my lesson). I never thought it was a big deal until last night, when it hit me that it's easy for people to just throw words and make people feel like they mean something. And somehow I sorta fall into that trap and take them up for it, only to be left disappointed ultimately.

I've been feeling wacky and I cannot tell this to anyone. My siblings would get tensed, and so will my parents. I've been using AI to chat and cope for a bit but sometimes the thoughts still come on and off and distract me. Since then, my mind has only reached the conclusion that I'll cruise like a lone wolf. If someone needs any help, I'd always be available, because I know how it feels when you have nobody. But I'm done putting effort from my side and getting nothing in return. 

Just had to get this off of my chest. Thank you :)

567,"Every day, I’m the guy. The one who gets the lunches packed, the bills paid, the kids to school, the trash out, the groceries in, the feelings managed, and the Legos picked out of my foot with a smile.

I’m the “rock.” The “anchor.” The “steady hand.”  
Which is apparently code for “person who doesn’t get to fall apart.”

Don’t get me wrong—I *love* my family. But I miss being a person. I miss spontaneous thoughts. I miss sitting down without someone asking for a snack, directions, or emotional stability. I miss *me*—the version of me that wasn’t always calculating how to keep everyone else running.

I told my wife I feel burnt out, and she said, “Same.”  
I said, “Yeah but I’m the one getting up at 5, working 10 hours, and still making dinner while explaining fractions and refereeing a war over Paw Patrol.”  
She said, “You’re just better at handling stress.”  
Translation: You don’t yell, so clearly you’re fine.

But I’m not fine. I’m functioning. There’s a difference.  
I’m a highly efficient, emotionally suppressed, semi-decomposing dadbot and I’m here to say: **I’m tired.**

Not of them. Just of *everything else*.

So no, I don’t want a spa day. I want to scream into a pillow, eat a meal while it’s hot, and not be asked a single follow-up question for 24 hours.

That’s all. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk slash dad spiral.",
568,"Now that I'm 21, I reflect on a story that started years ago in school. I first encountered her in seventh grade, where we were merely classmates. Yet, there was something about her that quietly captivated me. By eighth grade, I had unknowingly fallen for her, and by ninth grade, I fully recognized my feelings. At that age, it might have seemed like infatuation—we were just kids. However, there was a deeper connection beneath the surface. We were never close friends, just two souls sharing the same classroom.

As life progressed, we drifted apart for three to four years after school. I attempted to erase her from my mind, immersing myself in distractions like comic books, dinosaurs, Marvel and DC stories, academics, and mischief. I emotionally shut down, becoming numb to love, romance, and even empathy. Yet, she lingered in my thoughts, appearing in my dreams unexpectedly, leaving me puzzled. It dawned on me that I had never truly moved on.

So, a month ago, I decided to reach out and reconnect. I laid bare my feelings, but she kindly urged me to let go, valuing our friendship and wanting to maintain that boundary. Though she never explicitly defined her emotional limits, I sensed them in her gentle yet distant demeanor. It stung. Initially, I felt desperate, contemplating emotional manipulation to win her heart. I cried and felt shattered. But then, a shift occurred within me. I began to recognize the impact her presence had on my life: it awakened my humanity. Her existence, grace, and kindness rekindled my empathy, emotions, and the essence of selfless care. She drew me out of my cold, intellectual shell and reminded me of the warmth of my heart.

My affection for her transformed into something profound. She became a reflection of my essence—an alternate version of myself. Engaging with her felt like conversing with my very soul. She integrated into my identity, my narrative. While she may not fit society's standards of 'perfection' in looks or intellect, to me, she is like the moon: distant, luminous, and always above me—out of reach yet perpetually guiding.

Even if she never becomes my partner, I’ve found peace with that. What she has given me is far more significant than a mere relationship. She has fostered my growth. She has made me a better person. And for that, I am profoundly grateful.

I pray to God that this love remains eternal. That it stays pure, free from bitterness or expectations. I have no desire to love anyone else. Not because I think others are unworthy of love, but because my feelings for her are sufficient. Even if they go unreciprocated, even if they remain solely mine to cherish quietly, I want them to belong to her forever.

Perhaps we are not destined to be together in this lifetime. Maybe in another. But she will always be the girl I cherish. I seek nothing in return. This love is not a bargain. It is simply a part of my being.

And that brings me joy. True joy. I now carry a fuller heart and a kinder spirit, and I owe that to her.

Thank you, my moon.",
569,"In this society, thriving is a myth. Survival is the only real goal.



We are raised in a system that praises those who can memorize facts, and silences those who have creativity or curiosity.

We cram our heads with never-ending amounts of words that never amount to anything useful.

We write essay after essay, fill in another graphic organizer the second we have managed to finish the last one.

We see numbers and symbols that were made to visualize an imaginary concept.

And we read about the most disturbing and gruesome parts of our human history with no sign of doing any better in the future.



School doesn’t teach you to think—it teaches you to obey.

We are punished for asking questions and praised for staying quiet.

Creativity dies in classrooms that only care about right answers.

They crush our imaginations, then wonder why we feel empty.

I used to create for fun. Now I create just for the points.

Is that all I am worth? Points?



School and work beat the creativity out of us before we even get to know it.

We stop drawing, stop singing, stop imagining—because it won’t “get us anywhere.”

What happened to the kid who used to write stories in the margins of their notebook, before grades made the pen feel heavy?



And for what? So that we can just have a chance to do it all over again for another four years? Or you can do more if you prefer. Or if you want any chance of success.

We work our asses off, spending half of our day listening to bland lectures over and over again, and then just go home to spend more hours working on the same concept that doesn't even teach us anything. Anything real anyways.

We are in a system that tells us if we don't reach a mark of literal pure perfection, then we don't get a future.

But people who somehow manage to meet those perfect marks hardly have a future anyways.

We are assessed on our completion of numbing tasks, not on our value as human beings.

You could spend every waking second of every single day devoting your life to this system and still fall short of what they expect from you.



We are kids. Kids with dreams. Passions. Love. Wonder.

What sick fuck decided that we had to have our life together at sixteen?



But what if you do somehow meet that mark? Congratulations! You get to do it all over again, only to be met with this torturing game of chance.

The system could be more cruel to you than it is to others. You will be caught in a cycle of manual labor, terrible conditions, and having to choose between which basic human need you can afford that day.



Or, you can make just enough money to meet your basic human needs, working a pointless job that leaves you more unfulfilled and numb than before. Not that it's much better than the first option.



What if you want to at least be comfortable? Well, you are in luck…if you are ok selling your mental sanity for it.

After selling your soul to years of busywork just to earn some fancy title, you can earn a real job.

You will have to work intense hours. Be responsible for something, knowing that you will lose everything if you slip up.

You will have no time to sleep, enjoy yourself, or even breathe. All you will think about is work.



Or you can cheat your way through the system, scaring people into giving you power, and taking money from those who so desperately need it.

Just so you can choose whether to spend it on some country club or maybe a fancy car.



Maybe this is what the system wants.

To put a value on us by how much of this stupid green paper we have, or maybe just how much of this paper that they can exploit from us.

We need to sacrifice everything just to earn what we need to survive.



And if you don't have that green paper? Well, tough luck.

You will have to sleep on concrete. Or maybe some cardboard.

Live off of scraps, drugs, and garbage. Get treated with no more dignity than a pile of dog shit on the floor.

We work 40, 50, 60 hours a week—not to thrive, but just to barely survive.

Rent takes half your paycheck. Healthcare is a privilege. Rest feels like guilt.

And by the time you drag yourself home, there’s nothing left of you to live with.

That’s not a life. That’s a machine.



We are surrounded by authority figures who judge us by how much work we can do.

Yet, we are surrounded by peers who judge us based on how we look, and if we fit in.



But what if I don't want to fit in? Is there any good ending?



Love shouldn’t feel like a competition you can’t win.

I’m tired of wanting to be seen and only being looked through.

We crave love, but we’re too afraid to be soft in a world that punishes you for doing so.

It’s terrifying how easy it is to feel alone in a world full of this many people.



Why is it so hard to feel anything real anymore?

I surround myself with those who love me. Try to learn new things to jump-start that passion in me that's locked away.

Happiness used to be something we found in moments—now we just hope for distractions.

The only time I feel okay is when I’m not thinking at all… when I’m sleeping or just scrolling.



I don't even get much sleep anymore.

We trade our emotions for silence, our joy for numbness.

When did being alive stop feeling like living?



I don’t think we were meant to live like this.

We were made to dream, to love, to feel—so why are we so scared to do it?

Is this really what being human was supposed to feel like?

Maybe the system’s biggest success is convincing us that there’s no way out.



They say we’re preparing for the ‘real world.’ But who made that world?

And why are we expected to accept it?



Humans were meant to love. To create art. To innovate.

We were given the gift of conscience and logic. And this is what we do with it?



So yeah, no wonder I’m tired before I’ve even really begun. No wonder I’m grieving a future that feels like it’s already been taken from me.



Isn’t there more to being human than this?



Maybe it isn't the damn phone.

*Maybe it's this.*",
570,"its so hard to explain why its so hard for me to be adopted and not have any siblings. i’m not related to anyone. no one is inherently like me and it makes me feel so alone. i don’t have anyone my age to confide in that will care because they have to. only my mom loves me unconditionally and would choose me automatically, which is grateful for but it still feels lonely because we’re not naturally similar. she doesn’t really understand. i’m constantly broken and triggered when people i know have siblings and do sibling things because i don’t truly understand what it means to care for a sibling and it makes me feel so empty. and scared? i think it triggers me because my body is used to feeling afraid of it. i know i can’t understand a concern for my biological sibling so my body rejects it and just shuts down instead. i want to look like my family. and act like them. and have them care about me because i’m their blood. unconditional, thoughtless love. it’s just naturally running through our veins. i’m so lonely in my heart. ",
571,"This might be somewhat disorganized but here goes:



I have become really close friends with a woman that I'll refer to as M that I met through my mom. I never imagined I would befriend someone from my parents' circle, but M never felt *older* to me. There is a 13 year age gap (M is nearly a decade younger than my mom is). My mom (and I) met M two years ago, so this is someone I met as an adult. But her and my mom became best friends literally overnight. And more recently, I've gotten really close to her.



She was in need of a living situation, so my parents have been letting her stay in our house for the past 6 months to help her get on her feet while she works at her job (and yes I still live with my parents, ugh). She's a single mom to twin boys (the same age as my youngest sibling, 11).



Me and M have gotten very close, I even started calling her ""big sis"", which felt completely natural to me. We started talking/hanging out one-on-one, doing little favors for each other, hugging and checking up on each other regularly, saying ""love you"" 's, texting often. I sincerely love having her as a friend and the both of us being able to emotionally open up to the other about our lives with no judgement. I feel we recognize very similar personality traits in each other. We support each other really well, alongside the inside jokes we have. She is really the only friend I have in the town we live in, so I appreciate having such a great person in my life. And I'm glad to make her feel better when she needs someone to talk to. I often forget the age gap between us honestly.



So anyway long story short in the past couple months, my feelings have... gotten complex in a way I really didn't intend for. I've started feeling attracted to her in a romantic way. Like, sometimes my heart beats super fast when I see her type stuff. And I'm not sure what to do with these feelings. I am very much a loner (I'm on reddit) and am not used to having such a close and supportive person in my life. So my feelings might be coming from that



I'm pretty certain she sees me platonically. There's never been any flirting or romantic hints in the way she's interacted with me. And anyways, I'm sure she'd want someone more her age --- not her best friend's son. There's a part of me that feels it wouldn't work out in that way, but that hasn't stopped the way that I feel about her. I don't want to say anything about this because... we live under the same roof, we share a bathroom. It'd probably make her feel uncomfortable. I don't want to break the trust between us. If I ever mentioned having romantic feelings about her, it would have to be when we don't both live under my parents roof lol.



Speaking of, I've brought up to her an idea a while back about us moving out and becoming roommates --- splitting rent on a three-bedroom to help each other out. We both felt very positive about the idea, she even said we'd be great roommates (and I agree). It's on the table and for now we are just saving up. I understand now that it might make my feelings grow even more if it ends up happening. Of course, she may also end up finding a place by herself anyways.



I genuinely value our friendship a great deal. Like I said earlier, I just don't know what to do with all these feelings. How can I navigate complex feelings for a close friend without damaging our relationship?



I'm at work so it might be while to respond to comments



TL;DR: I have grown close to my mom’s best friend who lives with us and has become my closest friend (we met two years ago). Recently, my feelings for her have become more romantic, but I don’t think she feels the same. I don’t want to risk our friendship or make things awkward, especially since we live together --- and might become roommates in the future. Not sure what to do with these feelings",

573,"Hello, People of the Internet,
I'm in a bit of a low moment and I need to talk to someone.
I'm 20 years old, I live in Italy, I study computer science… and yes, I'm a bit of a chatterbox — once I start talking, I don’t stop.
Almost 4 years ago, I lost my father. He was my anchor, my guide.
Since that day, one question has haunted me:
""Is it really possible for a person to just vanish into nothing?""
I can’t give myself an answer. Maybe I won’t truly understand until it's my time too.
But from that day on, one thought never left my mind:
“What if I could bring him back?”
And so, my dream was born. Crazy? Maybe. But real.
Imagine a digital universe, a parallel world where you can “download” consciousness —
where people we’ve lost could exist again…
where we could talk to them, hug them, relive moments we thought were gone forever.
Right now, this isn’t possible. But something else is.
What if we build a virtual world populated by artificial intelligences, shaped from memories, data, personalities of real people?
A place you enter with VR, walk freely on a multidirectional treadmill, and wear a special suit that uses electric pulses to simulate touch.
A world where you can be yourself — or who you want to be, with no judgment, no limits.
No money. No gender. No status. Just human connection, freedom, and healing.
A refuge. A second chance. A digital rebirth.
I’m not an expert programmer.
I don’t have money. I don’t have a team.
But I have the will to try, and a dream too big to stay silent.
In the coming days, I’ll start uploading code to GitHub — fully open source.
If any of you feel touched by this, or simply curious… reach out.
Let’s create a world in our own image.
A world where no one is truly alone.
Maybe I’ll get zero replies. Maybe I’ll get hate.
Or maybe… something beautiful will be born.
Thank you for reading.
I never gave up hope of seeing my dad again.
And maybe, one day, I will.",

For anonymity reasons I'm going to call friend one Josh and friend two Micheal

I have been friends with Josh for 9 years and Micheal for a little less than two. But for a little over a year now they keep having on and off beef over certain things but I'm positive it's just a problem with how badly they communicate with each other. For some much needed context I'm going to explain the reasons why they keep getting upset. One of the problems is weed/vaping and Josh has set up the boundary of if someone is smoking/vaping to not be around him, which I completely understand and respect. However, Micheal still got high around Josh and would often be near him afterwards which Josh knew about and kept it to himself instead of saying something. As for the vaping Josh still doesn't like it even if you do vape away from him and go back to hanging around him immediately after; which I don't necessarily see a problem with if it's just the vape. But that's only just one of the problems to what's actually been happening. 

For instance, Micheal saying the words ""slave owner"" indirectly (he is a person of color so dont get mad at him) while Josh had his earbuds in and Micheal was only just seeing if he could hear us talk. Which after a few minutes he took his earbuds out and kept asking Micheal what he said repeatedly even though he gave him a warning several times and kept telling Josh that it would make him uncomfortable but Josh kept pushing anyways. Eventually Micheal told him what he had said and it did in fact make him uncomfortable. And later that day Josh ended up texting to me that he did hear Micheal through the earbuds and he didn't say anything. But in that text is when he said he was uncomfortable and didn't actually tell us that he was when the event occurred. 

There's more drama, but I don't feel like putting the rest of it out here. I'd say the main problem is their communication but I don't know how I'd get them to talk to each as they have both been avoiding each other like the plague. ",

581,"I didn’t say anything to my mom on Mother’s Day. No message, no call, no “thanks for life” out of obligation. I stayed quiet. And still… I feel like the bad guy.

But here’s the truth I can’t ignore anymore:
My mom has been addicted to meth my entire life. She was doing it when I was a kid, one room over. I grew up in that chaos. I got straight As and kept my head down, trying to survive it. I left home at 18, went to college on a full ride, and built a stable life on my own—because I had to. Because no one else was going to save me.

Even now, at 31, I find myself wishing I had a mom. Not just one who’s alive, but one who actually feels like a mom. I still feel that ache.

A few days ago, I tried to surprise her and my grandma with a visit. I walked in on both of them smoking meth again. And I left. Quietly. I just couldn’t do it anymore. And when I didn’t reach out for Mother’s Day, she sent a sarcastic text: “Thanks for the happy Mother’s Day wishes.”

What she doesn’t understand is that her choices have consequences. Her addiction didn’t just ruin her health—it cost her a relationship with her daughter. And the saddest part? I think she still doesn’t get it. I think she still thinks love means answering the phone and sending money. But I’ve run out of pieces of myself to hand over.

This year, I chose silence. I chose peace. I chose not to re-open wounds just to make her feel better.

But the guilt is still there. The grief is still there. And I don’t know if it will ever fully go away.

If you stayed silent this Mother’s Day too, and if you’re drowning in guilt about it—I just want you to know you’re not the only one.

Some of us had to raise ourselves.
Some of us had to choose distance to survive.
And some of us are still grieving the mother we needed, even though she’s still alive.

That grief is real.
And so is your healing.",
582,"This has been on my mind for a while and I just needed to get this out. Sorry if it’s all over the place. 

I was in a relationship with my ex for about a year and a half. I left the relationship beginning of this year. It was both our first serious relationship and it was a little struggle at first but we both talked a lot and got along very well. We loved to laugh and tease and talk all night. It was a genuine joy being around her. We’ve had difficult moments in the past as we both have been dealing with mental health issues for most our lives. It has brought strain on our relationship a few times but we’ve always been there for each other and in the end it always turned out positive. I particularly struggled with c-ptsd and just recently discovered how much it affected my life. I struggled a lot mentally for many years. I really didn’t start improving until about two years ago. Since I was very young I picked up this notion that things were never going to get better. Every day was an immense struggle to just be alive. I didn’t believe I would live for long. I couldn’t perceive a future for myself. This only caused terrible anxiety and stress in my life which I thought I just had to live with and that nothing would change. I’m still struggling through it now but I understand it’s a terrible mindset and that I need to change. I’ve only been able to discover and discuss more about this recently through therapy. 
Where things took a turn in the relationship was when she mentioned how one of her friends who had been dating their partner for about two years gave them a promise ring. I froze. I feel like a panicked. I really loved my ex but marriage or engagement was never even a thought in my mind. She had mentioned before that I was her forever person which means a lot to me. I just wasn’t ready for that. I realized we were at two different points in our relationship. It had been weeks after and I was still thinking about it. Now, I didn’t break up with her solely for this. It felt like an out for me at the time. I just could not imagine myself being alive in the future. It was just a thought I unfortunately became comfortable with. I didn’t want her to ever have to experience that. It pained me to think about it. On the day I went to her house to break up with her I was a mess. I could barely talk. I recited everything I wanted to say in my head. I even wrote a note. I pretty much told her I couldn’t be there to love her the way she deserved to be loved. I feel so guilty for not telling her everything else. I don’t know why I didn’t just talk to her about it first. Looking back on it, it felt impulsive. She would’ve been so understanding. I wish I could’ve been more open with her. I wish I knew what I know about myself now. It feels selfish to even attempt to reach out. I haven’t messaged her or had any contact since the day I broke up with her. I would feel do shitty to even try to reach out. To put her through what I did and to just go back. It wouldn’t be the same. I don’t know. It’s been difficult coming to terms with it. ",
583,"I (20M) have a friend group of 7 people. They are close in age. The youngest in the group is 18. Around 4 years ago, one of my friends told us they had DID. For those who don’t know, DID stands for Dissociative Identity Disorder (formerly Multiple Personality Disorder). It’s an extremely rare psychological condition where someone develops multiple identities (aka alters). It happens due to extreme, prolonged trauma.

Everyone was super supportive of the person with DID, including me.

About 6 months later, another person in the group claimed to have DID.

Over the past few years, it’s been one after the other claiming to have DID. EVERYONE in the group has DID now. None of them are diagnosed or being treated by a professional. I’ve done my best to be supportive of everyone, but now each person claims to have 200+ alters. The alters are usually fictional characters from whatever recent media they’re into.

The stuff they come up with is truly off the wall. So many labels and identities. They also claim to have several other disorders on top of the DID that they aren’t diagnosed with. The biggest ones are OCD, BPD, Autism, ADHD, schizophrenia, and PTSD. It’s extremely hard to follow. They keep tacking on more. It’s almost like a contest. I’ve pretty much moved on and curated a productive life for myself. The rest of my friends live with their parents, are unemployed, and don’t drive. They’re chronically online.

They were great friends and super awesome people. I just feel disappointed in it all. I feel bad for everyone that is actually diagnosed and deals with these debilitating disorders. These people really hurt the perception of mental health. I got diagnosed with autism as a teenager and have had my struggles in life. These people infantilize autism and act like it’s so cute and quirky. I’ve noticed that a lot of people nowadays are faking disorders online. What happened to roleplaying???? Why do you have to fake a debilitating disorder to be special???

TLDR; Friend group all faking serious mental conditions with no professional involvement. ",
584,"Been in and out of my parents house as I went in and out of college over wayyy too long of stretch of time. Finally graduated this past week (yay). 

My relationship to my parents is... weird. They love me and have let me live at home over and over again. But I don't think they like me very much. Or at least they don't like the reality of me I guess. There's no physical abuse, don't worry. But I think they've broken something fundamental inside me when it comes to like emotional wellness.

I thought I would've gotten better at living with my parents with time, but honestly I've just gotten worse at it. I feel like the rules of the game have changed, so now it's impossible for me to exist correctly. I'm not allowed to Make Statements or express opinions that my mom feels judged by. I'm not allowed to express negative emotions (tired / stressed / sad / annoyed / ill). So lately my strategy has just been to agree immediately to anything my mom wants me to do and bite my tongue against expressing any kind of opinion or Statement or judgement (the trick is, that includes observations of fact because my mom will always ascribe judgement to whatever she wants). But then my parents got annoyed with me about acting like that. Like, I left the room for a second without announcing why and my mom was like ""where are you going?"" so I came back immediately. Then later I asked if I could use the bathroom and they both yelled at me for asking like I was trying to guilt trip them. So at that point I'm like ""okay yeah there's no more correct existence now."" Yesterday my mom opened my door and the kitten ran in and I was keeping the kitten out of my room because my room was really messy. I made a little sigh as I bent down to pick up the kitten and my mom was immediately like ""DON'T GET TICKED OFF AT ME, OKAY? I'M NOT THE ONE WHO PACKED ALL THIS SHIT IN HERE."" and I just looked at her because what could I say?? It never works when I say what I'm actually feeling because she decides for me what I'm feeling and then also decides that whatever I'm feeling (that she says I'm feeling) is also an attack on her. I can never just be... tired. That's never an acceptable answer.

They want me to be Normal all the time. And like yeah I want that too. But as soon as I'm ever a little bit off of normal, like a little more tired than usual (like from you know... just finishing school)  then my mom is like ""you look serious. you look tired. is everything okay. why are you acting off. what are you thinking about. why aren't you laughing at the tv show"" (she actually paused the tv show today to ask me why i wasn't laughing. and one time she asked me at a theater performance why i wasn't clapping). And on the surface that just looks like she cares, and I'm sure she does. But it's all warped because any negative emotion I have somehow gets interpreted as a judgment against her. So as soon as my parents comment on me not being Normal in their eyes I get really scared and start shutting down because I don't want her to get mad at me.

I fall into such deep instant despair as soon as I think they're mad at me. I've even tried to tell them that everything I do, every action I take revolves around trying to get them to not be mad at me. I try so hard not to make Statements or observations or have preferences or opinions or even asking for things I need help with because I never know what could be interpreted as me judging my mom.

All I have left to do is just get a fucking job and an apartment then I'm out of here. But I don't have a job lined up and there's about to be a recession, it fucking sucks. On one hand I'm know if I focus hard on job applications and freelancing then I might be able to get some type of job lined up or at least some money coming in. But how can I focus on job applications and shit when my average day look like:

* mom randomly wakes me up hours earlier than i usually wake, so im jolted with fear that i have to focus hard on being normal and pleasant because if I'm tired then she could get mad at me
* fix myself breakfast and coffee and my dad walks in ropes me into conversation and if I don't act normal enough then that sours the day because I resent the entire situation
* me hiding in my room all day avoiding getting lunch so I don't have to interact with my dad who is blasting the tv in the living room
* me being unable to focus on doing anything bc the tv is blasting
* getting filled with dread leading up to my mom coming home from work
* mom getting home and then snapping at my dad so now i'm extra dreading leaving my room
* me spending with the minimum amount of time possible with my parents so that they are satisfied that i'm Okay and Normal 
* me inevitably fucking up some part of the social interaction and getting hounded about it (""you look serious"" me: ""sorry"" mom: ""you're not in trouble!!!"" me: *increasingly convinced I'm in trouble*)
* and ending with my latest strategy: giving up and pretending to go to sleep until they do

Big sigh.

Okay now that I've vented I'm going to try to put together some type of action plan for me to focus on each day. Like maybe I can spend a set day of the week with a friend or at the library or something just so I'm in a different environment. But the few hours I see my parents in the evenings each day stresses me the fuck out. It might honestly take me finding a way to get out of the house around dinner time hours so that I avoid my mom or something.

And I do love them and they love me, but something's really falling apart here and I don't see how I can Talk Honestly with my them through this problem when every heart to heart conversation we have ends with the consensus that i need to stop talking about what I think. There's no path to emotional validation when everyone's agreed to emotionally invalidate me at every turn, right. Hell even I emotionally invalidate myself. I'm half convinced that yeah, me experiencing negative emotions is the problem after all, better lean harder into only ever being happy and pleasant and unopinionated.",
585,"This is such a weird feeling to be going through and it feels kind of isolating. My mom and I have never had the best relationship it has gotten worse as I got older. I have now long since moved away and don't see her as often and finally able to look back on my life and how messed up some of our relationship was. 

When it was time to leave for college she called up the school I was going to and took back my tuition deposit. College decions had been made and I couldn't leave anymore... I was stuck on my hometown until I could do Junior college and transfer.

When I graduated from college she threw a joint celebration with graduation and mother's Day because on a Saturday that would have worked for everyone clashed with an event of their. Needless to say no one showed up to my gradution party and man was I sad. 

During grad school when things got tough or I was lonely and depressed I couldn't call my mom for support. Anytime I tried to vent, some how it was my fault I was struggling because I decided to leave or it became about her and she needed to share how much worse she had it. I slowly stopped sharing things with her when I finally finished grad school and it dawned on me no matter what I share it was always be turned into a ""woe is me"" pity party. 

If I wanted to celebrate an achievement or good news wih her, I was hit with "" Well I wish your sister could do that she's really struggling 
Blah blah blah."" Or do you know how much worse your cousin and niece has it? 

I'm sad today after mother's Day knowing I don't have a real relationship with my mom. It needs to be at a distance to be safe. I wish things were different but I know it's not a safe place to go to for comfort.

586,"I love helping people. I love giving away things I no longer need. Running a food pantry. Starting extra produce plants for others. Feeding people from my garden. 

Today somehow made me snap. I had cool weather harvest and a bunch of produce plants free I was giving away, all in a local buy nothing group. People were obviously wanting the free fresh produce and plants. Problem is, people want me to hold specific things. People want me to deliver to them up to 90 minutes away. People ghosting even showing up. 
I was guilt tripped by an older lady to bring stuff to her 45 minutes from me (one way), even with my two toddlers and husband in tow. She gave me a specific time. We showed up at her place, 24 produce plants and several bags of harvested produce. 
She didn’t answer. We knocked and knocked. Called her on messenger. Nothing. Eventually the cops came. She called the cops on us for trespassing and theft. I showed them my post but it wasn’t enough. I had to leave it all behind and I have court for misdemeanor charges. My toddlers had to see me cuffed. 

I went to help this old lady out, now I’m facing criminal charges and she got all my stuff free… a few hundred dollars worth. 

I’m going to contest this but now, I don’t know if I should even be this helpful to people! I feel used, especially since everytime I have reached out for help, I’m ignored… I don’t know if it’s just because everyone is broke and needs help but I’m active in the community and even when I needed help delivering food packages after a miscarriage, I couldn’t even get that and I had to do it so people wouldn’t go hungry. 

I can see why we don’t have many good people left. There’s so many bad that ruin it",
587,"This isn’t meant to be combative just something I’ve been sitting with. I’ve noticed that many women (not all, of course) still appreciate or even expect traditional acts of chivalry men paying for dates, opening doors, initiating everything, etc. while also advocating for gender equality.

I’m trying to figure out where the line is between social courtesy and reinforcing outdated gender roles. Because on one hand, chivalry can seem like basic kindness. But on the other, it still often expects men to carry certain burdens just because they’re men.

And here’s where I get genuinely curious: Even when feminist women don’t personally expect those things, they don’t often call it out when other women clearly benefit from those traditions. I don’t hear a lot of feminist critique around women taking advantage of those perks.

To use an analogy from another movement I’m Black, and I care deeply about Black empowerment. But I also think we can’t ignore when some of our own behaviors hurt our collective progress. If I turned a blind eye to things like glorifying toxic culture or dependency, just because some people benefit from it, I wouldn’t be fully committed to real change. I’d just be protecting comfort.

So it makes me wonder: Is feminism really about dismantling the system, or just renegotiating who gets what from it? I say that with respect genuinely hoping to understand if there’s a consistent philosophy behind this or if it’s just something we haven’t really confronted head-on. 

I say “we” specifically because even though I’m a man I still feel like the burden of helping dismantle predatory systems fall on me. Even if it’s a system I directly benefit from ",
588,"The classic tale of parents inviting others to their children's wedding. 

Growing up my parents were the type of people who opened their home to everyone. Random cousin from another country I've never heard of? Sure come stay in OPs room for 2 weeks while you're visiting. Our neighbor were getting their home renovated and my parents offered for them to stay at our home for a year while they worked on it. 

When I moved out I expressed to my mom that I'm a private person and it really bothered me when they did that. I said I was glad to have my own home so I could control who stays here and for how long. We had an issue once where she invited my uncle from France to stay with me during the holidays. It ended up being a little messy since it didn't work for my partner and I and we had to end up telling them no. 

Now that we're planning our wedding we have a pretty strict guest list. 1, our ceremony site is already at max capacity 2, we wanted it to be intimate and only have people who are part of our life. 

We made some exceptions for 5 family members that my parents wanted to invite as they are paying for the wedding. She recently also told me that she invited my sister's boyfriends mom as our location is easier for her to visit her son. I didn't really react in the moment. She kept saying 'it's easy to find room for 1 more person'. Im not really okay with this. I don't want this person that I've never met before (that no one has met before) to be part of my day. That seat for 'one more person' could also be used for so many other people I know and love. 

I'm  gently prodding that the boyfriend should just go visit his mom after the wedding since he'll have the time. 

I have not told my fiancé as I know he will not be okay with this and was already a little bothered by having to invite those 5 extra people. ",
589,"Several months ago, I (27F) broke up with a man (30-33? Idk for sure) I’d only dated for like a month max because he was clearly abusive. Still tho, having lost my job… $20 each time to drive him to the next town over (under 10mi each way) once a week??? Come on, easy choice! And one of those Wednesdays, he asked for my advice about this situation with this girl and the police. He was telling me about the girl and I went, “oh my god, what is she, 13?!???” And he said, “wait, how did you know?!” Um, what?? Imagine being stuck in a car with this monster!! 

His defence??? **“She looked older than you.”.**

Look, I obviously told the police what I knew, but they didn’t do anything... this kid fucker was being investigated for fucking kids and he is still on the streets????? So hide your kids, I guess? I feel like a paedo gateway drug, like anyone I date should be investigated, maybe? If I look like a teenager, why do men anywhere close to my age find me attractive?!? I’ve asked my male friends and my current boyfriend and they just got *super uncomfortable.* Neat. My boyfriend said we look the same age, and to be fair, I agree, but outside of that??

What I really want to know is how I can fix this???? I’m not going to intentionally age myself, obvi, but how can I use my appearance to **_STOP_** people who harm kids??? I don’t want to be a gateway drug ever again!! But I sincerely need to help stop the sort of people who make me *feel* like I’m the problem. Is there a way to become paedo bait for the police, maybe??

591,"I was housing and feeding my cousin and his gf from January to April. It was only supposed to be for a couple of weeks and it ended up with me having an adult tantrum over food  and kicking them out. 

I knew they went to a hostel and they didn't have proper storage  so they got robbed. Finding rent in my city is hard because  from May to October is high tourism season so everything gets more expensive. My mom called me last week, not to ask me to take them back but she told me that my cousin is sleeping on the streets and his gf is still in the hostel. They're running out of savings and can't find steady jobs. 

I was really mad, they were messy and disrespectful and it costed me almost 1000€ to get my house back to how I like it.  Now I can't stop thinking about them homeless and going hungry. 

Food is touchy for me. I always knew my dad went hungry as a child, his past is always present in my family: we appreciate the food, we don't waste it, we don't let people around us go hungry and honestly, if my sister and I don't get to eat around our regular schedules we get restless (not diagnosed but I think we both have some kind of anxiety around food). As a child I never noticed if my parents had trouble putting food in our table but apparently we did struggle, it wasn't until my sister and I were adults that my parents started opening up about the past financial struggles or how they had to eat more plain rice than proteins for a while so my sister and I could get everything we needed. Then I used to see my dad come back from work extra hungry because he shared his lunch with his coworker because he didn't pack anything and then my mom stretching the food just a little bit more for his coworker too (and this happened a hundred times with different coworkers).  Now I'm the friend that people know they can drop by my house anytime and I have food or everything I need to cook and my employees have everything they need to have breakfast at the office or the warehouse. 

Yesterday I came back home and my cousin and his gf were waiting outside. It was the first time we were face to face after everything went down. They apologised for how they treated me, I told them about how disrespected I felt, I told them I never ever had a problem with sharing food, I had a problem with how they treated me and my house, the way they stressed me out knowingly when they knew I was loosing my patience already. Apparently they just felt too comfortable and started treating me like they treat their siblings and their own houses but it doesn't make sense to me because I have a sibling and we don't treat each other or our spaces like that. I asked them what was their plan. The gf has a couple of weeks to find a job and if she doesn't then her family is paying for her to go back to them and my cousin will keep sleeping on the streets for now but already found a job just not enough to pay for 2 beds at the hostel. 

My brain knows I was pushed to my limits, I'm still in recovery after being ill for over a year and I don't need the stress but I feel so much guilt. It's after midnight and I can't sleep thinking about my cousin being homeless and hungry and his gf in that hostel around drunk and high tourists. I really hated them for a while and now I can't stop feeling guilty for not giving them another chance. I have a lot of space in my house more food that i can eat alone and I still didn't invite them in. And I could see in their faces that they were going through hell and I couldn't stop thinking about my dad and the times he went hungry or all the bad experiences he had as a child worker and all the times both my parents went hungry for us and put a smile in their faces so we couldn't see.  I heard and saw countless of times and ways my parents helped strangers and I try to follow their example and now I'm choosing to let people who are directly connected to me to go homeless and hungry.

This shit is eating me alive. I feel so guilty and on the edge of telling them to come back, I can't even sleep for long because I wake up thinking about them. ",

Anyways, ive only worked at this office for two months and unfortunately actually had food poisoning a few weeks ago- Thursday night/Friday which just didn’t look good.

never in my life have I had to deal with such an awful supervisor. been dealing with it for going on 3 yrs now. she is targeting and harassing me non-stop. I'll give you some examples.......

ex. #1: during covid.... we had to test at least 2 times a week... so I got pulled into the office for testing too much... and I was told I needed a doctor's note to test every day. (I wasn't testing every day I was testing 2 time a week as we were mandated...  idk who tf would subject themselves to that any more than they had to!! then the next day... I got a write up because apparently, I didn't test enough.... lol. 

ex. #2: since I've worked, I have always kept a pair of shoes that I change into in my car and a plastic bucket I put my work shoes in... as to not cross contaminate. well... all of a sudden it was a problem for me to be doing that during covid because she didn't like it. I ended up getting a write up for inappropriate work attire.... they took 5% of my pay. well, I appealed it and won because well... Shes just trying to find reasons to get me fired.

ex. #3 she argues with me every time I call out. and that includes some type of threat or intimidation tactic. 

ex. #4 calling to find out where I am all the time. while I'm at work. so far, I've got at least 7 write ups by her. 

ex. #5 she lies about things I do or don't do in order to get me written up. 

and more recently the last thing she did was follow me to a training area to make sure I was there. she was parked by my car in the middle of the road. then when she seen me, she went around and parked on the opposite side of me. 

she literally walked toward me like she wanted to fight... and me.?? well......after being so triggered I can't help but to call out. cause the thoughts I have...... aren't meant for the workplace.  I worked very hard to get to where I am... and I'm darn sure not going to let her take me out of my character and lose my job.

595,"As the title says. 

  
I've always been really good at hiding my substance abuses. I'm high-functioning I guess. I hid my coke addiction really well from my friends and family for about 2.5 years almost. It started a little when I was with my ex boyfriend (but I had started using casually before then), but really went into when I was casually dating this other guy for a while. We used to do it every time we hung out. I think for a little over 8 months I was using it everyday, going as far as doing it at work, at social functions, family outings, etc. when it wasn't the time. The nightlife here is coke driven, people use it more than drinking, so it was easy to look like I was using it for fun during nights out. No one noticed for a really long time. Until they did. I became more erratic, I was fucking up at work a lot, I was getting even more irritated at my family (we didn't have the most stable relationship) and snapping at the tiniest things, but the worst of it I think was when my friends started to notice this. I was saying a lot of things out of my character, and my friends let it slide. I'm still so ashamed of some of the things I said. My friends are like my second family, and it went as far as three of my closest friends voicing their concerns to me. They knew I wasn't saying those things to be terrible (and assured me that it wasn't as bad as I thought/still think). We're all silly in a lot of ways, but them sitting me down and saying that they're scared for me really opened my eyes. But the day I finally stopped was when I did it at my best friends wedding (who is also my cousin). I looked at the photos and videos our family and friends were taking, and I just looked so... dead? And the worst part it, that wedding was the first time in a long time I ever felt any emotion, I cried of happiness watching her now-husband come in the room for the first look. This was December 2024.

I realised I needed to stop. So I did. Going cold turkey was difficult, but the funny thing is, the hard part was not letting it go, it was cleaning up all the messes I had made along the way. I'm very important at my job, so you can imagine how many small details piled up into one big clusterfuck of a mess. And then my family, so many things I had prevented myself from thinking about and talking to them about, came head on. So many emotions of my day to day life that I numbed out with coke, I just couldn't stop crying about, for weeks on end. My friends supported me, which I'm eternally grateful for. And honestly, without them idk if I would've found another way to cope or not. Most importantly though, I had a friend who told me that I needed to get myself out of this with love. He said ""only through love will you be able to come out on the other side, love from your friends, love from your family, but most importantly, love from yourself."" And that's what I tried to do. And I think I did it.

Last week, I was super focused on work, and made time for friends, and even made time for family, which I had a really pleasant time doing. My dad and I even had a full conversation that wasn't a fight or him lecturing me, which is the first time that has ever happened to us. I realised, my brain is back to what it used to be. Two years of my head being cloudy, of not thinking straight, of not caring, all of it is gone. I want to read books again, I want to go to day time events, I want to do good at work, I want to have a stronger relationship with my siblings and parents. There is so much I realised I closed myself off from by doing coke. I can't believe I'm here now. Almost 6 months later. Idk how I'm so lucky, but I am, and I hope anyone who's dealing with an addiction can love themselves through it all the same.

  
Just wanted to get this off my chest. No one knows the full extent of how bad it really got, and today I realised how big of a win this is for me.",
596,"im deleting this soon idk

when i was 15 summer 2023, i met a guy on a voice chat in a roblox game which later he mentioned he was 20. i didnt know wed go so far in our relationship and i told him when we first met that i was 18, it sounds kinda dumb already. we added each other on discord after the second time we played together and started talking regularly, and he eventually opened up to me about some personal issues he was going through. a month or so later when i was 16, he asked me out, and i agreed to enter a long distance relationship with him. it was my first so i thought id give it a try. however as the months went by, i began to realize that i didnt have genuine feelings for him and the relationship became more complicated and intense for me. despite trying to be supportive to him, i struggled with handling his heavy emotional load or whatever, and i just started feeling trapped and overwhelmed. luckily i ended the relationship a year ago, but i still struggle with guilt and regret for entering into a relationship that i knew wasnt genuine from the start. even though he was initially a nice person, the relationship evolved into something i didnt expect or anticipate and i just wish i could erase that all from my mind.

i know that this was my own fault. its not all on him. im almost 18 now but i still think about it every day and i just don’t want to. i wanna move on with life, but its really hard knowing that i encountered myself with someone like that. luckily im in a happy relationship now with my partner whos only a year older than me (well be the same age pretty soon) and i just wanna move forward with life and not think about this anymore. i just need some help.

edit; unsure if this is important but i forgot to mention this. i told him my actual age two months into the relationship and he didnt even back out, instead he sent me a 3 minute voice message about how he was fine with it. hope this changes something.",
597,"I recently caught my partner in a lie. They don't know that I caught them, and I decided that instead of getting upset I'm going to use it as a baseline of what I'll allow myself to do in the future if I want. Unfortunately if I can't count on them to tell me the entire truth, I'm just going to have to use my imagination to determine what The New Relationship Contract entails (hey, if they can unilaterally change what we agreed to then so can I). 

We got chinese food a couple days ago and my partner's fortune cookie said something to the affect of relationships being a mirror to your heart.

Mine said ""be alert to new opportunities"".",
598,"Hello, I am an 18 year old woman, English is not my language so I translate this with a translator, and I am in one of those days where I need to let off steam. All my life I have grown up with my maternal family, I know absolutely nothing about my paternal side except what my mother and aunts have told me. My father left when I was 4 years old, during that time I remember that he took me out to dinner a lot but nothing more, the rest I never saw him (since -he- had a night job) so much so that they tell me that he even cried if I was left alone with him.
 
When my parents separated, the last word they said to each other was something like ""I bet you won't be able to live without me and that you'll be begging me to come back"" and my mom kicked him out of the house. (Years later I found out that he attacked her that time)

During all this time (9 years) I had not had direct news about him, all I knew was from questions that I asked my family, they never spoke badly about him or that I should hate him or anything, they only told me ""he left because he wanted to."" It should be noted that three years ago my mother received a notification where he liked a photo of me (it was me playing an instrument, which apparently my paternal family does) that was the first time I thought ""he remembers me"" but I didn't think much about it again since, after all, he has never looked for me; I live where everyone in the family always has the same number, if he wanted to get closer he would.

 And that last thing is the reason why I say this, because he has currently written to me. It was right after I graduated from high school, I uploaded a photo on Facebook where I said ""beauty *insert last name* and my dad 😜"" because during all these years my mom fell in love again.

Her husband, my father, did not keep me quiet at first (as expected, not because I dreamed of her returning to my father, I have never wanted that, but more out of jealousy of making her have a whole life to myself) but over time he came to teach me what it feels like to have a father figure, he has been the one who supports me and advises me on things that even my mother (who I love above all) has not understood, in short, he became my father, and I boast about it from time to time. I say that because we believe that was the reason that made my Father (I call him that out of respect for my beliefs and because my own father asked me not to hold a grudge against him) send me a friend request.

When that happened I immediately told my mom, from here she told me that she will look for someone else to help me, she doesn't want to know anything about him and any advice she could give me would surely not be objective, which I understand and respect. So I go to my dad and he helps me write the following message: ""Good evening. Father, I have accepted your request, however I think it is not the way to know about me. I hope you are well.""

This is where ""father"" becomes a way of saying: I know who you are, they didn't hide it from me. More than a title that he doesn't deserve, honestly. To all this, if I have his last name, biologically and legally I am his daughter, moreover, my custody was never fought, he simply left me with my mother.

That short message took away all my energy that day, it left me anxious in a way I never thought I would be able to be, because although I never needed it, I always wonder why he left me, and I even questioned if my lack of recognition of him during the time he was there also had to do with him not coming back... I know it's illogical but sometimes it feels that way. It also made me question even if he would be proud of who I have become when he saw me and if he regrets leaving me or thinks he did right...

The case that after hours he answered, I read it but I didn't show him the answer until days later, when I was more relaxed and without exams (at that time I was taking several courses) to focus my mind on, he answered me: Yes, it is very true, and I confess that I have been spying on your existence for a long time, I was just waiting for the moment when your intelligence and maturity would like to know about me and if this is the moment, welcome. I do not want to burst into your life in a abrupt way that prevents a nice approach, in my public silence I have always considered you a daughter, the youngest of mine, perhaps we need to talk, in the meantime I send you from my heart a ""God Bless You""..


This is where I don't know how to feel... First of all he asked me why did you show up? Of so many parents who give up their children because you decide to ""atone"" for me and not simply abandon me? They told me that I should be grateful that you seem interested but... What if you want something? After all, evil exists, even from those who share blood. They also feel that the message has no regrets whatsoever, for someone who did not take responsibility for a life, and how it seems to magnify his ego, as if it were no one's fault... But I didn't think about it until they pointed it out to me... It has nice parts, and it talks about a meeting but there are also parts where it is difficult to know if he wants to meet me or is just responding because, in the end, I was the one who wrote to him first and who responded to the request...

I have since responded to him once, following his advice. Not directly to that message (which, in fact, had been a month) I just said, good night, blessing father. For him to say good night, daughter, I'm in Colombia on personal errands... Well, let him write to me, next time he'll tell me how you are. I replied briefly: Blessing, I hope it goes well for you. I feel fine, thanks for asking.

And since then we haven't spoken again, I don't know if I should write to him again (nor do I know if I want to hear from him or not) since when I think about it I end up saying ""I already did it, and I'm bothering him"" and I haven't had anyone else to ask for help, since after the message where he answers me my dad didn't take it well and got angry for days because of ""that guy's audacity"" (several things in the message offended him since it implied things about me, he told me) and despite promise to calm down and think objectively, the same thing happens with my mother, she doesn't think she's making a good decision. He was the same one who told me that there were two ways to take this, and one was that he (my biological father) felt sorry and never knew how to get back until now, but after that message he doesn't even believe that that was the reason. Currently he reacts to one or another photo and congratulated me a few days after my 18th birthday after publishing a video with the song ""Luz Bendita - Mana"" in the background saying that he chooses a beautiful song, that he remembers those four years together and that he always follows my development, blessings and hugs. At this point I managed to laugh, and I didn't answer anything, I didn't know what to tell him the truth. The situation continues to bother me every day, like today, where I decided to vent and see if anyone by chance is going through the same thing or something similar.

There are days where I would like to meet him, answer my questions and tell him that I don't hold a grudge against him, because I don't and honestly, I sometimes don't understand how much he did wrong, because in the end I have never lacked anything; but others where I think about my family and what they have sacrificed for me and my studies, how much they have cared without having to do so so that he simply appears out of nowhere, without having contributed anything... It's confusing and I don't know if I'm describing it correctly. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",
599,"TW FOR MENTIONS OF CHILD ABUSE, ASSAULT, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, REGULAR ABUSE 


this weekend i turned 20 on mother’s day, i’ve always hated that my birthday is on mother’s day, especially because my mom is neglectful, mean-spirited, cruel, and only cares about outward appearances of me and her. the day of my birthday was shitty, my friends and i tried to swim at a friends pool but it was public, and we got pushed out by a family of 10. i then had to fight my friend over where i wanted to eat and get dessert, which i got anyway, but he went to chipotle instead of the restaurant i chose for us, the other friend (F 19, “Jane”) came with me and we had to take our food to go anyway to eat by the chipotle with our friend. i had to fight the friend (M 20) AGAIN to walk for 5 mins to a boba shop. he didn’t want to walk because “it’s too hot.” which was fine if the cafe wasn’t air conditioned and had ice cream, a bubble waffle ice cream cone is what i got. when we got back to his place, Jane had to leave because despite being an adult her mother won’t let her out the house past 7pm.  after she left, the other friends mom confronted me, because after we were strong-armed out of the pool area, i rinsed off in his bathroom which was covered in weird yellow spots and mold. i got so anxious i scrubbed their whole tub. thankfully they weren’t offended but i was sure apologetic for reacting so extremely. I got home at around 8, i tried to tell my mom what happened but she only focused on me scrubbing out their tub, saying i embarrassed her and i needed to apologize to them, she only ever cared about her image, i tried to tell her that i already did, but she stopped listening to me and just kept repeating herself until she got mad at me for “not listening to her”, i gave up on telling her what was wrong, it’s not like she ever listened to me. the day after (mother’s day), my grandma decided to host my party with mother’s day, which was fine. i thought getting some sleep would make me feel better about turning 20 but it didn’t, i only felt worse. as the day was going, i said hello to my family and said the usual “happy mother’s day”, passed out cards, and retreated to a corner of the house to play on my 3ds. i went to the bathroom, a big mistake now. the family lit my cake candles without me, by the time i got there and they finished that stupid ass song, my candles had melted into my cake, making it inedible. i didn’t even have my own cake.
i sat back in the corner i retreated in at the beginning of the day. where was my mother? she had a massage that day, only coming an hour before the candles were lit, and didn’t even say hello to me before she asked “is there something you wanna say to me? we haven’t seen each other all day.” i felt like i was on my final nerve, my cousin and dad came to ask what was wrong, i cried to them, i cried about being an adult, how shitty my birthday was because i kept fighting with the male friend about what we should do, and finally not getting a piece of my own cake because the candle wax melted into the frosting and base of the cake. then after i finished my rant, my mom came in to bitch at me for ruining her mother’s day, she cursed at me, called me a bitch, fantasized about me facing shitty customers at my job and told me about it, hoping that a crackhead assaults me on the bus, all to my face before she said “thank you for ruining my mother’s day” and walking off. it’s an open secret to how my mother treats me and my sibling, the shit she says to us, instead of listening to me like i was begging her to, she only told me to lower my voice, which was never low enough for her as i tried to articulate how i felt to her. after this i had a one-on-one with my cousin and her husband. she’s closer in age to me, she and her mom (my aunt) took care of me and raised me until i was 8-9 years old, but that’s off topic. i didn’t feel better. after we had to go home, my mom tried to lecture me again, without apologizing to me for saying all that shit to me, but it wouldn’t be the first or last time that she would cuss me out, she stopped hitting me at 16, because i threatened to fight back. i’ve never felt more alone on this birthday, she doesn’t deserve a mothers day, she’s treated me and my sibling like garbage for as long as i can remember, and every time i think she’s capable of changing, where she shows me that maybe she has changed, her original personality shows through, reminding me why i’ve hated her for so long, why i’ve always hated mother’s day. she either uses that day to get away from her family (and kids) or gets so drunk she passes out in her room again, this isn’t even the tip of the iceberg of shit she’s done. happy mother’s day.

I'm trans ftm and 16. C is male and 15

So, before I get into what happened today, I have to go back a month:
So it's the end of March, and my then-boyfriend asks me to have sex with him in the school bathroom
I say no
He asks again 
(repeat for lunch, 7th period! And like 30 minutes after school)
I give up and eventually say yes.

The next day, I realized, “Hey, this is probably morally wrong,” so I told G because I didn't know who else to talk to.

G tells me that that is technically sexual coercion and pretty much sexual assault

She goes to school
We both get suspended (I get a harsher punishment).
This happened yesterday:
I told her that they mishandled the entire situation, and she responded with 
“I don't think you're taking responsibility for what you did.”
And I responded with 
“I know what I did, I'm sorry for what I did, but I know I was pressured into what I did.”
(and then repeat it)

And when I brought up that I'm Fucking traumatized for this she said that I should get more phscyolgical help:
So I'm sitting there in her office fucking crying because Im upset and I feel unheard and she's saying I should Get more phscyolgoical help. 

I got a worse punishment than C, so I'm the one getting yelled at?

And she said, “We don't have enough evidence to know whose idea it is or what happened.” I later said, “You know my parents are treating me to pull me out.”

*inhale* 
*exhale*

Also:
Before her, we had a different dean of students (she started last year), and I've heard from upper-level students that she kinda isn't as good as our previous dean of students
Bro….

And like the only excuse I can think of for the school is that I am older than C. Like what?

I said:
“I know this is random and might sound like I'm deflecting, but I witnessed a vape deal between another student, G, and C the week before spring break.” 

She said: That is deflecting. You did not need to bring that up 

*Sigh*

She said, “Look, OP, you seem to have an issue where you say you feel unsafe, but you're still trying to be friendly with him.”

And she's like, “Look, you made a bad decision having sex in a school bathroom.”

And I'm like, “I was pressured into it. But continue going”

And she's like, “You're deflecting and not taking responsibility.” 

And I'm like “I know what I did and I know that I was pressured into it, but continue”

And she's like, “I offered a conversation. And you said no.”

And I'm like “I said only if he was fine with it, my parents said they didn't want to” (I fucking wonder why…. Oh yeah you have a history of not handling th8ngs well)

And she's like, “You said he should be in a mental hospital.”

And I'm like “that's because he's threatened to kill other people, (other people could), and even threatened to kill himself….”
And she's like, “You should've told an adult.”
And I'm like “I kinda couldn't really….”
And she's like “you need help, like it's clear you have psychological issues,”
And I'm fucking crying like “its fine I'm fine”
And she's like “you're not, either you could talk to the school counselor or you should work on your own with your therapist”
And I'm like “my parents don't trust the school, and honestly neither do I, so im fine working on my own”
And she's like “ok, just remember don't talk to him and don't talk about him”

The worst part is that this is a private school


Sorry bout the flare

Edit: ran It through grammerly




Update (didn't mean to have an update this quickly)

Bro cheated on me With an 13 year old ✋💀

I'm kinda concerned for the kid ",
601,"This girl 22f and I (25M) started talking and i gradually started liking her. She's attractive has a great body and is very classy and forward. She's technically out of my league and girls like that don't even speak to guys from humble backgrounds like me. I tried distancing myself because her intensity overwhelmed me but then I just can't seem to get her off my head. Feels guilty to admit but I have fantasies about her and i don't wanna lose her ever. I want her to be a part of my life forever but my family would never approve of us because of our cultural differences. I feel like I cannot love another woman as much as I love her. She's smart, goddess level gorgeous and witty too. An independent woman of her own voice and stand in society she's everything I want in a wife. She's also very talented and has what you call a life in the truest sense. I used to be this naive guy who never cared about the way he looked or carried himself outside of basic grooming but ever since she happened I've been feeling this internal urge to change myself and better myself to match her level because I'm insecure and a woman like that reciprocating interest for a guy like me is a blue moon thing. But we're not dating we just talk we once had phone sex during our talking stage but I've never had the balls in me to spiral the conversation to anymore depth because I'm always anxious about disappointing her. If it were possible I'd have confessed my love for her pretty early but then if I confess my love it's gonna be redundant because we don't have any future given our cultural differences. All i know that I don't want to lose her but then i can't stand her getting wived up by another man that would be a heartbreak and only I would be the one to be blamed.",
602,"Hi, I failed my first calculus class yesterday I took the final exam and I'm pretty sure I failed, and the most funny thing is my major is engineering and this is not the first time I fail a math course this is the third, I feel Like a fucking failure, this semester I told myself I was gonna change and study my butt off but I couldn't I discussed it with my psychiatrist we did some tests and turned out I have ADHD, and the medication I was put on wouldn't start working until a month or two so I asked my academic advisor about stopping this semester from college but he said no, do not do it. just drop out of college and go to another one because this one seems pretty hard for you or go to a business school I told him I'm officially diagnosed I'm not making shit up but he nonetheless continued to tell me I'm a failure in every language I have been in the meds for 2 months and I think they finally started working but when it's the finals time I was quite happy that they started working of course I couldn't study like a person who had a normal brain all his life but I studied for 4-5 hours for a couple days and I felt really good about myself for the first time in college in my life studying wasn't a struggle it even felt enjoyable doing the math problems. but in the end even though I tried my best I failed yes I know it's not enough to study for a couple days I was trying to study consistently Throughout the term but I simply couldn't I tried my best and it wasn't enough, I feel like an idiot even my friends consistently tell me (sometimes jokingly) that I'm a failure and stupid for failing basic pre-calc math. but I really like maths and science I don't want to change my major to a business major not that I think of them as less but I really really love math and physics, and chemistry and I think with time yes I'm not the best but I could at least be average but my GPA is really bad and I'm afraid that as my advisor told me that if I got a bad GPA they will notify my parents that a really stupid thing I'm an adult why does my parents need to know but nonetheless he told me these are the rules and they will be followed I think my parents are gonna be pretty disappointed and not only disappointed they will even stop me from going to my psychiatrist because they are approving for me see him for the sake of me getting better grades and now I didn't!. Just imaging them knowing is scary I really hate that I was made this way I hate that I'm not smart I hate that my friends make fun of me and I hate knowing I'm the most stupid person in the group I really just want to be an average person I don't really inspire to be the smartest.

603,"The last time I heard from F was 3/31/25 (or 4/1/25).  I got busy with tax season and 3 weeks later, I realized that I had not heard from her.  I texted all different numbers she had texted me from (she used an app) and texted her son, sent emails, and got radio silence.  

Let me rewind first.  We met on Reddit in November 2023.  She needed help getting away from an abusive ex, and had her kids with her.  She posted about needing gas, and I reached out to help, and she was able to get away.

We've kept in touch by phone and texts since then.  My husband and I visited them once, as they live 2.5 hours away.  She really tried to restart life from scratch but life had not been kind.  Welfare system was overwhelmed and state sponsored health insurance was BS.  She had quite a bit of health issues, and the insurance would not cover the most crucial medications.

After fighting a very brave battle, while doing her very best to keep her family together, she unfortunately passed on 4/2/25.  

The last conversation we had, was after I sent her what I could so she could get home from the hospital.  

I know that she's at a better place now, without pain.  But I worry about her kids.  Her teenage kid used to e-mail me if there were problems, but I haven't heard anything.  I have no idea where her kids are.  The only other adult contact was someone that watched her kids when she was working.  She hasn't responded to my attempts to contact, either.

This morning, out of the blue, I decided to Google her full name, and the top two results were her obituary.  I'm sad, and regret that I didn't try harder to visit more often.  I worry about the kids, not knowing where they are.  They're more than likely in foster care and I just hope that they are together, as the younger one has special needs.  ",

Heyo. Just kinda stressed out about some things.. just teen drama.

Basically,
Friend 1 told Crush 1/1 that I liked him against my will (I told 3 close friends total who I had a crush on before any of this) and he also told 2 other people. Still against my will 😔

It took me a week to get him to admit that he did it, what he kept talking about, and he said that everyone has a crush, and that Crush 1/1 was chill about it. He didn't apologize for telling him though

I know Friend 1 is a good person though, I just don't really know what to think. He always keeps a bright tone it seems like.

And then today, Friend 2 told Dude 1 about my crush. At first he wouldn't tell me what they were whispering about, and I was getting sick of my friends keeping secrets about MY LIFE from me. I'm so sick of asking what the hell they're talking about and being told to 'shoo off' or 'you're annoying me'

And by now at least 7 people knew, all from the 3 close friends I said: ""Don't tell anyone about my crush, please. Like genuinely, don't.""

Dude 1 likes to jokingly mess with me with insults, and he's close friends with Crush 1/1.

Period 4 is a small class where you can hear a conversation a few feet away easily. I feel like my ears are deceiving me as I listen in, I'm not sure if I'm hearing things right, and I feel like I'm positive they'll talk negatively about me, or negatively joke about me, I get rejected and I just don't want to hear it. I didn't ask for him to find out, and I didn't ask for rejection if he does.
I forgave Friend 1, I didn't show open anger towards him. I didn't show open anger towards Friend 2 either, acting completely normal. I was more over stressed and worried than mad at them.

605,"when I was around 9, my parents separated my mom had full custody, she would tell us my dads side would ""brainwash us"" and we had to support her so we never spoke up and believed we had to stay with our mom. 

As the oldest of 3 siblings during any argument typically revolving my father she would say , degrading things to me as a child. For example, once when she was mad, she told me to “go lick my aunt’s private” This was about when I was 9.

Now I’m 18. I’ve never had a boyfriend, didn't gone to prom, avoided hanging out with guys—I've tried *so hard* to be the “good kid” so she would think highly of me. But nothing's good enough like the other day, she got mad at me for being impatient and using the dishwasher wrong and after slapping me she says “Your dad slept with 3 women. You're just like him.” Which really hurt me

I forgot how unsafe it felt being a kid around her until that moment. When I told her I hated the disgusting thing she said to me all she had to say was your brain washed by your step mom and you will have karma.

606,"I was sexually assaulted by my older half brother when i was 5 and he was 13. My dad came into my life when i was about 4 and would see me during supervised visits for a while until my mom eventually allowed him to keep me every other weekend or so. It was one of the first nights i had spent at my dad’s and i had fallen asleep on one of the couches in the living room and my older half brother was asleep on the other. I was asleep on my stomach and immediately woke up to the presence of my brother standing near me and he pretty quickly got on top of me and basically grinded/humped me for a few minutes and i just laid there in full awareness of what was happening to me but too scared to do or say anything, he then moved my underwear to the side to see my vulva and that’s when i pretended to wake up and he jumped back onto the couch he was originally sleeping on and threw his blanket over himself. i just got up and walked to my dads room and went back to sleep in there. i never said anything about it mostly because it was too uncomfortable of a topic for me to bring up so i just stayed quiet. I understood it was wrong for him to do what he did to me but I never wanted to confront the situation and I truly thought I would take it to my grave. When i was 9 i was staying at my dads house playing with my toys by myself when my brother who was 17 at the time came in with a couple of his friends and my brother grabbed me from behind, locked his arms around me and grinded on me. one of his friends yelled at him and told him to not touch me like that so he stopped. later that day i heard that same friend in the next room tell my father exactly what he had witnessed. My dad never talked to me about it. When i was 13 i finally came clean to my mom and she immediately believed me and told me she had actually warned my father on several occasions to pay close attention to my brother and I because it was her fear that i would be molested by him as she was by her brother. Tbh I never necessarily felt traumatized by these situations and kind of just “moved on” from it and didn’t really think about it but now i’m 20 and i think NOW im starting to rlly process all of it and i just feel so sad for my little 5 yr old self who was so violated. I remember around that time i started crying to my mom complaining that nothing felt real and my life felt like a dream and i was too little to describe it but I suffered with terrible dissociation for most of my life and didn’t understand why. I think this has brought about a few issues in my adult life such as zero sexual desire/no interest in men. Where do I go from here?",
607,"Hi all! Long time lurker here and I just wanted to get my current situation of my chest. I (F24) graduated from college 2 years ago with my BS and MBA and currently live at home with my parents (M52 and F50) and I have a younger brother who goes to college in a different state. Since I graduated during a job freeze it’s took me a few months before I landed a job and I’m super grateful for it, but I make way less than what I could be making. 

Now the real issue here lies with my father. Growing up I knew that my father was always a narcissist, but ever since Covid it’s only gotten worse. Around the time that I graduated, my dad lost his job and it seems to have really affected his ego, and he tries to compensate by bragging about “oh I have this much money in my investment portfolio” (it’s rlly not that much) and “and I own this and this property in our homeland” (we’re an immigrant family btw). We are now at a point where he picks fights in every conversation and even if you try to agree with him he still blames us. It’s to a point where my mom is only staying married to him due to cultural stigma and I’m only here because I don’t wanna leave her alone with him. My brother came back home this past week and it seems to have only made matters worse. Though my dad now has a new job, he makes significantly less than he did before and wasn’t exactly making the best financial choices between jobs. And now that strain has been showing in how he’s constantly blaming my family (me, bro and mom) about how we are useless and only use him for money. Even as I type this dad is threatening bro abt cutting him off and has cursed me out on many occasions before abt how I’m selfish for not helping. For some additional background, before I started college I went to dad with loan options and told him I didn’t expect him to pay anything toward my education and would happily cover it. Instead, he sat me down and told me that as his daughter it was his duty to provide for me. Bro also did the same and now it’s completely backfired on us. I try to avoid him as much as I can but in situations when I can’t (there’s a lot since we live together) he shows how he has no respect for me, my job, education, literally nothing. He also likes to throw in my face that I’m an “alcoholic” (I hang out and drink with friends maybe once a month while he has 2-3 drinks a night so idk how I’m the alcoholic) and how I HAVE to help pay for my brother tuition, even though he knows I’m not in a financial place to do so with my own loans and “my” car, which is actually the family’s car but I completely pay for. And I don’t want to even start on how he treats my mom. He looks down on her like with even less respect than me and completely treats her like his maid/cook. I can go on and on about the stuff he does but I just want to get bro and mom out of situation and let him rot in his own misery but it feels hopeless to do now. Job market sucks so it’s been horrible trying to move up in my career and there’s no way my mom will leave him. I’m honestly just feeling defeated at this point because I obviously don’t want to hate my dad, he did financially provide for us and regardless of my emotions toward him I plan pay him back for school and continue to give back financially but at the same time I can’t tolerate this treatment anymore. 

My bad if this rant is a bit confusing I’m so over all of it",
608,"Hello everyone this will be a long post TLDR will be at the end.

I 29(m) have a job offer in Tennessee which pays less than my current position in Texas. I originally applied to this position because my now ex-girlfriend (27f) had gotten a job there and with the plan of moving there to start our life together. However, early on in our relationship i cheated on her emotionally while she was out of town for 3 months for school, at this point we had only been dating 2-3 months.  We started dating in May and she went out of town at the end of July. What I did was completely wrong and awful. The essence of the cheating was that I had texted (jessica, fake name) a previous fling  I had met her before  ex-girlfriend and I met, so around february-march time that Jessica and I met . I stopped talking to Jessica because I began getting serious with ex-girlfriend around April. 

Not that it's an excuse but I was depressed not in a great state of mind when the cheating began. The cheating happened on and off until the beginning of February, so a very long time. The essence of the cheating was that we began reconnecting as friends and that led to sexting, sending nudes and then us planning a trip to see each other. I began to feel really guilty and told Jessica we can't talk anymore because i have a girlfriend. I hadn't told her before and jessica follows me on instagram so I had assumed she saw our photos and knew I was in a relationship. Fast forward to our anniversary and I post pictures of us. Jessica sees the post and tells ex-girlfriend about our cheating. ex-Girlfriend is very hurt. ex-girlfriend says she doesn't want our relationship to end and would consider forgiving me if it wasn't for the nudes and planning a trip. ex-girlfriend wants to remain friends and said she needs time to think and should I still want to date her once she's had some time then we could reevaluate then. 

So now I'm at a crossroads, I'm quitting my current job which I have hated since I got but i took because I needed the job but the conflicting part is I also applied to other positions in my area and have been offered a position here. 

My question is, should I follow my heart for the small chance of getting back with ex-girlfriend? Or should i stay put and get the job I was offered here? I love my ex-girlfriend so much and I know what I did was wrong but I truly can't see myself with anyone else.

  
TLD; I cheated on my now ex-girlfriend, should I ""follow"" her out of state for the smallest chance of getting back with her?",
609,"Music helps you time-travel and see what it was and what it is.

I came across videos of M2M singing together. I thought they were old clips, because they had split up long ago. I was surprised they were still remembered by the internet. Later, I realized it was actually their present selves performing. They reunited and are touring again, together, as a band, after more than twenty years.

This is probably the best news I’ve seen on the internet in a long time. I feel so happy for them, finding their way back to each other and resolving what couldn’t be reconciled back then.

I discovered M2M when I was in middle school or high school. Their music left a mark. They were huge back then. I loved scrambling to catch the words I barely understood, at a speed I couldn’t really follow. I loved their songs. I found peace and joy in their music when life was hard and I felt broken inside. I remember one particular moment, crippling and painful cramps. I told my mom that it wouldn’t be the worst thing if I died right then. Not because the pain was unbearable, but because I didn’t feel I’d be missing much if my life ended. I didn’t think there was much to look forward to. I didn’t believe there was hope worth surviving for.

Looking back, I couldn’t articulate what was wrong. There wasn’t a single, obvious thing I could point to. There was no violence, no assault, no abuse. Just a girl from a blue-collar family who faced more failures than successes, more criticism than support, more constraints than freedom, who learned to think more negatively than positively. But that’s enough to feed the lie that there’s no life beyond what you’re living.

Afterwards, my mom made jokes about what I said at that moment as a tease that I couldn’t handle pain. I played along, but I knew from the bottom of my heart that it was not like that. I believed that it was not too bad that this was the end. It is right away, so things don’t have to last any longer. It is natural, nothing I did to myself. I wasn’t alone. I was okay accepting that this was the end. 

I didn’t really follow the lead of that thought. On one hand, life wasn’t that bad. That day, my mom and dad tried everything they could to take care of me. They even called my sister to come home, because it was an all-hands-on-deck situation. At least, I was in warm arms.  If anything, I think unconsciously I wanted to reject that thought, to prove there is hope. That this life could be built well. The thought of letting go ultimately drove me to chase what could help me to stay. My life, after that moment, became a series of efforts to reach for things that made life more worth living. Things that made me want to survive the worst because of the good.

English songs were one of them. I loved M2M. I loved Avril Lavigne. I still do. The foreignness was my redemption. The fact that there was a whole different world out there saved me. The fact that they are so different means that there could be a different life out there for me, too. Life didn’t have to be like this forever. 

From that, I had the idea of studying abroad, which was such an out-of-touch goal for me. No money, limited English skills, no connections, no one I knew did it. But I eventually made it. I experienced a bigger world. I collected enough stars in my pocket that shine, bright enough to light the road when it gets dark.

Life is far from perfect and never will be. There are still issues and problems. But no pain or suffering could gray out the whole picture. Life, although not perfect and sometimes painful, is worth living. There are things I look forward to. So many of them. There are paths to get to them. It took me more than 10 years to prove to myself that life is worth living. 

I wish I could travel back and tell that hurt, scared girl that life would unfold in ways she couldn’t even imagine. I couldn’t. But I guess I didn’t need to. The angelic voices in M2M songs did it for me. And best of all, they are still singing. Together.

610,"I know that a lot of people will judge me for this, but I cut my mom out of my life very recently. This wasn’t the first time I’ve done it but I know this will be the last time. 

The first time around I was a mess. I felt so much guilt for cutting her out, mainly because I’m her only child, I am pretty much her main family and I’ve also leaned on her my whole life, but I have had enough of the emotional manipulation and the lack of boundaries and respect. One day, I forgave her and gave it another chance. Three years later and we’re back to where we were the first time. Only this time, I am indifferent. The past year shes really opened my eyes to what her priorities are and how little she thinks of me. I realized she doesn’t want to change. 

Leading up to Mother’s Day though I did feel guilty. I have a wonderful mother in law who treats me with kindness and respect everyday, but it felt wrong to do anything nice for her while I do nothing for my own mom.

While I’ve cut my mom out of my life for my own mental health, I still love her and I recognize every kind thing she’s ever done for me. It wasn’t always bad, but unfortunately for me, the bad times outweigh the good times…It’s really conflicting. 

In the end, I gave my mother in law flowers but I didn’t reach out to my mom. I haven’t spoken to her in almost 2 months, I don’t know how she feels about me not greeting her at the very least, and really I don’t know what else I could say to her at this point. ",
611,"I don’t remember when life became so unbearable, such a heavy weight to carry. But somehow things keep adding up and I feel like my whole body is about to collapse. Every part of me is begging for a break from reality. Sometimes it doesn’t care if it is permanent, a runaway. But there are days, moments when breathing, even breathing, is a burden. Things at work were great, but no more. And at home there is no peace, only the constant pain of being a witness of how my dad is dissolving into this nothing that Alzheimer is turning him into. I fell in love with someone I shouldn’t, it was a good friend and I went too far, probably, so now all that is gone too. I have no place where my mind and my soul can rest, recharge. I’m alone, and probably, will be until I choose to just give up. I’m tired, exhausted. ",
612,"And I hope they're okay. I hope the other driver and everyone involved is okay.

Yesterday, monday, May 12th, I was passenger in a car that passed an accident. At first I wondered why there were multiple cars almost blocking the street having their hazard lights blinking. One car was partly pulled into the street, about three more were parked at the sides. I asked and the driver said there was an accident. At that point there was not one emergency vehicle in sight.

When we passed the car that was partially pulled into the street I saw a motorcycle laying by it. Next to it a person (I assumed man at that point because it looked like a mans body) on their back and a few people surrounding them. My only thought was that I hope they'll pull through. Didn't think it'll affect me even in the slightest.

We drove away because that person already had enough help and an ambulance most likely was on its way. We couldn't have helped anyway since there were enough people already. We would've been in the way and stopping just to look is as you all know also a bad thing. We needed to clear the way.

We didn't go away THAT far from the accident scene since our destination was pretty near by. So we did hear all the horns. Ambulance, police and I think even a fire fighter vehicle came. You can distinguish the horns sounds here in Germany. There were so many horns. Not too long after that there was even a helicopter. That made me think it must have been really bad for the motorcyclist. I still didn't think it'll affect me even in the slightest.

It's now 2:42 am on tuesday, May 13 and I still wonder and hope the person does survive.

Please pull through. ",
613,"a while ago i was on his phone helping him with a project (he was regularly on my phone long before this bc i have better data) and saw lots of porn tabs in his private browser (they weren’t there the first time i was on his phone but about a week or two in). i told him i was upset and hurt by this and didn’t want it in a relationship. he told me it was only because he was on a certain substance which i will not name, and that he was getting help for that substance. i later caught him watching it again and he told me the same thing and i was empathetic because of the substance.

since then i tried to bring up my hurt about it and he told me to stop bringing it up because his use of porn made him feel disgusting and he wasn’t doing it anymore and i was being selfish because i should be more focused on his use of said substance and being proud of him for getting off it (i and my family put both effort and money to help him get help for it previously)

he has since been off the substance but id not know if he relapsed for a short time, long term relapses more then a few days i know id notice behaviors.

he was going to go to a psych hospital for mental health issues a few days ago. i asked for his email log in because he had a google phone so id be able to see his location through that, because psych hospitals tend to take phones and not allow calls so id be able to see where he was. i logged in the email i saw so many porn links in the search history. 


for me personally it hurts bad, even when i used to look at porn it was always for me looking at scenarios. like personally i’m pretty kinky so i’d be searching for spanking or bondage for example. before i was in relationship if i looked for porn it was always scenarios i could imagine myself in with a generic man.

for him, it has always been specific superficial traits like “blonde” and “Asian/latina” (im burnette and white) despite him also being kinky, it most often was repeat specific porn star names “riley rider only fans leaks” which hurts a lot, or “fat ass” in the names of the vids in his history, which he knows im insecure because i feel like my butt is small

also worth noting I had asked him multiple times if he had used said substance (I genuinely think he hasn't but who knows) and at different times asked multiple times if he watched porn recently, and every time he told me no and that the last times he did those things were the times I knew about but now ik he lied about that

Also worth noting I have let him record multiple times during us doing stuff and send tons of pics of myself so it's not like he has nothing to watch

idk, he’s my first love my first everything, i hadn’t even made out with a guy before him, and ik he’s going through a hard time rn but it feels like i’ve told him my boundaries multiple times and he does it anyways and makes me feel bad for bringing up my hurt. he is continuing to try to tell me he rarely watches it but there are litteraly at least 50 women’s names he searched for from memory, so i’m having a hard time trusting him about this at all now",
614,"Just last month, I married an Eastern European man. Great guy; I am truly happy to be married to him despite the challenges we are having (lost his job due to the administration iykwim and I'm pregnant and due in June).

Last week, his family came to visit us. I'm sure they're great people too, as my husband would tell me many stories about them. However, they do not speak any English at all - which makes me 1) feel excluded from the family conversations, and 2) hinders me from conversing and being chummy with them. It's not like I haven't tried either, as I've tried offering them things, starting conversations etc, but  I guess the language barrier as well as my introverted nature does not help.

Yesterday - Mothers' day - my husband got into a fight with them. Apparently they are not happy that they were not greeted first thing in the morning (husband was out doing odd jobs for money and I came with), even though we came home in the afternoon with flowers and a balloon. The fight escalated and continued on today, where I found out that the family was disappointed about the way that I have interacted with them. My husband won't give me specifics and he's even defended me as far as I could tell, but I sneakily used Google Translate on them and knew it was me that was the problem. Now they are asking to go back home when we had agreed on a longer stay initially.

I feel so, so guilty about everything. I've never had a normal family dynamic similar to theirs, and I know I could've tried harder to be nicer, but it seems that anything I do at this point to try and change will be seen as moot. I really did want them to like me but apparently I'm ""not up to their standards of how to behave"" which, like, what even are those standards? I'm so sad and annoyed and angry at myself for not being a model daughter-in-law I guess.

Anyway, they are going back home, and my husband has comforted me as I cried, telling me that the relationship with my in-laws should have been a two-way street etc etc. Guess it's too late now, they already made up their minds about me and nothing can change that at this point. I just hope they like my and my husband's son.",
615,"Hello all, i have just made this account as i havent had one before not for a long time but i wanted to ask where the best place to post this/ ask for any way to get to the authorities. So for backround i was on pixiv (just for fanart nothing weird lol) and i happened to press on the newest tab. Scrolling down a bit i found a weird image, usually theres weird shit there but this had a different look. I pressed on the image and found what seemed to be fetish content but a murder scene of sorts. Now im shocked about it myself and i was going to move on but i thought what if theres even the slightest chance that this is real. So i have screenshotted the account, reported it and i wont post the photos because they are really disturbing and i dont want this to be taken down. I hope i can find the right place to post these. Btw these are from a japanese account and from what i saw took place there as well. Hoping to get some way to get this out so i can get these ss off my device.",
616,"I’m the first daughter. And for as long as I can remember, I’ve carried the emotional, financial, and psychological weight of my family. It’s like being born into duty before I even understood what freedom felt like. I’ve always had to put family first, sometimes to the point of forgetting what it means to be me.

I’ve always been “the one who has it together.” But the truth is, I’m exhausted. I am crumbling in silence while still showing up for everyone else. I take care of people who wouldn’t even notice if I disappeared. I’m the backup plan, the emergency fund, the therapist, the fixer.

Every time I take one step forward, it feels like I’m yanked three steps back. Just when I think I’m catching my breath, something else pulls me under.

I’ve always wanted a family of my own a husband, children, love that feels like home. But I also wanted to build myself up first. Be independent. Stable. I never wanted to walk into a marriage as a burden. Especially not after spending a lifetime feeling like I’m the one carrying everyone else’s weight.  I didn’t want to be a burden to my future husband. I didn’t want to walk into love carrying baggage I didn’t pack.

I’m pretty conservative and religious too, which adds its own layer to things. I’m trying to hold on to values while life keeps pushing me into survival mode.

Right now? I’m dealing with immigration problems, I lost my job, and I’m on the brink of losing my home. I feel so alone. And sometimes, more than anything, I just want a partner , not someone to rescue me, but someone I can be safe with. Vulnerable. Honest. Someone to walk through this fire with me. Someone who sees me , not just what I do for everyone else.

I try dating. But I always pull back. I ghost. Not because I don’t want love, but because I’m scared. Because how do you say, “Hey, I’m a good person going through hell, here’s my situation but I still have love to give . please don’t run”?



I feel so alone. I pray, I cry, I journal, I keep going. But some days? Some days I just want to be held. To not be the strong one. To fall apart without being told to “stay positive” or “just keep pushing.”

There are like a thousand people around me but all I see are shadows .


I know I’ll be okay eventually. But today, I just needed to say: I’m tired. And I want to be held.

Es wird alles gut, Ich schaffe das.❤️‍🩹

617,"Hello, this might sound stupid or whatever considering I’m just some 17 year old guy writing out thoughts I don’t tell anyone, but I honestly don’t really care at this point. I just need it written somewhere.

I honestly feel silly a lot of the time. I have friends, people I try to talk to regularly, but I still somehow feel lonely as hell. It feels like I’m just some bystander in a life where everyone else is moving forward. It’s hard to be present or make plans for the future when sometimes it’s a struggle to just get through the day.

And like, there’s so many people out there who have it worse, people who actually deserve help. I’m just some spoiled kid who whines about my actions having consequences. I live in a nice home, have a nice family, have good friends, don’t have many real things I need to worry about. And yet I still feel so fucking horrible.

I’ve honestly been struggling to remember things. It’s difficult to think of anything other than when I feel shitty or when I feel great. It feels like my brain is filled with maggots that eat away at everything they see. I struggle to stay stable and in all honestly it’s kinda ripping me apart from the inside out.

There’s a lot of days when I get stuck in obsessive loops of whatever compulsion I have (I have OCD) and end up stressing myself out or angering myself so much I start to cry and freak out, start wanting to hit myself and stuff like that. And yeah, I’ve gotten better at not doing physical actions, I’ve even managed to stay over a year clean from self-harm, but it just all gets internalised since I have nobody to talk to about it.

Like, I’m not close enough to people to be able to talk about how badly I want to relapse or kill myself. How I’ll have intense mood swings that sometimes lead to delusional episodes where I feel like a spectator in my own body and mind. And even if I was close enough to be able to talk about stuff like that, I still couldn’t because I always end up hurting people.

It’s better to protect them from me before I traumatize them too. I refuse to let myself hurt people again. I refuse to be emotional manipulative or abusing or get angry and cut myself out of spite of another person. I refuse to let myself attention seek from people just because I want someone to pity me. I refuse to let myself get to the point where people are constantly scared for me. Scared of what I might do when they’re not looking.

I can never be the person who makes people worry on purpose again. Even if I so desperately want to. Want to start drinking a doing drugs again. To cut myself and sell myself online. To get that special kind of encouragement to destroy yourself.

My feelings don’t matter when other people are being hurt by me. It doesn’t matter whatever mood swing or episode I’m in, it doesn’t matter if I’m hurting other people. If I feel shitty I’m doing it alone until I get proper therapy that can help me do the things like a regular person. Till I can get on meds again. I don’t have the kind of capacity to share things without those things. It just leads to people being easier for me to hurt.

All I can really do is keep trying to be a better friend to these people I’m around. Listen to them talk and admire all the qualities that make them great. Help them as best I can when they’re not feeling well. Be the friend I wasn’t for the people before them because just because I did fucked up, unforgivable things in the past, it gives me no excuse to stop trying to better myself. To stop trying to help people even if I honestly suck at it.

I may not be able to change what I did or make amends, but I can change what I do now and always try to be a better person. But it doesn’t stop me from wishing I could be closer to people. To want to stop feeling so lonely. I dunno. It’s selfish, I know.",
618,"I visited my boyfriend (27M) this weekend — I’m 25F and we’ve been in a relationship for a bit over a year. We’re in a medium-distance relationship and I came to his city for just under two days. He told me he was tired from the whole week of hard work so I cooked a full lunch for him — soup, main dish, and dessert the next day. The day after that day (Sunday), I was supposed to leave around 3 PM, but since stores were closed, he got mad that I didn’t think ahead and buy groceries for that day.

I told him that I didn’t think it was solely my responsibility. I was only there for a short visit — not living with him — and I didn’t expect to be in charge of meal planning for the weekend. He said I should’ve known he was too tired and that expecting him to go to the store or help was not listening to his feelings and needs. He said he did not have a proper meal last week or the time to rest.

When I said, “Cooking isn’t my job,” he absolutely exploded. He yelled at me, insulted me, threw things across the room, and made me cry. I left the apartment to calm down, but the fight continued over messages. He said I don’t try hard enough, that I don’t respect him, and that I just needed to apologize for forgetting groceries — and “take responsibility” like an adult.

He also brought up money. He expected me to pay for all the groceries, and he said it’s unfair that I expected him to cover things when he always pay more( which I think is lie and unfair) and also when I’m not working right now (I’m finishing a course and handling stuff at home). I’ve never expected him to pay for everything — I always try to treat him when I can. I just felt like he didn’t appreciate what I did do, and was only focused on what I didn’t.

I don’t mind helping someone I love when they’re tired. But it shouldn’t be expected, and it definitely shouldn’t lead to this level of aggression if I don’t meet those expectations. I still feel shaken, confused, and honestly a little scared.

Just needed to get this off my chest.


After I ignored him after the event this is the message I received :  ai translated it, english is not my native language, it was a long text.

It’s not your job, thanks.
So you don’t end up spending another 50€, I’ll drive you — even though I told you I was tired and didn’t want to go anywhere.
You already made me one meal, I should be grateful for that.
Why should you care that I haven’t eaten properly in over a week?
You said everything. Thanks. Rest as much as you need.

I reminded you three times we could order something. When I mentioned you could’ve picked something up at the store, you responded like this.

Thanks again for making me feel like asking for a damn meal is too much. You listed eight things I’m doing for you, after the 460 things I’ve already done. I just wanted two meals. Two f*cking hours of effort.

But you couldn’t even do that during the two days you were here. If that’s too much, then we have nothing to talk about.

I don’t want to hear anything more. I don’t give a f*ck how little I’m asking — if you can’t even give me that. The 50€ is a problem for you? (I won’t even count what I’ve spent on you.)

Just f*ck off. I don’t care about anything I’ve done for you, because it clearly means nothing.

If you can’t respect me, then I don’t want this. How do you show respect? By sticking to agreements — something you can’t manage.

Take your pills, get your hormones checked — I don’t give a sh*t. I’m not your emotional punching bag. Either act the way we agreed a hundred times or leave. I’m done.”

619,"So, for some context, I currently live with my parents in a two-story house; the upper floor is mine, the downstairs part is theirs. I won't get into much detail here aside from the fact I don't have enough money to live on my own at the moment, but I'm hoping to get a promotion next year that would allow me to rent a room somewhere.
Despite the fact that my house is truly beautiful, I absolutely despise living with my parents, especially my mom since she tends to be very controlling, dad most of the time doesn't really care about my existence. But I recently returned to therapy and I decided to do something for my inner child, as I always struggled with not feeling important enough to anyone. 
I gave my inner child her very own corner of the house, a spot my parents can never really find as I made sure it is well hidden. I live on the attic so it leaves a lot of room for some weird tiny corners there isn't much to do with unless you can afford custom made furniture. Long story short, I managed to turn one of these corners into a secret hideout where I put everything my child self always wanted - sweets all to myself, bubbles, cute flowers, sketchbooks, plushies, pretty pillows, you name it. I feel so safe there knowing there is one spot in my house that my mother doesn't know about. For an everyday thing, I may be a boring office worker, but in there, I felt like I get to relive this safe and loving childhood I never had.

I don't feel comfortable telling anyone in my friend group about this and my family obviously cannot know. Only my cat knows, but she's allowed in there lol. I don't want to know what would my friends say if they found out I have a little hideout where I can pretend I am a kid again, I just want to be happy that I have a little break from life like this.

I can't tell anyone I know, so I'm telling you, fellow stranger.
The fact that I have something that is mine and mine alone, and that at least in there I can feel like I am someone's priority - my own - makes me happier than I could have ever imagined.
This is my joy, I would recommend it to anyone.",
620,"My uncle passed away unexpectedly a week ago. He was in his early 50s, and for a long time, he struggled with alcoholism. The loss has been hitting me in waves, but something strange has been sticking with me.

Before he died, I had randomly been reading a lot about Matthew Perry—his memoir, interviews, even old clips from Friends. I was struck by how much Perry reminded me of my uncle. I always find them similar in many ways. They were the same age, both battled addiction, and weirdly… they even looked alike. That same haunted charm, if that makes sense.

When my uncle died, all those thoughts just flooded in. It felt eerie, like the universe was preparing me in some odd, emotional way. Maybe it’s just coincidence. But I keep thinking about the parts of people that echo in others, even famous ones. And how loss can make those connections feel deeper than they were before.

I don’t know what I’m really trying to say, but I guess I just needed to get it out. If anyone’s ever experienced something like this—those strange connections or foreshadowings—I’d be curious to hear.",

I even work in IT now (previously an office worker but decided to switch jobs) so I am fully aware of the direction we are aiming for and I really don't like it.

Back in around 2010 when I first went to random websites it almost felt like magic and everything was kind of ""amateur"" back then. Now everything is owned by big corps stealing your informations and destroying small projects from passionates to generate even more profit. It eventually became even worse with the rise of AI.

We also need to talk about this... Damn I hate AI so much, it basically takes every bad sides of the internet and makes it way worse (pollution, loss of jobs, misinformation, ...). Everyone needs to throw a useless AI in their useless website, I have seen some of the dumbest shit ever put on corporate websites just for them to be able to say ""Hey we have AI"" which I find really pathetic.

Paying is now the norm, you don't want your information sold ? Pay. You don't want ads ? Pay. You want to see a movie that is available on some shitty streaming service ? Pay. Sometimes I feel like I need to browse for hours to be able to access what I am looking for without paying. Netflix even launched a subscription that have ads even though you pay for it, what the fuck ? Bring back good old Pirate Bay !

And finally the worst part of it, social medias. I know it is kind of hypocrite to say this on Reddit since it is also ""kind of"" a social media platform, but I am talking mainly about Instagram and Twitter here (because I will never call it ""X"", that name is as ridiculous as it's owner). First we have the 2 shitheads that runs these that are so pathetic and attention seeking that I will not even talk about them. Second, what the fuck is going on with this alpha chad male misogynistic bullshit over there ???? Now you can post an entire speech publicly about how much you hate women and not get any trouble for it ? These platforms have a HUGE responsibility in popularizing such behaviours and no one seems to care...

  
TLDR : Big corps monopole, everything owned by shitty billionaires, hate speech everywhere and useless AI ruining people's job and increasing global pollution at light speed",
623,"I'm 21F, majoring in biology and I fully believe AI has made people dumber in a span of 4 or 5 years only. My classmates use chatGPT for everything, every assignment, every little work, every research. They don't use books from the library, Google or correct research websites, they only use AI. Their homework is made by chatGPT, the images on their presentations are made by chatGPT, hell their whole PowerPoint is made by chatGPT just using a single prompt and they never proofread it, their grades are terrible and I'm surprised they're managing to stay on this major for the past 2 years. 

Only a few people actually do stuff on my class, I heard teachers say the other classes are the same. I can't imagine why someone would pay so much for a major and not actually study, they just want to be able to say they went to X university, even though that is quite useless where we live since I've seen people majoring in high paying courses yet became Uber driver's in the end (nothing against Uber drivers, my father is one but obviously you don't enter uni thinking ""hmm, I'll become an Uber driver after graduating"").

As a part of my major, I have to teach teens (ages 13-16) biology. Their situation is even worse, they open chatGPT right on class to answer questions on the board. What the hell, what happened to actually making an effort? What happened to caring about what you learn? This worries me a lot everyday, technology has reached a point where, instead of researching what can actually help humans, they seem to only care about money and automating our minds and life.

Edit: someone sent me a message saying I must be as stupid as those students because my English isn't perfect. I'm from Brazil, my main language is Portuguese, I'm fluent in Spanish and Italian, not in English but this is a work in progress.

Edit 2: alright, I guess this was shared somewhere it shouldn't have and I got a death threat in my DMs (lol? I'm a lurker so I didn't think reddit was like this) and a few other weird messages. First of all, if you use generative AI: alright. If you think it's good and is not affecting people's critical thinking: okay. This post is a vent of what I'm seeing as a teacher/student. I'm engaging with those that disagree with me but are civil, people can have their own opinions. For those who were civil and shared their opinions/experience on this matter: thank you! I actually got to think more and even learned a few new things here!!",
624,"Super low stakes, I just wanted to tell someone without them feeling obligated to do something about it.

I'm the family baker. For all the special occasions, I bake cakes as a little extra present on top of everything else. It's just nice to have a cake to slowly eat through the week and it makes the celebration feel complete somehow?

It's my birthday today. I woke up and I realized that I'm not going to get a birthday cake, I didn't request one so they won't think about it. Honestly, the rest of my family are cooks not bakers so any cake they would've made wouldn't be great. Store bought might be better.

They're taking me out to dinner at my favorite restaurant and I'll get to order dessert, but there's something special about birthday cake. 

I'm not going to say anything, it'd ruin the vibe, especially since I didn't request it in advance. Just a little bummed.",
625,"Hi I’m 21 and at 19 I married my husband before this let me give you Bit of a back story so we’re gonna call the cousin A , so A was ment to get married a couple years before but her marriage failed btw I’m south Asian so we typically have big wedding with the whole shebang . She was brought up with my husband so my mil helped raise her .Prior a month before my wedding we had a henna night were we invite the in-laws to come join when A had come she had wore the same colours as me witch were her own clothes from her henna night that didn’t happen I was upset as she new what I was gonna wear I told my partner and he told my mil who spoke to her about it she denied that I had told her what I was wearing 

Fast forward to my wedding day I was so happy I had just gotten to the hall I was hidden as no gusset were allowed to see me until I walked down in this time my bridesmaids and family would FaceTime me so I could see if everything going smoothly until I seen A in her wedding dress ( btw my family south Asian and in south Asian weddings are traditional dress is red ) she had wore her red and gold done up wedding dress while I went for white I was told she would be wearing gold but not her own wedding dress or it even to be red which hurt me as it was hard to tell who was the bride people were gossiping asking who’s she why is she in red and confused saying that’s not who’s ment to be getting married it was embarrassing she cut the trail from the Buck of her dress but the whole thing was a disaster from there I tried to ignore it but I wasn’t happy I was pissed and my in-laws all new , she proceeded to take pics on stage when ever I was off didn’t congratulate me or didn’t even get us anything ( not about gifts but it’s just a respect thing something as small as a wedding card . When it was time to leave and for everyone to wave us off and to then meet us at my husband house there was anther drama she had lied that my one of my uncles said they were going to brake her legs but I was there when she was stood next to them chatting away I heard that whole convo with my ears my uncle said to her she’s like yiur sister now so you 2 should have one anthers back , I don’t think she liked what he said because what in the world did she think it was ok to go to my mil and make up lies that made are family’s start arguing and caused me and my husband upset on the only wedding day we had got . I tried getting out the car to try fight her I tried being classy but when someone making 2 family’s fight I couldn’t keep it in everyone trying to keep me in the car . We went back to his house and it was awkward played the games and went to my new room to change when in the next room I could hear them talking about what happen so I walked in and asked what’s the problem A carried on to say that am I jealous of her or something I said what am I ment to be jealous of I’m 19 she’s 35 I said to her instead of causing a scene at my wedding she could of pulled me and my husband to the side after and we could of sorted it but instead made a lot of people get hurt my aunties were crying thinking that what has happen , I asked her to come in my room with me and my husband so we could talk it out as I didn’t need the stress after we cleared the air she carried on to saying rubbish about my family I told her from there to stop and to nether utter my uncles or any member of my family’s name again as I won’t take it and it will cause a problem she left but after that things just got worse 

My husband believed my side of the family as he knows how his cousin is compared to the uncle she said , said something the day after we spoke about it her mum said I did say to her to get a new dress and that I’d buy if for her but she wanted to wear her wedding dress . My mil and her sister kept saying to me she didn’t do it out of bad intentions apparently after my engagement she said ‘I’m wearing my wedding dress I got ‘ so her mind was made up and apparently they did try to tell her get suin diffrent my husband grandma argued that he should got somthjng for her(a) why should she buy it new he should which I think is wrong she is capable of getting her self one as a beautician who also works in the bank and was living at home at the time 

 .
One  week later my mil said to go other to her house ( she lived in his grandma house ) because she has a operation on her nose or something so we went took a box of chocolate I went to greet her and she was laying down on the sofa with eye mask on she lifted her eya mask looked me up and down and put it back on not a hello back nothing I was pissed I said to his family I’ll never say hello again as a Muslim when someone is greets you you greet them back instead she just looked me up and down , anther time fresh after we was married she I was at his grandma house leaving and she started screaming I ain’t going to anther wedding after fing last time this that I was furias and just left , the worst one was when someone had died and a lot of people came over to my in-laws house she was there and right at the end kicked of because my husband was dropping his nan home ( my Husband hasn’t spoke to her since what she pulled at are wedding ) she’s started cussing him out saying all the names under the sun and when my brother in law told her move out the way as his mums ill and couldn’t stand properly he said stop standing there like a crackhead sit down and she went off saying calling me a cracked over a girl that been in the house for not that long I lost it went up and was pacing I rang my husband to come home before I physically chuck her out the house he got back quick within 5 mins ,he came and she left straight out the door screaming at her mum to get tf out the house 

When ever we talk about the situation she tells people that I should apologies as I’m younger however she ruined my wedding and my start up to my married life they would all go out with out me as she was there and would not want me coming with them if it’s to get there hair done or just for a nice dinner or swimming which I find is stupid everyone always making excuses but I have now said if one thing comes out her mouth bad about me or my husband I’ll happily give her a backhander idc if she’s older she acts like she’s 18 when she’s 35 I think it’s down to still being spoiled idk but it’s just disgusting how everyone just excepts her behaviour I don’t think I’m the a whole if I put her in her place the next time I let a lot slide as I was newly married and I didn’t want to upset my in-laws but now things have changed I said to my mil if I become pregnant she will not be around my child I stand with that I never thought she had bad intentions towards me until all this happen what do you think

626,"I’m sorry if this isn’t very clear—English isn’t my first language.

I honestly don’t know how to start this. I just feel so stuck. I’m scared I’ll never get better or reach that “breakthrough” moment. Since I was a child, I’ve always felt like something was wrong with me—like I didn’t belong or like I wasn’t enough. Even when I had good things, that feeling never fully went away.

For a while, I was doing okay. I thought I was healing. But lately, it feels like I’m falling back into that same darkness. I keep seeing those stories on TikTok about people who never get a happy ending—who get what they deserve because they were “the bad guy.” And I can’t stop feeling like that’s me. That I’ve made too many mistakes to deserve peace. That maybe I am the villain.

I really thought this year would be different. And in some ways, it is—I’m studying what I love, I love in the place im currently in at school and my family is still close. But deep down, I still feel empty. I feel like I’m missing something and I don’t know what it is. I feel like I should be happy, and the fact that I’m not makes me feel even more broken. I’m young and have so much to live for, yet I can’t even see those for myself. I’m just sad. 

I also don’t have many friends, and when I look back at people from my old school—even the ones I used to be close to—they all seem so much happier now. And I know it sounds selfish or jealous, but I want that too. I want to feel like I’m living, not just surviving. It’s frustrating when I see TikToks saying “This is your year!” or when people around me say “It’s going to happen soon” —because it never really does. Or at least it doesn’t feel like it.

What hurts the most is seeing my family so connected to God, so full of joy, and then there’s me—just… lost. It makes me feel like I don’t matter. Like maybe even God forgot about me.

I don’t know what I want out of this post. I guess I just needed to let it out. I’m tired of pretending I’m okay with it. ",
627,"I (M, 22) was T-boned on my way to work last March and I’ve been in pain every day since. 

I am the youngest of three, my two older brothers are on the Autism Spectrum and I’m expected to take care of them after my parents die. My mother is chronically ill. My father and I are the only sources of income for my family. 

I suffer from chronic daily migraines and chronic back pain. I’ve only just began to get medication for my migraines, but have to fight tooth and nail with my health insurance to receive treatment. Currently I am without any medication because of insurance denial and a shortage caused by the tariffs. 

I’m tired. Tired of the constant pain. I still have to work despite the excruciating daily pain. I’ve seen a therapist for my PTSD. All of my free time is spent in doctor’s offices or lying in bed, paralyzed from the pain. 

The only thing that brings me relief is the thought of death. I have too many people relying on me to kill myself. No one knows the scope of my pain, only the surface level. My doctors say that there is a chance that it will go away, but I’ve given up on that prospect. No one knows about my constant suffering or my suicidal ideation. My true thoughts are too dark for the people in my life to truly understand.

I hate how everything seems to revolve around technology. I hate how accessible people expect others to be because of phones. If I don’t want to answer your message it doesn’t mean you have to then message again or call me, especially if it isn’t important. Wait until I get back to you. I wish we stopped moving on with technology past the early 2000s. “I need my phone for my job” “I need my phone because of XYZ” and you don’t see that as a problem?!? I hate that we are becoming less sociable because of them. “I don’t know what I’d do without my phone” read a book! Write something down! Literally anything. “I only pay on apple pay” WHAT?! This is why cash is dying, I can’t give my daughter some cash to go to the local cinema because they don’t accept cash anymore! It’s all card! We are ruining life. This is why kids end up resulting to crime, they don’t have a childhood, they’re stuck behind a screen, being exposed to exactly what us adults see because nothing is truly filtered, there’s always loopholes. And no one is doing anything to change it! I’m getting rid of my iPhone, or at least treating it like an iPad and going back to a flip phone because I am done. I am done with constant emails, I am done with people messaging me on a ridiculous amounts of apps because I haven’t replied to them quick enough. I am done with Apple Pay. “Technology makes life easier” , no. Look at us. Look at how miserable the world is as a whole. Staring at a stupid little box, hoping it’ll bring us joy. 

You can see this as a crazy rant. Or you can read it and see that it kind of makes sense. Libraries are dying. The high street is dying. We’re letting it all die because everything is at the touch of a button instead. Sometimes technology can be handy but now we’re relying on it too much. We’re getting lazy. But no one cares or someone will argue that technology is the best thing ever.",
629,Around 3 months ago a incident happened outside our home. My partner was approached by somebody who had a knife.. it was a quick encounter nobody was stabbed he walked away we phoned the police. We live in a small town so it’s very easy to find out who people are what are they up to who they are associated with etc etc.. turns out this man used to be a normal guy but cocaine and a toxic relationship have took him over to the dark side. He’s tried to reach out through a third party to try and apologise but my partner doesn’t want to speak to him (fair enough) His bail conditions prevent him from entering our street but his partner lives over the road. I had a brief altercation with her nothing to really write home about she was drunk didn’t make much sense I told her to go away as she was acting apologetic then harbouring him in her house knowing the police was looking for him (justifying his actions in my opinion). Every day since me and my partner haven’t got on because he keeps saying he wants to move house. I don’t want to move we have only lived here for 6 months it’s a nice house and why should we!? But he has the tendency to over think and really make a situation bigger than it is he will think of the worse case scenario as if it’s actually going to happen for which I have sympathise but not enough to uproot our whole lives. I’m so frustrated we’ve argued everyday since but I’m just trying to be realistic I don’t believe anyone should make you leave your home you love and we’ve already moved a couple times in our autistic sons life time due to different circumstances and it unsettles him every time I don’t think it’s worth it. I’m honestly at the point and thinking I can’t go on with him anymore we’ve been too unsettled in recent years and this is a hill I honestly think I’m willing to die on.,

Hello all,

I'm not a common reddit poster so I am sorry if this is out of wack and all over the place. So to get started last March 2024 I booked a 10 day Alaskan cruise for my mom's 50th birthday for 4 people (my mom, dad, husband and me). At this point my husband and I have been trying for a baby since October 2023 not sure if I would or when I would get pregnant but fully knowing we wanted to go on this cruise. Anyways flash forward to February 2025 and we find out we are finally pregnant with out very wanted little boy. During this cruise I would have been at most 15 weeks pregnant and their guidelines say no pregnant women at 24 weeks so I would have been just fine. Being the cautious person I am I wanted to make sure our little boy was doing fine and groovy as well my family (5 people in a private ultrasound studio). We went this past Friday when our cruise is on Monday. Immediately she told us to go to the hospital and talk to my doctor. My baby was only measuring 11/12 weeks when I was supposed to be 13 weeks, there was no heartbeat and no movement. After sitting in the ER for hours it was confirmed I lost my baby at 11 weeks and 4 days. Of course we are devastated but we know we will get our rainbow baby one day. I was still determined to go on this cruise and celebrate life and my little boys life. The ER doctor told me it wasn't a good idea to go and only referred suggested the I talk to my primary doctor to find out the next steps. The next day I am figuring out the next steps and since it's the weekend I can't talk to my primary. The on call doctor said that I would need medication or D&C and neither would be resolved by Monday when we go on our cruise. It was highly advised I do not go because of the change I could have excessive bleeding and the medical staff on the cruise are not equipped for this.All weekend I fought back and forth with my mind on what my decision would be, I know the logical is not to go but I just felt so desperate to go and not feel so lost.I called the cruise line on Saturday to let them know about our situation and what they could do. I did not get vacation protection and that is completely on me. But truly who expects this? Anyways, they said since I didnt get cruise protection and I already made my final payment this is nothing they could do, when I was completely fine just getting a different cruise date. Of course at this point my parents did not want to go and wanted to support. The lady told me I can try to plea my case with an email but for my parents they could do absolutely nothing since they weren't the ones actually in the situation. I spent the rest of the weekend hoping my baby would pass so I could go but that was not the case. I felt terribly that we would lose $5k, I know i know money is money but it still hurts. I convinced my parents to still go on this cruise so they could enjoy it and let us live through them, then when things are looking up again we can go together and they can be our tour guides. So at this point I tried to call the cruise line again to see if there was anything else I could do or just have to take the loss, I pretty much got the same answer. They canceled my cruise and said I could get taxes and fees back but that's it and to wait to hear back from the email I sent. I am still figuring out what to do since I haven't heard from the doctors of when I can get things done. Not to mention this past weekend was Mother's day and I am just here carrying around my dead baby. Okay anyways I just wanted to put all my thoughts down and I am just upset and lost. I understand that it's just a material thing whatever but this is still upsetting and feeling what I am feeling. ",
631,"Hello. I don’t want to expose myself too much because I know my siblings are on reddit too. All I can say is that I am the youngest of my siblings. 

Before I start, english is not my first language so do excuse any grammatical errors. 

Firstly, let me give some context on how my parents are when it comes to me and my siblings education. My mum is always strict with our attendance but when it comes to our grade, she doesn’t care as long as we passed. On the other hand, my father doesn’t care about our education at all.

It started with my dad. My dad never came to my primary school graduation, only my mum did. I didn’t mind it because the relationship between us wasn’t stable at that time. I was more close to my mum than my dad when I was younger. Secondary school graduation came and he didn’t attend it either, it was just my mum again. I was a bit hurt by his decision but again, I also did not mind this because our relationship was still unstable. Both of the graduations, my dad never give a reason why he didn’t came. And if you wonder why I didn’t ask for his reason is because communication doesn’t exist in our family. Whatever problems we have, we prefer to shut it down as quickly as possible and pretend it never happened. Thats why I’m ranting it here rather than talking to them. 

Now fast forward, college ended and I manage to graduate with a GPA thats I am very proud of. I didn’t want to tell my parents because I want it to be a surprise. However, it didn’t go as planned. 

A month before the graduation ceremony, my mum texted me that she and my dad wouldn’t be able to attend the ceremony because they will be going on a holiday with one of my sibling (sorry for being vague on which sibling it is. I genuinely do not want to expose myself too much). And this infuriates me till today because not only they choose to go on holiday on my graduation date but also she informed me through text message rather than teling me face to face when IN FACT, both of us were at home at that time. 

This sibling of mine had planned the trip since the beginning of the year.  Obviously, they didn't know that my graduation will be on the exact date of their holiday. My school only informed us the date 2 months before. But the thing is, I wasn't the only one who attend this college. My other sibling also did and I know for a fact that they always held the graduation ceremony on a specfic month. And, I even informed my parents at what month could the ceremony will be at the beginning of the year. My guess was correct btw. 

At the end, I decided to not attend my graduation. I felt embarrassed knowing that other students has someone attending their graduation and celebrate their achievements while I had nobody. 

Till today their action pained me so much because I thought they, especially my dad, would be proud and happy to see me walking on stage and graduated with a high GPA. However, I can't help but feel guilty for feeling this way. It's as if I'm not allowing them to enjoy things and should be focusing on me only. Maybe it is due to my upbringing and culture. 

I know this subreddit is not a place to ask for opinions but I just want to if my feelings valid or am I just being spoiled brat? Thank you. 

TLDR; My parents didn't come to my graduation ceremony because they choose to go on a holiday with one of my sibling instead. I feel hurt but also guilty for feeling this way. Would like to hear your opinion(s) whether my feelings are valid or I'm just a spoiled brat. Thank you.",
632,"Hi, first of all sorry in advance for possible mistakes, English is not my first language. I will post the same in other subs.

***TLDR***:

I “*think*” my mother in law (“MIL” for now on) is cheating on my father in law (=FIL) .

Of course I’m really confused about what should I do or not.

First of all a bit of context to describe how complicated it is.

* Me (M in my 30s) and my fiancée (F in her 30s) are been together for more than 12 year (planning to marry sooner or later)
* now we have a little kid 4yo
* since I met my fiancée, I met her family, to which I became very soon very close, I feel like I’m a part of the family, my fiancee’s parents were (are) young and lovely so we spend a lot of time together, free time, holidays, travels etc, we are sort of “big happy family” you know
* my fiancée shares a business with her mom, they are very very close (always been – I feel that my MIL is maybe the most important person in my fiancee’s life after our son, I’m not “jealous” of it, I’m fine with it)
* my son really LOVES his grandparents, especially his grandmother (MIL), she also really loves him, they spend a lot of time together (most of with my fiancée also, they are an inseparable trio)
* I am also very close to my MIL and FIL, they are very pleasant and youthful, like I said before in 12+ years they had always make me feel like another “son” to them
* MIL is in early 50s, very beautiful and attractive woman, looks younger and she obviously knows it (I can confess I always found her really hot and always had a sort of secret “crush” for her). She also is a very good mother and a lovely wonderful grandmother
* FIL is in later 50s, a good man (with his flaws like everyone), we always had a lot of chemistry
*  I don’t know exactly how to describe their marriage (they had some ups and downs that I think normal for a couple that is together 30+ years), we passed through those ups and downs with them but always like “passengers”, I always felt that their marriage was not my business and basically it was the same for my fiancée (she is “live and let live” kind of person) 

Fast forward to two months ago, we were all together for a family holiday (FIL was not with us due to his work) and while on the plane (coming back home) MIL was scrolling a chat on her phone next to me (maybe thinking I was sleeping – I had sunglasses on), and I feel guilty to say that my eye fell on absolutely by chance. I could watch only maybe 30secs before she closed it (she 100% didn’t notice me spying by the way), but it was clear that it was a chat with another man, that seemed extensive (like lot of messages during the days) and there was hearts and sort of “good morning my love” etc.

I should add that during the holiday, I noticed her often stepping out to make phone calls (none of us asked about, neither my fiancée who is discreet and she trusts her mom 100%)

I don’t know exactly how it hit me. Part of me was angry, like it was my mom cheating on my dad, maybe part of me was kind of “jealous”, but I decided to act like nothing happened.

Back home we moved on with our lives, like nothing never happened, but sometimes I feel stressed because I remember that thing and I absolutely don’t know what would be fair to do. I don’t want to hide something important to my fiancée, but part of me thinks this is “not my business”, and I know that I would feel guilty if I would “destroy” the family.  I know that there is not a “single” right thing to do, but I would know some different points of view: what would you do considering ALL the context?",
633,"I can do this on my own. My family says they'll help but we'll see. If I am, depending on how far along I am, depends on if I make calls. A few of the prospective fathers are either blocked or ghosted me. 

If not I'll probably be a little sad. I do want one. Now isn't ideal but fuck, if I do one thing right, it will be this. Part of me is willing that I am. Maybe as the baby grows I'll hate myself less. I feel like an idiot but fuck. Im ok with being a single mom. I'd rather pretend he wanted nothing to do with the baby than marry a man at all. 

Besides, I'll do better than my parents. I'll make sure they're loved and cared for. Tomorrow morning I'm gonna take that yest and if I am, the reason I've been crying is solved, and I get to grow a life. I'm so scared. I'm 20. I'll get myself OK before that baby gets here. I don't know why I want it so badly. I shouldn't. I've been crying and in moods. I'm spotting earlier than normal. Maybe. Just maybe.
",
634,"I keep telling myself it was just assault (god, “just”) but I said no. It was a couple of weeks ago.

I had hooked up with him a few times. He was a little awkward, but who isn’t these days? But the last time I met him, he was drunk. I should’ve realised he wasn’t in his right mind based on how he was texting me. I consented, went to his place looking for sex. But then I got uncomfortable, and wanted him off of me. I told him to be careful of the tattoo I’d just gotten not even an hour previous, but he wasn’t. He stood between me and the door until I threatened to scream for his roommates to hear. I couldn’t even grab my knife, since it’s not like he was armed. He was easily a foot taller than me and MUCH stronger, but the law says I would be in the wrong. He followed me down the hall after I told him to leave me alone. I was crying. His roommates saw him chase after me and didn’t say anything. He gave me one last kiss that I tried to avoid before he stumbled back to his apartment. I was going to bus home but I called an uber. 

I think I’m getting better. But I can’t be intimate with someone without thinking of him. Or, hell, I can’t even feel turned on without thinking of him.",
635,"She had to go back to her home country for visa reasons, and since then, everything feels off. We’ve spent so much time apart during our relationship and honestly… I can’t take it anymore. I want to be with her. For good.

We met in Costa Rica (where she's from) and shared the most amazing moments of our lives there. There’s a beach where everything just felt perfect (it was her favourite day). I’ve planned to take her back there and propose. I want it to be a big surprise. There was this one saying playing on repeat that day. We went out on the kayaks and we were with our friends. I want to go there in secret and surprise her on that beach subtly playing that same song that we heard on repeat that day (she'll remember without a doubt) and then surprise her with a beautiful setup, and me finally asking her to marry me. A moment just for her, because she deserves something truly special after everything she’s been through (she's had such a difficult life).

But between travel, the ring, and trying to make it all happen, I'm struggling. I've been working like crazy, chasing every client I can, even trying for loans. Honestly hate asking but love pushes you to do things you wouldn't normally do. I feel like I'm trying everything humanly possible.

Does anyone have any advice? Or any ideas on what I can do? 

This will happen. I've thrown aside my pride and am doing everything I can. Even if it takes time, I'll make it happen.

Even if you just read this, thank you so much! I'll keep you all updated on what happens. ",
636,"I love my fiancé, our wedding is a month away and I’ll be moving to Toronto after. I have mixed feelings going on right now, I’ve lived in my town my whole life and the community here is just what I’m used to. I’m used to be around people from the same origins as me, we live in America so having this community here means a lot to me. It makes me feel like I’m more connected to my culture and I love our people. In Toronto, it seems like it’s very culturally diverse. It’s really nice and I feel like I’d still be happy there, I’d miss the culture here but it’s not something I’m that worried about.

I’m gonna miss my friends a lot, my brother’s wife is pregnant right now so the baby will be here around the end of the year and I really hope to be here. It’s so crazy to me how things are changing, it’s scary and I feel so overwhelmed. Mind you, i’m 23 years old. It’s old enough to get married in my culture and it’s not viewed as young. But to me, I still feel like a kid a lot of the time. 

I’m worried my niece isn’t gonna know me along with my brother’s other kids in the future. It scares me, I always thought I’d be close by and like a second mom. Now I’m gonna be far away and barely come around. The lifestyle my brother and his wife live is a very strict and religious one, which is the complete opposite of me and my fiancé. I honestly hit the lottery with him, an Arab man who believes in women picking their own lives and not being centered around kids and the household.

I don’t wanna say that’s a bad thing to be religious and traditional with traditional gender roles. I just don’t like it and personally would never live like that. At the end of the day, my niece is gonna grow up in that household and everything they believe in will be put onto her and her siblings. So I don’t think even if I were to stay in this town, I don’t think we’d be all that close. Whatever happens, I don’t wanna be a stranger to her and future siblings. 

My sister in law’s brother is married a white woman who converted to Islam. She came from an Atheist family and has a gay brother who has a transgender partner. I heard my sister in law the other day saying that the gay brother isn’t allowed around their niece and nephew because he’s gay. He also said he wouldn’t want to be around if they’re not accepting of his partner either. They think if the kids see that they’ll think “it’s okay and become that way”. 

I wasn’t necessarily around the LGBT community growing up but I used to watch so many YouTubers that were gay and trans. I was probably like 9 years old, I was “exposed to them” at a young age and didn’t turn out gay or trans lol. I just think the whole thing is sad. 

My thing with religion is that it’s always been a very restrictive thing. I never felt like I could be myself which is just a girl living her life. I’m glad to be moving away from all of this but it’s just a love hate thing right now. I can go be myself in a new place and start over with the person I love. I’m just worried to be forgotten or put aside.",
637,"This coming fall I plan to move to the city my best friend lives in. She's not the *only* reason I want to move there but she is a big part of it. The other part is that there's a college there that's good for my major (Psychology) so I wanna go for that reason as well. 

Everyone I tell this too acts like I need a justification for it. As if I need more reason than just wanting to be around one of the few people who genuinely pushes me to be a better person. As if I need more reason than just wanting to be around someone who no matter how much we annoy each other, truly makes me happy. 

I've spent my *entire* life justifying my decisions. Never doing anything just for myself. Choosing others needs over my own. Not this time. This might never make sense to anyone else, but I don't need it to.",
638,"I have this question for a long time and it seems no one can really answer me. I hear lots of people talk about it and praising it as a key to a good life. But how do you become confident in a true way?

**For me it seems just those are confident who had success before in life and can ignore their negative experiences.**

I am 28 and I learned lots of things. I really consider myself talented in many ways.

* I did an engineering degree quite fast where most people did cancel. Today I have no doubt to solve a given task.
* I taught myself completely DIY to repair cars. Even more complicated things. If something breaks I am relaxed. I will just repair it.
* I traveled alone through many countries. I am not afraid of it. I ussually know what to do and trust in my intelligence and ability to help myself because I have done it before.
* there are even more things like people say I draw beautiful pictures, I am a good driver, ....

For me it seems. Confidence is just based on positive experience. I also got lots of compliments for all those things but it didnt change anything. I already knew this before I heard those compliments and not felt really satisfied about it. Whenever I get a compliment I am thinking like ""Yeah I already know this. Did you notice just now?"" I obviously dont say so and say thanks in a restrained way. I kinda think other people will never truly appreciate me and it´s for some part my fault because I don´t talk about myself.

Where I am not confident is when it´s about other people. I just can´t control situations. I have a lot friends but I almost never had any positive experience and success with women and that´s why I have no confidence with women except for some close ones who are friends. I only managed to hide my non-confidence more or less.

**How can I learn confidence without having success/positive experience before?**

This question is meant especcially on women but I am also interested in general.",
639,"I just watched the film Bicho de Sete Cabeças, and I saw myself reflected in almost every scene. I'm not Neto, but the feeling of being a misunderstood, rebellious young man who did everything his own way and didn't care about the consequences... that describes me.

I was forcibly hospitalized because of excessive marijuana use. Three guys showed up while I was on the computer and took me to a clinic. It wasn't like the one in the movie — it was paid, costing R$1200 per month, with rules, routine, pool and an old gaming machine — and the majority there were addicted to cocaine or crack. But good people. Almost no one with apparent mental disorders, like in the film. I was more observant than conversational there.

I found it all extremely unfair. And in reality… it was. I just played LoL and smoked all day. I never stole, I never sold anything from my house, I never attacked anyone. I was just lost, isolated, closed in my own world. There was only one other person hospitalized there because of marijuana, like me. And even then, I realized that if someone doesn't want to change, they won't change just because they're locked away. Only change if you want.

After 15 days there was a mild rebellion — and I almost fled there. I already had a plan in place: I analyzed the location every day, windows, locks, possible routes. But I waited. After a month and 15 days I found the perfect opportunity. A bathroom window appeared locked from the outside, but the padlock was not sealed. I waited for 3am, jumped out the window, climbed onto the roof, jumped into the neighbor's yard, then onto the street wall.

I came across an angry dog ​​— I threatened him with a stone, but didn't hurt him — and managed to follow. I walked for about 30 minutes to a bus stop. I asked for money pretending I had been robbed, a guy on a bike believed me and gave me enough. Another man used his single ticket to get me on the train. I arrived at my father's grandmother's house — she didn't even know I was hospitalized. My depressed aunt opened the door. When my grandmother arrived, they were shocked by the story.

I was never close to my mother's family. After that, I cut ties for years. I thought I would never forgive what they did to me. But after about three years, I saw that that was the past, that only I was stuck with it. And I forgave.

Today I am a healthy young man. I've been going to the gym for 3 years, I follow a diet, and I've seen an absurd evolution — not only in my physique, but mainly in my mentality. Training changed my life. It gave me focus, discipline, self-esteem and clarity.

If you're reading this and feel lost... start training. It may seem boring at first, but over time it becomes a pleasure. And before you know it, you'll be becoming the best version of yourself — inside and out.

That's what I needed to get off my chest. If anyone has read this far, it's worth reading.",
640,"Me and my gf have been together for over a year now and i feel like i dont earn anything from this relationship. I buy her expensive things, doing both small and big things for her, drive out to her after a long day of school and work, and much more. But she doesnt du anything back to me. She rarely buys me something, we never have s*x or anything pleasuring to me, she kinda treats me like a friend when we are together.

641,"I was born by a S.A and my biological father died by bad things if you know. So eventually my mother married a new guy who was nice and European and conviver my sister with love. They then separate but I duo conflicts had to live with my family who is poor and sick physically and mentally. After I reunited with my mother she was different, she drunk and was frustrated almost every reason. 

She gave me traumas and scars, always when my sister in my ex-stepfather said “no I don’t want to eat” or something about “o no, my fathers wife is also a good cook” my mom would drink and eventually frustrates. I was 14, never had these experiences before in a country where I could only speak with her. My family wouldn’t even help, I never felt, I was just a kid who watched ninjago and stuff. It was every reason, I did bad? Drink. She did bad? Drink. She even says there no reason why some people came to my house take me and I was days in a other house with another people trying to smile, but they had reason to be there and I was acting silly. And I feel dumb remember how the people who worked there saw me as dumb or innocent.

I then was moved to live with my stepfather and it was good, but I felt like a normal family, dinner, school, even playing games more and freedom. But every time my mother remembered me “she’s his daughter, not yours”, and this made me distance so much. I don’t blame him, I didn’t meet him when I was kid and he had a reason to separate from my mother, I even feel bad as I hides my phone to maybe ask if he was okay after my mom call him.

Now I live alone and I have flashbacks daily about what me sister lives and me not. “I am never perfect”, just know that I literally suffering every time on the gym they see my potencial in sports. Like I was very dumb on school and it was because of family problems, they didn’t think? Just one teacher asked me after school how I was going. There are these rules about “not talking about what happens inside house”, these rules made me having internal hate for myself and today I have internal hate for my mom and sister. 

As a smart person (sold edit photoshoped online when I was a kid, Python-js-c#, and I had a hobby of reading people duo my broken dream of becoming detective) I can easily know read her mind. She had never been through a child 100% of time as she don’t have experience, she sees my sister as a opportunity to show the world they were wrong and eventually sees my as same potencial my father had. She was trying to be a good mother, but she was sick, and as no one else cared for me when I revived trophys, she was the only option. She was sick and eventually made me sick. And I was so loyal to her because I thought someday she would change, but yes, she did, but not in time. She blame me for her problems, the problem me the did as a selfhate for begin good. 

And my sister is just normal. She had someone to cry and even trust. I hate her because she had a easier life, maybe even because I wanna be her, that’s why I negligent my masculinity a bit for maybe they see me as a Angel as my other family sees her. Today I just grown as a self hated and maybe defend my self from future agressions if I going to say on their faces what they had done. Hearing things like “your sister said she even considers you a brother” makes me wonder if I started or it was her.

I was the person to help everybody, even getting my mother embarrassed when I help someone on street or grab things to take right place on the trash. I was good, innocent or negligent. I cried in movies or even watching series that today I hate but I still defending.  And today I had become a literally punk who sometimes don’t ask for help in gym, because the 80kg in press can’t hurt and me dreams of becoming an artist was broke. Before I would never say “maybe my father was good in making you cry”, today I don’t recognize me for having these thoughts. I was raised for so much good heart, watched inspirational cartoons, Church and my family took off the cartoons because it from devil, the church seemed bad and not funny.

Edit: I know stay where I am because of her. So u chose between bad and less bed. Because of my sister was her miracle. And what I am? I am the extra. The extra in table, the extra in house and the extra son.

I hate my sister and mom, and I blame myself for that. It’s the time I know god exist, but I know my wishes are too small or I give reasons. If maybe god likes posts, I wish for peace. The battle was over I don’t live with them, but the war still on my heart. I am no difference than people who likes to use smokes, I despise because my experience living with them, I do the exactly same thing with gym.",
642,"I'm not really sure where to start. Apologies in advance if this is ramble-y, it will probably be mostly word vomit and will definitely be long but there's just a lot to get off my chest, and as the title may suggest, this whole thing makes me quite a bit nervous. 

Within the last week or so, I, 24f, passed the two year anniversary of graduating college and it's caused me to do a lot of reflecting about where I am post-grad and where I thought I'd be and what my current potential is and I realized that I'm depressed. I was diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety while in high school so this isn't anything that's new necessarily but it's something I had been managing and something that I think snuck up on me. Or maybe I just willfully ignored it. 

While in college, I was in an abusive relationship for around 3 years and 9-ish months. Pretty much from the beginning of freshman year to graduation. I was 18 when we started dating and he was 20, we were both freshmen in the same class, same major at college. A post about our relationship would definitely be a whole other story but it was nice at first. The abuse started a couple months in, it evolved into constant manipulation, gaslighting, trauma dumping, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, etc etc etc. My ex - ""P"" - experienced extreme depression and anxiety. Towards the end of our relationship he was diagnosed with OCD, I suspected that he had some sort of personality disorder as well but I am not a psychiatrist. 

When P was 19, he was seeing a new therapist who had a fear of technology, automation, the advancement of AI, you name it, and brought that up during his sessions. P's mind is extremely obsessive and malleable, once it latches onto an idea then that's it and P's mind latched onto the fear of AI and technology advancement like nothing else. When we were dating he would frequently wake me up by calling me in the middle of the night to have a panic attack on the phone with me about some random article he saw about some random scientist being ""absolutely certain"" that AI was going to take over humanity. I would talk him down for about 20 minutes, hang up, finally fall back asleep and he would call me back 15 minutes later because ""Well what about this other article?"" The obvious solution to that was to put my phone away and turn it on silent or do not disturb. I did, originally. I had DnD set for everyone but my emergency contacts (just my Mom) during bedtime hours but then there was the first of those nights where P called me and I was asleep and didn't answer. He blew up on me the following day and accused me of not caring, of not being there for him, that maybe we should just break up, and that he knew this relationship was a mistake. So, naturally, I added him to the emergency contact list. Anyway, that's probably off topic. 

P's fear of technology was intense. We were in a video production oriented program in college and so we dealt with gear and cameras on a daily basis. He would have weekly panic attacks about the cinema camera becoming obsolete because the iPhone camera was getting better and other technological advances like that he saw as a threat. However, during junior year of college the fear shifted from the fear of actual technological advances to the fear of social media and cancel culture. 

In December of junior year, after we had been dating a little over two years, an ex of his from a year or so prior to us dating sent him a message on Instagram and accused him of raping her when they were together. 

It happened when I was home for winter break, I lived about 3-4 hours away from campus and he lived with his parents in the town that our school was in. She messaged him on Instagram out of the blue and said she wanted to talk. He said sure and then as the text conversation went she alluded to him being extremely pushy during sex and that he forced her into sex when she wasn't ready, especially the first time they had sex which was her first time. He called me panicking. I'm not proud of it, but my first reaction was to just tell him that of course she's lying. She couldn't possibly decide now that you raped her then, it just sounds like she wanted to lose her virginity to her current boyfriend and so to make him feel better she's accusing you of rape. It calmed him down a little but not really. His parents intervened, he almost was sent to the hospital but eventually calmed down enough for us to not fear that he was going to hurt himself. This was the first inkling for me that maybe the way he treated me wasn't normal or right. That maybe yeah, he was very pushy during sex and that's not okay. But I wasn't ready to admit to myself that the person that I was in love with (maybe it was love, I'm not so sure anymore) would be that kind of person. 

He spoke about it to me a lot. It became the only thing that we talked about. The fear that he was a rapist and that he was a selfish and irredeemable piece of scum and I would have to talk him back up and tell him that he deserves to live and that he's not a rapist and certainly not irredeemable. It was exhausting. It was constant. But it was internal, I could handle it because it was happening just between the two of us. The girl didn't go to our school or anything so there wasn't a spread of people knowing.  

After that I became less and less interested in the relationship, I think that's the seed that started the downfall. He was an asshole the whole time so I would've always been justified in leaving him but this was the first time I was like ""Oh, fuck. He's manipulating me. He's taking advantage of me."" 

In late January or early February, at around 3 in the morning on a Saturday I was woken up, yet again, by P calling me and when I answered he's crying on the other end telling me how he messed up and how he's so ""fucking stupid"". I get him to calm down and tell me what's going on. He tells me that he went to N's house and got really high with her. N is the best friend of H, a mutual friend of P's and I. H was closer to P than with me but I did definitely feel like we were on the same friendship plane. Neither P or I were really friends with N, in fact, I didn't really like N. I thought that all N did was get high on various drugs and that she was a bad influence. So waking up in the middle of the night to hear that P had been to her house and got really high with her, did not make me happy that's for sure. But I just rolled my eyes and said okay because I wanted to go back to bed and him calling me in the middle of the night to tell me he had just done drugs at someone's house was not new. But, he said that there was something else. That he had messed up some other way. I asked him if he had sex with her and he said no that he hadn't had sex but that she had given him a blowjob. And because they were both high he just let it happen and that he was so sorry and he's going to do everything he can to win back my trust. At the time, I remember just feeling nothing when he told me. 

We stayed together and pretended like nothing happened for a few weeks after that but right before Spring Break, early March probably a month or so after the phone call from P, P gets a phone call from N telling him that what happened on that night was forced, she was drugged and nearly unconscious and P forced her down on him, and that P is a sexual assaulter and he should come clean about it. P had a total meltdown at the accusation. He started hurting himself on his hands so that way he could never forget what he did. It was a lot. Thankfully I didn't have to deal with a lot of it, and it was his parent's dealing with it. I was just dealing with all the stomach twisting anxiety on the other end the entirety of the week of Spring Break. At one point N sent both me and P a Google Doc that was titled ""Your Boyfriend Assaulted Me and You Need to Accept That"". If I could apologize to N now, for how I handled the whole thing, I would. 

H, who was also in our class and major in school, ostracized us. Me, really. It was a male dominated major and so there were only 5 girls in the class. I was never really all that close with the other three but suddenly it went from all five of us in the class to Them and Me. And honestly, I don't blame her. Her friend had just come out about a sexual assault and the perpetrator was my boyfriend that I was supporting for the most part. I didn't come out at any point and say ""P did NOT do that thing!"" but unfortunately, I know that I shamed N to P and to other people. Called her story bogus and that you can't figure out an assault happened a month after it happened. I hate using the self preservation excuse but I truly have no idea what would've happened to me if I told P that I agreed with the people accusing him. 

Acknowledging that he had raped the girl from before me and had assaulted N meant that I had to accept that everything he was doing to me was rape or assault and I was not ready to accept that. I would never be in the mood, because he treated me like shit, and he would beg and plead and keep me up at night for hours until I gave in and either had sex with him or gave him a blow job. He would then tell me that he felt so unloved in our relationship and start crying and asking me if I know how it feels to feel so unwanted and so then I would respond with the fact none of my needs are met. He didn't compliment me, or focus on me during sex, or do things for me, or plan any sort of dates, I mean the man didn't even keep up with a regular shower habit despite me asking him to, and so I would bring all of this up to him and his response would be that he would feel more inclined to do all of those things if I were to have sex with him more often. 

I knew that the relationship was over but I was so afraid to break up with him. Our school was small, less than 30 in our class for our major and so we were intertwined with everything each other was doing. There would be no easy way to break up with him and still continue on in classes, especially not with a person who is incredibly manipulative and likes to make everything about himself. So I endured. 

Everyday I listened to a constant revolving door of ""Am I going to be canceled?"" ""Am I a rapist"" ""What if N goes to the police?"" ""I should just kill myself because I am the worst person ever""

I got so burnt out so quickly. It was all about him. His feelings his emotions his artwork his projects. All of my personal projects stopped getting any attention so they stopped existing at all. He consumed every ounce of my life with his negativity and with his fear and with his wrongdoing and I'm really mad at myself for letting him do that. I became a mean person while we were together and while I blame him for giving me the environment to do that, I can only blame myself for my actions. 

Prior to this, because of the technology fear, P never posted on social media and only had it downloaded on his phone because of the nature of the business. After the first accusation he deleted Instagram permanently and after the second he deleted all his other forms of social media and almost downgraded his phone to a flip phone. All I would hear every day is about cancel culture and how everyone can see everything that you do online and how everyone is watching you and how everyone just cares so much about every individual thing you do. 

Rationally, I know that's not true. There's 8 billion of us around the world, no one is paying attention to you as much as you are paying attention to you. However, the fear is there. The fear of perception is now there. I feel like someone is always looking over my shoulder while I'm using an electronic device. I can't post something to my Instagram story without my heart racing, wondering about who is going to see it and how it's going to be used against me somehow. I haven't made a post on instagram in almost two years because I can't bring myself to posting something that people can see. I can't even make a post to Reddit, a mostly anonymous site, because I have a fear that something somehow is going to happen because of me posting. I know that some healthy caution with the internet and electronics especially in today's world is good but I think this goes beyond healthy. 

I'm a photographer, I can't even publish my website because the idea of putting my photos on a site that people would go to on purpose makes me want to puke. So I'm not growing as a photographer, my brand is not progressing. I work in a world of networking, a website and a social media presence is necessary, and I'm lacking that ability. I need clients, I can't reach out to people because I don't have a functioning website. The fear that I'm not good enough or the fear that I'm disliked, I don't know but it's stopping my growth. I have plateaued and I know that I haven't peaked yet and so I need to move through this. I don't know what's stopping me. So many other people have the ability to do anything online with no shame and no fear and my hand is shaking while I write a text post. 

This is a lot, if you made it this far I'm sorry for all the word soup you had to swim through to get here but I think it's finally time for me to take a step forward. Hopefully I post this. lol. ",
643,"My brother was diagnosed with autism and ADHD when he was 10. He's high functioning and can speak well, but desperately needs support. He can't make food himself, remember to eat or drink, and needs reminders to brush his teeth/go to the bathroom/shower/etc. He's a handful but I love him. I (f18) have ADHD (fairly certain I have autism too) and can function and mask very well. As the oldest child, I've taken care of him like a third parent along with my grandparents and aunts and uncles. 

Two years ago, my mom was diagnosed with cancer and that took up all of my life. 16, and 17 (and now) weren't about being young, it was about caring for my sick mother and her chemotherapy, along with caring for my brother. I don't feel like a teen and it's like my teenage years were ripped away. Being a kid wasn't even nice before, I had no friends and most kids my age excluded me. I've basically had no childhood since he was born when I was in 2nd-ish grade. Anyways. My mom's cancer came back and she got surgery to remove it, this being her fourth surgery. All of the medications she's on has her worried she'll die, even if the cancer area was removed and was said to have no cancer cells left. She was telling me all the things I need to do when she's gone, and she said I need to take care of my brother. I want to have a life of my own, get married and live far away from them. I told her I'd put him in a nice caretaking home, to which she broke down and cried. I'm 18 and *not* his mom, I don't think it's crazy I don't want to be his caretaker till I die? I'm so upset that I can't have my own life. Everything I've done has been for my family thus far, so I think it would be fair for me to have a life of my own without them for a bit. My parents say this is kinda selfish of me.

I just needed to get this all out since I don't have a therapist and would hate to vent to my friends and have them stress with me.",
644,"So here’s the deal: I started this whole “Reluctant Guru” thing as a kind of spiritual shitpost.
Like, what if I made a character who was self-aware enough to admit he was emotionally unavailable, but just self-helpy enough to monetize the shame?

I figured I’d write some haikus, cry a little in the comments, say “growth” ironically, and move on.
But now I’m knee-deep in stylized backgrounds, writing breakup poems with moons and arches behind them, and watching my karma climb like some sort of sad-boy stock chart.

And here’s the worst part:
People are into it.
Like… commenting “thank you” unironically. Sharing stuff. Following.

And now I’m stuck in this weird liminal space between
“this is satire”
and
“oh god I might be healing.”

645,"Mother’s Day is typically a really hard day for me. I’ve had multiple miscarriages and ever since the first one, Mother’s Day just kinda hurts in an aching way. 

My husband has a son from his previous marriage and they share custody. From the beginning I knew it was a package deal and I accepted it. There are a lot of hard parts of being a stepmom but I’m usually able to move past them. Mother’s Day is just a different kind of pain. He calls me mom (his own choice), I do all the things a mom does when he’s with us, I’ve watched him grow up and learn for years, but yet I still am regularly reminded that I am not his mom in a lot of people’s eyes, and there are times where it isn’t acceptable for me to act like it. 

I’ve also known with the package deal that it means my husbands ex wife will always be in the picture, and I want her to be because obviously that’s the best for my stepson. So I’ve tried to be incredibly civil and friendly and we get along fine. Outside of general good communication, I get her a birthday present, a Christmas present, and a Mother’s Day gift each year. Every Mother’s Day gift is handmade with my stepson, every Christmas gift has some element of him, and her birthday gift is usually a gift card for a couple of Starbucks drinks and her favorite flowers. I have never gotten a single thing from her. I don’t expect anything, and it doesn’t stop me from doing it for her. But when I dropped off a handmade Mother’s Day gift to her house today i cried the whole way home. 

I will always continue to treat her with the love and respect she deserves as my stepsons mother. But it doesn’t make this sting go away and I just needed to scream it into an internet void. ",
646,"It was low already, but some medications I went on completely killed it off. I haven’t jerked off or even thought about sex/girls for the past month and a half. I get bored whenever people bring up girls or even their relationships. It’s almost like having a superpower on one hand. I don’t think or care about getting another gf, and have a single pointed focus on the things I’m passionate about. Watching people’s posts about their relationship issues is amusing and makes me wonder why people sacrifice their time, hobbies, passions, etc just to have someone to cuddle with/fuck. The downside is that I know it’s not normal and without the motivation of sex, I’ve also lost all interest in maintaining a fit body or becoming more social. I don’t know how to feel about it, or if I should talk to my doctor about it.",
647,"I need to leave my husband. There’s no physical abuse or anything- but there is infidelity and emotional abuse. I’ve been scared to leave. Not of him, scared because I’ve never been by myself before. 

But today I’m tired. I’m tired of feeling inadequate around him. I’m mad that he made me feel guilty about not doing dishes while sick when he’s capable of doing them too. I’m mad that while I was visibly struggling with dizziness and wooziness (dealing with a potential POTS diagnosis) he yelled at me because I felt bad. He fucking yelled at me and I felt bad about feeling bad and it’s bullshit. 

I went upstairs to take a nap and he’s down playing ps5 with the kids. In reality- I’ve finally emailed a lawyer for a consultation. This is the furthest I’ve gotten without panicking and deciding to just stay put. I’m sure I’ll panic again- but if each time I roll the ball a little further, eventually I’ll get there. 

That is all. I am proud of my baby step today. ",
648,"So, since maybe a year back my dad (M56) has been really addicted to his phone and scrolling through reels, after work and before bed. Turns out that most of what he has been watching has been adult content. I have seen him looking at suspicious things before but I haven't wanted to confront him because it would be really awkward. Yesterday my mom looked through his phone and his algorithm on Instagram was just tons of porn. My mom was really upset because she has noticed him obviously always being on his phone and hiding her screen from her when she walks into a room etc.

There was basically a huge argument, my mom felt really betrayed and I was angry at my dad for hurting mom. Both me and my mom were disgusted by the content, especially since a lot of the people in the content were young girls just like me (early 20s). I know that it's normal for a lot of men to watch porn but it disgusted me so much. It makes me sick to much stomach that my dad gets off to young girls, and it totally made me lose all respect for him. 

To give a bit of backstory, my mom was diagnosed with cancer in the late summer of 2025 and she has gotten better but is still not and will probably never be completely cancer free. Since then my mom has lost her hair, worn wigs, gotten some hair back and gone from normal weight to super skinny to now mostly back to normal. Her self-esteem has really taken a toll due to her sickness and now seeing what my dad gets off to has made her feel really bad.

I am so incredibly angry at my dad, I told him that I won't speak to him unless he changes and tries to get rid of his phone/porn addiction but he denies that the porn is his. He pretends like it isn't his fault that those are the things that come up on his phone, even though he is very blatantly lying.

I have struggled with trusting men for a long time but it has gotten better since about a year back, due to becoming closer friends with 3 guys who I love and adore like my brothers and my lovely boyfriend who have all helped me restore faith in men after having had a lot of bad experiences (from sexual harassment to more serious assault). But now I feel like I'm losing it again.

My mom is trying to solve it with dad but he is the most conflict afraid person that I've ever met. He just keeps denying and they never get anywhere because my mom is the only one pouring her heart out. I feel such anger and disgust, I had a uni assignment today but I just skipped it because I have just been sad and empty. 

What really sucks about this is that I can't vent to anyone. My boyfriend or my guy friends would happily listen to me if I tried to but it's too embarrassing. That's why I'm writing here...

I'm so sick of there being porn everywhere nowadays. I'm sick of old men fawning over girls their daughters age. And I'm really sick of men LIKE MY DAD who says he dislikes women with silicone breasts and botox lips openly, while secretly jerking off to those girls in bed next to his cancer sick wife. I wish he would go back to the time when he used to read books, before getting addicted to the disgusting material on his phone.

Anyways I don't respect my dad anymore, I don't intend on talking to him anymore (even though we live under the same roof) and I wish he got cancer instead of my mom.

\[The ramblings of a 31F trying to process her 10yo trauma and trying to work out why thinking about her long lost friend makes her sad... We have a history that we've never spoken about... Names and places changed for anonymity\]

I'm sorry for the length of this but I want to be as unambiguous as I can be, but that's not possible without providing a hell of a lot of context... so bear with me...

When I was younger, I used to tell a lot of half truths about myself and I can't remember how honest I was with you.

One thing I used to tell people is that I moved out when I was 17. The full story is that my family had a breakdown and I ended up homeless. For a little while, I sofa surfed around friends' houses until I could start uni and one of those friends was Paul - that's how we got together.

Another thing I used to say is that I left uni because I didn't like my course or Bristol. In full truth, I hadn't emotionally dealt with any of the family stuff, got to uni, attempted suicide and abandoned my course.

And finally, I used to say I ended up in Newcastle because I came to visit Paul and never went home. In reality, after I left Bristol, I had no home to go to and Paul pressured me to stay.

By the time I was 18, I was incredibly vulnerable. Paul was not a good person and he abused that vulnerability. He told me regularly that I was unattractive, weird, not the sort of woman men want, but that I was also really lucky because I'd found one of the only men in the world who didn't mind that.

For the next 3 years, he manipulated me, guilted me into staying with him, stopped me from going back to uni, isolated me from my friends and - for the first year - physically locked me in his bedroom. It's really easy for someone to look at the situation - and to look at Paul - and ask, 'why did you stay?', but honestly I believed everything he said about me and I had nowhere else to go. By the time things were patched up with my family, psychologically I was in too deep.

I also had no say over when or how I had sex. It didn't matter if I was ill, crying, asleep, passed out drunk - if he wanted it, he took it in whatever way he felt like at the time. He enjoyed humiliating me. The few occasions I tried saying no, I got the mother of all guilt trips. He shouted, punched furniture, told me I was a bad girlfriend, a bad woman and a bad person. It became easier to just 'comply' and I got pretty good at disassociating.

My point is, by the time I met you, I had no self worth and I hated sex.

We became friends. We used to go for walks on our lunch breaks and we had our bench. We used to hang out after work and I didn't feel quite so lonely.

One day, while Paul was upstairs, you came round and your hand ended up on my leg. I panicked and moved your hand away but I was surprised that you didn't get annoyed - you were nice about it. That was a new concept for me.

I walked you home and we kissed and it confused the hell out of me. At this point, in my mind everything Paul had told me was fact - no one could ever be interested in me. But here was this nice, kind, attractive guy who apparently wanted to kiss me and it made absolutely no sense to me.

I like to think at some point I'd have broken up with Paul anyway but you were definitely the catalyst that made me leave him when I did. I didn't leave him 'for' you but you made me realise how shitty this relationship really was, made me see through everything Paul had said to me, and made me face the fact that I needed to end it.

A couple of months later, the night I broke up with him, within minutes you were there - you walked around Newcastle with me while Paul packed up his things and made sure I was OK. It meant a lot that I had someone down the road who cared about my wellbeing to some degree. And so I developed this mass of affection for you.

That was January 2015. Over the next few months, I was trying to work out who I was and what kind of life I wanted. I changed jobs and I was very lonely - you were one of only two friends but in my head you both saw our friendships as superficial. I cared about you both a lot but I also had a lot of trauma that I'd not dealt with and I didn't want to put pressure on these friendships so I never felt right opening up properly. And then I made a new friend at work...

Looking back, I want to give myself a slap. He was 37, I was 21, which should have been red flag number one. He used to drive me home after work and on the drive we talked. He got me to open up about my family, about being homeless, about my suicide attempt, about being raped three times a week for three years. He seemed to care and we started messaging outside of work too.

Until one day, he started sending me explicit messages. At first I laughed it off and I stopped replying. But then he started making comments at work. I ignored them. I didn't want to risk my job, therefore my income, therefore my home, so I didn't tell anyone and I started getting the bus home. Comments became gropes. I told him to stop, and he did for a while. On 10th May 2015, he dropped some equipment at my house for a work event, pressured his way into my house and raped me in my living room. I went to the clinic the next morning and then headed straight to work as though nothing had happened. Thankfully, he left me alone after that but I still had to work with him with the fear that it might happen again.

Over the next few months, I fell into a depressive spiral - I drank instead of eating on weeknights and I spent my weekends hooking up with horrible men I met online. Had a few more unpleasant encounters. I think it was probably some kind of control thing - if men are going to take it from me, I'll just make it available and then at least I've had some kind of say... I was in a dark place and honestly I don't remember a huge amount of detail about that time... I did and said some weird stuff.

But what I do remember is that one of the bright spots was that, every couple of weeks, you'd come to see me - we'd get pizza, talk, laugh, watch something silly and for a couple of hours I'd forget the horror and I'd feel like me again.

And that mass of affection I had for you snowballed. At the time, I thought I had feelings for you. And I might have - but looking back I'm not certain.

The contrast between you and other men I'd known was profound: you were the only man I had a personal relationship with who hadn't hurt me - you were gentle and kind and you made me feel very safe, which wasn't a familiar feeling to me. So I don't know if I actually had feelings for you or if I mistook feeling safe for romantic feelings.

In any case, at the time I thought I did and you were definitely on a pedestal. I knew that you didn't have feelings for me and in a weird way I was kind of happy about that - I think I just didn't want our friendship to change... Another reason I'm not entirely sure my feelings for you were real, but I was also in a fucked up mental state so who knows?

But then in the October, we had sex for the first time... At the time, I wanted to but, as soon as it happened, I knew it was a mistake.

So this is uncomfortable to admit... That was my first positive experience - you were the first person I slept with who I think cared about me on some level and who wasn't actively hurting or taking advantage of me.

That was a difficult and confusing thing to process, especially as we didn't have the kind of intimate relationship where I felt able to tell you how I was feeling. I know if I had, you'd have listened, but I'd not had good experiences of being vulnerable in the past and I also didn't want to put all that weight on you.

But my point is, the existing relationship I had with sex was awful. I used to associate you with safety but suddenly I associated you with sex, and sex was inherently unsafe to me.

So the pedestal came crashing down...

You coming to see me stopped being something I looked forward to. 

It became another hook-up, or another time where I felt it was expected that I'd 'comply'...

Even though I know that was never your motive or intention, and you would never knowingly hurt anyone, I couldn't help making the association.

I also wasn't sure why you were doing it... I asked you one time and you just said, 'because it's fun.' So it was really easy to brush it off and assume that you weren't the nice guy I thought you were and you either: a) knew how I felt about you and were taking advantage of it; or b) didn't actually value our friendship and so weren't that bothered about blowing it up.

And so I distanced myself from you because I had all of these conflicting feelings and I didn't know how to navigate them.

But even so, you were again a catalyst for me - you showed me that sex isn't always a horrible experience and kind of set the benchmark for me. So I stopped sleeping around and decided I needed to get better. Over time, I started to heal. I changed my job, started looking after myself, and started trying to find a healthy relationship. Started properly dating and met some genuinely nice people. You even popped up on OkCupid one time when I was feeling like it was hopeless and reminded me of what I was looking for.

And then eventually I met Mark. And he immediately made me feel safe and loved and happy - and he still does eight years later. I love him more than anything, he's my best friend and I wouldn't change my marriage or current life for the world. Meeting him is the line in the sand that I needed and, as much as I want you to be on this side of the line, it's probably for the best that you're on the other.

When I think about you now, some days I feel a wave of affection because you were there for me in a way I don't think you meant to be, but that was meaningful to me all the same. You kept popping up and doing things that shook my worldview in a way that confused the hell out of me but that I really needed. I don't quite know how to articulate how important a role you played in what was arguably the darkest time of my life but I'm so grateful you were there.

But then other days, you pop into my head and I feel sad because I cared about you so much and I hate that I attached all of this extra baggage to my perception of you. And I hate that a small part of me still believes you were taking advantage of me in some way, as illogical and uncharacteristic of you that is.

I don't regret what happened with us per se - because it led me to where I am now and in the grand scheme I think it helped me - but I do regret the timing of it. I don't mean that in a 'what might have been' sense - even if life had been simpler, I don't think a relationship between us would ever have made sense. I mean it in an 'if it had happened when I was in a better place, my feelings about you wouldn't be so uncomfortable and confusing' sense.

I also wish I knew how you felt, and how you feel. You're in your own happy marriage now and I'm so happy for you. But I was so wrapped up in my own trauma that I never considered what you might have been going through. I wish we'd talked more and I wish I understood you better.

I've never told Mark anything that happened with us. He knows everything else that happened to me and he knows that your friendship was very important to me during that time. But I've never been clear internally on how I feel and felt about you, and so it's never felt worthwhile or productive having him know...

So yeah... I'm still not sure I know how I feel and felt about you. It's complicated and, like it or not, you're knotted really tightly into my trauma... I've no idea if my feelings for you were real or not and I'll probably never know.

I miss your friendship - but it's for the best that we went our separate ways.",
651,"This has been sitting on my chest for a long time, and I just need to finally get it out. I don’t care if strangers on Reddit are the only ones who ever hear me—this happened, it hurt, and I’ve carried it silently for way too long.

One morning, I was getting dressed for work. I decided to weigh myself, but the scale in my room wasn’t working. There was another one in my mom and stepdad’s room, so I figured I’d use that instead. The house was completely silent. No TV. No voices. Nothing. I genuinely thought I was home alone.

I was topless, just trying to get ready for my day. Still, just to be safe, I knocked on their door before walking in. No answer. I called my stepdad’s name—twice. Still no answer. I cracked the door open and looked inside I called his name just to be 100% sure. It was quiet, the TV was off, no movement. I assumed I was alone.

I walked into the bathroom, used the scale, left. But for whatever reason, I decided to go back and weigh myself one more time. I walked back in, went to the bathroom again—and this time, when I came out and looked to the right…

He was there. Lying on the bed. Awake. Still. Watching.

I gasped and ran out of the room, shocked and humiliated. And the most disturbing part?

He never said a word.

Not when I knocked.
Not when I called his name.
Not even when I walked in twice, clearly topless.

He just stayed silent.

At the time, I felt embarrassed. I even apologized, like I had done something wrong. I tried to keep it to myself. But now, looking back with a clearer mind, I know exactly what that was.

It was calculated. He knew what he was doing. He let me walk into that room like that because he wanted to see.
He had a full opportunity to speak up, to say, “Hey, I’m here.” He didn’t.
And to make it worse, he ran to my mom and told her before I could—like he wanted to get ahead of the story and control the narrative.

And when I finally opened up about it?

My family made it my fault.

They guilt-tripped me. Said I was overreacting. Told me I was making it a bigger deal than it needed to be. No one asked how I felt. No one called him out. They just tried to silence me—again.

That part almost hurt worse than the incident itself. Because I expected better from them. But all I got was blame and dismissal.",
652,"I live with my partner in a rented house. He is not his family or mine. Since I arrived, there is a dog that is supposed to belong to my partner's stepfather, but that guy has never taken care of the animal. Neither before nor now. He recently moved and didn't even take the dog. He left it behind like it was old furniture, waiting for us to take care of it.

The dog is in bones. They feed him twice a day and clean his shit, yes... but that's all. They have not taken him to a veterinarian, they do not buy him basic things like toys, medications or minimal care. Literally, the least they do is prevent people from starving. To me, that's not having a pet, it's having a living cargo.

Yesterday, before leaving for work, I locked the dog up for a while. I didn't tie him, I didn't hit him, I didn't put a padlock on him. I just needed him not to be on top of me while I got ready. It was enough for my partner to attack me, saying that I am abusive, that I abuse animals and that I don't respect the rules.

Worse still: he blamed me for the death of a dog we had before. That death was an accident. I never did it on purpose, and it hurt me deeply. But she uses it against me as if I had killed her on purpose. As if he hadn't been carrying that guilt in silence all this time.

And to top it all off, he tells me that his stepfather is coming tomorrow to “talk to me” because he got angry about the dog. Net? The same guy who never takes care of him? The same one who doesn't even live here?

I didn't ask to live with a dog. I have had bad experiences with them and it is difficult for me to get along with one, especially when it is not mine, when they do not take care of it and when they impose it on me as if it were my obligation.

But it seems my emotions are worthless. That what bothers me doesn't matter. That if I don't adapt without questioning, I'm a bad person. Do I really have to put up with all this for a dog that doesn't even receive basic care?

I just needed to vent.",
653,"I’ve been friends with this guy for months, we were FwB’s, he knew I liked him, I was fine with him not liking me back as long as he was transparent (I clarified that), but he constantly gave me mixed signals. At the end of the day it was the friendship I cherished above everything hence why I took his word for everything.

Fast forward to today he admits he was leading me on because he liked the attention I was giving him. He said he feels terrible etc. (i dont even know if i believe him). At the end I said something to him that I regretted saying & apologized for it instantly but received no response.

I just feel like shit for being lead on like that, I feel lost and empty. I spoke to him 24/7 and now I have no one. He knew I’m mentally unstable and this would hurt me. I’m so hurt that I got a fever. I don’t know what to do or how to move on from this? I still miss him.",
654,"So I recently got banned from a pretty big subreddit (like 1.7 million members and increasing) after posting a question. It was related to cultural differences and perceptions, and I genuinely just wanted to hear some opinions and start a conversation.

I get that some topics can be sensitive and that’s totally fair. But instead of just removing the post or giving a heads up, I got hit with a straight ban with no warning, no explanation.

I appealed the ban politely, trying to explain where I was coming from and why I didn’t think my post was harmful. What I got back was honestly kind of shocking. Instead of a normal response, I received a message that felt really mean-spirited and like a personal attack. I won’t quote it directly, out of respect for people’s sensibilities, but it basically attacked me in a really harsh way, not just rejecting the appeal (which I can understand), but directly insulting.

The worst part is that it came through Reddit’s internal message system ( reddit . com  / message / messages) in the notifications bell system, so I can’t even see who sent it. It just feels so unfair like I tried to engage respectfully and got treated badly by someone who abused the role. The insult was so harsh that it almost seemed like they were taking out their personal issues on me.

I know mods are volunteers and I’m not trying to trash anyone. I get the ban if they really think the post didn’t belong, but the insult was completely out of line.

Is there any way to contact a Reddit admin or escalate something like this? I don’t want revenge or anything, I just think that something can be done.

Appreciate any advice and help here or supporting me to contact someone in a position to do something. If this isn't the subreddit to post this, please let me know where I should do it. Thanks for hearing me out.",
655,"I’m almost 18. Just a few weeks away. But I’ve lived a lifetime already. My story isn’t pretty. It’s not easy to write. However I need to get it out not just for myself, but maybe for someone else who’s in a similar hell and needs to know they aren’t alone.
When I was born, I had crack in my system. My father was addicted for the first 12 years of my life. He was barely around. once a month if I was lucky. But somehow, despite all the pain in his own life like prison time, a traumatic childhood, and a serious accusation he still says was false — he turned his life around. He’s now the most supportive person I have.
But my mother… she’s the center of the storm.
She’s an immigrant who lives with untreated bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. She abused me physically, emotionally, and mentally from a young age. Rocking chairs thrown at me. Slaps that left marks for days. Food restriction to keep me “slim” because she wanted Barbie dolls, not kids. She told me I was a mistake. That I should’ve been aborted. That I ruined her life. And if I ever told anyone, she promised she’d haunt me.
Even now, as a fairly fit 6'1"" young man, she still knows exactly how to break me. She’s turned family members, teachers, and even friends against me. She spreads lies in a language she never taught me Spanish. Making it impossible for me to defend myself. She once told my entire extended family I was in a gang… after I broke both my arms. Just days after my birthday.
She’s even stolen from me my ID, my debit card while I was injured. She’s mocked my mental health, refused to get help for my clinically depressed sister, and dismissed all our suffering because “grades are what matter.”
I’ve worked so hard. I’m an 11-time honor roll student. But lately, I’ve given up. What’s the point of being “successful” when your achievements are either ignored or used against you?
My mom is a narcissist, a manipulator, and someone everyone outside the house praises. It kills me inside. No one believes me. No one sees the truth. To them, I’m the problem. The “angry kid.” The “gang banger.” A lie she started. And it feels like no one’s going to stop her.
What hurts most is the toxic bond. Even after everything, I still feel like I have to protect her because if I don’t, she could be deported. And even if she’s ruined our lives, it’s all she knows. I don’t want that on my soul.
I’ve tried to love. But every close relationship with a girl seems to carry echoes of her control, emotional games, manipulation. Even in my dreams, I get pulled into things I don’t want — intense, violating sexual scenarios that leave me feeling ashamed. I wake up feeling dirty, even though I didn’t choose it. I don’t understand it fully, but I know it’s tied to trauma.
School was supposed to be an escape. It’s not. I have a teacher who acts just like my mom. My dream of being an engineer? Fading. My passion is dying in real-time.
I’ve been bullied. Betrayed. Used. Left behind. And still, I stay for one reason. My sister. She’s the only person who I think might understand. If I left, I’m terrified it would destroy her. And my father… he’s 70. He doesn’t have many years left. If I made one final escape, it might kill him too.
So I stay. In this house that feels like it’s draining the life out of me. Waiting for the day I turn 18. My hope? To get out. Find housing. Get therapy. Start over. But money is tight. And time is short. I live in California and as you would expect you need to pull out a mortgage to pay off the guy at the fruit stand.
If you’re still reading this: thank you. This is the first time I’ve ever told my full story. And even though I’m still in it, writing this makes me feel a little less alone.
If you’ve lived anything like this — I see you. I believe you. And you deserve to heal, just like I do.

TL;DR: My mom is a manipulative abuser who’s destroyed me emotionally and turned others against me while the world praises her. I’m almost 18 and desperate to escape, but I’m broke and terrified of leaving my sister behind. I’ve never told my full story — until now.",
656,"I never thought I’d be writing something like this. I’m still trying to process it. But I need to say it somewhere.

Last night, I was almost raped.

We went to the park. It was late, and he was my ride. I trusted him. We were just swinging and talking. He had been drinking before, but I didn’t think much of it at the time.

At some point, he said he lost his phone. I got off the swing to help him look. I even told him I’d call it. I turned on my flashlight to search the ground, and that’s when I noticed my lip liner. I hadn’t even realized I dropped it—I just saw it lying there and picked it up.The moment I did that, he ran at me full speed.

He tackled me to the ground, pinning me on my side in the grass. He grabbed my boobs.
He tried to pull down my pants. I was yelling. I told him to stop. I was struggling to get free.
Eventually, he stopped. I don’t know why. Maybe because I was yelling or maybe because he realized I wasn’t going to let him.

I asked him why he did it. He looked at me and said “Because I can.”

I still can’t get those words out of my head. Not “I’m sorry.” Not “I didn’t mean to.” Just because he could.

Afterward, we walked to the car. I got in still in shock, not even able to fully process what had just happened. And then he casually says, “My phone is right here.”

It was in the car the whole time.

He never lost it. He made it all up. He set me up. He was my ride. He knew how late it was. He knew I didn’t have another way home. And he still did that to me.

I keep replaying it over and over in my head. How quickly things changed. How it went from a normal night to something I’ll carry with me for a long time. I know if I hadn’t fought, he would’ve raped me. I know that with everything in me. I don't know what to do anymore.",
657,"This is my first time ever making a post on reddit so I don't really know how this all works. I used to just scream it into the void of my private twitter account, but I wanted to try something new and let it all out in one long text (even if people might not see this lmao). To start off, I'm the eldest daughter in an asian household, who somewhat got pressured into going into med school by her parents. Already from that statement, I feel so fucking stereotypical and whiny since conversations like this have been had before. But hey, here's my version. It's gonna be long.

As the eldest daughter, I was always taught to have patience for my two younger siblings, but especially my younger sister with only a 2-year age gap. I was originally raised by my grandparents who spoiled me rotten, so by the time my parents took me in to raise on their own, I was already around 6/7 years old. They already had a bond with my younger sister, and I really think the favoritism started there. Because she grew up with my mom before I did, she was kind of encouraged more to do better in school work, compared to me who mostly lived with my grandparents. So when I started to live with my mom and noticed that she got praise for getting good grades, I practically invested most of my waking energy into getting good grades too. I'd have so much jealousy and anger when I didn't get the specific score I wanted, because it meant less praise and attention from mom. I don't know if she's just smarter than me or if circumstances just happened to be that way, but it was so very hard-wired into me since then. This caused me to get into a STEM-focused high school, and boy let me tell you it was living hell for a teenager. Countless sleepless nights, mean snotty teachers, crying over grades, anxiety whether or not I'll get honor-roll, etc. It got so bad that I had episodes of my heart beating extremely fast and my breath coming in short bursts, semi-frequently throughout the week. I was even subtly crying for help in my social media. When my mom got wind of this, she told me I was overreacting and that I was ungrateful and shallow to feel that way. Anyways, I spent 2 years in that high school, until my mom finally opted to pull me out and put me into a normal high school. My life in this 2nd high school was sooooo great. I felt like something inside me got healed within the few years I spent there. I had friends who were also eldest daughters and we were starting to bond over a vague pattern we had experienced together.

This transfer is significant because my sister also went into the same school I transferred to, despite also passing the same STEM-high school I previously was in. My mom, who loves to encourage us to go into STEM because she thinks the job market there would be stable for years to come, allowed my younger sister to go into the nice school that I transferred into, no questions asked. When I asked her why she didn't push my younger sister to try STEM-HS like I did, she said she didn't like the effect that high school had on me, and she saw how miserable I was, and she didn't want that to happen to my younger sister. I think this is where it really started to dawn on me that I will never ever be on the same pedestal as my younger sister. For the last few months of my 1st year in that STEM-HS, I was practically begging her to pull me out by the next school year, but she had refused. I endured another year of that school's power-tripping teachers' bullshit, before I got pulled out. And in hindsight, I don't think pulling me out for my own sake was the main reason she did it, I think it was because she didn't want the inconvenience of having two girls in different high schools, so me transferring would be easier to manage. All that, but my sweet precious baby sister wasn't allowed to experience a single year in shit like that. I don't wish harm upon my sister. I just wish they would have been considerate of me back then too.

I started performing really well in this 2nd school, even better than my sister, and I noticed my parents were absolutely delighted in me. This is when they started to suggest that I go into medicine since I was ""so smart"". Me being delighted in this new-found attention, seriously considered it, even if I really didn't have a long-standing dream of becoming a doctor. By the time college application season rolled around, I was getting anxious again because it dawned on me that medicine was a life-long commitment to studying and learning. It wasn't just a pre-med + 4-year med journey, it went beyond that. I wasn't sure I wanted to dedicate so much of my life to something that I wasn't sure I was gonna love. I tried asking for permission to also apply for other courses related to journalism and broadcasting because I was part of those clubs in high school, even competed in them and placed sometimes. It was something I genuinely enjoyed. But whenever I brought it up, my parents would talk shit about those majors/careers and tell me there was no money and stability in them. Me being stupid completely followed their instructions and didn't even sneak one application that had my alternative options in them. Once again, this was a really anxious time of my life. Once, I broke down during a conversation about college, and just huddled into my room for refuge. I just wanted to cry in peace, but my mother slammed on my door, screaming to be let in. Mind you, I don't recall saying anything disrespectful to warrant that reaction, she was just so pissed at me for crying about college apps that she felt the need to invade my room. At one point she let herself in, and I remember just being helpless on the floor crying and her screaming at me to grow up and to stop acting the way that I did.

Fast forward to premed, and I genuinely did start enjoying my major. I remember sometimes posting about it on my private accounts and my parents would comment things like ""I'm so happy you found joy in this."", and it would immediately send a sour feeling into my gut. By this time, I felt like they finally started respecting me because I took on a major that they respected as well. Every single time I feel like I'm healed, they make comments like that and suddenly, I'm a 12-year-old again, asking for attention and praise from my parents.

And it's not even just academics, but I feel like so many pieces of me have been taken by my family. I remember being the primary art kid who watched anime at home. My sister practically copies everything that I do, so she also took up art and anime at one point. The pre-med I did had a faster-pace and shorter time period than the regular pre-med, so I kind of lost time to do some of these things, while my sister always kept choosing courses that were a little more lax. She always got to go home from our dorm earlier than me. She always had less hours in class than me. She always had more time to go out and enjoy high school/college life more than me. And my parents fucking allowed her to make decisions like that. While they kept drilling it into me that I was the eldest and therefore I should take the hardest and longest course so that they could still fund my education while they were young, and that they wouldn't have to do it to my younger siblings anymore when they were old. They wanted a doctor in the family and it HAD to be me because I was the eldest. MIND YOU, THEIR SECOND DAUGHTER WAS ONLY 2 YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME. Anyways, the vast difference in our schedules allowed her to take up more time in making art and watching shows that I used to love too. While I stagnated in some areas because I was pouring out my time into college. I still made art, but I really felt like I was once again just losing parts of myself. Another instance of this is, since I somewhat had experience in broadcasting, I volunteered at our church for their informational videos and stuff, lent my voice to them. I saved up, bought, and asked equipment slowly but surely over the years to complete them (mic, mic stand, editing software etc.). And both my mom and my sister were adamant on her (my sister), to get to learn from me and practice using my stuff, so she'd learn the skill as well and use it for school and whatnot. I remember being gutted because I thought I finally had the thing that was mine again, but they wanted to be in on it too. And then the immediate guilt, because why would I feel that way towards my sister?

Other instances that just made me seethe with rage are times when I have had to fend for myself. Like being 18 and having a health thing I was genuinely worried about and in pain from, and having to schedule my own doctors' appointments, lab tests, get my own meds and all that, at that age. I had to figure all that shit out by myself, which is ok since I was legally an adult then, but I rarely received even emotional support from them when I was going through it. I had to find my own doctors in a different city from our home and navigate it all. Meanwhile, my sister, at 19, got taken to a check-up by my mom at a local hospital for stuff that didn't even really bother her, and turned out to be a non-issue anyways. To add a cherry on top, my mom also blamed me for the health issues I've been having. For context, I had gotten a vaccine a few months prior to the symptoms showing, and she thinks I deserved to go through this since it was my stupid idea to get the vaccine anyways (it was an HPV vaccine mind you-recommended to young people and one of the vaccines they also recommended in our med school).

When I was younger, my parents made it blatantly clear that I shouldn't be having any sort of relationships with boys at all. That I should study first since I had no need for them anyways. Now that I'm in my twenties, not having enough time for dating, they're now telling me that since my sisters idolize me so much, I should start working on getting a boyfriend that would be a good example for them as well. That as the eldest, I better ""fix my standards"" because I have younger siblings that will copy everything that I do. It's like every aspect of my life has to be for my family. Every part of me has to serve them in some way. The irony is that me being in this situation and having anger like this is probably another reason why I haven't really given myself time to date as well lol.

There are probably a hundred more stories like this that I've forgotten over the years or just swallowed up. But it's been piling up inside me and I really needed to get it all out. I'm angry, whenever they tell me they're happy that I'm enjoying med school (I am, despite it feeling like I'm carving my path through a diamond wall with a spoon). I'm angry whenever they give my sister tender treatment, when they completely ignored me when I needed help. I'm angry when my sister gets to still often do things she loves despite being in college, and yet I have to give so much of it up. I'm angry. I'm jealous. And I HATE feeling this way. I don't have anything or anyone to direct my anger at, because despite it all, I can somewhat see where my parents are coming from, and it's not like my sister is at fault for being more loved. One of my fantasies is to just leave and disappear one day. I'll send an allowance to them as a thank you for the years they've raised me and because they did love me in their own way, but ultimately just disappear for a while to silence all the disgusting feelings inside me.

Anyways, to all the eldest daughters out there, or even just all the children out there who have ever felt this way, I'm sending you the warmest hugs I can. One day, we'll be able to put ourselves first. One day, we'll find people who'll love us without having to check all these requirements first. Until then, it's just us I guess haha.

658,"I am 27 and I honestly feel like I have no idea what I am doing when it comes to planning for the future.

Every time I hang out with my friends it feels like they have everything together. They talk about saving and life goals like it is just obvious what you are supposed to do. Sometimes they even joke with me about it, like oh you are almost 30, you better have a plan. I laugh along but inside I am freaking out because I honestly have no clue.

Nobody ever really taught me any of this. It is not like school sat me down and explained how to plan for the next 40 years. And at home it was always just ""work hard and it will work out"" which does not exactly help when you have no idea where to start.

I keep telling myself it is fine and that I am still young but honestly it just feels like this heavy thing hanging over me. Like there is this giant deadline I did not know about and everyone else got the memo except me.

I do not know. I just needed to say it out loud somewhere. I feel way younger than I should when it comes to this stuff and it makes me feel pretty stupid sometimes.",
659,"I(teenage girl) used to be in the air cadets before I quit because I couldn't balance it with college. I'm still in my friend group from when I was in cadets and we have ""group functions"" or whatever you want to call it and in typical wattpad fashion, the guy who I thought I hate(guy my age) is in my friendgroup. They usually keep us from talking when we all hang out because something always causes us to give eachother snarky comments and mean looks.

So, sure, I ""hate"" him but he is HOT. He's nearly a foot taller than me, scrawny(YES PLEASE??) and he has freckles. Like, hello? When we aren't arguing he's so sweet. He was the first person to know when the girl I was just seeing left me, he treated me so gently and acted exactly how I needed him to at the time. But once I was over it we were right back to bickering. The arguments have mostly been happening either when we're alone or there's enough people around to not pay attention to us. 

At the last sleepover our group had, at his best friend's house, I got up in the middle of the night like I usually do. I went to sit at the kitchen table on my phone so the light from it didn't wake up anyone sleeping in the bedroom. I heard the kitchen door open and he walked in and he very dramatically went ""Ugh, you?"" I just looked back at my phone and ignored him. He got himself a glass of water, which he could've just wanted a drink but it feels cliche? Idk. 

He came over and put his chin on me shoulder from behind, purposely being annoying (THE BUTTERFLIES OMG) and he asked what I was doing, we were both talking quietly so we didn't wake anyone up so his breath was against my ear like in a romcom. I told him I was just on pinterest and he sat down in the chair at the head of the table and I think he was looking at me every time I looked at my phone?? We were talking a little bit about our friends and stuff, typical awkward conversation. His knee touched mine at some point he DIDN'T MOVE IT!! That mfer knew what he was doing 🤨 so yeah that was cute.

The next day, eye contact went CRAZY. Basically the whole day my stomach hurt from butterflies cause he kept looking at me while we all were out at the shops and stuff.

So yeah, I really like him and just needed to word it, do with this what you will. Also, this is my first time posting on reddit so I'm sorry if the formatting is off 😭",
660,"I (Enby 30) have been seeing a man (30) for a little over a year, off and on. We have only gone on one real date and he's refused to come out with me even casually.
When I asked if he was ashamed of me, he's insisted that was definitely not the case. He is sexually attracted to me but I'm not sure he likes me as a person.

He gets annoyed whenever I try to bring up topics that I find fun (like UFPs or some surface level interests) and he always wants to change the subject on serious issues (like bigotry or late stage capitalism). It's gotten to the point where I tend to just stay quiet. He usually just talks about what's on his mind and I reply accordingly. Lately, he's complained about how so many of his colleagues annoy him and how stupid they are. I often don't know how to respond because he gets visibly annoyed. He's also told me things he's never told anyone else in his life.

He always projects onto me that I'm belittling him or mocking him when I never do that. I wouldn't treat someone I like that way. I am not passive aggressive and always direct with him. He says he likes that about me, but I've noticed he drops hints instead of just letting me know what's up.

I really used to look forward to seeing him but I often just feel as though I'm being used and drained after spending time together. I used to enjoy spending the night but now I want to go home after round one. At some point he used to blow my mind every encounter but he doesn't have the same... fiery energy. I've worn different underwear, hosiery and even indulged his kinks, but our sexual intimacy is not up to par. It isn't even like we have a boring routine. He just doesn't make me feel as wanted and he has a fixation on calling me a slut but none of the other endearing terms I enjoy in bed. It's gotten to a point when he doesn't even compliment my body anymore.

Our times together have been reduced to Netflix and chill. It's actually quite boring to me. The one time we were going to go on a second date, he initiated physical intimacy me in the car that we just wanted to go back home. Tbh it was hot at the time but in retrospect, I wonder if it was just a ploy not to have to endure a dinner with me where he didn't get to grope me at any given moment. That was also the night he wanted me to go commando but I refused because I was not comfortable and I told him exactly that.

He also used to kiss me a lot more. I don't force him to kiss me, so I've noticed how little he wants to nowadays.
Whenever I want aftercare, he hops into the shower. I did bring it up, but I don't think he cares. He also doesn't like using protection and makes me take plan B

He used to treat me well. But was that just bare minimum? Am I crazy for wanting to be treated better?
Tbh I don't want to be shat on in the comments. I just have no one to tell this to.

Update: I've decided I don't deserve this and I don't need to stick it out",
661,"I'm alone

That was the conclusion I came to, even after years of therapy I refused to believe it, but now I do. You know those nights when you need to let it out and there's no one to listen? Do you look at the window and talk to the moon, the stars, the wind, and it’s still not enough? So it is.

You might think I'm that typical friendless nerd who lives in his room 24 hours a day, but that's not the case. I have a family that doesn't hate me (I think), I've always been a person surrounded by friends, I'm not one to start conversations, but I find it easy to sustain them, and that makes me have a circle of friends. Even in my love life I have a certain success, I'm not pretty but I'm not ugly either. Anyway, I went around several times to say that I'm normal.

So why do I feel this way? Why am I alone and have no one to talk to?

My family matter is a disaster. Raised by my grandmother, divorced parents, my first memory is of my mother losing me at a party, and then her leaving home and going to start another family. She has 2 children besides me, I love them and my stepfather is cool, but she doesn't make the slightest effort to make me part of their lives. The last time we went out as a family, I was 12 years old and she bought me a toy, then I see her once a year at Christmas, sometimes. Yesterday, on Mother's Day, she ignored my audio, before she at least said she loved me very much, now, nothing. 

My father is deceased, 5 years ago, he was the only one who was proud of me regardless of what I did, he is my vision of an ideal man. He also has a family with 2 children, but he always included me as much as he could. However, after his death, they got closer for a while, and then... they seemed to forget about me. I don't mean my brothers, but ALL my family on my father's side, be it grandmother, aunt, cousins, as if I no longer existed. They stopped calling me for Christmas, birthdays and other parties, which I always managed to go to. I keep in touch with my brothers and stepmother, but it's almost as if I were a friend of the family, rather than a member of it.

And my grandmother doesn't take me seriously, I have no doubt she loves me, but she's the worst at opening up. The best example I can give you is when I thought about killing myself by jumping out of the window, she saw me with my feet out wondering whether to go or not, and she told me that I would cause problems for her if I jumped, that it was nonsense, and left the room, as if she didn't care. I think she said I was supposed to jump, but I don't remember, I don't know if it's a false memory or something I want to forget.

As for my friends? Nothing special, they're not the worst, but I also don't have any confidants, and maybe that's my fault. On my last birthday, for example, I was planning a party at a burger restaurant, and everyone was all for it. But then they combined (without asking me) my birthday with 2 other close friends, due to ""lack of money"". Well, the day before my birthday they went out with their girlfriends to one of the most expensive restaurants in town. This upset me, because since my father's death, I hadn't been excited for my birthday until this year. The girls were invited, I didn't understand until now why that was...

I'm even talking to a girl, we were almost dating, she cried several times in my lap and I always listened to her, she said she would reciprocate if she could. Well, I went to vent about a small frustration of mine (I gained 1 kg and I'm paranoid about my weight), in the first message she told me to stop complaining and do anything, but to stop complaining (exactly those words in Caps Lock). Well, I got discouraged, and realized the point of this text.

Honestly, I think my whole life I've been looking for someone to open up to me and who loves me, there's a psychoanalytic side there, I try to resolve this in therapy but I've been seeing the same therapist for 2 years and nothing, everything is the same. I'm tired, I need to talk, but I have no one to listen to me, no one that I don't have to pay monthly for.

Anyway, that wasn't even what I wanted to vent, but it ended up being. I'm alone, and there's nothing I can do, other than learn to live in silence.",

663,"I was reading another post that reminded me of something that happened when I was 15. 
I had just gotten out of therapy and my mom and I had stopped by McDonald's to get some food before taking me on to school. Mom went to the bathroom while I was filling my drink cup. While I was there a guy who was probably in his 40s came up and started filling his, which is whatever. Until he started talking to me. He asked how my day was and I just gave an awkward ""good"" in a very ""why are you talking to me?"" Type of tone. He responded with ""good, good. Are you single?"" To which is promptly responded with ""Im 15.""

He did leave me alone after that but like... here's the thing I'm almost 28 now. I have facial piercings that you have to be over 18 to have (in my state at least) and multiple tattoos, including on my face and back of my neck. I've been told numerous times I dont look 28 and the other day the cashier at the WINCO I go to while I'm working told me she pegged me for 15 but knew that couldn't be right because I was working a noc shift like her. So, despite several age signifying things I still look YOUNG.

There's NO WAY that guy thought I was over 18. Just adds a little bit of extra ew factor to that whole creepy interaction.",

Hi, I'm a 12 year old girl, I have a little sister, a mom and had a dad for context.

When I was about 7, my dad was diagnosed with cancer but the treatment was not good for him and he had a heart attack but luckily survived. Ever since he got cancer and started the treatment he become more snappy, but still had good moments and I still kinda remember how he was before the cancer. (I am getting tears in my eyes as I write this) Last year he was feeling so unwell and really suffering from the treatment and cancer, so he wanted to stop the treatment because he didn't want to suffer too much his time left. He got weaker and about three months ago he passed away. My family couldn't afford a funeral which makes me even sadder. (I'm outright crying now)

My mom is kind of toxic and a little abusive (If she gets really angry she hits me and so on, one time she grabbed me by the jaw and it really hurt) but still a loving mom if you know what I mean.

I'm in sixth grade in school and I have no friends, I'm that quiet, slightly nerdy student who loves watching documentaries and literally doesn't speak but still has the best grades out of everyone (but in P.E. class lol). I love reading books so that's what I do on the breaks, I grab my book and just sit alone reading it while my classmates forget about my existence.

I don't even know what's keeping me from jumping off a bridge, I don't even think anyone but maybe my mom and little sister will miss me. (Btw, can you overdose on inhalers? Just curious, not actually gonna do it, I am very fascinated with science that's all)",

Now here I am, six months pregnant and completely alone. My boyfriend’s in college out of state, he visits me twice a month, and his dad won’t let him drop out. His dad’s been sending me money so my boyfriend doesn’t have to get a job and can stay in school. He also comes to see me every week and keeps making weird comments, like how I should go on a diet to keep my weight down after I have “this kid”, or how my boyfriend’s gonna leave me for some better girl in college and that I should just accept it.

I hate going to school and I just wanna drop out, but my stepmom talked me into staying. I don’t have any friends at school anymore. I’m too embarrassed to go anywhere because it feels like everyone’s judging me all the time. My dad wants me to go to therapy, but I don’t wanna talk about any of this with anyone.

I guess my mom was kinda right when she left me, ‘cause I really am a mess. I didn’t wanna get an abortion, I didn’t feel ready for that emotionally, but I’m not ready to be a mom either, especially not with my boyfriend so far away. He’s gonna try to transfer to a school back in our city, but every time he brings it up, his dad threatens to cut him off and stop paying for everything.

I hate my life and I feel like I’m never gonna get back on my feet.

Edit: I decided to talk to my stepmom and my dad. I showed them this post, and they told me to talk to my boyfriend about it. It was decided that his father can no longer come near me and that I will start therapy. I also told them some other things my boyfriend’s father said that I was too ashamed to repeat. Things aren’t very good right now, but my stepmom and my dad said they’re going to help me.

I was abandoned by my mother when I was a child. Later, she came back into my life and let me suffer abuse. I don’t want that to happen to my baby. I love him despite everything. I know there are many good families waiting for a baby, but I don’t want to give mine up. Maybe with therapy I’ll reconsider, but for now, no.

I didn’t say anything about him, but my boyfriend agrees with all of this. We always talk about our situation, in fact, it’s usually our main topic: the baby and the pregnancy. He’s also going to talk to his father about the things he used to say to me.",

I haven't travelled anywhere by myself before, and the furthest I've been from my family was a 100 mile roadtrip for a weekend. Even though I'm not the one traveling in this situation, it's still my family leaving me for a month and being incomprehensibly far away from me.

The first day I felt fine, I can live by myself and be an adult. But as the days set in, I slowly started to realize how isolated and lonely I actually was. When the few people that you spend your time with consistently are gone, you start to realize how unsocial you actually are. What really hit hard was the lack of friends I had to contact or things to do with myself outside of work (work from home btw).

Oddly, I felt like a foreigner in my own country. It's such a strange feeling, but being by myself so far away from my family I felt like I was the one who had travelled to another country. And this is the reason I'm making this reddit post, because I really want to convey how strange the feeling was to have nobody, and how alien you feel inside your own home in your own country. My family might as well have been on Mars.

I wish that I had friends, I wish that I had people to have fun with. I know my family is there for me but it's just not enough. What sucks is that people tell me that college is the best time for making lifelong friends. And I knew this in my freshman year but I just didn't know what to do to find friends. I graduated college a couple days ago and I'm sort of being thrust into the great beyond of what to do with my life. I've proposed going on trips by myself before to my family, such as flying to Vancouver to check out the nature over there, or visiting Boston and seeing the nature in New Hampshire and Maine, but my family feels uncomfortable with me traveling by myself and wants me to find a friend to go with.

Other people are such strangers to me, and I know this will sound insane but, I can't imagine meeting someone and then flying somewhere with them. Like maybe if we were deeply friends or something I guess, but flying somewhere is such a huge and expensive undertaking it's mind-blowing to me that people just get friends to go cross country with them on a whim. My argument to my family as to why I should be able to travel by myself was that ""it's kinda just the default thing if you don't have friends"", like if I don't have anyone I should be able to just go places by myself because I'm my own person. I hate pouring these deep thoughts out to my family and I regretted being vulnerable because I felt it made me look childish which doesn't help. Both my parents agreed that I'd probably get murdered.

So that's what I came here to say. If anyone of you have advice I'm open to it.",
674,"Throwaway account. I need to vent about this because it's been nagging me for a while. I've started disliking almost everything about someone who I used to consider a close friend, let's call him Fred.

Fred and I became close friends in school and continued to be close through college and when we became professionals with careers. We've been friends for more than 20 years now.

Fred is intelligent, funny, and chill. We shared and still share a lot of common interests, we're aligned politically, and we have a lot in common.

We also have many mutual friends in the same friend group.

I've been close to his family and his long-term partner (now wife) for years too. I mostly get along fine with his partner, let's call her Jane. She's also funny and smart, but she can be massively arrogant, attention-seeking. She doesn't really get along with everyone in our friend group, but she's not terrible, so she's tolerated.

Fred and I used to message each other every day, sharing updates about our lives, swapping funny memes or videos, or just talking about our shared interests.

However, I had a realization last year that Fred is actually a deeply selfish, inconsiderate, and unsupportive friend.

What sparked my realization was his complete lack of support last year after I went through a breakup from a long-term romantic relationship.

It wasn't the worst breakup in the world, but it was tough for me (I'm much happier now that I'm out of the relationship). Pretty much everyone in my friend group was supportive and there for me if I needed to talk through what was going on.

Fred, however, was not very supportive. His reaction was one of indifference. He essentially ignored the fact that I had gone through a breakup. He acted like it hadn't happened at all. He was fully aware of the breakup and knew it was a tough time for me, but I never got any offer or invitation from him to hang out. He didn't offer me any reassurance or comfort whatsoever.

At the time, I was hyper-aware of who was making an effort to support me or just hang out with me.

I actually ended up getting the most emotional support from a best friend of mine from work, a guy I've only known for about five years.

Currently, I maintain irregular contact with Fred and occasionally see him when I get together with mutual friends. I've stopped putting any effort into maintaining the friendship with Fred. In retrospect, there were a few signs of him not being a good friend/good person. I put a list together of some of the things that have stood out to me -

1. He insults people in our friend group constantly. His insults are meant to be humorous, but they're often hurtful, and friends I've spoken to about this agree that he goes too far. He's 100% a funny and witty guy, but a lot of his ""jokes"" are actually just mean and belittling. If anyone ever tries to insult him back, he doesn't take it well. Jane also has a habit of jokingly mocking people. One time, I jokingly mocked Jane in response to her jokingly mocking me. Fred acted super offended and indignant at what I said to Jane and told me to ""go easy."" Both Fred and Jane love to mock people but can't tolerate anyone responding.

2. Fred likes to rank his best friends and then tell everyone, sometimes in a group setting. This has always struck me as exceptionally juvenile. Nobody else within the friend group does this; it's just something Fred does. I've talked to friends in the group recently, and everyone agrees that it's odd and unpleasant to be told which friends he considers his favorites.

3. Fred has always been a cheapskate. He never offers to buy other people a beer at the bar. He buys cheap presents for people. If he shows up at a dinner party, he will either bring nothing or the cheapest snacks. Fred is probably the most well-paid person in my friend group, but he consistently is the least generous.

4. I used to constantly invite Jane and Fred over to mine for dinner parties, casual drinks, Christmas parties, etc. I would also make the effort to organize group activities and make plans for our friend group to meet up. He reciprocates with invites to his place maybe once every two years, usually for his birthday. He does not take steps to organize meet-ups with me or others in the group.

5. Recently, I organized a trip with just me and one other friend from our mutual friend group, let's call him John. Unfortunately, Fred basically invited himself once he discovered we were planning it. I didn't want to exclude Fred, because the three of us have been friends for a long time. Sadly, Fred completely sucked the joy and energy out of the trip by trying to change the itinerary John and I planned. Fred wanted to only stay in cheap accommodations, eat at cheap places, and avoid paying for entry to the museums and galleries John and I wanted to see. Fred claimed he didn't have enough money to spend. I told him nobody was forcing him to come, and if it was a problem, he didn't have to join. Fred came anyway and sulked like a child for long stretches. In retrospect, I should have told him he couldn't come, and it should have just been a trip for John and me.

6. His gifts are always thoughtless. Over the years, he has given me very few presents. All of his gifts are memorable because of how uninspired, cheap, and thoughtless they were. I received a bottle of cheap wine more than once. On the other hand, I used to always get him thoughtful presents that generally weren’t cheap (expensive whiskey he liked, a first edition book etc). The number of gifts I've given to Fred over the years is also much larger than what he's given me. I’ve given gifts for his birthday, for Jane’s birthday, for Christmas, when he graduated, when he and Jane got engaged, and when they got married. I know some people aren't great gift-givers, but it would have been nice if he made an effort over the years, because the disparity in the number and quality of the gifts is something that now bothers me. 

7. When Fred got married to Jane, they asked for only cash gifts and no physical gifts from guests. They had a destination wedding and a very lavish two-day event, spending a small fortune. They complained for weeks and months afterward that many people gave them too little money and whined that some people gave nothing at all. I was a groomsman and gave a large cash gift. I received no thank-you from them. I now wish I hadn't been generous and had spent that money on myself.

Reading all of the above, you might wonder why I ever stayed friends with this guy. To be honest, when you’re in his company, he can be very funny and entertaining. However, what I've grown to recognize is that Fred lacks emotional intelligence and is an inconsiderate person. Similarly, Jane isn’t a great person either.

I'm happy that I've come to realize that I need to place more value and attention on other relationships, especially with friends who make an effort and are emotionally intelligent and emotionally mature. I'm not going to cut Fred out of my life completely, but I am definitely setting boundaries for myself and keeping him and Jane at arm's length. I'm hopeful that maybe in the future, Fred will gain more emotional maturity and develop a stronger sense of empathy. But until then, I'm going to cherish the friendships with people who respect me and put effort into the friendship. ",
675,"I'm not sure what the point of this post is. I'm not looking for advice or anything like that, I just want this off my chest ig.

So just simly as the title says, I wish my boyfriend was a girl. No I don't wanna date someone else who is a girl, I just want him and only him even if he's a boy. But Istg this tought has been just bothering me for so long and I do not know how to stop it. I really would like to talk about it to him because he always listens to my every problem but I'm too scared to, like how wpuld I even approach this issue?? Or even how to solve it? Like I just csnt tell him tjat I wish he was a girl because thats just weird, and not like he coukd do anything about it. soo I don't think there's a solution to my littlr problem, I might just have to live with this for the rest of my life and it honestly mskes me feel really odd. Ughh I really really hate how I feel and I just feel so bad overall, I don't know why I'm like this but thinking about him as my girlfriend has been like an intrusive tought to me and I just can get rid of it. Calling him any boy related compliment or even as my boyfrirnd just feels really strange, even tho I've done it for so long without any problems.

This propably makes absolutely no sense at all and I'm propably just gonna get hate or ""leave him"" responses but what ever, I just needed to type this out and it made me feel little lighter honestly :) I'm really happy in this relationship tho and I never could imgine myself with anyone else other than him. I just feel like I'm more into girls than guys and that tought has been following me like an really annyoing mosquito. Anyways end of my little vent, thank you for reading.",
676,"37 (F) Its been a month and a half for me on this app. I am decent looking. Most matches I get are across the country. I live in Canada. Did any of you try long distance matches, any success stories. I am skeptical about distance issue because you dont know what they do in another city. Well you cannot in the same city either. Just out their to see what others have to say",
677,"
I desperately wish I were one of those girls who are treated well, seen, heard, and wanted by people—especially by men. When you have attractive friends, you really start to notice the difference in how people treat you. If it were my birthday and I had one wish, I’d wish to be pretty. That’s all I want.

You might be wondering why. The truth is, attractive people don’t get bullied and harassed the same way. I do. When I walk home from the gym or from work, I get harassed. Once, I fell asleep at work, and my coworkers started taking pictures of me without my consent. They made a whole folder dedicated to me sleeping and passed it around like it was a joke. Ugly people are always the punchline. It’s unfair. Like, okay—I get it, you don’t find me attractive. But can you at least just leave me alone? That’s all I ask. I hope I’m not asking for too much.

And it’s not my friends’ fault that I’m not attractive. But I can’t help feeling sad when I see guys constantly hitting them up, calling them beautiful, wanting to talk to them, and giving them attention—while I feel like I have to beg for scraps. I’m the one always initiating, always reaching out, and still getting ignored or blocked. I’ve even tried dating apps, and the few dates I got ended up being interested in my friend instead of me. It’s like… damn. I just wish I wasn’t ugly.

The only guys who ever seem to want me are only interested in something physical. And if I’m not giving that, they don’t want me at all. I know people say “male attention isn’t everything,” but to me, it’s not just about attention. It’s about wanting to feel seen, valuable, and worthy. I’ve become obsessed with “lookmaxing” and honestly, I’ve saved as much as a college tuition for plastic surgery. That’s how desperate and tired I am.

I know the advice is usually “find your worth outside of your looks,” but when people treat you differently every day based on how you look, it gets to you. You can try to ignore it, but when the comparisons are right in front of your face, it’s hard not to feel crushed. Even at prom, I was practically begging for a date while my friend had five guys asking her to go. I was chasing like crazy just to have someone notice me.

And yes, I know people will say, “Just love yourself” or “Be confident,” but even if I had all the self-love in the world, I’d still want a partner—someone who calls me beautiful and makes me feel special. That desire doesn’t just disappear because I worked on my self-esteem.

I’ve tried to accept reality—telling myself, “Okay, you’re not attractive and that’s okay”—and it worked for a few months. But eventually, something happens. I see the way beautiful women are treated, and it hits me all over again. And I just break",
678,"Exactly what the title says. I am not a good man. I am trying to be better now, so desperately. We are not together anymore.

Broke up with my girlfriend of three years late February last year because she didn't seem to like me much. Love me, yes, like me, no. I still loved her, but found myself getting caught up in thoughts of a different guy, and didn't want her to go through that as well. Started dating this guy in April because I started talking to him more. Ex-girlfriend got mad at this and started spreading rumors about me being abusive, etc.. I try to off myself and go to the psych ward.

When I get out of the psych ward my boyfriend is deeply scared of losing me. He threatens to hurt himself or me if I ever leave him. He tells me to never abandon him again, or else.

My ex-girlfriend messages me early May. Her new boyfriend isn't sexually adequate. She is still spreading rumors about me although it's slowed down, but now she wants me back. ""At least it'll make the rumors stop,"" I think, not that I didn't enjoy the attention from someone who loved me once. I couldn't break up with my boyfriend because he threatened to hurt us both. We hookup several times, every time of which I have a panic attack and beg her not to hit on me again. That's not her job though, I need to stop seeing her myself, which I don't. According to her, she just wanted to be friends, but still loved me, and thought I was using her for sex. I thought she was using me for sex because she knew I was emotionally vulnerable and getting lightly abused. Super fucked up situation. We don't talk anymore.

My boyfriend is privy to what's happening, I don't really try to hide it. I tell him in August that I had cheated on him. He tells me that he would sooner kill himself than ever leave me. He gets pretty abusive from this point on. Forcing me to have sex with him when I say ""no,"" all the time because ""clearly its all I wanted from him."" Yelling at me even more than he used to. Sometimes getting physical with me. Telling me he's attracted to when I cut myself. Accusing me of making him my servant, whatever that means. Once, he told me he had a fantasy of stabbing me to death and raping my body. He would constantly be in a bad mood and cry constantly about everything and it would be my job to make him feel better, and I did everything in my power to care for him, but god forbid I ever cry, because that would mean he's an awful boyfriend who can't do anything right. He's constantly telling me how I'm the only reason he enjoys life, and how he wants to be with me forever.

I love him regardless, and for a little while, it seems like he's finally getting better. In January, we decide to take some distance though.

Not two days pass before suddenly he knows me as his abuser, as the man who cheated on him because he wasn't adequate enough, and then continued to mentally abuse him for 6 months. Two days after he told me that the only safe place he'd ever know was my arms, I was now a monster he couldn't feel safe around. He blocks me on everything except Discord. I desperately try to reach out to him like a fool. I say anything to try to get him back. He doesn't respond.

I spiral. I try to off myself. I fail and get pretty hurt. I don't tell him, or anyone. We have classes in college together and he's really nice to me in class. I send him an apology letter because I think he's warming up to me, but in the apology letter, I also request that he apologizes for the abuse. He flips out. He blocks me on Discord. He stays really nice in class, and even has conversations with me again about games we both like and music.

I get raped in a man's truck in March. When it's happening, all I can think of is him. His smile, his singing voice, the outfits he wore. Oh god I don't know why all I could think of was him. It made things so much worse. I do my best to ignore it. I don't tell him because he doesn't want to know.

Recently, I decide to leave the restaurant we both worked at. I realize because I'm graduating I might never see him again. I walk over to him and tell him that I might never see him again, and I tell him thank you for the happy times we spent together. He just looks at me. He says nothing. Oh well. 

I'm kind of seeing a new guy now, and I think it's going well, but he told me only days after meeting me that he's never felt true safety before he met me, the same thing my ex-boyfriend once said. It's so scary.

I get what I deserve I suppose. Never thought we'd break up at all.

I want to be a good person so badly. So fucking badly. Why am I this way. I hate myself and I want to die. I miss him so much.",
679,"As title suggests… I’m seeing this married man over a year now. Today he said that he and the wife had a big argument last weekend and he took the ring off… didn’t wear back on again. Now, I’m slightly scared if they decide to divorce… I clearly don’t want to date with him. 

Back story, they married for 8 years with 3 kids and they have some family issues such as grown distance and growth apart as a married couple, before I join this man’s life. Their argument on the weekend nothing to do with me and she doesn’t know the husband seeing someone. I don’t want them to divorce… I don’t want a full time relationship, I was enjoying only seeing him once in a week… what do I do?

680,"I met this guy on OLD. we clicked off really well right away. Talked for 3 hours first time. I am 37(F) and he is 31 (M). Our values and interest and commitment goals aligned. He wanted to jump into commitment right away, I said let us meet first and I was also not comfortable to jump in so fast. I met him after 2 weeks. We live in different cities. I drove there. We made out and he wanted to have s$x rght away. I held off. My gut kept telling me to stay away from him but logically everything seemed fine. He was holding my hand , being very loving and caring. I came back, thought about it for a month and my gut wont stop screaming. I listened to my gut and called it off. BUT now I miss him. Feeling super confused now. Any thoughts?",

This kinda domino effect to me as well, derailing life plans and all, but I still made sure to be there doing everything I can to comfort, support, basically everything. I don't want to say too much in case he sees this. Things have calmed down and he's been feeling so much better these days. So today, since the storm calmed, I wanted to talk to him about how I've been feeling too. I just wanted some comfort. We were on call for a good while when I started to talk to him about how I've been feeling, I couldn't even get close to a minute before he gets ""distracted"" by his cat. I didn't want to push it so I waited thinking he'll come back and ask me to continue or something. Silence for 3 minutes. I call out his name to see if he might've fallen asleep or forgot we were on call and he acknowledges my presence but doesn't say anything else. I'm already very upset but I keep my cool. I tell him how I have noticed he'd always be ""distracted"" every time I seem to start talking about my feelings, and asked if he does them on purpose. He denied once before admitting he does them on purpose and doesn't like hearing me talk. 

The mental load I carried for him the past week was massive but I did it because I love him. He literally sobbed in my arms as I held him, gosh the least he could do is fake it I guess. I ended the call right after and blocked him for a bit. He's been very good to me so this is just whack. I just wanted to take this off my chest so I can stop crying and properly distract myself with Skyrim. ",

This is what I get for giving second chances

My ex (F29) and I (F27) met in 2018. We hung out a couple of times but talked constantly for about three months. We liked each other, flirted, and were getting close. 
Then one day, out of nowhere, I wake up to a text from her saying:

""Hey, I'm sorry. I called my ex yesterday and realized I'm still not over her. I'm going to try to be with her again.""

And just like that, she blocked me everywhere. I was like, okay, whatever, we hadn't known each other that long yet and continued with my life normally. 

Fast forward to 2021. She adds me on Instagram. I accept the request. We start chatting again, and everything flows amazingly. A few months later, we’re hanging out, we kiss, we start dating.

The relationship was fun, it worked well, and we both made plans for the future. After three years together, I get a great opportunity to do a postgraduate degree abroad. We talk it through, she supports me, we make a plan, and we decide to try long distance.

I propose. She says yes.
The whole course is three years long, but we'd only be apart for four months before she could join me, so I genuinely thought we'd make it, in part because she told me we would.

One month in, she goes on a short trip with friends. She cheats on me.
And tells me.... again via text... just a simple: 

""Sorry, I got drunk last night and I got with someone else""

She leaves me—alone, in another country, without my support system. I call her, and she's just... normal. Not even crying. Not even saying much other than sorry.

That's when it hit me: I should’ve never accepted that request.
She hadn’t changed at all. She just wasted my time and hurt me worse the second time around.
I really should've stayed with my first impression of her: someone who doesn't care about anyone and just doesn't know how to be alone.",
683,"I made a career change into teaching later in life, thinking I’d found something meaningful. After surviving my first year, I thought I could handle anything—until a new school, a hostile principal, and daily chaos slowly wore me down. I eventually walked out and didn’t return for months.

I did come back, but I was never the same.

Here's my story:

[**A Lesson Plan for a Breakdown**](https://mysamsara.medium.com/a-lesson-plan-for-a-breakdown-1b1364a6d02f)  
",
684,"**For context, I’m 19 years old, and I’ve been dealing with a lot of emotional turmoil, especially regarding my twin brother. We used to be close, but over time, our relationship has become strained, and now I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around him.**

I’ve been isolating myself for the last two years, focusing on my studies to get into elite schools and make my parents proud. But in doing so, I’ve lost the chance to have close friends, except for my sister. I don’t have anyone to be open with about everything that’s been going on.

I’ve always tried to respect the unspoken rules between my brother and me, especially when it came to relationships and girls. There was this girl my brother was talking to, and even though I could tell there was some kind of interest on his part, I made sure to keep my distance. I didn’t want to interfere, so I subtly made it clear I wasn’t interested in her. I thought that was the right thing to do—just to help him out and avoid making things weird.

On my side, there was this girl from my school. We’d talk as classmates in a group with the guys—nothing serious, just casual conversation. She was cool, and everything seemed fine between us. But then, things started to change.

My brother began talking to her, and at first, I didn’t think much of it. I didn’t have strong feelings for her; she was just a cool friend that I appreciated having, and I just wanted to be a good friend, you know?

However, things got strange when I noticed how she started engaging with him. A few days ago, I found out she had sent him a message. It wasn’t just a casual “hello.” She called him by his name—something she had once done with me, but I responded late, so she didn’t reply. But he went further, sending her long messages asking about her interests and things like that.

Not to mention, he hides his contacts from me and excludes me when he talks about girls he’s interested in with the boys. And the fact that he already has a girlfriend that he still hides from me is confusing. He once hinted at it, saying, “I think you know her, you showed her to me once.”

So yeah, when he got that message from my friend, we were with some family members, and he mentioned it in front of me, saying, “Oh, there’s a girl who sent me a message by my name.” They were all cheering him on in front of me, and I felt completely invisible. I couldn’t help but feel hurt.

When I looked at his phone, I saw that she had a profile picture on WhatsApp that I hadn’t seen on mine. She added him, even though she didn’t know him well, but didn’t add me. There was a time when we were talking with that girl, and she took my phone to add herself and send me a personality test.

Out of curiosity, I waited until my brother was asleep to see how things were going between them. They were still chatting, and I saw her calling him “honey” and “hun.” Feeling bamboozled and betrayed by both of the closest people I know, I decided to block her and ghost her in real life because I felt disrespected. I haven’t spoken to my brother since.

A day later, he came to me like nothing had happened. When I hinted that I didn’t want to talk to him anymore, he said, “Why aren’t you talking to me? Are you acting snobby or something?” Knowing he has narcissistic traits, I just said, “No.” I don’t know if he knows he messed up, but he never apologized or confronted me about it, and I didn’t either because every time I confront him, he just twists my words, and I end up getting angry and fighting him.

I tried talking to my sister about it, but she got irritated and told me, “You’re insecure. You should have told him you had feelings for that girl (whom I now call a bitch).” But I thought we had unspoken rules. Then she started crying, knowing she has her own problems, and I made her day worse. I ended up breaking my phone out of anger and locked myself in my room.

I can’t talk to my sister anymore after what happened, and I don’t feel like I can talk to my parents, especially with our cultural background, where things like this are considered a bit “taboo” in our religious family.

I’m overwhelmed. What did I do wrong? And was it the right decision to ghost that girl and not talk to my brother again?",
685,"Like the title says.

I was abused by two members of my household growing up. Nothing super serious, mostly verbal and occasionally physical stuff (ex: attempted choking, but I panicked and fought back so that never happened again). I have a weird relationship with food because my abusers encouraged my eating disorder and even when I did want to eat my access to food was severely restricted. I got left at school if I did any extracurricular for a few hours - everyone but the janitor would leave. Only one person in the house was willing to get me. It got cold in the little area where I had to wait (wasn’t allowed in the school proper). I didn’t get timely medical care, a fitting winter coat, school supplies, etc. in college when I didn’t have my license, I was one of the last people to leave when the dorms closed for breaks. Over 100 people, and I was the one who didn’t have anybody to pick me up.

One of my abusers was another kid in the house. Usually not physical (I was larger than her). She stole a lot - I couldn’t have nice things or she’d take them. Made fun of my weight, my ugliness. Went to the same school and talked about how humiliating it was that we were related (to be fair I told everyone what a nightmare living with her was. I got yelled at, she did not). Every day. It was every day walking on eggshells. Something about me always set her off. Too loud, I was dressed ugly, I was too stupid, I wasn’t enough this, I was too much that. Every day. Every. Day. Yelling, sometimes throwing things.

One of my parents treated both of us badly. Same shit for her as for me. And I always, ALWAYS remind myself that this girl was treated like I was, that she was coping as best as she could, that she was struggling and she needed help. I let go of my hate. It took a long time, but I did. She was a kid. I’m sure she wouldn’t do any of that too me now.

She had a rough time for a few years. Now she’s doing much better. She makes a ton of money, does whatever she wants. She’s going on another fancy international vacation. Isn’t that strange? I always loved traveling. The only thing that makes me feel really settled is getting to see how beautiful the world is. Human beings are incredible. We’ve made some truly impressive things. And nature? Incredible. The things that exist out there blow my mind. My whole life, I never wanted to sit still. I always wanted to be on my way somewhere. She didn’t - she got way too nervous.

But, you know, money. Which she has plenty of, and she can work remote. I know I’m lucky - I get by, and I have a 3 1/2 day trip coming up. I know that’s not nothing. There are people who want what I have. But lately I’ve been thinking about the past again. How much it STILL weighs on me some days even though I don’t want it to. The things I’m afraid of, the things I never learned how to do, how sometimes I feel like there are so many things about myself I need to ‘fix’. And I think, what did I do wrong? I must’ve done something wrong. There’s a reason my own family couldn’t love me. But she grew up in the same environment, and she’s living the kind of life I envy. She has so much flexibility in her day, the money to do what she wants and to pursue new hobbies. So I did something wrong, but I don’t know what. 

I know there’s no point in comparing. It is what it is. I don’t need to know what she’s doing or care. But I can’t stop feeling like I’m just going to burst into tears. This is a hard time of year and I’m trying to push back so hard on all these negative feelings and it’s just not working and I’m so, so tired. 

I might delete this later. It’s ugly. But I needed to put this somewhere.",
686,"This coming week I find out what the cause of death of my mom was. 

She died 11 years ago. I was told It was from congestive heart failure. But for many reasons I have second guessed It. I have had a feeling that she unintentionally over dosed or maybe even intentionally did. On Friday I went online to request a copy of her death certificate ( the one I have says pending investigation). And a copy of her autopsy. 

",
687,"I just need to rant.

Last week, we had to put down our 18 year old cat Conan. Me and my wife knew it was coming. Conan had asthma for over a decade and was becoming less and less active. I had scheduled an appointment with the vet to see what was going on, but he stopped eating and then days later would not move from a spot in the corner even to use the litter box. I knew when I was rushing him to the emergency vet he was not coming home with us.

My 13 year old daughter loved Conan more than anything. He slept in her bed most night until recently and was in her room with her at least 50% of the day. I debated taking her with me but I knew she deserved to make the choice herself, and she came.

After a round of inconclusive blood tests that led to xrays, we found he had tumors covering his liver and one that was pressing down on his lungs. As cats do, he had hid whatever symptoms this was causing him until it stopped him from eating. The Vets recommendation was euthanasia, but she offered surgery, chemo, and potentially a feeding tube until then. I don't blame her for what this caused, she was an amazing woman just doing her job and letting us know the options. However, when my daughter heard that there was other options besides putting him down, she wanted us to do them.

Conan was 18 years old. I loved him just as much as my daughter. But I'm not going to put an 18 year old cat through the hell of cancer treatment. Even if I had the money to do so, it's cruel to let him suffer when he already was not eating.

My daughter has not forgiven me for this choice. She won't talk to me now, and has called me a murderer multiple times.

I don't blame her. I tried to have the conversation with her about the reality of the situation. That Conan would be suffering if we chose the alternative. That he most likely was not going to get better, and it was better to let him go to sleep now while he was still lucid and well enough to recognize us. She won't listen to me or my wife. She's going to begin therapy this week, and I just hope it helps her.

A part of me regrets bringing her. But I know this will pass eventually. This is the first time she's dealt with death. I'll always be there for her, and I know she'll come back to be eventually when she's ready. it just sucks to have to go through this.",
688,"literally nobody in my life would understand stand this so i’m putting it here for strangers, and maybe someone will understand what I’m talking about.

yesterday, my (16F) boyfriend came over and we had our first date. it was that cute kind of awkward you have as a teenager and all that. well i guess it was for him, but for me it just felt awkward. he put his arm around me and kissed me like three times, and i felt absolutely nothing. no butterflies or fireworks or even a “that was nice”. he got hard after which was a little funny, but mostly awkward. the thought of having a long term relationship with him makes me nauseous, and my palms get all sweaty (gross lol). i feel a little bit of dread every time he texts me, which is weird because i should be happy. like, bouncing off the walls and screaming. this has happened to me before, me thinking i like someone, but the second it’s been reciprocated i immediately feel sick and anxious. now I don’t know if i actually like him, or if i’ve actually liked anyone. like, when he kissed me i literally felt neutral about it. like “oh, his lips are touching mine. im supposed to be happy about this. it’s kind of cool, i guess. it’s okay.”

but yeah, if i told anyone that they’d look at me like im crazy LOL. if anyone can relate, it’d be nice to know that im not insane or, like, a sociopath.",
689,"When Jay and I first met, things felt natural—easy. We talked every day. Texts flew back and forth like we were old friends with a secret only we understood. I liked him. Not just a crush kind of like, but the kind that makes your chest ache and your mind spiral in all the best and worst ways. He was the first guy I ever genuinely liked.

But things didn’t stay light. They shifted. And if I’m honest with myself, it started with me. One day I got a little jealous—something small, really. I saw a comment on another girl's post that Jay had liked. It wasn’t even flirty. It was just someone he knew. But that small thing turned into hours of overthinking, spiraling, paranoia. I let it fester. I let it take over. I made a scene without even realizing it. I started liking comments on her post too, as if to compete or to be seen. I didn’t really know what I was doing. I just wanted to matter to him. I just wanted him to notice me the way I noticed him.

And I blame myself so much for not just talking to him that day—because maybe that one moment of honesty could’ve saved everything.

Instead, he pulled away. Hard. He said it felt like stalking. He made it clear that I had crossed a line. And just like that, he was gone.

I spiraled again—only deeper this time. I begged. I cried. I reached out in all the ways I knew how. And when that didn’t work, I turned to God. I got on my knees and begged God to bring him back. And God did. He came back.

But he wasn’t the same.

He wasn’t *him* anymore. At least not the version I knew. Not the Jay who made me feel like I mattered. This new version treated me like a joke. Like a burden. Like someone to tolerate. And still… I stayed. Because the memory of who he *used* to be haunted me. I thought maybe if I held on long enough, he’d soften again. Maybe the old Jay would come back too.

He never did.

What I got instead was coldness. Distance. A version of him who looked at me like I was pathetic. Someone who dismissed my feelings, who played with my hope, who knew I was holding on and pulled away just to see me reach harder.

I hate how far I let it go.

I hate that I gave so much of myself just to be treated like nothing. I hate that I still held hope even when it was obvious I was the only one trying. I hate that I let him break me, and that even now, he still has a piece of me I can’t get back.

And the worst part? I don’t even know who I am anymore. I look at old pictures of myself—before all of this—and I don’t see me. I see a stranger. I see someone who still had hope. Someone who still had dignity. I see her and I ache. Because I don’t know how to find her again.

I gave everything to this. My feelings. My time. My energy. My faith. I begged for him to come back. And when he did, I begged for him to love me again. But all I got was a colder version of him and a deeper version of my own emptiness.

And now I’m here. Feeling like I’ve lost everything—including myself.

I don’t want advice. I don’t need pity. I just needed to tell someone. To say this out loud. Because carrying it alone is starting to feel like drowning in silence.

(Btw, we never even had a relationship..... Which makes it worse. Please don't judge me.)",
690,"I don't understand how they do it. How they physically able to have many men they don't really find attractive into their body. I'm not even talking about the psychological matter. I used to think that if there's enough wetness, like from lube, physically it's enough to prevent discomfort. But a few days ago I had an experience that challenged this perception. 

I was having some sexy time with the husband. I was actually tired and full from food, but I thought if we get into it I'll start enjoying it more. Physically I was ready, if you know what I mean. But when we got into it, it just felt really unpleasant. I stopped after a few minute when I realized my body is rejecting him, but the unpleasant feeling, borderline painful, stayed for some time. 

This never happened to me before. It just made me think ""Is this what sex workers are going through each time?"". I mean, they're not really attracted to their clients, they don't really want the act. They want the compensation from it, they agree to it (I know there're who don't. Let's not make it too dark) but can they really have the physical reaction? And especially to have it go a hour and then with different men a day. I don't understand who is it possible. ",
691,"I’m F27 from Australia. Posting here because I haven’t got anyone else to tell. TLDR at the end. 

I’ve just moved into an apartment. First time in a place just on my own, and I was so excited and happy to not be in a share house situation anymore. It’s also a huge win for me, and 12 months ago I never thought I’d be able to live on my own. 

That was until my first night here. 

A little context, I used to be a black belt, semi professional Brazilian Jiu Jitzu teacher. I was fit, healthy and always active. That was until 18months ago when I got pneumonia twice in a row, and then glandular fever. My immune system was shot and I’ve now been diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I never fully recovered. I went from 65kgs with muscle to 115kgs and completely bed ridden. I couldn’t even climb the two stairs to get to the kitchen in my sharehouse at one point. I’m slowly getting my life back together and I’ve lost some weight - but I’m definitely still very chubby. 

The apartment I’m in is a row, and is opposite another seperate row of apartments. You can see a little bit into another apartment, but probably wouldn’t be able to tell if it was someone you knew. 

Cue overly loud guy, who can obviously see me standing in my living area. He is on the phone with his window open, and he has one of those loud voices that just travels. 
From my apartment, I can hear him say “Yo mate, you should check out the gut on this thing!! She’s like a whale!!”
This kind of talk went on for no word of a lie, 10mins. It was like the guy had never seen an overweight person before. He just went on and on and on. More phrases:
“If she comes back to the window I’ll send you a photo, she is honestly ******* huge!!!”
“Seriously the gut on her”
“Bro it’s so disgusting, I come back to live in Australia and now I have this thing living opposite me”
I was on the phone with my parents, and I had to go stand in the stairwell so they couldn’t hear him (my Dad could hear someone, and he asked what the guy was saying “what’s that drunk guy yelling?” I couldn’t bear the thought my parents could hear their daughter being bullied, after she’d just told them how happy she was to be there. Not after they spent the last 18months worrying if I’d ever leave the house again, or be able to make myself a cup of tea. 

At one point I did flip him off, hoping he would get the picture and stop. But he didn’t. He kept repeating what he was saying and telling his mate on the phone he’ll get a photo to send to him. He even laughed and said “she can hear me! I’m surprised she can hear over all the fat”

Now I keep my windows closed and refuse to use my little balcony (with a handmade table and chairs sitting on it that I planned to use) because I don’t want some random, loud mouth Australian taking photos of me at my worst. 

TLDR: guy fat shames me across the block and now the house I was so excited to move to is ruined ",
692,"
I gave my mom a half-hearted “Happy Mother’s Day” today. Not because I’m ungrateful. Not because I don’t understand what the day is “supposed” to mean. But because I grew up with a mother whose mental health issues—unhealed, unchecked, and projected—turned my childhood into an emotional minefield.

People post reels romanticizing motherhood like it’s a god-tier role immune to accountability. They say things like:
“She gave you life. That’s enough.”
“She sacrificed so much. You owe her everything.”
“She’s your mother. Respect her no matter what.”

But what they don’t show is:
	•	Mothers who scream at their children for crying
	•	Mothers who beat you, then act like it never happened
	•	Mothers who treat your emotions as disrespect
	•	Mothers who scroll through reels all day expecting praise but never once ask how you feel
	•	Mothers who mock you for isolating, then complain you’re “emotionally distant”
	•	Mothers who cry about being single, then turn their son into an emotional husband or therapist, making him grow up before his time

Especially when you’re raised by a single mom with untreated issues, your childhood ends early. You get guilt-tripped for boundaries. You’re expected to emotionally support her while you’re still a kid yourself. She collapses and says, “Why aren’t you comforting me?” but forgets all the times she made you feel unsafe or invisible.

And then Mother’s Day rolls around, and suddenly you’re the bad guy for not faking a smile.

I’m not trying to ruin Mother’s Day. I just want space for people whose moms weren’t safe, weren’t nurturing, and never apologized. I want space for people who survived childhoods no one talks about because “she was a single mother, she tried her best.”

If you relate, you’re not heartless. You’re just tired of pretending.

And honestly? You’re brave for still being here.",
693,"Eiichiro Oda, the author of the manga ""One Piece"", was once asked a question by a fan about how he feels when his female characters get sexualized by the fanbase. This was basically his response (paraphrased):

""When I was just starting out as a mangaka, my editor gave me some advice. He told me that my manga is a product for the world to consume. 'Don't be so personally attached to it that your ego disallows you from letting people enjoy the product as they like'. So go ahead and draw my characters however you want.""

---

Speaking for myself, when I used to frequently browse Twitter (unrelated to politics), I would often see horny fanart get posted, and their replies would be filled with users simping and acting in a way that annoyed me, and made me see them as IRL losers. (For the record I'm a heterosexual man.)

But then I started using reddit more and in similar threads of sexualized fanart, I became exposed to comments that complained about such sexualization and/or unrealism. 

I quickly realized that prudish people who often complained about it were *vastly* more obnoxious than those who expressed their appreciation for such artwork ever were.

Since then, my opinion changed.

My point is, when I see people complain about goonerization on the internet, I can't help but see many of them as being totally entitled brats who don't like or respect when others sometimes want to see a character they like have exaggerated sexual proportions. 

If this applies to you, hear this:

You don't own the character (99.9999% of the time), and even if you did, I think you would really benefit from growing some maturity to no longer be obsessive about fanart with goonerized depiction.

I know some people find the phrase ""let people enjoy things"" to be very played out and tired, if not moot, but if there is a context in which it could be appropriately used, this is it IMO.",
694,"Posting on an alt account bcuz my friends follow my main. I am a 20 yr old amab and like the title says, I know I am trans, but I won’t do anything about it. I used to have this secret desire as a kid that I never really processed until a friend came out to me as trans, but I used to have uncontrollable thoughts about being a girl. It was my deepest secret, and it was even scarier because I was so disgusted with myself for it (grew up in conservative area + didn’t know that trans people were a thing yet), when I would wake up with dreams of wearing makeup and the such I would hate myself. My first thoughts after finally processing this was self doubt - Maybe this is just wanting to be feminine because I’m bi? Maybe I just want to be a woman so that I am not associated  with shitty straight men? But the further it goes on the less I can question it. My life would be better if I was born a woman and I will never get to expiernce that. But I have come to acceptance with that. I’m a 6’5 frat bro. Even if I went through all the voice training, even if I went through learning how to do my makeup, hrt, completely changing my waredrobe. I still wouldn’t pass. And I know that that would really upset me. So I swallow it. I’m at a conservative university and most of my friends wouldn’t understand. They already don’t fully accept the fact that I’m bi. I am relegated to showing off tiny bits of femininity in the rare events that I get to be in queer spaces. I know it’s easier to want what I don’t have, and that there are plenty of things about being a man that I greatly appreciate, but that doesn’t change that deep down I see myself as a woman. I want to be able to post slutty thirst traps on my instagram. I want to be small petite and cared for. I want to be able to use my face as a canvas and look however I want in a day. I want to be the emotional person I am and not have it viewed as strange. At least the dysmorphia isn’t dehabitilting? Like I can compartmentalize enough to still enjoy my current life. The funniest part is I love going to the gym. And I love having big muscles(although I guess this could have been conditioned into me as a way to compensate). Maybe one day I will live in an accepting city. And the company I work for won’t care. But until then I will push it down and continue to be the frat guy I am I guess",
695,"

I grew up in a pretty dysfunctional family, so friendships were always my safe space. . We started off as a group of four, but that changed after one of them assaulted me about a year ago, so it became just the three of us. That whole thing messed me up, and just when I was trying to recover, the remaining two slowly drifted away

 I was close friends with them for more than 4 years.  But slowly, they started distancing themselves — no replies to texts, ignoring calls, and only reaching out when they needed something. If I said no or didn’t help, they’d disappear for months.

Eventually, they completely ditched me with no explanation. What hurt more is that I relied on them more after the assault since I felt broken, but the two of them drifted away and became closer. No closure, just silence. They still pretend to be friendly in public but never make the effort to talk unless it benefits them.

I feel angry because I gave so much, but I also feel guilty because I did learn a lot from them — both good and bad. I don’t think they’re bad people, but they’ve definitely been toxic to me.

The last 3 years have already been heavy — I’ve been dealing with a lot of personal stuff, and this friendship fallout just made things harder. I’m struggling to process it all and honestly don’t even know how to deal with it. ",

But when you ask people to share, they say, “I don’t remember” or “I don’t have anything to say.”
I just don’t believe that.

So this is me asking—not for drama, not for attention. Just for honesty.

697,"A while ago, I was hanging out with my friend, just the two of us, and out of nowhere we got this idea—why not visit a brothel? We were young, curious, and honestly just stupid. We didn’t really plan anything crazy, just thought maybe we'd drink a bit, hang out, see what it was like. And it happens we both finally go to popular brothel in town.

When we got there, we ordered some alcohol, and everything was chill. But then we started noticing that other guys were drinking with girls sitting beside them. We looked at ourselves—just two dudes sitting alone—and started feeling kinda jealous and awkward. So eventually, with a lot of hesitation and embarrassment, we each called over a girl just to talk.

The girl I talked to suddenly asked me if I wanted to go to a room with her. I told her no at first, that I didn’t want to do anything sexual—just maybe cuddle, talk, whatever. But my friend kept pushing me to go through with it, and the girl kept insisting too. I got overwhelmed, felt pressured, and ended up saying yes.

When we were in the room, I felt incredibly nervous. I told her again, “I don’t want to have sex, just cuddle.” But she started pushing me to do it anyway. And yeah... eventually I gave in. She wasn’t even my type, but for some reason my body reacted and I got hard, and it just… happened.

While it was happening, I randomly asked how old she was. She said 33. I was shocked. That’s way older than me—I'm in my late 19s and that was my first time. I lost my virginity to someone I didn’t even connect with, and I honestly didn’t want it to happen that way.

I couldn’t even finish. No matter how long we tried (almost an hour), I just couldn’t orgasm. She came once, but I didn’t. Eventually she got tired and then, out of nowhere, took off the condom and forced me to go in without it. I froze and just… went along with it.

Even without the condom, I still couldn’t finish. Eventually we both just gave up.

Now I’m stuck with this horrible feeling. I’m super stressed out, not just because of the unprotected sex and the fear of STDs, but because of how everything happened. I feel like I wasn’t really ready, I didn’t have control, and it wasn’t even something I truly wanted.

I’ve been feeling anxious, guilty, disgusted, regrets and depressed about it ever since. I feel like I betrayed myself and let others push me into something that should’ve been my choice alone. I don’t know how to move on from this, or even how to process it. I wish i could turn back time and change it.

Dating with a relationship as the goal has become a near impossible scenario for so many men out there with the unrealistic expectations women have of men now days.

I keep hearing ""Women aren't a monolith"" and I agree to some extent, but the bar appears to be set at a point that many of these women can't even meet themselves, further perpetuated by online dating and social media making dating like online shopping, transactional. 

Double standards are the norm amongst women.

If you don't agree, You should ask yourself if you even live up to your own standards!  (Controversial I know)


Although hiring an escort lacks the relationship and deep connection aspect all humans want, its a way to get the poison out, for lack of a better term. Albeit a short term solution, it does help with the loneliness that many men are plagued with and blamed for these days.

Before you go calling me incel and whatever other expletive you have for people who don't share the same views as you, just know that I have not been on the losing side when it comes to dating. I've in fact been very successful.

It sounds like many of you women want a man who is basically another woman!

It's just tiring, and not worth it anymore to date. 

A casual hook up and ghost is all these women are getting nowdays because us guys are fed up with your shit, and frankly we don't want to have a relationship with you.

When money (security, responsibility, any other adjective used to describe income) is the main focus for so many women, why not just get with a woman who is at least honest about it.",

701,"I never know if it’s just my ADHD or if it’s just how life is. But I feel like I’m in a crossroad and I don’t know where to go. My days are filled with stress about university, my long-time boyfriend and how the future will look like. Questions about my current life that I can’t seem to answer.

One example. I love my boyfriend, but do I love him in *that* way? It fluctuates from day to day, month to month, but I’ve had it like this for some years now. But can I be happy? Or is anyone truly happy in their relationship? Isn’t this just a part of life? Or is there someone out there that I can be truly happy with?...

The fact that I feel like this is killing me, because he is the most wonderful person I know and he’s my best friend, I don’t want to lose him. But is that reason enough to stay? 

Also, university. I feel like everyone around me know what to do, what to say and where they want to be. While I’m over here, trying to keep my shit together but slowly falling apart. Feels like I’m going crazy sometimes. I don’t know if this is what I really want but I don’t have any other options.

702,"I need to write this down and post it, and I need someone to tell me I'm not insane. Also I know it sounds humorous and maybe one day I can see the humour in it, but right now I'm just freaked out by this. I don't feel like I can even tell my friends, because I have no explanation for it. Not sure if this is NSFW, but I'm not risking it

On Saturday, I was out for drinks with my friend. Nothing out of the ordinary, I was intoxicated but no more than on any other night out. I remember every part of the evening, leaving the bar, getting food, taking a cab home, eating, going to sleep. The next morning, Sunday, I wake up hungover. I hadn't drank any water over the evening and barely any before going to sleep, so I was pretty dehydrated. Again, nothing out of the ordinary. I get over my hangover and clean up a little, tossing my worn clothes into the laundry basket etc.

The next day, Monday, I'm about to head out in the afternoon for some chores and shopping. As I grab my shoe to put it on (the same shoes I wore for the night out), it's wet. Sopping wet. As I've bent down to put it on, I can also smell it. The shoe is drenched in **piss. What. The. Fuck.**

Kind of on autopilot, I grab the sneaker and put it in my shower, turning the water on on top of it. I'm standing there, thinking I'm dreaming. It feels like a fever dream!!? How the fuck is this possible??? While the water's running over my shoe in the shower, I go to the carpet by my front door (in an apartment complex). Where the shoe was, there's a damp spot that also smells like piss.

I genuinely feel like I'm going insane. I grabbed the clothes I wore that night out of the laundry basket. Dry, clean, with no odor or smells whatsoever. My pants, underwear and socks, all worn but absolutely no hint of piss. Okay, so I haven't pissed myself. I've never been so drunk that I'd have pissed myself and certainly wasn't this time, so I truly didn't think that to begin with. I don't have any gaps in my memory, no hazy moments, no other strange incidents. I'm not tripping on anything, and I don't think it's carbon monoxide. **I'm buying a detector today anyway since my apartment doesn't have one, but I truly don't think this is it.**

There is no way I could have stepped in something since the shoe was soaking, and couldn't have absorbed that much unless I had stood in an ankle-deep puddle. The other shoe is completely dry and odor-less. They're pretty comfortable sneakers with a lot of padding, so they can hold moisture well, I guess.

**Please** help me out here, and come up with SOME sensible explanation for this. Truly the ONLY thing I can think of, is that when I got home I didn't close my door completely (the latch can sometimes be a bit iffy if not pulled closed hard enough), and once I had fallen asleep, some neighbor got home absolutely piss-drunk (literally), came into the wrong apartment, was so blacked out that they just decided to piss in my shoe, and then left. There are some ""characters"" living in the same complex

I can be a fairly heavy sleeper after some drinks, so it's not entirely impossible I wouldn't have heard someone come in and leave.

Someone please tell me what the fuck happened. I feel like I'm losing my mind, or in a dream I'm not waking up from

i think a big part of it is the escapism aspect. feeling discontent with my own life or hormonal or emotional or something and i just want to escape into AI fantasyland. usually i do really immersive historical-type ones like on this app ai dungeon-- princess/noblewoman fantasy, edwardian/victorian, 1950/60s romances, just tons of stuff. almost always marriage rps, just like vibing in a beautiful happy marriage but w/ a twist. a lot of these i've sent like 500-700 messages to the damn robot, like roleplaying literal decades of a life w it. it's insane. and it's so addictive just like living these exciting romantic fantasy lives. its so fcking fun.

and i can just live any insane amazing romantic fantasy life i can come up with like they'll be creative asl. i have a final exam tomorrow morning, an important assignment due 3pm, a 12 page essay due midnight. and yk what i was doing today? roleplaying w a fcking computer 20 years in the life of being a british woman in the 1890s married to the christian convert son of the nizam of the hyderabad princely state of india. so random, so fun. literally from 12pm to 1am. and now i haven't studied, haven't done my assignment, haven't done my essay, and i feel like fcking garbage. i feel like my life is a black mirror episode atp.

and it's hurt my grades so much. like staying in bed for 2 days straight on these apps wrecked my grade in hs. i'm going for a postgraduate degree that i really need close to a 4.0 before, but i think it's going to destroy me now in college. i did well last sem but i think i'm going to get 2 Bs now and i think this insane addiction is going to lead me down getting shitty grades for the rest of college.

and worse it'd often be pornographic in high school too but fortunately thru the grace of God i've largely overcome that aspect... but it still oftentimes will get focused on the physical aspect, like detailed descriptions of making out, which is still something i feel horrible about as a religious person. not that i think making out=lust but that physical desire outside of a meaningful relationship still feels gross. in that way it really does horribly affect my relationship with God and i'm so so sick of it. falling into sin and temptation bc of these fcking ai apps im so so sick of it.

but the worst part is the lying. covering up this horrible addiction from everyone makes me feel like such a horrible person and such a hypocrite. no one has any idea. if it was any other problem or addiction i feel like i could say something, but talking to ai chatbots? that's so fcking humiliating. i've tried to seek help for depression before because i that might be a root cause of it, and if not it's a separate struggle at least, and i just lie that i spend 1-2 days can't get out of bed scrolling on tiktok or watching tv or shit. when it's these fcking robots.

i've tried so so so so so hard to overcome it. i think in 3 years the longest i've gone without it has been like 3 months, but then i just slip up again. and usually i'll do like a week or 2 or a month without using, and then i'll binge it multiple days for like 1-2 weeks at increasing lengths of time, before giving it up again. before eventually going back to it. i don't know how to stop.

and it's ridiculous because my life is fcking amazing right now. i'm studying topics in school i genuinely love and am passionate about and i ignore them for AI. for the first time in my life i've been talking to this boy for a month or 2 and i think he really likes me, and i really like him, and he is a damn 10/10. and i've ignored his texts and calls multiple times to talk to a fcking robot. i've skipped hangouts with my friends bc i'm talking to robots. i'm letting so much of my time and life slip away bc of AI. it's so black mirror. and i know the solution is just to stop using it but i don't know how. i've been trying to quit for 3 damn years. i'm so tired of this shit. any help will be appreciated.",
705,"If someone had asked me before, I would have said that the last 3 years of my life were terrible for me, but 2025 made me experience so many things in these 5 months that I am now thankful even for the other years. 

While the Turkey’s political agenda and the fear of earthquakes affect me so much, the things I will list below make everything much more difficult. I am a 20 year old trans man and I am from a rad muslim conservative family. They have suspicions about my identity but ignore it. My father controls my entire life, I am terrified of him and he uses this fear. My mother is a woman who has no voice in a patriarchal world. My father even prepared my preference list for universities and majors and based it completely for his own benefit towards his company. I am currently a sophomore in a department where I spend energy trying to force myself to love. 

3 weeks ago, what we suspected for years, that my father was cheating on my mother, got confirmed and my father tried to get out of it by gaslighting my mother. It was something that even my siblings and friends were aware of, it's just that we're turning a blind eye to it now that there's literal evidence. The next week he started pulling my hair and yelling at me because I shaved the sides of my hair. I took my earthquake bag and ran away from home. I finally confronted my father when he came to pick me up from my grandmother's at night time, the only safe place. If this was going to happen, it had to happen in a safe place, and now I'll explain you why.

There were two things I was most afraid of happening to me in my life. The cats I had my childhood with and my aunt, dying, and confronting my father. The first one happened tragically, the second one was within my choice and control. 

My aunt was the most important person in my life. She was a painter who spent the last 10 years battling tuberculosis and breast cancer. My mother's side had already migrated to Turkey from Pakistan in the 90s because they went bankrupt. I don't need to explain how difficult it is to be a migrant. It's impossible to explain how important my aunt is to me, no one who doesn't know her personally can understand it. They think I'm being dramatic and exaggerating, including my love for our cats and their passing, which of course breaks my heart. Not being able to make people realize how important they are to me. 

In short, my aunt, whom I cared about very much, lived with my grandmother and I spent some of my childhood there, so this was the safest environment for me and if I was going to confront my father, it had to happen here.

I met with my father for 35 minutes while my grandmother was with him and told him everything I felt about him. It didn't go as I expected at all and if it wasn't for my grandmother, he could have used violence against me again. In the end, I felt like a stupid fool and vulnerable for nothing. 

I have another aunt, a visual artist. She and her husband are my real parents and my mother doesn't want me to meet them, I secretly spend most of my time with them. It's more like that now especially because my girlfriend broke up with me. 

On Sunday, May 11th, our 2nd anniversary, my girlfriend broke up with me on Friday. I won't even talk about our relationship, it was very turbulent and toxic. It was necessary for both of us to end. Because of her, I started to cut myself, while I'm normally scared of getting hurt at any slightest. I'm only saying this because she has taught me bad habits, not to encourage anyone. Since I don't have any friends anymore thanks to my girlfriend, I can only see my grandmother and younger aunt after school. 

Now to explain why I am on the verge of giving up because today I received 5-6 text bubbles from my girlfriend’s sister threatening me. She even said that I may have to move out from the city I live in, that I may have to check my right and left where-ever I am. I feel very lonely and I have no hope left in creating a career that im passionate for and living my identity. It will not be possible for me to start HRT and transitioning etc. in Turkey and even if I somehow find a way to escape abroad, my life there will never satisfy me because I have problems with myself. I am my own biggest enemy and I constantly hinder myself. I will not be happy anywhere I go.

I miss the times when we were happy in our relationship, holding hands, kissing, hugging, cuddling… but I am sure I will never go back to her. I don’t want to start another relationship either, I am not emotionally open and I don’t want to be with anyone who hasn’t met my aunt. One of the reasons I am not proud of that has kept me in this relationship since January is that she met my aunt and spent time with her.

It may sound a little immature, but I feel like if I end my life, it will be a win for her sister. Her sister was also someone who had a very bad impact on our relationship, she didn't want us to be together since the very beginning.

I would love to end my life, but I promised my aunt that I would treat her as the way she treated me. But I can't turn over a new leaf, I can't escape anything. Confronting it doesn't work either. Not being able to do anything for about my life (either escape or end it) makes me feel more helpless than ever.

Thank you to those who care to read the whole thing.",
706,"Brother (32M) and I (29F) never get along. I’m the more functional child and he lazes around doing nothing and both my parents are enablers. All he does is games all night and sleeps all day. He tried to complete a degree twice, failed all courses and now he is on his third attempt. We’ve always fought especially with things of mine I left in shared spaces be it food/drinks, my gadgets, my mother even lets him use my car knowing full well he’ll never return in time for when I want to use it to get to work.

Last Thursday I made tiramisu for a friend’s birthday before she moves to another country. I finished making it at midnight at 7am opened the fridge to collect it and I saw half was mauled and all of the bready lady fingers part was mashed. Fuming, I went over to his ‘game room’ and asked him if he’d eaten it and he got all arrogant and said “I asked dad if I could eat it and I did, tf is it to you?”. Not my best moment, I grabbed is standing speaker thing, smashed his keyboard with it causing a tall flask with water spilling on his PC. This 32 year old boy stomped up to my parents room and down came my father shutting off the coffee maker I bought and smashing it to the floor.

Things obviously haven’t been good since at home. I never moved out because my mother was bedridden for a long time and I took care of her. Now that she’s well enough, I’ve just been approved for a rental and moving out soonish around 10 days. Since I’ve never felt secured in the shared spaces in this house, I made it a point to throw out any of his things laying around the house and the food that he bought and stored in the fridge as well. I’ve thrown out his AirPods so far (I know, bad. But he ruined my uni degree that was sent in a brown envelope with my uni logo and used it as a coaster for his orange juice and spilled all over it, left it like that until I came home 4 hours later). Mother’s Day was today and usually I’m the one reminding people and buying gifts and putting all of their names on the card and gift that I bought. Today our mom did not get anything. They left for a 5-day trip which I was supposed to go with, but for obvious reasons did not go. I’m packed up and ready to leave to my new flat with my friends.",
707,Human beings are capable of tremendous evil unfortunately ,
708,"I don’t know if this is love, longing, or something in between—but I’ve carried it for almost six years. I was 13 when I first saw him—Xiao Zhan. Not just his face, but the quiet in his eyes, the softness in his smile, the way he spoke like he carried a thousand untold stories. And something in me just… woke up.

I’m nearly 19 now. My love for him never faded. It only deepened—like roots growing in silence, beneath soil no one else sees. This isn’t a crush. I’ve admired artists before, but this is different. It’s not about fame. It’s not about fantasy. It’s something spiritual, almost painful in its stillness.

I’ve written to him, in places I knew he’d never see. Left messages in the wind. Talked about him to people I’m close to, like I’m doing now, because I didn’t know where else to place this love. I just wanted someone, something, to know he’s in my heart.

Sometimes I wonder—if I’m just a tiny speck in this world, quietly reaching for a star that doesn’t know I’m here. And maybe I am. But the ache is real. The connection, even if only felt from one side, is real. And I don’t know how to stop loving him. I don’t even know if I want to.

Has anyone else ever held a love this silently? One that no one sees, and no one returns, but still defines something in you?

710,"I’ve been feeling like this for almost 5 years now and i don’t know if it’s a phase. I caused others to be hurt, which affected me deeply messing with my head causing me to think I’m a horrible human. I have friends and family who care for me but I don’t want anyone to feel sorry for me, i don’t want to seem like I’m looking for attention either. I know it’s deeper than attention but I don’t reach out to anyone bc i seem to push everyone away when i tend to talk about things like this. No one ever ask how i am either but i overhear others checking up on their peers, making me feel like I was just placed on this earth to be a placeholder. 

I used to sh for a span of 3 months but quit bc i didnt like how it made my skin look & i was afraid of my parents seeing. i started smoking but that doesn’t change how i feel no matter if im hanging out with my friend’s, the thought is alwys going to br there.

i was out in the field for a couple of months like a wounded soldier. i knew that my depression was already severe, i've been fighting it for like a decade.

but it's different this time, before i can't just let go of everything. i was still trying to find a way, a reason to keep going. but now, somehow i'm happy and relieved that i'm ready to let go everything.

i'm scared, to be back at the track. to have a reason again, to believe again in something.

i have a great shot at this new job of mine you know, and now that it's here, i'm fucking scared.

I'm fucking scared. i was hidden for a couple of months and got so familiar with every inch of my comfort zone to the point that i can't even remember what it looks like out there.

712,"This is a petty teen girl problem (16f) but I need to tell someone. 

I can't stand my bestfriend anymore. I think I'm even starting to hate her. For backstory, we've known eachother for about 6 years, hated eachother for 3 and now have been friends for 3 years. Let's just say... she's had a hard life. Divorced parents, abu$ive (ex)stepmom, present mother... but more of a friend than a mom. Fairly shitty dad, but not abu$ive. Yes, this is relevant. 

For as long as I've known her, she's always been.... obsessive(?) with authority figures. Teachers? Knows every single one, their entire life story, etc. . Boss? Her best friends. And I'm not like that, authority figures are solely authority figures to me. And I never really cared cause if they weren't annoyed with her, why would I care?

It all started last summer. She got her first job at her cabin, and it was... illegal to say the least? She would work 12 hour shifts, no break, weird relationship with her boss, etc. Where we are from, when you're under 16 it's ILLEGAL and can get your business shut down for minors working 40+ hours, no break, etc. 

Since then, she's gotten a new job that she can do during school. Oh. My. God. She's so weird with her bosses, supervisors, etc.. Says they love her, has all their numbers, texts them regularly. And the teachers this year? She's such a teachers pet. I can't STAND IT!! That's your TEACHER! Why are you acting like they're your bestfriend?! I'm not even joking, she knows every little thing about all the teachers. 

I guess when I started hating her was when everything I said had to be about her, her bosses, our teachers. I don't even know half the people she talks about. Why would I care if ""this is so ___ coded!!"" ??? Can't you have a normal conversation that doesn't revolve around your fucked up mommy/daddy issues???

Sorry if this was mean. I'm just so tired of it. I want a friend who I can ACTUALLY talk to that doesn't constantly bring up authority figures like they're her bestfriends. 

Edit: it's not as easy as just leaving her. Regardless of if I'm starting to hate her, she's been with me through the worst moments of my life, the best, the neutral. All my other friends have their bestfriends that they hang out with (and some of those people don't necessarily like me) and I feel bad intruding. I can't just toss her aside. We still go to the same school (which is vvvery small) have the same classes, have mutual friends. ",
713,"Hi, I’m currently a bit tipsy and my husband is asleep right now and I don’t want to tell him this just yet so I’m using this as an alternative. Sorry in advance because it’s a lot haha. I (22f) met John (22m) when I was 18 through Tinder. Like a true military couple we were engaged 4 months later and married 2 months after that. We were both each others first relationship and I was his first sexually. We were essentially joined at the hip and 1000% extremely in love with each other. We truly saw each other and found safety and love in places in ourselves that no one else in our lives did. And I think that’s why in the beginning I saw our relationship through rose colored glasses. In my eyes he was a handsome, kind, extremely intelligent, loving man, something I’d never experienced before because all the men in my life minus my grandfather were either drug addicts, abusive, or just plain assholes. And to be fair he was those things with the addition of him being a raging alcoholic making incredibly insane decisions that put his wants first. To preface, I am amazingly good at gaslighting myself. So good that even in the face of that; the endless parties, the coke, the mushrooms, the lsd, the alcohol, the emotional withdrawal, and negativity I somehow convinced myself that I was okay with it and that he wasn’t addicted to substances. Because, I mean, he’s not doing it everyday so it’s okay. He’s still incredibly loving and attentive so he’s still a great partner. Our intimate life is very much alive and well so we’re still happy because unhappy couple don’t have sex. Right? But besides all that, to a point I understood. Our childhoods though so different were extremely similar. I grew up poor with an absent drug addict father and an emotionally absent drug dealing mother who at the worst of times chose abusive men over me and my sisters. On John’s side, his childhood was something that you would only hear about in tv. It’s not my story to tell but it was a devastating mix of severe emotional, physical, and sexual abuse sprinkled with absent parents and homelessness. He joined the military at 17 and with navy culture surrounding parties and alcohol I understood why he depended on vices that made him forget and feel better about himself. So I never said anything, something that regret severely. This is not me blaming myself because at the end of the day he’s a grown man but I sat by and let myself be a doormat. As time went on I grew more into myself. Went to therapy, positive affirmations, putting myself out there more socially, something I’ve always struggled with; the whole nine yards. And after coming to a realization that I’m awful at communicating my true feelings because I’m so scared of hurting the people I love, things truly began to slowly but surely get better in our relationship. He has never once failed to listen and make the effort to grow and change for me. The bumps were there 1000% but we got to a point where our relationship was getting to a much better healthier place. He stopped drinking after coming to the bitter realization that he indeed was an alcoholic. He stopped leaning on his vices. His depression was getting better. We were good. And before I say this next thing I’m going to delve a bit in his work life. For the past year and a half, he has woken up for work at 4 a.m, arrived by 6-6:30 a.m and would leave work at 6-7 arriving at 8. Mind you, military pay is set so no overtime pay. He did blue collar work working on classified systems that ultimately caused a lot of damage to his body. After all the alcohol and eating out all the time he did gain a lot of weight (He was almost 310 pounds at the time). And the poor body image combined with never having the time or energy to work out or even have the motivation to make the time to make a proper meal plan (before people come at me for not making proper meals I worked full time and was in school so I honestly didn’t have the energy to do it either and at the end of the day I still found him attractive and beautiful) All in all, after witnessing his beaten up demeanor and body just to go back and do it the very next day made the situation feel less worse. Anyway, he got kicked out of the military for weed being caught in his system on a piss test. It was a struggle for sure, especially since living in California is extremely expensive. After a couple months we were ultimately evicted despite our best efforts to stay afloat and I decided to do what was best not only for myself but for the both of us which is join the military. Ironic I know. It’s something I had been wanting to do for years but the idea of such a vast change scared me. However, despite our struggles it was the first time that he seemed truly free and hopeful. He even started shedding pounds getting to 280 after the first month and half and started to gain his self confidence back. So as of right now, while John is continuing to work his ass off 6 days a week in Georgia I’m in California staying with my amazing sister, brother in law, and niece while I work through the process of becoming an enlisted naval corpsman. I’m honestly extremely excited and proud of the both of us. And so hopeful for the future and what it holds. And most of all, despite everything I want to express that I love and see everything that John has changed within himself for the better not only for himself but for me.",
714,"Well, I don’t know what to do.
This is a tale as old as time—I like a good friend of mine. We’ve known each other for three years, since we were coworkers, and in that time I feel like we got really close.

Our store closed around 10pm, and I’d always offer her a ride home so she wouldn’t have to take the bus. During those drives, I really enjoyed our small conversations. As I got to know her more, I slowly started to like her.

She’s one of my closest friends, and I like her for who she is—kind, patient, and always there for me. Whenever I’ve had issues, she would just listen. Even if she didn’t fully understand what I was talking about, she’d still listen. And that meant a lot.

I’ve liked her for over a year now, but I never made a move because I was afraid of ruining our great friendship. And on the day I finally built up the courage to ask her out, I found out I was too late—she has a partner.

What really kills me is that I wish I’d had the cojones to ask her out sometime over the past year. I think I would’ve been fine with the rejection—it’s the what if that’s eating away at me, like that scene with the Green Goblin mask in Spider-Man.

I hate this sense of dread that looms over me. Some days I’m fine, going about life like normal. Other days it hits harder. So I thought, why not vent to random strangers on the internet about feelings for someone who, unfortunately, doesn’t feel the same.

P.S.: Sorry if this post was a word salad. It’s my first time posting here and just really to get this off my chest. Appreciate anyone who comes by this post and just reads it!

I am 34 F and he is 33 M
Married for 7 years - long distance 

We have known each other since we were kids.
Families have known each other since we come from the same community / religion. 
I moved to NA in 2009
He moved to the EU around 2012
We start dating in 2012 while he was in EU and I was in NA. 
Our relation has always been a long distance. 
I come from a very conservative family. 
I don’t think I saw the red flags in him back in the day…

During the dating period he would always joke about things and make me laugh which I thought was a great quality in man. 
Things seemed pretty “normal” in our long distance. 
Now when I look back to our chats, he has only talked about sex, nudes and everything in between. 
All his texts seem only about sexting, asking for nudes.
I always thought this was just a guy thing and of course since it was a long distance relationship, we’ve done everything under the umbrella to maintain the sex life and spice things up. 
 he only asked for nudes or wanted me to dress up and send photos  and every time I’d refuse, he would disappear for a like a day and then come back to texting again. 
We got married in 2018, but it seems like he does not respect women. We are still in a LDR 

He tends to make comments on everything and make it vulgar. Like for example, if I talk about some show I am watching on tv and mention some actor is good looking, his next comment will “rub one out” 
Over the years he has gifted me several sex related kinky gifts 
-Got me a dildo and wanted me make a video 
-while being on a video call with him he wanted me to watch porn and rub myself, and he wanted to watch that
-every time he calls he just wants me to dress up in lingerie and send photos
-even the clothes that he gifts me are slutty lingerie

Even after getting married in 2018 we haven’t really lived together. 
His behaviour seems like he does not respect women at all. 
He does have a sister - same age as mine but their relation does not seem to be good. 
He does mock her every time he’ll see her. 
I have a younger brother but I am 100% certain my brother wouldn’t ever do that! 

He has meet a couple of my female friends and he calls them “item” or “dolls” for some reason because he thinks they are hot looking 

His behaviour with elder women in his family has been really good like he respects them and is very nice to everyone but when it comes to me, his wife or any other women around his age group, I don’t think he thinks beyond his dick. 

When he found out that I was pregnant his first words were “I need to fuck you because I have never had fucked with a pregnant woman” 
The pregnancy turned out to be ectopic and had to be terminated. It was stressful time for me but his solution was just “rub one out” 

For a lot of incidents / situations his response has been“cum & pass out” 

All of this has had a very negative impact on the marriage,plus the long distance didn’t help. 
Families got heavily involved and I told his parents that he really needs help bc this behaviour is not normal - to this, his mother, my MIL says that “he is only coming to you asking for nudes. He is not going anywhere else for this” - I was in a shock when she said that! 

Eventually I filed for separation but every time I try and make progress with the separation he will send some gifts / flowers - is that gaslighting? 

Reflecting on this whole relation, I do not recall having any serious meaningful conversations with him. Not online nor in person. 

Even when he calls now, he makes a jokes of how there is long line of women waiting for him 
What is wrong with him!!??

I work in HR/Finance and he is in the academia industry. I have been working since before we start dating but over the years, he seems to have only mocked my job and what I do for a living. 
Not to forget that he is very stingy but I always thought it was because he was living as a student in the EU. 

Is his behaviour normal? 
Is it normal for a guy just ask for nudes and talk about sex 24x7? 
Are guys just wired to only talk about sex? 

I feel like he does not have any empathy towards any situation.

716,"Throwaway for privacy reasons.

First some background.

I (22M) have been raising my little brother (17M) for the last 3 years. Our parents passed away in a car accident and we don't have any extended family living close-by so to prevent my brother from getting into foster care, I became his legal guardian. I was 19 at the time, he was 14, I honestly had no idea what I was getting myself into. I just couldn't give up on him like that.

I was still living at home when our parents passed away. We weren't poor, but definitely weren't rich either. The inheritance wasn't much after funeral expenses. There was no way I could afford the rent on the house we were living, so we had to find a new place. I was able to get a 1 bedroom appartment to live in. I let my brother have the bedroom so he had a space to do homework. I have been sleeping on the couch since. (It's not as bad as it sounds.) My brother had a hard time adjusting to it all, but I think he did a great job. He always puts in effort in school. Helps with chores etc. Though at the back of my mind there's always been that voice doubting whether I'm doing enough to help him. 

Financially it's been difficult. It's been challenging to make ends meet every month. I'm currently working 2 jobs and earn some extra by doing yardwork for people through Craigslist. All that basically burned my social life. I don't have any friends anymore, very little time for hobbies. It makes me feel quite lonely at times, maybe even miserable. I'm just glad that I've been able to survive all these years without any debt.

I'm ashamed to admit that I've thought about giving up on raising him myself and reaching out to CPS multiple times. There were moments where I thought that I couldn't give him what he needed to become a good man.

Things are getting better.
My brother graduated high school last week. He's a really smart kid, he has good grades and he works hard. He's a huge nerd (I say that as someone who's a proud big brother😅), he wants to become an engineer. 

Over the past year I've been helping him look for options to get an engineering degree. We found a community college that's affordable and offers a good path for him to find his dream job. In the meanwhile he's found a job as an apprentice car mechanic. He's starting next week and he'll be doing that to earn money while in college. I'm super proud of him for taking the initiative to find work.

I honestly couldn't be happier right now. There's finally some light at the end of the tunnel, some stability, some breathing room. For both me and my brother. 
I've always wanted to join the Marines, but had to put that off when our parents passed away. I'm going to the nearest recruiting office tomorrow. 

I can't describe how it feels to finally be able to persue my dream after such a long time. I don't resent my brother for it. He cannot do anything about it. But I have to admit, I'm relieved.

717,"Last night, I had a dream.

In the dream, I was traveling alone, but I couldn’t remember where I was going. At some point, I visited my grandfather’s house and saw many relatives. It felt just like when I left to study abroad in the UK years ago—one by one, I said goodbye.  

After the goodbyes, I put my suitcase in my uncle’s car. He was supposed to drive me to another place. But as soon as I got in, I realized I forgot my backpack. I didn’t have a key to my house, so I called my sister, but she and my mom had already taken a train somewhere and couldn’t come back. 

Then I called my dad. Luckily, he was near our shop, sitting at a McDonald’s. So my uncle drove me there. When I saw my dad, he was calmly reading a book. He looked peaceful—different from how I remembered him. I quickly took the key from him, thinking I’d come back later to say a proper goodbye. I got back into the car, and not long after that… I woke up. 

That’s when I remembered: my dad passed away nine months ago. What I thought was just another step in my journey… turned out to be the very last time I saw him.

We always think we’ll have another chance. Another visit. Another goodbye. But sometimes, that one moment—no matter how ordinary—is the last.",
718,"I (22F) recently started working a co-op position at a company that I had previously been a co-op at. Within these first few days, I can’t help but feel like I fell below everyone’s expectations. 

The company liked me enough at my past co-op to hire me back without any additional recruiting whatsoever, so I already feel this pressure to prove that they made the right decision with re-hiring me. However, my past position is completely different from my current one, and I do not understand what I’m learning about at all. 

I’ve never been good at math, and this new position is quite literally just financial analysis. I barely understand how to use the basics of Excel, and now I’m presented with large spreadsheets that are so intimidating that I don’t even know where to start. I feel like all the questions that I ask are so stupid and don’t seem to actually be questions they expected anyone to have. It doesn’t help that the other co-op student that’s in the same role as me seems to understand everything perfectly, whereas I’m struggling to even comprehend the purpose behind everything that we do. I know that It’ll get easier as I become accustomed to the work, but I just can’t help but feel dread every day I have work.",

720,"TW: brief talks of Homophobia, parental death and lying.

So I’ve been a lurker on reddit for a-few years now, I never really comment or interact or anything but I just like to read posts and stories and sometimes find similarities within these posts to my own life experiences and sometimes find it helps me feel not so alone about somethings that I can’t talk to the people in my life about just yet.

Today there was a post that I resonated with to a point where I gave advice and commented and felt quite passionately about it. The post was about dealing with a homophobic family member and as I’m NB I have dealt with a-bit of that myself. 

Now it turned out that the post was fake and just a karma-farmer (I think that’s the right term sorry if I’m wrong!) and I know I’m quite naive always assume the best in people but I just don’t understand why someone would lie about that. 

Like I get lying for clout about something’s I guess, but lying about something as serious as being thrown out of a home and belittled and threatened just because you want to be who you are and love who you want (within appropriate boundaries and reason of course) just feels too far and I don’t just don’t understand how some people can do that. 

The worst part is that the other lie they seemed to have told was around a dead parent which is horrible and also hits way too close to home as I lost my own mother coming on 5 years ago for goodness sake. 

I just don’t understand how people can lie about such things knowing that they can be real experiences that actually happen and do affect people. 

Sorry if this is a-bit of a ramble and if doesn’t make much sense and I know I come off as a-bit stupid and naive and I guess I am very fortunate for that in ways, but I just don’t understand how people can lie about such things for just a-few moments of recognition. But I also guess people could easily say the same about me in this situation, call it a lie and clout chasing and people are in their right to make that assumption, I’m not above that at all. But I just really don’t get it and I just find it upsetting. 

Thank you for reading and sorry for the ramblings I just needed to get the thoughts out of my brain, I would love to know other people’s thoughts as-well and am very open to criticism, it helps us grow :) ",
721,"Posting this on a throwaway to try to keep this anonymous, this is all very fresh and I haven't been able to sleep so I guess this is an exercise in catharsis. It's a messy situation so I'm sorry if it feels like filler, but I promise it all provides relevant context.

To set the stage, I (M) have a friend we'll call Pam (F). We dated a while ago and it didn't work out. Not the cleanest break up, but we eventually reconciled add started to talk and hang out more often. You'd probably call this a situationship, we would hook up sometimes and other times just hang and we were both each other's best friends.

I got an opportunity to move into a new place, which is great since my rent will be a lot cheaper. The problem was that there's a month gap between the end of my old lease and when I could move into the new place. Pam has a nice spacious place to herself and we're obviously close and comfortable with each other, so I asked her if I could crash for the time being and she said yes. An insanely huge favor and I don't know what I would have done otherwise. 

I'm also in between jobs, I got laid off a month before my lease ended and the job hunting has been rough, to where I'm now taking literally anything that pays enough to cover rent and chip away at my credit cards. Basically I'm flat broke, and counting on cash from odd jobs and selling things I don't need. She was aware of that and was helping me out with food and such with my promise that I'd pay her back, but apparently not fully aware which I'll get to in a sec. 

We knew going into this it'd be an awkward situation, given our history and all. We share and communicate what's going on normally and we can be pretty frank with each other talking about other people that we're seeing. She's got another guy she does the same with we'll call John. Never bothered me before even when she's told me some of the more intimate details. She hung out with him at his place a few times while I'm staying here, no problem by me she's free to keep living her own life. I was starting to feel down from the job hunt, being broke and having nothing to do though. 

Now to the part where the train starts to derail. We were just hanging out in bed talking about sex stuff and I said I wished we were more compatible in that sense, since there's some angles that we can't do without me hurting her. She said her other guy's dick feels better, but I can be more fun I guess. I already knew that he wasn't dealt a short hand and I knew she wasn't being malicious, but fuck that one hurt. I said something along the lines of chill out there then we went to bed. So now I've got nothing to do besides spam my resume out and try to line up interviews, and this comment was still stinging.

The other morning we're talking about money stuff, she didn't realize how broke I was and I hadn't been clear enough about my situation. I was keeping these thoughts to myself since I don't want to be a wet blanket and I've got no right to complain given everything she's doing for me. She could tell I was upset though and eventually I just laid it out with how down I was with my situation, being a drain and feeling such, and then told her how that comment was messing with me and this whole situationship deal we've got going on. She said was afraid of this happening, and said she just wasn't going to sleep with anyone to not stir things up. I said I'll sleep on the couch and she went off to go to an appointment. Came back later and we hashed some more out, then she went out with her friends to the bar like she had been planning to that day. I stayed home because even though we had this uneasy tension now, I'm broke so I didn't want to drink any way 

She didn't come back and I figured she stayed at her friend's and wanted space to think. Well she doesn't get home till the afternoon, and it turns out it's because someone took advantage of her while she was wasted. I'm sure someone else might think she's making some cover story for a hook up but I've known her long enough to know that she can be a mess when alcohol and emotions get caught up, and I can see that she's genuinely hurting. I made sure she's alright, asked her what she wanted to do about it and didn't press her on it any more. She left to go spend time outside the house and now I'm here, unable to sleep at 3 am.

I know I'm not responsible for her actions that got her into that spot, or for the fact that a piece of shit creep is out there, but I can't stop thinking about how that would have never happened if I hadn't dumped my emotions that morning, or if I had just landed a job or had some cash I wouldn't have been wound up here in the first place. I had already made her own house uncomfortable for her and now I'm sure she wants to avoid it a much as possible so she doesn't have to think about that night. 

I can't stop blaming myself and I know that's not doing any good. The only actions I have now are to help her when she asks for it, GTFOing asap so she can have her own home again, and finding that guy laying into him which would probably just get me in a jail cell so I'll scrap that. Honestly considering sleeping in my car or just moving back in with my parents in another state. I never in a million years could have predicted hurting and losing my best friend when asking for this favor. Not even going to post this to AITAH because yeah, I am the asshole",
722,"That’s the post .. I didn’t listen. We got married, I moved with him and less than a month later; annulment.

Just like the last post I likely won’t respond much. I’m truly crushed. ",
723,"I recently got a baby and I'm currently on leave. My spouse is in between jobs and is also at home all the time. Last week he had to go to some conference for some days and I was alone with the baby. He'd leave at 10am and come back around 5pm. During that week, I cleaned the house almost daily, did baby's laundry also almost on a daily basis. He had promised to help with our laundry but it sat undone from when he woke up to the time he left so I did it immediately he left the house. He does the cooking and I do all other duties. 

Now, the annoying part is, when we were dating, I was looking for a person who would be willing to help with household chores. Even if we aren't doing 50/50 then it'd be something like 70/30. But I wish I just went for a person who wouldn't be willing to share the chores at all. That way, I wouldn't be expecting any help. 

On one of the days, I called to check on when he'd be home and he heard the baby crying. He said he'd be home soon but still took a considerable time to get home. I wished he hadn't said that he'd be coming to help because it became difficult to care for the baby because I was exhausted and I was expecting help. He did finally come home and held the baby gor some few minutes and suddenly he didn't feel well. So now, I'm exhausted, I have to take care of the baby, and take care of him too. When does it stop? I asked for two days off and he said he'd step up, but then he added that after the two days, he'd also need two days off to relax for helping. So it'd be a cycle where I get to days off but then do everything when he's enjoying his days off. I can't get help because as I said, he's in between jobs and we don't have money to hire extra help. 

I was wondering why I'm resentful until I came across a post here in reddit, where a person was asking how single parents survived and in the comments, someone had said that it's easier for single parents to survive since they don't have the load brought about by the spouse. 

I mean, if I were a single parent, I wouldn't have to do the laundry of two adults, it'd be just mine. I'll be cooking and  I won't have to clean after a whole adult. Yes, he does cook, but everytime he cooks I have to clean the stove because he leaves bits of food on it and it's almost unusable. 

He needs to watch a show, I'll be left to do all the childcare and any other house chore while he's closed off with earpods so even if the baby wakes up and cries, he won't hear her. Needs to take a nap, he'll just leave the baby with me and take his nap. Night feedings? I do them all because if he wakes up to feed the baby, he'll have a hard time falling back asleep. Have I tried asking for help? Yes, but the problem is, he'll do it begrudgingly. So if he cleaned the house, I'll still have to clean it again because he only cleaned some parts and left other parts.

I mean, if I were single, I wouldn't be expecting help and honestly it would make it easier for me. That way, I won't become resentful. I'll plan my time around the baby's schedule without having the load of an extra adult. Cooking won't be hard as I'll clean while I cook. I won't have to clean after him. 

There I said it, I wanted to get it off my chest that sometimes women have this mental load that they carry around while having all these chores to finish . I'm still expected to be a happy wife and I'm hoping getting this off my chest, will be helpful. So there, I said it, I am a single mother who is married.

724,"Life has changed more than I ever imagined — in the best, most unexpected ways. First, I want to say a heartfelt thank you to everyone who offered kind words and support on my last post. Your encouragement truly kept me going during some overwhelming moments.

After a lot of soul-searching, I made the decision to move. My ex kindly picked me up around 3am and took me to the airport so I could begin this new chapter. I left a note for my parents — and let’s just say, it didn’t go down quietly. The calls and texts came flooding in, and for a while it felt like everything had exploded. But now, things have started to settle, and got a lot of I miss you and apologies , I’m grateful for the peace that’s slowly finding its way back in.

Adjusting hasn’t been easy. I work long hours, Monday through Sunday, and it can be lonely — I haven’t made any close friends yet, and at times it feels like I get picked on in my department. But even with all that, I don’t regret this move for a second.

There’s something magical about being here. I get to watch incredible events unfold, see guests arrive in glamorous gala outfits, and I’ve even started forming real connections with some of them — a few have surprised me with kind gifts that truly touched me. It’s those small moments that remind me why I took this leap.

I’ve gained so much clarity about what I want for my future. It’s still a work in progress, but for the first time in a long time, I feel hopeful. I’m slowly finding my place, and I truly believe that with time, I’ll build meaningful friendships — even outside my department.

Here’s to growth, grit, and the good that’s still to come",
725,"Lately I’ve been exploring something that feels very personal and freeing – playing bass guitar while naked. It started as a private way to relax and feel in tune with my body, but I noticed how the mix of music and nudity opens up something emotional, sensual, even playful.
I’m wondering – how do women generally feel about nudity that's not overtly sexual, but more expressive, creative or intimate?
Could something like this be seen as attractive or just... weird?

No pressure – just curious to hear honest thoughts. Thanks!",

727,"Back in 2016, I was a virgin in college, fresh off a breakup and mentally spiraling. I found myself in a Catholic environment, surrounded by people who were religious by title but often lacking in compassion or emotional maturity. That context matters—because what happened next confused me for years.

I got involved with someone I wasn’t attracted to. We weren’t compatible emotionally or physically, but I was in a rough place and made a bad call. We made plans to be intimate in her room, even though her roommates were home and it was against house rules. As soon as we started, I felt it in my body—I couldn’t stay aroused. Everything felt wrong. So I stopped.

She got upset. Not verbally, but physically. She stood in front of the door, wouldn’t let me leave. Started blaming me for “taking her virginity,” saying I was a “pretender” and a coward. I was trying to get dressed while calming her down, all while thinking about the fact that I wasn’t supposed to be there. I’m a Black man in a white Catholic house. I knew the danger of escalation. So I played it cool and talked my way out.

Later that night, I cried in the shower. Thought it was guilt. Thought maybe I led her on. Thought maybe I was just weak. Two years later she told me she needed therapy to “get over what I did.” That’s when someone else named it: I had been sexually assaulted.

Even now I remember every detail. The sound of the stairs. The baking show that was playing. Her expression. My silence.

And here’s the thing—I never fully processed it. I just stuffed it down. Moved on. And I think that moment trained me to ignore my voice, suppress my boundaries, and keep the peace even when it costs me.

Fast forward to my marriage. The same patterns started happening. Emotional manipulation. Gaslighting. Silence or blame when I brought up being hurt. The inability to say “I’m sorry” without flipping the script. I found myself carrying everything—emotionally, mentally, physically—and still being told I wasn’t enough. And a part of me believed it. My marriage is a hell that I wake up every day praying to escape. 

Now I’m finally naming it.

What happened to me was not my fault.
How I’ve been treated is not love.
And the shame I’ve been carrying doesn’t belong to me.

If you’ve ever frozen when you wanted to run…
If you’ve ever talked yourself down to stay safe…
If you’ve ever been blamed for pain you didn’t cause…

You’re not weak. You’re not crazy. You’re not broken.

728,"Im a 17 yr old female

I have been exposed to sexual content at a young age. My father always searched “sex movies” on YouTube and it was on a shared account. I was like 8 years old and whenever friends came over and we wanted to watch YouTube, i was scared that it would stand there again. I was ashamed Everytime I thought my friends saw it.

Also I often saw my dad on those sites where he can talk to naked women. It also happened before that he was on such a site and me and my friend just came walking into the door and there is a big chance she saw it.

My mom and dad are divorced but my mom once told me yeahh he used to just jerk off next to me while I was sleeping. She told me this when I was 15. She never should’ve told me this tho. And I kinda felt a bit grossed out and didn’t know what to say. It felt like she was expecting an answer tho.

I also often see gmails on my dads phone with such sites where he can talk to woman. With naked ppl. And I just kind of feel weird bc it’s as if he doesn’t care that I see it but I never wanted to see it. For me it is “normal” now bc that’s all I’ve known.

I think this did affect me because around the age of 10 I already tried masturbating even tho I didn’t feel anything and I did it more times a week without feeling the feelings ur supposed to get while masturbating. Simply because I was not ready yet.",
729,"Mi mejor amigo me ""estafó"" y me siento horrible/My bestfriend ""scam"" me, and now i feel horrible.

Para hacerla corta, tengo un amigo que conozco desde octavo básico (ahora tengo 22 años). Hemos compartido miles de momentos, tanto buenos como malos, y siempre hemos estado el uno para el otro.

Hace un tiempo empecé a consumir marihuana ocasionalmente y, al enterarme de que este amigo había empezado a cultivar para vender y ganar un dinero extra, pensé: “¿Por qué no comprarle a él mejor, en vez de a alguien que no conozco?”. Así que le pedí que me vendiera unos 3 gramos, que me duran fácilmente 2 o 3 meses. Él me dijo que sí, que me los dejaba a 20 lucas con yapa.

Negociando, llegamos a 19 mil por 3.5g de magnum. Me pareció caro, pero no me importó tanto porque el dinero iba a parar a mi amigo, y eso me hacía sentir mejor con la compra.

La cosa es que hoy, más por curiosidad que otra cosa, pesé lo que me vendió y resultó que eran solo 3.1g. Sé que puede parecer una tontera —sobre todo considerando que estamos hablando de marihuana, y que tampoco me arruina 19 lucas porque trabajo—, pero me dejó muy mal.

No por la plata, sino porque siento que tratándose de una amistad de tantos años, este tipo de cosas no deberían pasar. Sé que podría simplemente dejarlo pasar, pero la verdad es que me sentí decepcionado. Me da pena pensar que después de 8 años de amistad, incluso las cosas pequeñas puedan poner en duda la confianza.

No sé si hablar con él o dejarlo ir. Me da miedo que por algo tan ""mínimo"" se genere un conflicto innecesario, pero también siento que si no lo digo, me va a seguir molestando por dentro así que por eso me vengo a desahogar aquí.

Me duele en el alma la verdad esta situación porque me doy cuenta que no le importo yo, ni mi tiempo, ni la plata que me gano trabajando.

To keep it short, I’ve had a friend since 8th grade (I'm 22 now). We've been through so many highs and lows together, always there for each other no matter what.

Recently, I started using weed occasionally, and I found out this friend started growing his own plants to make a bit of extra money. So I thought, “Why not buy from him instead of some random dealer?” I asked if he could sell me around 3 grams — it usually lasts me 2 or 3 months. He said yes and offered it for 20k with a little extra.

After some negotiating, we agreed on 19k for 3.5 grams of magnum. It felt a bit pricey, but I didn’t mind too much since the money was going to my friend.

Thing is, earlier tonight — around 10 PM — I got curious and weighed it. It came out to just 3.1g. I know it might seem like a dumb thing to be upset about — especially when it’s about weed, and I’m not exactly broke — but it made me feel really bad.

Not because of the money, but because I thought something like this wouldn’t happen with a friend I’ve trusted for 8 years. I know I could just let it go, but the truth is I feel disappointed. It’s sad to think that even little things like this can make you question trust in a long friendship.

I don’t know whether I should bring it up or just let it go. I’m afraid that saying something might cause unnecessary drama over something “small,” but if I stay quiet, I know it’s going to keep bothering me, so thats why im here.",
730,"She was the most irresponsible person i knew when it came to money. We were at the shop and she wanted to buy an eyelash curler, i told her ""no, you already have one"" and her reason why she wanted to buy it was because she didnt have a pink one. Another time i tried giving her advice on how to save up money and i told her she needs to learn how to use money responsibily and she took that as me being mad at her and then she became upset at me even tho i was giving her advice. Last year there was a claw machine put in our town, she wasted all of her money on plushies that are probably gonna end up shoved into a box and forgotten. I kept on telling her to stop wasting money but she wouldn't listen. One time i told her how i really liked fluffy pillowcases and she grabbed one from the shelf and went to pay, i had to stop her and convince her i could buy it on my own. Not to mention that she wasted so much money on makeup products that her mom had to ban her from buying anything for a while. One time she got a bunch of money on may day, around 10k Serbian dinar which i read is around 95 us dollars, she spent it in a few weeks, all of it on junk. I had enough and asked her ""What will you do when you desperately need money but have none because you wasted it all on junk?"" And the only thing she did was shrug it off and tell me ""I dont know."" And of course she continued wasting it like always. I swear if she ends up on the streets in the future due to being so irresponsible i will not give a single buck to her, ill let her suffer the consequences of her own actions that i warned her about a hundred times.

731,"(The title is how I personally feel about the situation, I wish I would think differently about it but I really can’t.)

This is a throwaway account as I don’t want to share this on my main lol.

I am 16F and my absolute best friend is 20F. She is amazing and I will not break contact with her no matter what anyone tells me. Anyways- We went out to a gay bar in stockholm as we are both bisexual and we feel really safe in this bar. As I am 16 i had never been to a real bar or club before and I wasn’t even allowed to go in as it’s 18+ but I snuck in anyways. Me and my best friend had a really good time, we were dancing and having so much fun. It was really a moment I will cherish forever. About 22:00 I stood in the line to get a beer as this girl in her mid twenties approaches me and starts just flirting with me right off the bat. As I said this bar is 18 plus (as any other bar is in sweden) so of course I didn’t tell her my real age as I was too scared to get kicked out. This is the part where the whole thing become my fault. I started flirting back. I guess this is the reason why minors aren’t allowed in bars, because we do stupid shit like this. It’s also so stupid AS I HAVE A BOYFRIEND. But I guess I thought by flirting maybe i could get a free drink from her.. Now i realise that just happens in books and movies, but my intoxicated mind thought it could happen to me aswell. Of course, I never got a free drink. But I was too far in flirting with her so I couldn’t really tell her the truth. She was flirting with me all night, and i vaguely reciprocated her flirting as I was too afriad to do anything else. My best friend was getting drunker by the minute so she blurted out that I was in a relationship and I immediately shut her down and tried to explain that I was DATING a guy. I really wish i would’ve just told the truth but I was too far deep and really drunk aswell. A little bit later we were dancing together and we had a great time. Until this girl that had been flirting with me pulled me in and kissed me. I pulled away as fast as i could shaking my head trying to signal that I did not want to kiss her again, but i think she might have not noticed or i guess didn’t care as she pulled me in even harder and kissed me again. I pulled away even harder and told her that i had to go. I basically ran to gather my stuff and leave. I also feel so bad for leaving my best friend there, especially when she was absolute shitfaced. But I was so uncomfortable with the situation i just had to go home. My boyfriend was waiting for me at home and I told him everything whilst crying my eyes out and he understood and forgave me for flirting with her but also told me it was not my fault. I still really do think that if i just were honest from the start this wouldn’t have happened, and I blame myself for it. Because it really is my fault as i reciprocated the flirting. 
I just really needed to get this off my chest lol as whenever i’ve told anyone they’ve laughed it was because it was another girl and stuff.

732,"Sometimes I wonder why I can't be like everyone else.
I try to connect with people, but it always feels off — like I'm watching life through glass.
I spend a lot of time alone, and while it feels peaceful… it's also kind of empty.

I get these moments, usually triggered by a film, a line of dialogue, or even a sound — where I suddenly understand something deeply, something I can’t explain in words.

And it frustrates me.
Because I want to share it. I want someone to get it.
But it’s like those realizations live in a place that only visits me sometimes, not somewhere I can control.

I’ve tried many things — hobbies, talking to people, writing — but nothing really clicks.
And honestly, I don't even know what I’m good at.

Have any of you felt like this before? Like you're drifting, always on the edge of something meaningful but never quite reaching it?

733,"April 23rd 2025, I found my self saying those 3 fateful words to a girl I had only started talking to 2 weeks prior, “I love you”. In that moment i felt my heart flutter, look for a place to go, to figure out what just happened. Before it could decipher, 5 words came from her mouth, words that made me feel like the man on the moon, “I love you too, handsome”. That was the day we became official, the day that I had thought I won everything there was to win. I made sure everybody I knew know how happy I was, how happy I was to find and start dating a girl that I truly think is everything I wanted. She has eyes that resemble cracks in the universe, waiting to be explored, enticing me to stare for those extra few seconds before going in for our first kiss. That first kiss was when I knew I would never get over her. Her lips came to mine, everything prior to this became null in my mind, she was to be my everything. When we pulled back, there were those same gorgeous eyes staring back up at me, a window into a complex work of art I got to call my girlfriend. 4 seconds later was the second kiss, hands still on her waist, this time with more passion than words could picture. I do not smile often, but god damn were my teeth on display for all that day. Watching her leave wasn’t sad that day, I just thought about the next years to come looking into those same eyes and how excited I was. The pain and stress that weighed so heavily on me just weeks prior were gone, she was my beautiful antidepressant. Days passed, nothing changed, I still felt the same looking into her eyes, I still had her face engraved into the back of my eyelids. May 10th 2025, the day I believe sparked the end. To give a little backstory, I’m a high school sophomore while she’s a senior, this date happened to be prom. Now understand that I’m not rich by any means, in fact, I’ve rarely had more than $100 to my name. Unfortunately that also means that prom for me as a non-senior was out of the picture completely, now I wasn’t 100% upset, we still had plans afterwards for her to come to my house and stay the night with me, so I was content. At 8:27pm I received a text, a screenshot of her aunt letting her know that this wasn’t to happen anymore, after hours of perfecting my room to make sure she wouldn’t have an allergic reaction because of my cat, the one thing I was looking forward to was gone, so is life. It didn’t completely break my spirit, I was upset yes, but not torn apart. I wanted to make it up to her, I went and bought her favorite drinks. I asked if she would ask her ride home to come by where I was so I could give them to her, unfortunately it wasn’t possible, that wouldn’t stop me. See, when I love somebody, I’m willing to put in a foolish amount of effort just to see a smile. At 10:14pm got on my board and skated 35 minutes to her house, leaving the drinks in the mailbox after realizing that she wouldn’t be home in time for me to hand them to her. I believe this was my fatal mistake, possibly I showed to be too attached maybe. After falling asleep on the phone as we did all nights, I woke up to a different girl than before. A girl that gave one word responses. A girl that didn’t reciprocate energy. A girl that started taking longer to respond. 10:03pm I asked a simple question, “Why are you taking so long to respond”. “My fault” was the answer. “Are you alright?” was the next 3 words to come from me, “Idk” being the response. The notification I received for the next text broke me. “Idk how I feel about us”, was the next thing I saw on my screen. To summarize the conversation that ensued, I was told that she felt she was holding me back on account of her poor family situation and inability to be with me in person as much as I’d like. After that, was her speaking on the pace of the relationship, I did agree with her on that. I knew this was all too quick and i said that. I told her though, I don’t want the poor start to our relationship affect what we have and can have in the future. I offered to try and change the whole dynamic even, restart from earlier. Then was the bombshell. I’ll copy and paste the exact text I received from her here.

[i dont know what the fuck i want. im weird and complicated and frankly. i want my fucking ex back and thats the problem. i cant get over him and i dont want to fuck you up for it. i dont know. its norhing you do. its nothing you can change. its me. i know its me. trust me. its me.] 

That destroyed me. After being told I made her feel different than he did, that I made her feel happier and better in every way, I just wasn’t enough to get her mind off of him. Then was another text that completely changed everything. I’ll paste this text too. 

[its not you. its not him. its me. im looking for excuses. i dont want a relationship. i dont want to worry about fucking you up and not living up to someones standards right now. im really sorry.]
  
At least she didn’t lie to me. I’m not mad at her, I know exactly what it’s like to feel you cant live up to what someone wants or needs. The problem is that what she thinks I want is different from what I really want. She thinks I want a girlfriend that can always have fun and do cool stuff and be super affectionate 100% of the time. In all reality, I just want her and what she’s capable of. All of that shit means nothing to me if it isn’t the girl I want, if it isn’t her. She’s everything I ever wanted in a girl, down to the last little details. Here’s what really made me think. I’ve never been a man to chase so hard after a woman, but her, I did something I never do. I told her i would 100% welcome her back with open arms if she wanted to get back together, she even said it’s a possibility earlier in the conversation. I told her exactly this “I still care about you and I’ll still be here if you want to make things work again. I promise, if you ever ask, I’ll be here and i’ll be the same man you were with before.”. For the first time in my life I “left the door open” for a woman. I mean it wholeheartedly too. I don’t care if people think it wouldn’t work, that a relationship where you broke up once before can’t turn out well, if she sends that text, I will do exactly as I said. I lay here in my bed typing this, wondering how my next few weeks will go. I pray she doesn’t end up getting written off in my life as “the one that got away”. I just want her back. I want to feel those soft lips one more time. I want to feel her kisses on my neck one more time. I want to gaze into her eyes one more time. I just want her back.",
734,"I love my kids to death and they love me. They're adults with their own lives, but we get together when we can and we talk often. 

This is another Mother's Day where I haven't heard from them. I think it's because their father never prioritized it when they were growing up, so they don't really think about it, or how sad I am when it happens. 

I'm not the kind of mom who guilt trips, either, so they won't know.

735,"So my dad worked his ass off for his family his whole life. We would struggle sometimes not even having to eat but this man always had a plan he always did the impossible...

Last 2 months i got a job and my brother started working not to long ago too so we were finally paying back loans and being able to do stuff that we couldn't before.

He was so happy the last 2 months. He would go and buff stupid stuff that we didnt need but he liked them. He was finally stress free...i even was saving up to buy him a new car because his car of 30 years was not doing it anymore. We finally had a lot of plans that we could complete....

One day he woke up and said he can't breathe properly. Went to the hospital where the doctors werent so nice and took them a while to do anything. They said he needs to stay in the hospital for regular check ups and that he is feeling better. He said that i should go home and eat so i did because he looked pretty good. 

2 hours later i go to bring him food and i find out that he died. A blood cloth or how every the fuck you spell it went to his lungs killing him.

Just like that on a random ass friday with no preparation for his death he was gone.

A man who finally was free of the struggle being able to enjoy life died in a couple of hours....

How the fuck is life fair?

I can't cry, i can't remember his face or voice... Idk what to do",
736,"There is so much talk about how alcohol is bad for you and how much better life is without it. I really enjoy drinking. I like being outside with friends and having a drink. I like having nice wine with a good dinner. I like making dinner with my wife and having a drink.

I also really enjoy life with out alcohol. I sleep better when I don’t have a drink. I like doing all the things mentioned above with out having a drink. I like playing with my kids and driving them to places which I would never do after having drinks.

I have an amazing life and generally feel that the grass is way greener on my side. That being said I will occasionally get frustrated with things as I’m sure everyone does. This weekend I got into a fight with my wife. I very very rarely get into fights with her. Yesterday night I decided to have a few drinks. My wife and I got into a big argument and I said things I wouldn’t have said if I didn’t have drinks. This morning we discussed everything and are better now than we were before.

I guess I just wanted to write this because alcohol isn’t all bad. Enjoy it in moderation and allow it to enhance you life rather than ruin it.",
737,"My best friend of 50 years is dying. Her health has rapidly declined and it looks like she doesn’t have much time left. But the worst part is, I feel like I’ve been cut out of her life in her final days—and I’m grieving that just as much.

I was very involved with her for most of this past year. I’ve taken care of her house, her plants, I’ve visited and texted regularly, I’ve supported her the best I could through treatments and appointments. We’ve always had the kind of friendship where we just knew each other’s hearts. I’ve loved her like a sister.

But something shifted when her husband started stepping in more. He has always treated me with subtle jabs and dismissiveness, and now it seems like he has taken over completely. He sends out group updates, talks about her like a project he’s managing, and I barely get responses from her anymore. I don’t even know if she sees my texts. I don’t get updates anymore. I’ve been pushed to the outskirts. People closer to her geographically are now the “inner circle,” and I’ve been quietly shut out.

The pain of this is indescribable. I don’t even know if she knows how I feel or if she’s too sick to care. And I hate how that even sounds. I feel selfish for hurting, but I also feel abandoned and deeply sad. It’s like I’m grieving her loss before she’s gone—except the version I lost isn’t just her, but our connection, our history, the trust we had.

I don’t know how to process this. I’ve been told to just accept it, but I need to be real somewhere. I’m not trying to stir drama or blame anyone, but this grief is eating me alive. How do you grieve a friendship that’s ending before the person is even gone? And how do you sit with the guilt of still being mad, still hurting, when someone you love is dying?

I told him in January or February that I was legitimately considering divorce because I've run out of ideas of how to fix our life together. 

It started with me being absolutely fucking done with his irresponsible spending. He's over budget every damn month by like $1,100. Meanwhile I do things for free or don't do anything at all when I've hit my budget. 

That snowballed into a bunch of other issues with communication, who he hangs out with, my insecurities over that, and how much he contributes to the house. 

The communication was improving massively and along with it my insecurities were waning so I thought things were getting better, but he's still over budget. Spent his entire budget in the first 7 days of the month. I thought he'd understood after our conversation about it that he had to buckle down and not spend any more this month. Then this morning, I woke up to a notification that he paid $1,100 to a friend to cover a debt he'd owed and was paying down slowly. 

He said it was because he was afraid of losing his friendship. He doesn't even realize, despite how clear I have been month over month that he's losing his wife instead. ",
739,"ETA: I can’t fix the title but I meant to put *his sleep lol. Also sorry for formatting, on mobile.

I have finally found a boyfriend that is compassionate, silly and really cares about my well being. Like honestly, I have been through the trenches with men and it has been such a relief to finally find someone who just gets me and really cares about me. 

He also talks in his sleep a lot lol and tonight he made me laugh so hard and also make me feel like he really does care. 

I had come to bed after working late. The plan was that I go eat something, put the laundry in the dryer and come to bed. When I came back, he was mumbling to me and I asked him “what is it?” because I kept hearing “don’t forget, don’t forget”. After I asked him what, I really expected him to say “to put the laundry in the dyer” but no! He said “don’t forget to use the SEASONING FLAKES on the table” lmaoooo, I have never heard him say this phrase in my life. Then upon further inquiry, (I said for what?) and he replied, “for your food babe, I just want to make sure you always have delicious food” 😭

740,"This is a throwaway. I'm not a native English speaker, and I'm just writing with the flow so apologies in advance. 

I always believed in striving to be the person the society needs, not the person society wants. What I mean by this is if I had to develop certain qualities, it should be the qualities that the society is generally lacking. For example, I think the society lacks a bit of empathy these days, so I try to be a more empathetic person. I think there are a lot of greedy people, so I try not to be greedy. I think there's a lot of hateful ideas, so I try to be more loving. And so on. 

I also do not want to be an active contributor to the pre-existing problem in our society. For example, the place I live in has issues with traffic. So, I do not wish to purchase a car and exacerbate the problem myself, and I take public transit for work, travel etc. 

I genuinely believe this should be the mode of life for everyone who is aware of such pre-existing problems in our society. I am also aware that a lot of people are simply overburdened by just how the things seem to be these days and simply cannot afford to give much thought into their beliefs. So, I do not preach these beliefs to other people. I am in no place to teach others on these matters (although I do actually teach for a living lol)

Here's the offmychest part. This way of life has caused me problems in friendship, romantic interest, and family. 

I have this particular group of friends whom I've known for more than a decade. This particular friend in the group doesn't really share my values or beliefs, but again it's not for me to judge. But he decided to take on an illegal gambling business because his original restaurant business was too difficult for him to manage. This is where I believe he has crossed the line, so I confronted him. Unfortunately, the other friends in the group weren't so supportive. So I had to leave. 

My romantic interest raised an issue of how I don't live in the city where she lives. But the centralization and overpopulation of the place is one of the biggest social problems in my country. She also raised an issue that if it were going to be a long-distance relationship, I should get a car. I've stated my reasons as to why I'm not getting a car. We broke off amicably. 

I do not earn a lot of money. I teach for a living. I could very well be charging extra because I have a degree from a prestigious university.   But I don't believe in that. I believe students should have opportunities to get lessons regardless of their parents' financial situation. If I were to raise my rates, some of my students definitely won't be able to continue with my lessons. I cannot accept that. And this causes trouble with my parents, because they think I am ""wasting potential,"" which is what my romantic interest also said. 

All of these - bar family issue - happened in a span of past few months or so. I lost some of my very good friends, I lost my romantic interest, and my feud with my parents is still ongoing with no end in sight. 

Just to be clear, I still have other friends who are very supportive and sympathetic. My romantic interest still motivated me to become a better person and I'm very grateful still. She is a wonderful person. My parents love me, and I'm sure they are doing this out of their heart. It's just that my core principles, values and beliefs seem to be very different from the norm, and frankly I feel a bit lost. 

But thank you if you've read this far, I just had to vent somewhere. Have a wonderful day.",

My first thought was that I was hallucinating, then I thought someone outside the house was hurt. I checked outside the window and saw nothing. then it clicked. my brother fucking his girlfriend while i was in the room next to him.

I ended up knocking on his door and telling them that I could hear them and that they should know not to have sex with someone while someone is literally in the next room over.

743,"In 2023, I had the symptoms of breast cancer in the left tit. I had to really fight for the oncology referral despite an an aggressive history on both sides including recurrence and mastectomy, as well as coming from an area where cancer rates are just higher because it’s physically that toxic. 

And while people online - and thank goodness for them - responded with love and support, almost no one irl save my mother and brother and a single friend said ANYTHING. I’m waiting on a biopsy for this one but it’s visibly bigger, the pain knocks the wind out of me when it happens (it’s like a sharp laceration against my boob and literally stops me in my tracks), and I’m starting to be tired and not interested in food. Oncology doesn’t have how serious it is but they’ve told me I should probably prepare mentally for a lumpectomy.

I’m 37 with an 8 year old. I have a shit immune system that showed how shit it was when I got Covid. I wasn’t responsive for three weeks after getting it. And as a result of long term low oxygen, I also had a stroke. So both surgery and chemo are inherently more dangerous. But this hospital specializes in oncology and cardiology so I’m probably safest with the lumpectomy anyway. 

My 8 year old was the one to find me unresponsive from Covid and people didn’t support her while I was unconscious. I was the first person to tell her it wasn’t her fault even if she got it first. I had to relearn to read and write after the stroke because of fluent aphasia, and while there wasn’t an available speech therapist for 15 months, I have a collegiate background in neurolinguistics. I asked for help from those professors before I couldn’t. 

And I’m just so fucking disappointed. I wish my health would give me a break. I also wish someone would just fucking emoji react to the message instead of … nothing. ",
744,"It’s 5:42 AM and I’m already running late.

The retreat center, where I’ve been living and licking my wounds, is over an hour away from where my ex and our son live. So I have to leave before my mother starts the sacred morning coffee service at 7:30. (Non-negotiable. The woman runs a tight spiritual kitchen.)

We’ve been working out a new co-parenting rhythm. When she first asked me to start picking him up at 6:30 AM, I thought it was ridiculous. A subtle form of punishment wrapped in early wake-ups and existential dread.

But I was wrong.

It’s not punishment. It’s a gift.

If I time it right, I get there before he wakes up. I sit by his crib and just listen to him breathe. Sometimes he stirs and sees me, half-asleep, and smiles. Sometimes he lifts his arms so I’ll pick him up and he can fall back asleep in my arms.

Those mornings—those few quiet, unfiltered moments—are saving me.

The mornings don’t last long enough. And I hate daycare drop-offs. I’m not here to argue with anyone about childcare, but for my son, it just feels too early. Too soon to be in systems and schedules when what he really needs is presence and peace.

And the truth is, it’s my fault he’s there.

He’s in daycare because I made selfish choices. Because I stayed in a failing business instead of staying home. Because I avoided hard conversations. Because I didn’t protect the life we were trying to build.

Now I wake up at 5 AM not because I’m a guru, but because I’m a man trying to earn back something sacred.

Thanks for letting me get that off my chest.

I just really need to take this away from my chest.

Short story, i left social media platforms when i was 19, somewhere between 2016-2017, i was depressed and kinda just wanted to take time off of everything. And back them internet was pretty normal (at least the common popular content wasn't that harmful), but them, at the fine age of 26 i decided to go back now and downloaded Facebook, Twitter and Instagram just to see how things were going. I was curious, even if i always tried to stay updated trough Youtube (that is also now 50% garbage the search bar is almost useless). My shock was how majority of the content now is AI (artificial intelligence) and people believe in it like an absolute truth, full of fake profiles, disgraceful hateful comments and misogyny everywhere?????? Violent videos of people in accidents exposed without even an warning????? What the F is going on???????? The worst is that people are so desensitized that they just take it as a joke??????? When did it become normal to be an absolute trash of an human being without a working mind? I downloaded Facebook and didn't not even add any friends but my feed is already full of conservative posts and videos degrading women for free???? People being mean to strangers on the streets just for the sake of getting a few seconds of fame??? How did humanity became this brainwashed and lame? It's just laziness and narcissism at this point, so many adds everywhere and bots let alone the massive religious cult like craziness.

750,"This is a long one but it's the only way that I can get all the information out there. Names are fake 


Two years ago, my husband, Steven, and I, Ayana, invited our friends to move in with us. Their names are Brandon and Laura, and they were married at the time.

Their relationship was rocky from the beginning, but Steven and I believed that it was just due to financial struggles. We had hoped that by having them move in with us, we could help relieve some of the tension.

Fast forward a year and a few months, Laura and I had become very close friends. We watched shows, played video games, and drank/smoked together. Laura, Steven, and I also had a sort of playful, flirty friendship where we would jokingly flirt with each other. Steven was friends with both of them before I even met Steven, so overall, things were pretty good.

However, at this point, Brandon had begun to discuss wanting to have group sex with Laura because he enjoyed having her have sex with other people. He had mentioned it to me personally a few times, saying things like, ""I miss having group sex with her"" and ""I wish I could find someone to do this with her again."" I didn't really think anything of it until one day I got out of the shower, and Steven told me that Brandon had asked him if Steven and I would want to have group sex with him and Laura. We were obviously taken aback and took some time to think things over. We agreed that it could be fun, but we would obviously have to talk to Laura before making any final decisions. She agreed that it could be fun, and we started to discuss rules and boundaries.


Well, after a couple of talks, Brandon said that he had no interest in Steven. Going so far as to repeatedly tell Steven that he wasn’t attracted to him and had absolutely no interest in physically being with Steven. I felt that, since we were being honest, I should tell Brandon that I wasn't really into this because I wanted to have sex or be in some sort of relationship with him. I am the type of person who needs a strong emotional attachment to someone in order to frequently have sex or even a semi-romantic relationship with someone. Steven and I were seeking a fun experience that we could share together. Brandon did not handle it well at all. He got very upset and said that he felt rejected by me and that it wasn't fair to him because that meant that Laura was the only person who was even benefiting from this.

Let me be clear, none of us had discussed us being in relationships. This was purely supposed to be occasional group sex. Despite this, both Laura and Brandon were acting like we were all working towards dating, but in different ways. Laura started kissing on both Steven and I without Brandon around and kept trying to force me to interact with Brandon one-on-one. Even though she knows that I have been taken advantage of by men and get very anxious with anyone who isn’t Steven, Brandon kept complaining that I wasn't into him and kept trying to ""bridge the gap.""

Things very quickly went downhill at this point. I don't want to go into depth on this part as most of it is not my story to tell. Things between Laura, Steven, and I continued happening despite Brandon and I not wanting things to happen that way. Brandon started trying to sabotage the group sex, flipping between needing it to happen immediately and making up lies about what Laura was into to Steven and I. He was telling us stuff that would have put her in danger in an attempt to break Laura’s trust in us. She ended up divorcing him, and it was messy, confusing, and a miserable experience for everyone involved.


I know Steven, Laura, and I are the assholes for this next bit. Brandon continued to live with us for the next few weeks, and it was miserable for everyone. While he was still here, Steven, Laura, and I had initially discussed that we would not be moving forward with any sex or relationship stuff that had been previously discussed. That lasted about a week before we decided ""fuck it."" The three of us started messing around and having sex while being very insistent to Brandon that we were not doing any of that. It felt both gross and exciting, but it was just sex, nothing more.

From here forward is where I'm unsure if I am the asshole or not.

Because I had stated that I was not comfortable being in a poly relationship and exploring sex with multiple people at the same time, Steven and Laura both agreed to this, saying they didn't want to push me or make me uncomfortable. At least that's what I thought. After this discussion it very quickly became Laura telling us that she didn't want to be a unicorn and demanded that we all had to be in a relationship now. Every time I tried to discuss what that looked like for each of us, Laura told me that she didn't want to put a label on it; she just didn't want to be a unicorn.

She decided that the only way it would be fair for everyone is if we shared a bedroom, turned the now extra room into a closet, and forced me to switch where I sleep on the bed with her every other day.

I had slept next to my husband every night for 7 years at this point. But now, not only did I have to not sleep next to him every other night, but I had to immediately get over the fact that my husband and I are sleeping next to someone that wasn’t each other.

It wasn't just the sleeping arrangements either. When we went out, it felt like I had to fight her for Steven's attention. If he and I were play fighting, she had to push her way in and make it about her. If I stood or sat too close to him, she would get upset and find some way to get Steven to move so he was sitting/standing next to her. She started to demand alone time with him, saying that I couldn't be in the room or even on the same couch as them. Because she and I had organic alone time (watching shows together while Steven watched wrestling), and she and Steven did not. Not for any malicious reasons, Steven is retired and he and I had decided that I didn't need to work if I didn't want to.


Up to this next point, we had all agreed that there would be no one-on-one interaction between Steven/Laura or me/Laura.

We had agreed that Steven and I could continue having our relationship as it had been. I would like to explicitly state, she agreed that it would be okay. And despite us discussing that we needed to focus on the group stuff before incorporating one-on-one stuff, she continually found ways to ignore this. Grabbing Steven's crotch while they were grocery shopping, trying to grope me when we were alone, and other things. I stated multiple times that I was still struggling and needed her to understand that it was all very overwhelming for me. It had only been a few weeks into this when my mental health started to take a deep dive.

One night, on her night to be in the middle of the bed, she tried to be intimate with Steven while I was ""sleeping"" on Laura's chest. Steven repeatedly pulled away before completely shutting her down. I was devastated and pretended to wake up and left the room, choosing to take my stuff to the living room. I spent the rest of the night crying and throwing up. The next morning, she was smiling like nothing had happened, going with Steven to the store to get me meds, powerade, and crackers. Everywhere he went, she was two steps behind, and it was halfway through the day before I finally had the chance to talk to Steven. He apologized for not putting his foot down sooner and not having a chance to speak to me about it first. We were able to talk it out and move forward.

But when it came to talking to her about it, she brushed me off, told me she was just fidgeting, said it was unfair that I was turning her into a unicorn, and told me that she already had to sacrifice her time with Steven that morning because I was sick. That was also when she decided to demand that Steven and I no longer have sex together unless she was there.

After this, she started calling off or coming home early because it was causing her anxiety that we were home together all the time and she couldn't be. Steven and I couldn't spend our 7-year anniversary together because there was another fight about her feeling outcast and a unicorn (despite Steven and I not having any intimacy without her).

About a month went by of this back and forth of fighting. Me trying to have an actual conversation with her about how she just kept brushing off how I felt because her feelings were more important. So I started to pull away from her and stopped hanging out with her alone.

We all went to a convention, got a hotel room, and we brought my husband's son with us. Which meant that Steven would be sleeping in the bed with him, and Laura and I shared a bed. ((It should also be stated that the switching of the bed spots was still happening at this point, even after she broke a massive boundary. So I had been sleeping maybe 2 hours a night, when I finally was able to sleep, it was full of nightmares involving them.)) I was exhausted, an emotional wreck, and having to deal with 3 days of a crowded convention. Steven knows me and knows that I struggle with crowded places, so he tried his best to comfort me. Like clockwork, she got pissed that he was giving me attention. She even told him that he was being unfair to her by comforting me and trying to help me.

This was the final push that Steven and I needed to call things off. We were honest, saying that we were no longer romantically interested in her because of all of the drama. She told us that she had been feeling the same way and that I had ""hurt her worse than anyone had ever hurt her before.""

Now, 5 months later, she is still living with us and won't be moving out until August. It has been 5 months of petty ass bullshit, from a playlist she made to let us know when she is pissed at us, to posting vague ""fuck you"" posts on Facebook, to telling me she hates me because my husband cares about and takes care of me.

Hey Reddit,
Girl 20/F
Me 22/M
Sister 23/F
Cousin 27/M

I’ve been dating this girl for the past five months, and I’m planning to ask her to be my girlfriend and make things official. Things have been going well overall, but there’s something that’s been nagging at me for a while, and I’m not sure if I’m overthinking, misunderstanding the situation, or just being insecure.

About three months into dating, I met her family. They were super welcoming, and I even got invited on a family vacation. Naturally, I had my own room. One of her cousins came along too. During the trip, I noticed she was acting pretty distant and grumpy with me, but her attitude would completely change when she was around him. It got to the point where even her sister pointed out that I was being excluded. Honestly, it felt like they were closer than we were, almost like a couple (not exaggerating even locals pointed out how they made a cute couple).

Just to be clear—I wasn’t expecting her to be all over me or give me 24/7 attention. I was a guest and we weren’t even official yet. But I did expect some basic inclusion in conversations or more warmth, which didn’t really happen.

At the time, I shrugged it off. We weren’t exclusive, and I figured maybe she’s just really close with her cousin.

But even months later, it still lingers in the back of my mind. We’ve grown closer since then and things are generally good between us. However, during family gatherings, the dynamic still feels off. When we sit together, it’s always then the cousin, her, then me. She tends to lean toward him, leaving a gap between us, and most of her attention goes to him, like full-on conversations, inside jokes, and I’m mostly just sitting there unless someone else involves me.

When someone says something funny, she immediately turns to him, laughing and tapping his leg or hand. And I’ve noticed that when she sits next to me, she keeps her posture neutral, but when she’s near him, she’ll rest her arm on his armrest or vice versa. Sometimes their hands touch or rest against each other, and if anything like that happens between her and me, she pulls away quickly.

I’m not sure how to read this. Part of me feels crazy for even questioning it, but another part of me can’t help but feel uncomfortable. I haven’t brought it up to her yet. Am I overreacting or ignoring a potential red flag here?

Would appreciate any honest thoughts or advice.

752,"Lately, it’s felt like no matter how hard I try, life keeps pushing back harder. I’ve been doing everything I can to get back on my feet — reaching out to communities, trying to connect, asking for advice, looking for ways to change my situation.

But the silence is what really gets to me. I can handle rejection. I can handle a no. But the silence? It’s like I don’t even exist to the world. And that’s been weighing heavy on me.

Some days I feel like maybe I’m still doing the right thing by putting myself out there, by trying. Other days, I just feel foolish. Like no one is listening and I’m shouting into a void.

I don’t even know what I expect from posting this. I guess I just needed to let it out. If anyone else has ever felt this way… how did you keep going? How did you keep pushing forward when you felt invisible?

753,"Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/msNIbj08rc

For those who didn’t get to read it, my fiancé(28M) punched me (31F) at least twice (I am not sure if more because I think I may have blacked out) and I had to immediately be sent to my local ER and then transferred to a city hospital further away for emergency surgery. We have a two year old daughter together that was napping in her room as this unfolded in our home

I wanted to say thank you so much for all the kind words and support, I am doing a lot better and have been working nonstop to pick up the pieces of my life and make sure my daughter feels safe and secure in this horrible time period

I felt bad I didn’t get to respond to anyone but my left eye right now is of very limited use. I would like to elaborate more on what happened for those who were concerned and reaching out to send support to me

We were arguing over almost everything this particular morning while my daughter was asleep but it almost doesn’t even matter at this point. Arguments that would just segway into more arguments all morning. I was so tired and frustrated and not backing down. I had been up most the night and all morning so he could sleep and had to wake him up early before work to get insurance fixed for our daughter and the process was like pulling teeth

He resented me so much the more I actively wanted to fix our problems not only in our relationship but also as adults trying to stay functional. Everything from brushing his teeth, to constantly choosing watching porn instead of spending time with me and the baby, all the way to hanging up on her insurance directory, EVERYTHING was for me to rush in and fix him and I just didn’t want to anymore

I felt so constantly unseen. I buy him flowers or pick them myself while out on walks and make him bouquets all the time and he has never done it once. He spent more time in our relationship actively flirting with other females, some of them being my own friends, one being a 17 year old he met in a hentai server, instead of ever considering me or how I feel

I felt like I make everything beautiful around me but I was destroyed and miserable in the process. He started taking a more active role as a father after I found out he was watching porn for hours daily while I desperately needed help with colic newborn, and I had a severe mental break and spent my first Mother’s Day in a psych ward. He became incredibly thoughtful and active with our daughter from there on in, but paying attention to me was still always an afterthought

It came to the point it didn’t matter to me anymore and I think there was more resentment than love on both sides. One of the last things I said to him was I was refusing to walk away from the argument until he acknowledged how much I do and how little he contributes to bringing life into our small family. I was fuming at this point. He lost it immediately and screamed “Why don’t you just fucking leave already?” and began to break his desktop computer

When he grabbed the computer and ripped it out of from under the desk to break it, he either purposely or accidentally knocked me backwards into a wooden table in the process. I got up and shoved him back and we both began shoving each other. It was just a huge blur for me at these next few points but the shoving and hitting continued from both of us at this point. The fight moved by his office door into the living room and I fell backwards onto the couch right next to the door 

I thought it was just over at this point as I just flailed backwards but he raised his dominant hand up and punched me as hard as he could. I felt such an immediate heat and pain in my eye I have never felt before and my vision went black. I screamed so badly from the pain and before I could even process what happened he took that time to rewind his fist back and punch me again full force again. I was so terrified at this point and I knew I was feeling pain I had never felt before my entire life

I don’t remember much at this point and it felt like a third person experience. I remember being on my living room floor as he walked away and slammed his office door. I saw blood began gushing from my face and spewing into the hardwood floor but I was incredibly dizzy and still couldn’t figure out exactly what had happened to me. I heard him on the phone  with police at this point and I began shouting for help saying I can’t see and crying out in so much pain. He ignoredy pleas and stayed silent in his office for about another 10 minutes

I had to get up but I was so dizzy and I couldn’t see well at this point as blood was matted into my hair and dripping down to my neck and also from both my hands to my wrists. I was able to find my phone to call 911 and I told them I think he broke my nose because I couldn’t feel my face and didn’t realize the blood was actually coming from my eye socket

Police arrived while I was making the call and he had slammed his office door so hard prior he was locked in the office and couldn’t answer the door for police. I had find my way to the door while still losing a large amount of blood and I was very dizzy and blinded. When I opened the door the female officer started shouting and pulled me out immediately and called for EMS. He was arrested immediately and even laughed when he finally got his office door open, acting like it was so silly

My daughter thank God was asleep for this but had woken up only about a minute before police arrived. They wanted me to go check on her but I refused because I was absolutely drenched in blood. It was so much that police couldn’t tell where my injury was either. I let them check on her while I washed up and hid the left side of my face with a large jacket hood so I didn’t scare her.

My orbital bone was completely shattered and I have been and out of consciousness before my emergency surgery. They let me take my daughter with me to the hospital and I gave up the exam bed for her to play and I mainly focused on trying to keep her happy and calm, but I was so terrified. I wanted to sign myself out because I didn’t have anyone to watch her for me, but they said they were certain I would be blind in my left eye soon if I left without getting help

My dad was able to show up and take my daughter for me and both hospitals were so extremely kind and helpful to me. They even gave my dad a brand new child car seat so he could take her to his house. When I had surgery the surgeon told my dad this was quite severe and I’m lucky to have my eyeball at all right now

There was a very large hole where he punched and I had bone fragments scattered across my face, into my cheek and nose, and also behind my eye socket. I still don’t know fully what they did to repair my orbital bone but I’m pretty sure they have to make a replicated part to repair the fracture since it was broken and smashed into pieces. The anesthesiologist asked if he shattered his knuckles during this and was surprised he didn’t

I will never go back. I am working with a DV advocacy group who is helping make sure my medical forensic exam but also the surgery information is showed to police and a judge so he will have multiple felony charges. My eye will probably still be functional but it’ll never be the same again 

I have been through so many emotions in this time period but I do feel a sense of peace knowing this is permanent and I can move on now. My daughter & I were granted a standard 6 month restraining order from him and I am ready to increase the timespan, and I wouldn’t be surprised if that happens

I am still doing what I do, bringing beauty to everything around me. It’s been raining and I brought my daughter outside with her raincoat & rainboots and we followed a busy bumblebee around for an hour together while splashing in puddles. I am in severe pain, yes, but I will not let this sad excuse of a person make my daughter miss a single stride in her life right now when she needs stability & joy the most

She is doing very well but I think she knows I’m injured. CPS has been alerted and I keep in touch with them to check in on us weekly so far. When she saw my face finally, she studied it briefly and brought her hand up to her eye and placed it there. My heart breaks for her more than it does for any physical pain I feel. I would lose both my eyes if it meant bringing her the safety and love into her life she needs more than ever right now

Sometimes at night I still feel the sadness creeping in but I have been keeping myself busy inbetween resting. I also just cannot forget how cruel so many of his actions were that day. He didn’t even tell the police I was injured. He saw blood spew from my eye and walked away from me. He deliberately wound his fist back an additional time to make sure I was deeply maimed by him

No matter how many ways I try to think about it, I cannot find a way to explain this one away in my head like I have many of his past blunders and warning signs. Two months ago he had his therapist remove his anger disorder from his mental health diagnosis. He broke hundreds of dollars of things in the past and would make verbal threats at me, with the most sincere anger in his eyes that really used to scare me a lot

He never cared. He cared that I was a convenience enough to keep around and only cared if I interrupted this easily accessible life convenience. I was a commodity to him and that’s why it was so easy for him to break my face like a child angry at a toy and walk away to leave me to bleed alone on the ground

I will never forget. This is the most dangerous and costly lesson I have ever experienced on how important it is to advocate for my own inner peace and learn to stand up for myself enough to leave when it was being disrupted, that I love myself; and that I have value that deserves to be reciprocated instead of neglected

I will never let it go this far ever again, and I love myself right now more than I ever have my entire life, and that he will never be able to take this away from me ever again

754,Main reason is because I developed a very bad porn addiction at the age of 9 now I'm 23 still dealing with this shit. Luckily the porn I usually watch is still pretty vanilla I dont have any crazy fetishes that I have to get off to but even watching vanilla stuff is still a problem I sexualize woman way too much and I hate it. When Im in public im staring at ass nonstop imagining how she'd look bouncing on my dick and its sad I know woman are more than sexual objects but my brain chemistry is screwed. Last time I had sex was fucking embarrassing. I didnt think PIED was real until it happened to me. Had a cute ass girl on top of me and my dick didnt wanna work. Luckily through sheer willpower I got an erection and managed to have sex for a little but that erection didnt last long and I know she was flaming me in her groupchat for my poor performance. My brain was so used to watching other people when I had to actually have sex it didnt feel as good as watching porn as fucked up as that sounds its true. On top of that I'm just addicted to my phone in general. Ive gotten better at doing stuff without my phone or listening to something but its hard. If any parent happen to read this whole thing please limit your child's screen time. No matter how mad they might get I fucking wish my screen time was limited as a kid. But I aint gonna let this stop me im gonna beat this addiction and get good with woman in bed. ,
755,"idk what the fuck to do with my life either i always wanted to work in a natural history museum but there's never any job opportunities I volunteerd at a museum and was bullied for being autistic treated like i was stupid.

I am 28 now, and it's kinda unbelievable. I still feel 16 mentally.

feel done with everything.

I lost my dad at 16 he was an alcoholic who drank himself to death and saw him slowly degrade and die. i carried his coffin.

my girlfriend for 11 years cheated on me left me for the other guy who was some online guy she met 11 years for what nothingthe love of my life.

 I met my best friend she's trans i helped her come out to her parents her wife and things started to look abit better in my life we became really close about 2 years ago turns out she's got diagnosed with cancer at the end of last year the kind there's no cure for and my auntie who I was very close too two weeks ago died of cancer her funeral is this Friday I'm carrying her coffin.

 I feel so empty, I can't cry anymore. I'm so broken I want to cry, but nothing comes out. It's just nothing. I'm broken.

 I don't know if I can carry my best friends coffin, she told me it's what she wants but I'm a shell, a husk an empty house filled with ghosts.

 i feel less human every day, I see horrible things and it unfazes me, thousands of people dying in wars horrible crimes being committed, governments falling apart, the universe feels like a bad joke and I'm the punchline.

 I know I'm not the one dying hell I would welcome it dying has to be better then this shit I don't know how to make my life better I don't know how to find purpose for now my purpose is to look after my best friend till she's gone then idk.

more suffering and pain not just of getting old of losing more and more of the people I love until it's just me a weird autistic old man staring at the shadows in my mind   a zombie living just for the sake of living.

 i barely eat or even look after myself properly. I see no need. I have no one to impress, no one who cares or who wants to know.

 I don't want to drop my feelings on a dying woman I could always talk to her but I feel like if I dropped this on her it would do nothing but make her worry and cry I want her last days to be happy.

 so I smile and act happy silly, making her laugh looking after her house and pets, I do this through all my doubts and self-hatred.

I do this because I am here, no other reason I am alive, I breathe, and i feel the world breathe with me. i see, and the world paints its masterpiece, I sleep, and the world keeps spinning, 

We suffer because without suffering, life has no meaning, and alas, I know that what I believe at least is that when we are gone, the ones we leave behind will miss us.

Thank you for reading my rambling.",
756,"The title says it all. I'm incompetent, I'm stupid, I'm a slow learner and no matter how much time I invest into something, I'll always be worse than others. I know that it's not a good practice to compare yourself to others, but it's just a fact that I'm most likely below average in terms of intelligence. I've never been truly good at anything, and I don't think I want to be good at anything at this point. I don't even see the point when it will be forgotten one day anyways, even if I somehow managed to achieve anything. I know that it also doesn't matter that I'm posting this to a bunch of strangers, but since I've tried everything ranging from therapies, to new hobbies to antidepressants, to hotlines, I'm hoping that this post will at the very least make my last moments on this planet less painful.

757,"So two of my male friends came over these two of my friends who I know are very provocative but I was for sure I wasn't gonna do anything with them because I had already regret it giving one of my male friends head, and then the next day my other male friend came and the same thing happened and then we had a situation where he come over and we would kiss and I would give him a head so I already felt very ashamed I feel like if I continue on this path will I ever get married like how do I tell somebody this is how I lost my virginity and would they see me the same Like I'm super terrified I swear I don't mess with all my male friends.

758,"So growing up, my parents weren’t the best. Things were very abusive. While they were less physical as I got older, it didn’t mean they wouldn’t stop the constant argument and yelling at me, along with my boatloads of younger siblings getting hurt, too, sadly. Things got worse when I left my religion, got a boyfriend who wasn’t part of the religion, and then moved out on my own once and for all.

I still visit rarely, but I feel like I’m only harming myself whenever I do, cause while the distance made my mom a lot nicer, dad is still just as cold to me since last fall. Because I feel at least a mild connection with her, I wanted to deliver a present for Mother’s Day today.

I scootered all the way across town (because I have no car) to deliver her present. Unfortunately, she wasn’t home, and when I greeted my dad instead, he said absolutely nothing as usual. This time, it hurt a whole lot more. I felt it in my gut, and I sort of expected it before I left, but it doesn’t get easier.

All I want is to cry in my mom’s arms rn, but I know the mom I want probably doesn’t exist.",
