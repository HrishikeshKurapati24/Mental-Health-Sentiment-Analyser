1,1,"I made another suicide attempt & I was institutionalized again. When discharged I thought I'd at least have my job to rely on. I never even got any messages from my boss. I had to contact *her* to ask if I could go back & her response was, ""I don't have a position available now,"" that's it. She only knew what happened because a co-worker of mine told her, but I thought my boss would actually talk to me personally.

I've been replaced by a student who's doing my job for *free*, so I guess I'm fucking useless. It's illegal what she's done to me & my unemployment application will hear everything. This is just another thing that's causing me to be suicidal."
2,1,"So this may be tmi, but I was friends with my bf for years before we started dating and he had always expressed his interest in Latina women. Recently, while drinking, he told me that when he watches Latina ….you know he watches only exclusively Latinas. I am white, very pale and white… not Latina. It bothered me for weeks until this morning I walked in on him doing it when he didn’t know I was home. Then I fully, finally, flipped out. I was being a bit mad and aggressive and ignoring him which maybe wasn’t the best, but I was very hurt. I don’t care ab watching it but I care his preference does not look anything like me. I already am extremely insecure, I have a rare skin disease that traumatized me and took over my face and no longer look how did, I’ve also been SEVERELY cheated on so this brought back those icky intense feelings of comparing myself to women and feeling like I want to crawl out of my skin. I haven’t been able to stop crying all day. I am so tired of feeling like I have to compare myself and am not good enough. And as much as I know about of this is my own insecurities triggered, I tried to then rationally explain to my bf that I know he didn’t do this to intentionally hurt me but I need him to understand where I’m coming from and that this is extremely hurtful to me because I don’t look like that and never will and never can and that I’m already so insecure. And he said he didn’t do anything wrong, and it’s hard to have empathy cause he didn’t doing anything wrong. So then he said I’m putting all my insecurities on him and that he never should have said anything because all it did was cause problems and that the proof he does love like me and that isn’t his preference is that he’s with me. But I’ve had people act completely in love with me and still leave me for other women, so in all honesty, us being together doesn’t make it obvious he likes me. He could be with me for a countless amount of reasons. He is saying he feels sorry for me but is having a hard time being empathetic because I am always making him out to be the villain etc because I said I just wanted empathy and understanding. He is saying I’m invalidating him because he’s dating me and why isn’t it enough he’s dating me. I now know this is going to eat me alive and honestly am having second thoughts about continuing the relationship because I am already so insecure and I don’t know how I’m supposed to forget this. I will feel always paranoid that he’s watching it instead of wanting to be with me and that he wants someone else or will cheat this is just another thing to worry about. He said it’s clearly not his preference if he’s with me, but it clearly is his preference if that’s all he watches. And I already have a bad relationship with sex and online content and being a woman having to compare themselves constantly. I just feel so awful and gross about myself and so depressed my bpd is completely flared and I don’t think it can be undone cause this is his preference. Idk what to do, honestly. "
3,2,"Ever since i was younger, i was obsessed with finding love and wanting a boyfriend. I got extremely attached to any guy who showed an ounce of affection towards me, and every guy i met, in the back of my mind i saw them potential partners. Most of my friends well, ex-friends stopped talking to me because they said i always talked about relationships and crushes and nothing else. In the moment i got heated and had an episode and blocked them and they blocked me too, but they are lowkey right. I just don’t know how to stop it. it’s like relationships and love are the only topics that swirl in my brain and i hate it. it just reminds me more of how “crazy” i am. and apparently people think the same way about me. I hate being self aware but am not able to fix it"
4,0,"so this is just for me but I heard in other posts that people with bpd are really good with connection and being empathetic with other people but with me I just can’t find myself actually feeling any sort of empathy towards anyone, maybe it’s just a me thing since I went through a lot and so my feelings are just dull but I was wondering if anyone else went through that experience too? "
5,1,"I know everyone on here can probably relate to feeling hated and worthless. Like every little thing that’s gone wrong is because you’re a horrible person, right? Lately, I’ve been feeling like maybe this is true for me. All my relationships have gone to shit, everyone has left me. I am in therapy and actively working on my issues but I feel like it’s not enough and people wouldn’t mind if I wasn’t here anymore. I feel so utterly alone in this world now. I don’t know what to do anymore other than end my life. Maybe people would be a little sad but then realise they don’t have to deal with me anymore. I just don’t know anymore, I’ve battled with this horrible illness my whole life and I’m SO tired now, I just want to go to sleep."
6,0,"But I know I can't. The people I pushed out won't come back and creating new friendships and relationships won't work either, so now I wanna to save myself. I want to shelter and hang on to every part of myself I grew to like. I want to feel safe with myself, I want to be free my my own expectations and others. I truly see that I'm the only one who can set me free"
7,1,Found out my bf is on tinder and is an active member. As far back as the 7th June. Matching and messaging people. There’s moments like this when I hate having bpd cus the pain is awful. I feel like whilst I was planning our future he was out there looking for hookups. I’m so broken hearted and disappointed in me. He let me down. Like everyone does. He’s no better than them. 
8,1,"Ever since I was a child, I felt as though I didn't belong or matter that much to anyone. I always felt like an afterthought or that I was always being forgotten. 
Another way I'd put it, is that I always feel like an outsider or spectator peering in, no matter how hard to try to be noticed or valued. "
9,3,I’ve never felt more alone. I’m on my period so it always exaggerates my BPD but I felt disrespected and it triggered an episode and I’m so overwhelmed with my emotions it’s literally crippled me over in pain.
10,2,"Basically the title, what do you do to prevent yourself from spiraling at the smallest things? 
How do you prevent yourself from getting jealous from your partner friendships? especially opposite sex ones (if you're straight) 
How do you prevent that anxiety when they get close with a new person ?

Especially if you partner is the social type, and they like to befriend everyone.

My partner is sick of me implying that he's not faithful or that he's doing things behind my back. So I'm trying not to talk about these feelings with him, because he's sensitive around the idea that I have doubts about his loyalty. I tried to explain many times that it's not personal and mainly because of my BPD. 
But he thinks it's still my responsibility to work on these feelings, so here I am reaching out to you guys 🙏
"
11,1,"Guys, does anyone else simply not want to work? I feel so entitled and shitty saying that but I have dream jobs and I’m not consistent. I get my bills paid but the thought of doing anything full time makes me want to hide. Is it a bpd symptom? How do I not feel so much shame and weakness based on this?"
12,2,"I know that this is unhinged but if it’s somewhere I feel safe to talk about it it’s here.

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for a couple months now and things have been going really good, he’s super affectionate and does what he can to help my feelings feel validated.

Usually we stay at my house but I’m at his apartment this week and he is obsessed with his cat and treats her like a princess.

Mind you, I love animals, I’ve cat sat for my friends and i know what it’s like to love an animal like a family member.

He’ll give her so much affection, calls her his love and his princess, if she wants to come on the bed he’ll tell me to move, or let me know that she’s mad at me cause she’s territorial. I feel like extreme jealously and it’s making me shut down. I did some digging and I don’t think this is super rare for people with BPD and CPTSD and am aware that this is just a trigger for something deeper probably from childhood and my self beliefs. I have therapy later this week but right now I’m in a spiral I can’t get out of.

I talked to him about it yesterday a bit and today he made a joke about it but realizes how it made me feel and apologized. He’s doing everything right but I can’t get rid of this jealous feeling and I feel so insane and stupid.

If anyone else has struggled with something similar, what helps? Or any thing to self soothe until i can dig deeper with my therapist?"
13,3,"I have been in therapy for half my life and I have come a long way in trying to have healthy conversations instead of arguments. 

Yet every single time I try to voice anything at all to my partner, IM the problem. I can say it in the calmest way, like tonight: “I’m not mad at you, I’m just frustrated that the plans changed from being one hour long to all night long.” 

Now all of the sudden he’s allowed to give me attitude and be cold towards me when I’m over here trying my best to regulate and stay calm and rational. I literally said nothing wrong until he continued to try to defend himself over nothing. He told me one thing, then did another, then acted like he never said the thing originally and couldn’t understand why I was frustrated. 

Why is it okay for him to be cold towards me and how am I supposed to just accept that when it feels so unfair? A huge trigger for my anxiety and anger is when things change unexpectedly. Instead of jumping to irrational outbursts, I chose to voice my feelings in a calm manner. 

And then I feel like I’m goaded into actually being a bitch because I get so frustrated I can’t contain it any more. I can only work so hard to regulate and if I’m not being met halfway then what can I even do?

I feel so trapped in my mind and body. I WANT to be constructive and adult about things, I don’t want to resort to anger and name calling, I want to treat my partner with respect even when I’m upset. 

But how am I always the problem even when I’m being calm and respectful? How is there never accountability for the fact that some of his actions triggered an emotional response? "
14,2,"This is just venting. My current almost FP (I’m not completely attached but I’m getting there) said he wanted to hang out today and then ghosted me and I don’t know if he’s fucking someone else, working, or what but not knowing is making me fucking spiral if he would just answer why he’s busy it would be so much better."
15,3,"Dx 5 years. I truly do feel mentally healthy when I live a life alone. No friends or relationship. I can just concentrate on my life. I usually avoid it all together. 

I recently stumbled into a relationship this past month. After years of feeling mentally okay, I just feel a switch of insanity. Trouble is that I really like the guy and want it to work. But it’s like I have a whole new brain when I’m in a relationship. I am already over analyzing every interaction, text, voice tone, breath. I’m doing little things to test him. I’m becoming completely enveloped by my feelings for him. But at the same time, when I feel like he’s off with me, I want to react. I want to cheat or get into an argument (I won’t do either). But that’s how I think. 

It’s only been a month so why does my brain feel the need to have such an extreme reaction? Am I only meant for mental health if I’m single? Any advice appreciated. "
16,1,"** first ever reddit post so please bare with me** 

I haven't been through any traumatic events or nothing happened to me so negative to cause this. This chaos. I simply am this way. 

I was 7 or 9 (can't remember specifically) and then slowly bt surely I became this dark kid that lost all color. I didn't want to smile and laugh, or felt cheerful like I used to. And I used to be such a happy child, Idk what's wrong with me.

I almost feel as if I was a different person before. Like that was the original soul, and then she went away and now it's me instead, a completely different being. 

So I don't know, could it be that I'm this way for no reason at all? I have dpdr as well, which sucks"
17,1,"Does anyone else feel this deep heartache at times? I woke up in the middle of the night after drinking and it just hit me badly. I’ve had this before even when totally sober but it’s just when I’m feeling down I get this horrible painful heartache that physically hurts and has me inexplicably sad. It’s this mourning feeling that I can’t control. It comes and goes, right now I don’t feel it as much but when I woke up it was so bad. It’s like my heart is crying. 

I haven’t been this upset in a long time. Usually relationship stuff or the past gets me emotional but now my job has screwed us over and has hurt our patients with understaffing. Like actually compromised patient safety usually I bitch about staffing but this was very bad. 

So I feel all parts of my life are coming apart at the seams. I am going to look for another job or a lateral transfer because I don’t ever want to be in that type of situation again. :( My job distracts me a lot from my feelings with my life atm but even that joy is taken away from me. "
18,2,"CW: no explicit story about abuse, but questions about the potentiality of it happening.

I have just recently joined dating apps for the first time trying to meet new people after putting a lot of work in myself (I am a woman in my 30s more used to meeting people in person).

It is very early on and have not been to any date yet, I am taking it easy. But I woke up in the middle of the night thinking, what if someone finds me?

I live in a very big city but have a very unique name that is easy to find online. My name is on my work website so it'd be easy to find where I work and where my office is. I live not too far away from work so someone could literally find me, follow me really easily.

Is this some form of mild psychosis? I logically know the chances of this happening are low but I still hid my profile and am just sitting with this feeling trying to explore it (I am glad I am not spiriling tbh). I have always said I don't meet the psychosis criteria of BPD (I am diagnosed) but I don't fully understand psychosis or its spectrum.

My friend told me that I shouldn't worry this much. I've had other female friends telling me such in other situations but they are usually confident women who come across as such. I look naive, probably relatively vulnerable for those who know how to look and anyone could be anything on a dating app. I was robbed/pickpocketed 5+ times when I was younger (none too traumatic or anything) and I know it has to do with how unconfident I looked.

For context, when I was a child my mum was always worried about rape and kidnapping because of some cases in my area. Both my sister and I have concluded this influenced us both dressing relatively ""masculine"" when we were teenagers. I now live alone and sometimes change my routines in small ways in case someone is observing. Again, nothing too disruptive for me. I see a lot of cases of abuse against women through work and of course in the world, so I feel my fears are somehow at least slightly justified. 

Any thoughts?"
19,3,"I'm confused only because I find my self complaining how lonely and friendless I am in past writings and always come back to I hate people and everyone and I wish I didnt have to talk to them and please them all the time to prove I'm a normal typical human that's fitting in or that I like being there in general or whatever.

basically my s/o's  best friend is staying over for like a week but my period starts the same day he's coming and the wedding is also on the same week. I was just praying that my period would start on the wedding day (Saturday) so I would have an excuse not to go. of corse though it'll just come early  (yesterday)so it'll be practically over by the time Saturday comes.  

it sounds weird but I was having a complete mental break down over these events for 3 weeks. I didn't want to go really bad. I'm in so much pain bro I just want to cry and sleep😃"
20,1,"My partner and I got into a verbal blowup and he said a LOT of things. We're both living with BPD. He started off telling me that he doesn't want to be with me anymore, that he didn't go to bed until 3 this morning because he didn't want to sleep next to me. All other kinds of stuff too. It was bad, I was bawling my eyes out so bad my stomach hurt. It felt like everything was ending. He crashed out SO hard on me and then he had the audacity, when I raised my voice just a little, to say to me ""If you EVER raise your voice at me again, we're gonna have problems."" I told him that's not how this works. He replies with ""That is how this works because I'M THE ONE WITH THE PROBLEMS"". It felt like SUCH a slap in the face. He's constantly telling me he wants to off himself because of me, how unhappy his is with me. How I never change and get better, and that I breadcrumb him and don't try. 

But then he stopped splitting. He admitted that it's him, that he thinks without him, I wouldn't have BPD. That the only reason he wants me to leave is so he stops emotionally ruining me. He said he's tryin to hard to not wreck my dreams with streaming because he's already ruined a good 98 percent of my dreams (lied to me from day 1 about wanting a kid with me and getting married), told me later on then baited me with ""if you can replicate the lost recipe of my grandma's cookies, I'll get you a ring."" I feel stupid. I hate that I fel so hard for him...we're about four years into being together. I don't know that anyone's ever gonna actually love me. I've been with abuser after abuser and been emotionally screwed up and screwed over. When do I get my happy? Where's the people that will love me? When can I have my family and have security and maybe even a ring on my finger because I want commitment and someone who won't run away from me when things get hard.

I can't leave, I have no money. I'm 31, I can't move back in with my parents. I feel like a complete and total failure. I'm so tired of moving. I want him, but I don't want how this feels. I just want someone to love me and protect me. I suck at working, I suck at homemaking. Even if I did try to date I don't bring anything to the table. I""m fuckin worthless."
21,1,"i am sisyphus, sitting at the bottom of the hill. i am letting the boulder rest against me, slowly crushing me. i cannot push it up again. i have nothing left inside of me to push with. i know i need to push, but i can’t move."
22,3,"Have no idea if its about my bpd but here it goes. I have to think about being a human all the time, like i have to think “i have to watch a show now” “i need a hobby now” “i have to be sad now” “i have to make a joke now” as in “what a normal person do right now?” And it’s so tiring.

 I don’t even know how to express this with words. But if i ever let myself be completely myself, im just some meat that doesn’t want to do anything neither speak nor eat"
23,3,"❌CW: suicide, self harm, and eating disorders❌

i'm a girl, almost 23 now. i'm undiagnosed but i've had a feeling for a while. my recent break up made me remember my past suspicions of me having bpd. and i feel like i've been getting worse. i'm becoming more destructive and hurting people i really care about. i don't want that anymore. i'm in therapy, but I've only been going for about 2 months. my therapist is still in school though. i know that no one here can actually diagnose me. and i'm sure i can talk to my therapist and come to a conclusion with her in time. but what's your thoughts? i listed my symptoms as well as some examples next to them. 

• i usually (but not always) have a favorite person: could be anyone, and i take on their personality and mannerisms even when they're not around. i don't always have a ""favorite person"" but when i do, i definitely lose myself.

• i have attachment, trust, and abandonment issues: this one is new, and could be because my ex has a very social life, he's very outgoing and friendly and none of my past boyfriends really had a social life or multiple hobbies. i was always so paranoid he would leave me despite him telling me how much he liked me. when we were together, everything felt fine. but as soon as he wasn't around me, i got a weird sinking feeling and was so paranoid he was cheating or planning on leaving me. 

• suicide attempts & history of self harm: i have attempted suicide in the past and i just attempted about 2 weeks ago. i'm not sure how much detail i can go into but lets just say i used to self harm with sharp objects. now, my eating disorder is coming back and i haven't been eating enough for the past month or two.

• angry outbursts and displacement of anger: i never physically take my anger out on people, except one time recently (threw a full high noon can at my friend in a drunken rage). but mainly just inanimate objects. last night my ex and i got in a fight when we were drunk, and i kicked my ex's apartment complex's lower glass window pane in the main entrance and shattered. i'm now having to pay for damages. it feels like my anger is getting worse and i'm so scared of it. 

• substance abuse: alcohol and nicotine. i'm a little better about drinking now. but i still get cravings occasionally. i don't drink every night anymore though. when i do drink, i still occasionally find myself losing control and drinking to a point where i'm not acting appropriate and causing issues. it's almost like my symptoms get worse from the alcohol. it makes me so much more reactive, emotional, and angry.

• been fired/quit so many jobs: history of lashing out at managers and coworkers and getting fired or just leaving a job a week or two in.

• can't keep/don't have close friends: i'm not super social, usually outgoing people approach me. i've had many friends but none stay close to me or in my life at all. most friends don't stay though.

• i engage in self sabotaging/impulsive behaviors: unprotected sex, drugs, spending all my money, unsafe driving, binge eating & starving myself.

• extremely unstable self image: i can never stick to a sport or hobby. i don't know what i like. i have no passion for a career but it's always changing even though i know i'm never really in to what i pick. probably also why i can never just be my own person, i have to act like other people that are close to me.

• black or white perception of other: this one really fucks with me. if someone does something i don't like, i'm not just upset with them, i question everything about them, remember other upsetting things they did in the past, and hate them for it. and vice versa. it's almost like i hyperfocus on the bad or good things and my head decides from there that they're either amazing or evil.

• unstable relationships: with everyone. my mom, past partners, siblings, in laws, friends, etc. the closer i am to someone though, the more explosive the fights get.

• other small notes: 
- i get upset or angry easily if something doesn't go as planned. 
- hard time finding peronal prefrences for fashion, decor, etc.
- extremely sensitive to anything and everything.
- love bombing, i specifically buy gifts in the beginning of a relationship (usually romantic) and as an apology for acting out.
- i sometimes feel like people are out to get me.
- my confidence often changes, some days i'll feel so attractive, and other days i feel like the ugliest person alive.
- mood swings, but sometimes i'm upset and try to cry but just can't? i can't tell if it's a lack of empathy, dehydration, or just me being actually crazy?

these could all be from something else. and i'm working with my therapist to get to the bottom of it. but any thoughts?"
24,2,"I was recently diagnosed with BPD and ED. I decided to tell my father about it. He's part of my family after all. My father replied that:

""Psychologists are deceivers.""; ""You can't be called thin at all and say that you don't eat enough.""; ""When a person harms himself, it's an idiot, not a BPD.""

I told him because I thought I could trust him. I thought people close to me should know what was happening to me. I hardly hoped for acceptance or understanding, but I certainly did not expect an insult. Maybe silent aggression, but not like that.

At the same time, he is ready to financially help pay for a psychologist, but I don't know... I don't understand what kind of reaction he expected from me after these words. As a result, I just dropped the call and am not responding to his messages right now.

UPD1: My dad is now texting me things like:
""I'll give you as much money as you need.""
""Sorry, I acted too emotionally.""
""I was wrong.""
""If you want to go to therapy, go ahead. I was just expressing my opinion.""

UPD2: Thank you all so much for your responses and support. It truly means a lot to me ♡
And if you've been through something similar — my heart goes out to you. We'll get through this!"
25,1,"I can’t stop. I wish I could share my feelings and thoughts with people I love but it scares the fuck out of me. What if they leave. What if they never talk to me again. I’m so used to holding everything in and when people confront me that I don’t communicate enough, internally I freak the fuck out. I’ve lost so many friends. Just cut off ties with my alcoholic father because I exploded on him. I’m scared. I hate myself most days. I hate the way my brain works. I hate how there is no cure for this. Is this what it’s going to be like forever? Constantly trying to distract myself with people and substances until I die? "
26,1,"So, I didn't know I had BPD until about 4ish year ago, and since then it's been a rocky road trying to manage it. I felt the usual shame, the feeling of being broken, crazy, unreasonable. I also found some peace in knowing WHY I am the way I am.. But last year, my mom passed away and it felt like.. a switch kind of flipped then. I don't feel much anymore and I used to be so explosive in every way. I don't get angry, the only thing that happens is a burst of something maybe hurting me (usually physical pain or the grief and heartbreak over losing her and others) and I'll start crying. 

I'm wondering if maybe even my mom was my FP in a way, I loved her more than anyone, she was the only one that could make me feel better during an emotional spiral. I'd never thought about it but it kind of makes sense now. I'm not sure how it truly feels to lose an FP to that extent. I've been heartbroken by another FP before, but I think actual loss is.. different. I'm not sure. All I know is that my emotions have changed so much that I don't know what I feel anymore, if anything most of the time."
27,0,"Asking people who have BPD and have had experienced having a FP, what's it like? I can't figure out if my attachment to certain people now/in the past is a favourite person thing or if I just have attachment issues. I'm not asking for peoples opinion on my situation, I'm asking for people's own experiences with previous situations involving having a favourite person and what it feels like, because I know it will be different for everyone."
28,1,"I'm so fucking tired of meeting people and having them tell me they really like me just to ghost me. I dont understand what I'm doing wrong. Every single person I meet leaves me. I don't want to let myself get my hopes up but I keep meeting these people who say ""wow i can't believe how cool you are, I can't believe how much I like you."" How could I not get my hopes up?? But then they leave for no reason and it hurts so much worse every time. I'm so tired. I don't want to do this anymore. "
29,1,"i genuinely feel so guilty that its been eating away at me for the past few weeks since the break up, it all started when my ex's mental health spiralled and i was taking care of him because his intrusive thoughts were becoming violent. it ended up snowballing and culmulated in a break up because i was so upset that he ignored 7 months of university just to sit around and game. at the same time, i tried my best to handle his own mental health issues while struggling with mine unmedicated. we ended up talking things through and getting back together briefly but by then i could tell that i was having an episode and needed to be left alone because i was getting back into my self harming habit that i'm really ashamed of relapsing from. he ended up secretly going through my phone and seeing my self harm stuff and then tried to initiate sex with me afterwards. i said no and the next day he brought what i did on my phone up and started scolding me telling me how betrayed he felt because of what i did. i then lost it and slapped him saying that if he knew the whole time i was trying to hurt myself why did he try to have sex with me, and he started yelling at me to go away. we still ended up having sex afterwards but we're broken up fully now and ive just spent the rest of the month dissociating. does it get better. i really feel like ending it. "
30,1,"for context: I had this trio in uni, a guy and another girl. The guy and I started to hangout more alone which eventually led to us both liking each other. Everything was peaches and daisies until he got scared and started to outwardly treat me like scum; ignoring my messages, saying I’m being too much, calling names, etc,. I was crashing out for a long time over this because i didn’t understand what had happened, i would ask the girl in our trio if she’d noticed anything weird with his behaviour and she denied it. Well well well, turns out i was right all along and this guy just got cold feet and decided he’d rather i distance myself from him rather than him just telling me what was going, BASIC COMMUNICATION. 

i felt pretty worthless and unlovable after all that and still do. He’d constantly make remarks about how I’m weird and that he doesn’t understand me, which i blamed my bpd for. We stopped being friends after that on my own terms but i was still crashing out because I didn’t feel like i got closure from the whole thing, mind you this was my first time liking someone like ever. I would confide in the girl who was a part of our trio about the whole thing, this went on for months and id always ask her if she got annoyed by constantly hearing about this. She said she didn’t and was happy to listen so i kept talking about it. The girl was still friends with him, I never expected her to stop being friends but overtime her neutrality started to feel like betrayal. She’d go out of her way to speak and hang out with him and it constantly gnawed away at me. I spoke to her about this before and she made it seem like i was doing too much and that she doesn’t understand how this could possibly annoy me. she had essentially victimised herself when i was trying to confide in her about how her actions were making me feel. I let this situation go as it didn’t go anywhere and decided to give her the benefit of the doubt because i loved her (STRIKE 1 IM AN IDIOT). But she kept doing it over and over again, i called her recently to talk about it and she had this nonchalant ‘idgaf’ attitude. so to put it simply: I stopped being friends with her due to her lack of care for me and now she’s gone and yapped her mouth about all the things i told her to HIM. 

idk how to get over this, it genuinely feels like im constantly losing. I do nothing and mind my business, feels like they’re getting away with hurting me. I try to confront the situation, feels like im not taken seriously and im just a pest. I also feel like im in the wrong somehow because they’re still friends and im the odd one out, statistically speaking 🤓 that means im the fkn issue BUT I GENUINELY HAVEN’T DONE ANYTHING TO EITHER OF THEM. it’s eating away at my soul and i see them everyday 💔"
31,2,"im no stranger to guilt but ever since i started meds and therapy i have been able to atleast control my reactions to emotions a bit better than before. but ive always been very explosive when it comes to rage and anger. can you guys share some of ur experiences with guilt and doing things to ur partner etc and never explaining or telling them the truth. yesterday i was really mad at my partner because he did the one thing i really cant stand which was when we are in an argument he likes to bring other ppl in and get attention in public. Its really embarrassing and i cant take it. i walked off, scratched his car a bit, took off this cat sticker on the car that we got together and threw 2 of his pictures that he gave me in the drain.

after the rush of anger went away i felt guilty and then offered to split to pay for the dent in his car that he kicked in (he kicked his car out of anger) he declined my offer. he still doesnt know abt the things i did before that.

i know this is awful and im working on it.. its been a while since i lost my composure like this. i know im capable of doing worse but im getting help. I just wanted to let this off my chest and mayb share someone elses experiences too. have u ever done stuff that u never came clean about and felt guilty of?"

I have a friend that I truly adore. But lately I felt them distant, dry answers, short conversations, cold looks. They have more friends and I avoid feeling obviously jealous, I don't tell them about it because I want them to be happy.

I tried not to overwhelm them but my bpd is very obvious and affect them in one way or another. I know they get tired of dealing with me, they appreciate me, but not as much as I do.

I know that my stability is not their responsibility, I simply can't help but feel that way. I'm in therapy, on medication, but it's not enough, I'm not ready yet to love or have healthy friendships I guess.

They recently asked me for some time. It's not personal, they said, but then again, I can't help but feel it's personal. I'm not upset that they replaced me; it stresses me out to feel like my last reason for living is gone.

**I don't know what to do to get them back or to accept the fact that the friendship that kept me afloat for years is over. I need advice to improve or make this feeling go away, please.**"
33,1,"I’m 29F, English is not my first language, sorry for any grammar mistakes, when I was a kid I was sexually abused by a family friend , one of the abuses was him doing oral sex to me , which caused a trauma for OS, first time a guy tried to do it to me (consensual) I cried , and everytime I would try to , doesn’t matter who , even with a partner that I was with for 4 years (it was a toxic relationship, all of my relationships were) I would feel uncomfortable. 

2 Years ago I started dating my fiance, a sweet man who has been supportive with my bpd and my sexual trauma, and has been helping me trying to overcome it, yesterday on our two years anniversary I had my first orgasm with oral sex , and it was the best gift I could receive , overcoming one of the traumas that contributed to me developing bpd with love and patience. 

We all deserve healthy love ❤️

34,2,"hi everyone, hope i can get some advice or support from your own experience🤍

short summary:

im a female, 26 and all my past relationships have always been very toxic where id always get hurt, it’s what ive grown up to be used to i never got love from my father growing up, and for the first time in my life im in a healthy relationship with a man who is so supportive and so loving with me (i can go on and on)  

but for some reason it just feels weird to me? feels like im always convincing myself i dont like him i keep self sabotaging my thoughts knowingly ill be more in love with him once he hurts me because i crave that chaos? feels like my whole life is on pause now and i can’t achieve anything anymore because all my life is dependent on this guy (maybe that’s being scared of commitment but he is so motivated on building a future for us and wants the best for me btw) 

please tell me im not the only one that felt like this.. idk i feel so alone in my thoughts "
35,3,"I urgently seek some more guidance from any of you about an issue I noticed I have but don’t want to have anymore. While away on a birthday trip and after I returned my good habits especially DBT related habits, have slacked badly and I need help on how to manage stuff next time so I stay on it but don’t keep myself from having fun. "
36,2,"Hi all, 

I saw a psychologist a while back that highly suspects I have BDP. He wanted to refer me to a psychiatrist but I never went through with it and stopped seeing the psychologist.

My symptoms get a lot worse when I’m in a relationship. I find myself looking for problems when everything is fine which makes my relationship unstable. It’s like I can’t stand the peace, quiet and love. I need chaos but that’s not truly what I want if that makes sense. 

I go on loops and obsess over things. Usually self image or my partners behaviour and although I get reassurance, I just bring the problem back. The reassurance will give me brief peace but then it’s all on again. And when i’m tired of that subject, I’ll bring another subject on and go on a loop with that one. 

So I wanted to come on here and ask if any of you have a now positive experience with BPD. How do you manage your symptoms ? What steps have you taken ? 

I am tired. "
37,3,"1. Ignored him on his birthday because he was spending time away from me, and I figured if I didn’t message him, I wouldn’t have to deal with the anxiety and fear of him not responding. I sent cake and presents through DoorDash to his place, then checked his Life360 (red flag number God knows what) and saw he wasn’t home, so I instantly assumed the worst and accused him of doing the unspeakable.

2. Told him I hope he dies after accusing him of cheating because his location was unfamiliar (he was literally at a pizza place…).

3. I make up any pathological lie I can think of if it means hurting him when I feel betrayed or afraid. He once made a joke about touching another woman — knowing how it would affect me — so I made up an entire story about how I was going to cheat on him with a completely fake person. At this point, it's kind of unspoken that anything I say regarding cheating can't be trusted, and he knows not to believe it no matter how convincing it sounds (I’ve even used TextNow accounts). It’s my twisted way of coping with feeling abandoned.

4. I’ll be totally normal for several hours, then switch in an instant over something small. He walks on eggshells constantly while there’s this voice in my head screaming at me to stop, telling me I’m insane, that it’s all in my head and he’s trying — and then I feel that voice fade and something else just takes over.

5. I self-sabotage every good thing I have with him. He’s patient. He stays. And then hours later I come back frantically trying to fix whatever I destroyed, begging him not to leave, realizing he’s the only one who actually sees me and believes I can improve — and if I lose him, I’ll be alone.

6. Random bursts of hypersexuality and extreme fetishes happen, and when he doesn’t fully match that energy (which is completely understandable), I spiral. I assume he’s no longer attracted to me or doesn’t love me anymore, so I go into panic mode and start deleting things — shared locations, passwords, anything that connects us.

I want a kind of patience and stability I can't even give in return. I expect what I can’t give, and I know how selfish that is.

Sometimes I feel like I’m just… evil. Not just mentally ill — like there’s a selfish, destructive part of me that hurts the people I love no matter what I intend. I’m so thankful to have a partner who knows me, not just the version of me that shows up during an episode. But it also makes me feel even worse — knowing someone loves me enough to keep trying, to keep having faith I can get better, even when I keep breaking everything.

I’m starting therapy again soon. I’m 18 and finally have access to help I didn’t have before. I just hope it’s not too late to fix what I’ve broken."
38,1,"FP is gone, I don't know how to put myself back together. It is stupid but I feel no other motivation or purpose to continue everyday without her. I don't want her back at this point, i'm terrified of my desire for longing and how it consumes me.

I'm torn apart. I give everything I have because even the slightest bit of attention feels so much to me. I'm hopeless and I don't know what to do anymore. fuck it i will just cut myself, i've been postponing it for so long, i can wear long sleeves idgaf"
39,2,"Heya,

I’m not looking to be diagnosed or anything, but wonder if very early childhood trauma can result in BPD? I went through some traumatic things during my first year in life like abandonment, emotional neglect, was fed burgers and coke instead of milk and regular food, possibly physical violence and SA (not confirmed but my dad did get caught for exploiting children and was always a violent person, and the way I reacted as a kid I suspect something like that could’ve happened). I’m talking to a psychiatrist tomorrow and wonder if I should bring this up or if it doesn’t matter. "
40,1,"Why am I not allowed to be hurt too? After having my boundary disrespected? After being ignored like I was nothing? We used to lay in bed and talk but the second a stranger comes in and casts doubt, you jump ship. I was never threatening or insulting. Passive aggressive and bitchy maybe. But never threatening or insulting. 

And now I'm playing the victim but I can't even be an ex because they're closeted. I cant eat, can't sleep, my chest hurts so badly that I've called my doctor.

And meanwhile the two of them go facebook official. Take cute pictures. All while they're still peeling their shit from my house, scraping themselves out of my soul like a lobotomy. Only a lobotomy might hurt less. 

A stranger comes in and suddenly we can't have a conversation. And suddenly it's okay to ignore me. 

God everything hurts and I see them in everything. "
41,1,"I’m 17 - diagnosed with BPD - having just gotten out of a romantic/sexual relationship with an adult (not a significant age gap - they’d known me since I was 15 and they were 21, and we started dating online soon after I turned 16), and it’s a lot, honestly? Like, I knew in my head that it was wrong, but similarly I just didn’t care. If anything I loved the fact that they were older - hell, I *needed* it, and had even passively wished that they were a couple years older, too - and now they’re gone and have blocked me and fully replaced me with another mentally vulnerable but ‘easier’ teenager, having fully whittled out the place I had in their life and moved on blissfully with their other friends, and their support system, and I want to talk about the horrific amount of emotions I feel and all that happened and led up to this and all the shit they’d done and said and all the shit *I’ve* done and said, because I was no angel, but it’s just really too much to get into. 

And I think what’s worst is that I don’t think any of it is the mourning of like, a romantic love, if that makes sense. I mean, in general when people leave my life it’s like a big fat part of me was hollowed out with a carving knife, just this black miserable void that never really closes. But it’s not even love, and I think that outside of all of this I hate her. It’s that I’m just mourning the concept of her - of having an adult who cared about me or at least pretended to, and having them pay attention to me, and talk to me, and have me be their person. And then on top of that, the stomach-churning acknowledgment of my replaceability, my lack of significance to her or to anyone, how easily she could move on and forget about me while I know I’ll be agonizing over this for so, so long, and so, so deeply. It’s a gross oversimplification, but my head’s still unset and I haven’t slept yet, so I’m not sure how to better describe it at the moment. 

It feels like, a lot of the time, that I’m nothing more than a vessel for people to imprint themselves onto, and it’s not even that that I have an issue with - I’m fine with that and I’ve long since come to terms with my lack of value - but I just want someone to stay.

I don’t think I have a capacity for the ‘warm fuzzies,’ for what love is supposed to look like; I think I’m just a writhing mass of need. I don’t have friends, I don’t have an anchor, I don’t have people I can turn to, and I don’t even want that. I just want a fucking adult to ruin my life unconditionally and not leave me.

EDIT:
Hello! I’m freshly rested and revisted this post, and I just first want to thank everyone for commenting Everyone’s been really sweet, more than I expected and honestly deserve, and I’m really glad that you guys felt enough from this to be vulnerable and share your own stories with me. I’m not very good with words, I’m sorry, but it really does mean the world. 

I want to clarify somethings, too, though. The relationship started and ended purely online. There was no physical contact, but it was a sexual relationship; I don’t feel comfortable sharing more details than that. I think that makes it feel a lot less ‘serious’(?) to me? Or deserving of being treated with seriousness. And I guess I don’t want people thinking it was worse than it actually was. I know that’s probably wrong, but regardless it just makes me accepting any kind of ‘victimhood’(?) even more difficult, on top of everything else. 

Nevertheless, thank you, everyone. This community’s been so kind to me. "
42,2,I’m leaving on vacation today for 9 day and I feel like I’m literally going to die without my boyfriend. Even tho I’m going with friends I currently feel sad and anxious about leaving and not seeing him for 9 days. I trust him 100% and I know he would never cheat. I’m feeling this way because I get extremely homesick when I go on vacation and it got worse when I got with my bf. Over the three years we’ve been together we have travelled separately and every single time the distance has deeply affected me. When I don’t see him for a few days I get confused and insecure and doubt his feelings for me. I know it’s all in my head and just part of my bpd but I can’t help but feel this way. Ofc I’m extremely grateful to be able to travel but being away with my boyfriend is very hard for me. I even have like body spams and my hands tremble. I’m not specifically seeking for advice I just wanted to share this to a community who might understand what I’m going through. I’m aware I need to work on this and I’m currently seeing a therapist to help with that. 
43,1,"Sometimes I’ll just start thinking about being able to dramatically reveal in an argument or something that I’ve been through something horrific


Or i’ll feel bad about myself and think god im so fucking useless and I fuck everything up and if I had been through worse shit it would make a little more sense why I am the way I am"
44,1,Before she stopped messaging me she did she she’s been feeling very down and depressed I was wondering how long during this time would she maybe stay like that. She never really did speak about anything like how long she can be down for before (each individual is different I imagine)so I don’t really know but I will here and there send messages to her saying I’m still here for her if that is appropriate. Thanks much appreciated 
45,3,"Im talking to a guy. We were just talking about our progress in therapy and sometimes he flirts very subtly. Then until 2am i started feeling so overwhelmed? Like my head was just so going DANGER DANGER idk :( i kinda knew that talking to a guy is like my trigger, but the physical sensation was crazy. My body and insides felt like burning, and i cried.. will it always be like this? Because i feel safe around him? "
46,3,"Hey there, tired person here. I think I have a burnout. I can't stand my job anymore. I work at my mothers pharmacy. I studied pharmacy because my family expected me to. I'm 32 years old and I still act like 16. I told my mother I'm quitting the job. I want to stand on my own feet and make my own decisions. I'm sick of our codependent relationship. I told her I need some time to think and she told me I have issues and I need psychological support cause my anger is uncontrollable. Thing is, my anger is uncontrollable with her cause I don't feel seen or heard. Ever! I was diagnosed with bpd last year, after many years of psychotherapy. And the only thing she said was that I have to go back to therapy. She doesn't understand how much I've tried to better myself all these years.. "
47,1,"Throwaway account because I’m just secretive. So, for a bit of background, I used to have very impulsive BPD. I have had it for most of my life. After some very intense spiritual work and a bit of therapy, I am in remission. However, as we all know, healing is never linear. I am in the phase of making peace with my past actions and behaviors. I am feeling very alone in the person I used to be. I used to be absolutely obsessed with revenge. I would never, EVER, physically harm anyone (unless out of self-defense), but over the years of having very intense symptoms, I enacted a lot of very calculated, drawn-out revenge plans. I have genuinely lost count at how many people I have been evil towards in one way or another. Now of course, I didn’t do this completely unprovoked. These people were generally not good people or were behaving in such a way that offended or harmed me or other people. However, 9/10 my reactions to these offenses were way out of line and disproportionate to the actual situation. If I could go back, I would have just allowed myself to process the situation, accept it for what it is, and then let go. But I can’t change the past. I would do awful things such as threaten people anonymously with legal action, sign their phone number up for the scammiest shit I could find, lie to people to turn them against them, file anonymous reports on whatever misdemeanor they were (legitimately) guilty of, etc. I accept that I was this person at one point. But it is hard to cope with the shame of my past self. Has anyone else been obsessed with revenge at one point? If so, how did you make peace with this? For me, it always felt like I was getting justice for myself or others that I felt deserved it. Any advice would be appreciated "
48,2,"i hate relationships changing. i hate any change, but most of all i hate change in the dynamics with people i love. it was my fault that our relationship changed and now i feel so empty. i grieve everyone and everything preemptively, and im constantly worried about being too much and pushing them away even more than i already have done. 

it hurts most because they’re the one person i want right now. i can’t put my feelings down properly because i don’t want to sound like a weirdo but i can’t cope with the idea of just not being important to them anymore, even though it’s my fault they don’t want me around as much. it’s not pain i can put anywhere or do anything with because im the reason i feel this way. mentally i know that, but my body doesn’t and i literally feel sick with anxiety as im waiting for a reply back. more than anything i miss that safety net of knowing im cared for, even when we fought most of the time i still knew i was loved and that’s not a guarantee anymore. 

i don’t even feel like there’s anything i can do about it, because even if i improve myself, i can’t take back my hurtful actions of the past. i just want to go back to when everything was okay again. at the same time i wish i could remove myself from the world so no one ever remembered my existence because i think the planet would be a whole lot better if that happened. i hate myself so much right now i just feel like the worst"

Disclaimer… Please don’t take this advice and think “Oh, well I guess I’m just a shitty person. I guess I’m hopeless.” Read the whole thing.

This may sound counterintuitive but: 

The best thing you can do for yourself and others is accept accountability for your actions without hating yourself.. Accept that you are manipulative and that you’ve hurt people without hurting yourself in the process. Get sober from drugs and/or alcohol if that’s a problem for you. 

BPD may be disguising the person you really are. You have to realize that maybe right now you’re acting like a shitty person, but deep down all you want is to love and be loved. BPD makes that difficult for you. But you are the only thing in control of yourself. You have to take a stand against BPD.

6 years ago I was a very different person. I was manipulative and did a lot of shitty things (because of my BPD). I was very hard to love and I didn’t make things easy for anyone. I only blamed others for my problems and I would get very angry and then later get very sad and become suicidal. *The thing is, BPD is just a reason, it’s not an excuse.* There comes a point when you have to realize that you are making bad choices and do something about it. You are hurting people. You are hurting yourself. Nothing about that is ok. 

Remember: 
Thoughts lead to feelings, feelings like to behaviours, and behaviours reinforce our thoughts. 

For me, the best thing to do was work on my behaviours first. Eventually I decided that they weren’t serving anyone, not even myself, and I worked really hard on disrupting them. This led to me believing I am a better person than I used to be, which made me feel a whole lot better. Feeling better makes me want to behave better, and so on. 

Now it’s been 5 years since I’ve self harmed. I’m almost 2 years sober and it’s been 1.5 years since I’ve been hospitalized. I still occasionally get passively suicidal, I still overreact to things and get angry sometimes over stupid little things. But I can now say that I am a much better person than I was 6 years ago. And my life is so much better for it. I’m much more happy and loveable and the people around me are happier too. 

I was one of the really bad ones. Sometimes in and out of the hospital several times a week. I hurt a lot of people really bad. If I am capable of change, so are you. "
50,2,"not completely sure if the flair is correct. my friend and i both have bpd and we're currently long distance. he's been struggling this year and has gone silent for days to a week at a time due to depression which i understand. the last time we spoke was may 8th. i understand it feels impossible to reach back out after a depressive episode and i don't doubt that the length of time apart makes it harder. i'm just not sure how i should help him. i have tried texting like normal, reassuring, telling him i miss and love him, giving advice, and giving him space. i know it's ultimately up to him and i can't force him but i can't help but feel like there's something i should be doing. he's not currently in therapy (nor has he ever been to my knowledge) but ive been in therapy for years, done dbt and tfcbt, etc. i'm also medicated and he is not. if anyone has any advice on how to help him or has been through a similar situation id love to hear it."
51,1,"sometimes i listen to music and feel like they're looking directly into my brain. personally i feel like the entirety of ""i want it all"" by the drums is extremely relatable as someone with bpd. the following are some of the lyrics to ""beach life-in-death"" by car seat headrest, which i personally feel like captures the borderline experience quite accurately:

*""i am almost completely soulless,*

*i am incapable of being human*

*i am incapable of being inhuman*

*i am living uncontrollably*

*it should be called anti-depression*

*as a friend of mine suggested*

*because it's not the sadness that hurts you*

*it's the brain's reaction against it*

*it's not enough to love the unreal*

*i am inseparable from the impossible*

*i want gravity to stop for me*

*my soul yearns for a fugitive from the laws of nature""*"

I have pretty bad bpd and cannot control my feelings sometimes even though i try my hardest i have tried therapy as well as medication and i can’t seem to stop. It’s so tiring just living as me and managing my feelings and taking a deep breath so i dont ruin us and yell at her. I do love her deeply she is the most beautiful woman on earth and we click really well together. But i just get so angry and begin to split on her sometimes, for example if she’s a little dry i get really upset or take it wrong. Today i made her cry because i was being really rude and had to calm her down but it all feels like an excuse for me to be a bad person. I try really hard for her and am usually able to keep it under wraps but i am constantly on edge. Should i leave her and let her be i’ve had many serious conversations with her about who i am, how i am, and why i am this way and what im doing to stop or what she can do to help. But i just can’t take hurting her anymore but she doesn’t want me to leave."

57,2,"about a month ago i found out i had borderline personality disorder and honestly it all makes sense but it's ruining all of my relationships and my own life too. i hate being told im crazy or too much i just want to be understood. small situations for me turn into huge emotional outbursts which lead to rage, anxiety and depression. something as little as getting a bad grade caused me to overthink and spiral and sometimes this wouldn't end for days at a time. in my previous relationship there was many things that triggered this for me. i had been cheated on and it felt like my life was completely over. i broke things in my room, i isolated myself from everyone, i didn't get out of bed for days to go to school or work. my life was falling apart because i couldn't seem to move past being betrayed and lied to. to this day i still feel crazy all of the time and i hate it so much. why is it that i can't get over situations that any other person would be able to get over so easily? i ask myself why all the time and it eats me alive.  i overthink everything, i over analyze everything and it makes me stress so bad that im barely getting any sleep. im not enjoying my life to the fullest because im so anxious all of the time. i always jump to conclusions and i feel like im always ruining relationships because of that. im constantly catastrophizing situations and i dont know how to stop this at all. i used to self harm and it got very bad to the point where i honestly just had to force myself to stop and get piercings and tattoos instead. lately ive been feeling so lost with myself that i cant help but wanting to relapse and hurt myself again. i know its bad and i really need to get out of this depressive mindset but i just feel so alone. no one around me understands the way i feel and it makes me feel so stupid. is there any advice anyone has that helped them work around this disorder? i go to therapy every week but nothing seems to really help me. it's getting harder every day trying to find motivation for myself and i need this to stop because it's really affecting my life. please if anyone has any tips or suggestions let me know id greatly appreciate it. i just want to stop being so sensitive all the time and i really hope i can get through this.  "
58,3,"So during an argument or fight with my bf and other loved ones I realised that I do not want to fight. There's this one voice in my head that says, you know this isn't gonna end well but it's not strong enough compared to the primary voice that tells me I hate him/them and I wanna destroy them with my words. 

I really am struggling with this a lot. Especially when the other person has no idea that I am self sabotaging.
I tried explaining this to my bf today that when I fight with me I don't wanna continue but breaking the pattern is so hard so if he could remember that I am self sabotaging it's gonna help him calm down and not respond back to the fight and approach me with love. And words of love from him. They're the best. He can literally call me ""my baby"" or ily in the middle of fights and I'll just melt and cry. His words are either a warm hug or painful knives.

So what I tried telling him is that, when I forget I love him, he needs to remember I love him and remind me that.

I don't know if that makes any sense.

But please give me more tips or ways that you have learnt yourself or maybe from a therapist or anyone to deal with sabotaging.

I can't afford therapy yet.
Thank you so much!"
59,3,"basically title, i’ve been having issues with this friend for a while and being back home from university being with my parents has made me more prone to splitting. 
essentially she’s been mad at me since december of last year and would lie to me about it (i had multiple friends confirm that she was in fact mad at me but wouldn’t explain why). i gave her multiple chances to talk to me about it and gave her the benefit of the doubt but basically that’s been bubbling inside of me for a while. while ive been at home i discovered my mom is intentionally misgendering me to my face but using my proper pronouns when talking to others about me. my meds ran out, and my friend who i mentioned called me a really fucking mean nickname then ignored me when i brought it up. (called me a slur, she can say it but it felt more pointed and really mean) 
the next day we were supposed to hang out at 10. (i have autism i NEED the schedule so this is important.) then she moves out hang out to later. it frustrates me off but whatever so now we are hanging out at 12! 12 pm comes and goes and guess who still isn’t there. didn’t text me or give me a heads up she’s pushing it back again and my brain starts to kinda freak out. i get even more upset because i know as soon as i bring up the fact she didn’t tell me the updated time she’s gonna make a comment about my autism and that i’m done dealing with her and i plan on ghosting her out bc i can’t stand any of this anymore. so i’m more than frustrated at this point and i vent about it on my spam account close friends on instagram, but in my frustration i accidentally posted it on the main story where she could see it. she comes and gets me finally at 3, and mentions that she saw it. i genuinely apologize because i now process that i was splitting when i posted it and tell her as much and update her on what’s going on in my personal life and apologize that she was the person my brain could lash out about. 
i do genuinely feel sorry, but i do still want to cut her off. i’m not sure how to handle this situation since i usually just let things drift away but obviously now it’s very intentional. i want to apologize again because i truly am sorry that she was what i snapped at, but i don’t want to be weird and pushy with my apologies (i’ve already communicated that she absolutely doesn’t need to forgive me.) it feels weird if i keep mentioning she doesn’t need to forgive me and she can in fact give me space since that is what i want but i don’t want her to feel guilty or anything? i don’t know. i’m trying to see if i can get an emergency appointment with my therapist bc this has been the only split ive had that wasn’t private. if anyone has any input or anything on how i should handle this it would be much appreciated.

60,1,I’m a m24 and Im struggling with loneliness so much. I started avoiding people and isolating because I was sick of getting attached to people and just feeling depressed when they’re not around or not able to talk me. But I started getting really lonely and now I’m back trying to search for someone to fill in this empty hole so I’m not lonely anymore but it seems so impossible to find anyone. For example I just met this girl literally 2 days ago and I fucking love talking to her she is so sweet and nice but right now she’s working and I feel so fucking miserable I’m crying and wishing she was here to talk to and don’t know what to do tbh I just want to cut her off and never talk to her again because I honestly feel like she’s just going to leave me anyways I just don’t feel good enough for her but as soon as she’s back I’m so happy but when she leaves it’s like my life is ending don’t even get me started if she leaves to hangout with someone else or starts talking to another guy I just break down and wanna leave so bad because I feel like she likes them more and I don’t know what to do and it’s so weird to because when I’m alone and not looking for anyone I’m fine I’m normal don’t feel emotions on this scale but when I’m looking for a relationship with someone or get attached my emotions sky rocket and every little thing they do bothers me. It’s so confusing and it makes me not wanna live I’m hurting so much right now while she’s gone and I’ve only known her for 2 days I wish I could find someone that is always around and is always free to hangout like me and talk to and is loyal and I could actually trust but it seems so impossible to hard to trust anyone. And it scares me to because if she finds out what I’m really like I feel like she will leave I’m scared to express how I feel to her or ask for reassurance I also hate when people have friends and leave to hangout with them it makes me not wanna talk to them anymore because it makes me feel like I don’t matter to them because I will always put them first and only hangout with them if my friends ask me to hangout I would never choose them over her and I feel like others wouldn’t do that for me idk this whole trying to find someone is hard and breaking me. 
61,0,I was diagnosed with bpd when I was 18. The past few years (before I turned 18) have been strange for me as I found myself not feeling empathy for others. I can understand what people are going through and understand the emotion they’re showing but I don’t feel bad for them? I usually stay neutral in situations (like fights between friends) and I’m good at giving advice but I don’t really feel anything for them? I’m not even sure I love or care for my friends. I know people with bpd can lose empathy while they’re splitting but this isn’t the case here. Even when I’m not splitting I have a hard time creating a real connection with people which is weird because when I was a young kid people would always tell me how kind and empathetic I was. I’m curious about the sudden change and if bpd is the right diagnosis for me. My old therapist suggested that my brain blocks me from developing connections or feeling empathy for others in order to protect myself. Does anyone also feel this way? It’s also important to note that I have a bf of 3 years and him and my parents are truly the only people I would die for. I care about them a lot which is very contrasting to how I feel about other people. 
62,1,"So I am more on the quiet BPD scale. I feel like I’ve always been a pretty patient person, I’m pretty quiet and introverted and hate any conflict or drama. I’m a lot better with communication than I used to be. But for some reason I have just never had luck with keeping friends. It doesn’t help that I have crippling anxiety/depression and health problems where I end up hiding in my house a lot and don’t make plans and go out. But all the friends I have had throughout my life have just left me, they walked away. I don’t understand. It’s always something. Always some misunderstanding or I attract the wrong people I guess. I’m 33 and it’s sad that I only have 2 friends I can count on even though they are always busy. When both of them have so many they can’t even count. I couldn’t imagine that. It makes me so depressed. "
63,2,"hi all! i was recently diagnosed with bpd last week, so its been pretty jarring coming to terms with it. anyhow, i have a serious jealousy problem, and was wondering if anyone had any advice! i also wanna preface w the fact im fully aware this requires therapy (which i start soon) as well as dbt & whatnot, im just looking for ways to cope in the meantime. my problem is whenever my partner hangs out with their friends, i get EXTREMELY jealous - like genuinely nauseous. ive talked to them about it & they check in on me while theyre out to help me, but i cant seem to deal with it. ive spent so much energy & time crying over it, spiraling, etc. and it is so exhausting to feel this way & its stressful for my partner. does anyone have any advice? i tell myself all the time theyre allowed to like and be with other people, and i genuinely do want them to hangout with their friends bc they have great friends, but it just sucks so much. thanks in advance! :)"
64,3,"I've always had some problems dealing with my emotions but back in april i got on birth control and it's made it even worse. i get so easily irritated over the dumbest things and it makes me feel like im losingmy mind.
 on some days i just end up having a mental breakdown. i cry for hours. it's been driving me CRAZY. ive been so emotional it makes me want to hurt myself; i haven't in over a year and i don't think i will, but it's a reoccurring thought. i just don't know what to do with myself on days like this. i don't really have a best friend(because he became my partner..) to talk to and i feel like i bother said partner enough so i just end up feeling alone with my thoughts.  it just fucking sucks feeling incredibly emotional one day and then the next day i feel fine and like i totally overreacted. idk just needed to get that out. (wow also my first post after being a lurker!!)"
65,1,"vent tag bc it seems appropriate i guess? (20f)

almost 1-2 years ago i had an incident and i activated my freeze response and i’m just like passively rotting away in bed and at home ever since. it was basically betrayal, self-betrayal and a friendship fallout and a lot happened internally.
 i also have to share my home with 7 other people (family, dysfunctional) so i crashed out a lot quietly but never externally, only to my therapist. 

i started having panic attacks like crazy which i never had before and the only thing that i really felt to move forward in my life is suicide, bc my emotions were that strong. i feel like i have to go thru with it or attempt at least once bc i feel like i can’t move on with my life if i don’t acknowledge it?? or like ppl don’t take me seriously lol so i have to prove to them by k wording myself.

i don’t know i’m really stuck in a bad freeze response. depression never affected me as badly as THIS segment in my life which feels like my whole life now. i want to hurt the person who stole everything from me but they’ve already moved on. urgh. i hate wasting my life. i wish someone stopped me from making best friends w people i would never met. i hate them and myself so much. 

it just sucks being at rock bottom once again i guess and people taking things you love from you AGAIN. (mommy issues) i really wish i could start over my life. i’m fighting ending it everyday. i just feel bad for myself bc the ppl i grew up and raised me with never will :/ 🤷"
66,2,"being in a healthy relationship with bpd feels like you’re being held captive in heaven when you don’t deserve it. You’re with your person and you feel on top of the world- so in love with the relationship and the person. Your person treats you with love, support, and understanding- and you do your best to do the same. I’m told I do a great job and no one else could support and love her the way i do, and i believe it- sometimes, most of the time, idk. 
Like every relationship, there are ups and downs, hiccups and misunderstandings & some will be easier than others. However, the hardest part about those isn’t necessarily what happens between us, but what happens with myself. 
I hate splitting, I hate this illness & it’s crazy that not everyone thinks this way regularly. It’s so confusing and exhausting. The splitting makes me feel so evil because it’s not how I really feel but I don’t know why it feels so strong. The strong intrusiveness that somehow life would be easier single (even tho it REALLY wont, i just convinced myself that @ that moment) and I’m not fit to be in a relationship or at least right now, or that my gf is annoying me right now (but those episodes usually subside after a couple minutes of processing). It’s moreso the thought that I’m not meant to be in a relationship because of my mental illness and not being able to love properly. Like I feel like my gf deserves someone who loves her just the way she loves me. But it’s so hard because I know I do- but I dont know why it feels like I don’t, i mean i do know why. it’s cause of the intrusive splitting thoughts i have & that make me feel so undeserving of her. She’s so perfect and I know she’s the only one who I could love and trust like this- she’s the only one I want in the end. That’s why it’s so confusing because of this illness- because of how back and forth everything feels inside and how strong it is just continuing to spiral. Sometimes, it makes me feel paralyzed in myself. And at this point, it feels like hell and im just stuck, stuck in my own mind- and sometimes its worse because it causes me to want to say things like “lets just break up” and I’m left with the instant regret of not actually wanting that. 
My person is my heaven.
I end up needed space, and during that space she’s so sweet- trying to make me food. It’s so hard to accept it and be okay with it because everything in me feels a mixture of 
un-deservingness and annoyance because its annoying she’s being so good to me when I feel like I’m at war in my head. 
Eventually something does end up grounding and im slowly regulating- and it’s good for a while
but again- bpd makes me feel captive in my own head because it cycles again and again. making me desperate for a cure or change or else I fear I’ll lose the most best and important thing to ever happen to me. Not because of me breaking it off, but because of my behavior and natural self preservation subconscious thinking might lead her love for me to diminish. & That’s also why I’m willing to pay about $200 a week for a DBT program in hopes it’ll help.
It’s terrifying to tell her this too because I’m scared she won’t understand. I’m scared she’ll not get that I never want to lose her, and she’s my everything and genuinely one like no other. I don’t understand bpd and I wish I could get rid of the splitting, cause imo, it’s the 2nd worst part of it because it doesn’t feel like me- but in the moment it does feel like me which makes it so confusing and horrible. However- right after it, it completely subsides and is the opposite of what I could ever want. I feel crazy.
That’s why it’s terrifying cause I don’t want her to ever think I want a life without her, but I don’t want this to make her scared that there could be a chance that I genuinely would. 
That’s why I feel like a captive stuck in my mind because bpd tells me to run but my heart and soul wants to run to her & at this same time, i feel so undeserving to run to her.
Does anyone struggle with this too and do you have any advice?"
67,0,"I’ve completed my course!!!!
This course has helped me really focus on what I want, and want I wish to do career wise. I have finished with an extremely high result, and I’m starting to be proud of myself, I haven’t been proud of myself this way for a long time.
I hated academics growing up, but this course is the first time I enjoyed something, and I’m gonna miss everyone and the familiar feeling. I know leaving is gonna give me some extreme feelings, so I’ve set up some routines and DBT skills, but I can’t believe I finished, and with a really high grade. I’m so happy for me!!! <3"
68,2,"Cw: light mention of self harm

Hello,

One of my biggest triggers for splitting is just myself. I’ll get the usual black or white, the “every second I keep breathing is making the world worse” to “I’m actually an angel and any self-doubt is the world trying to poison me.” Recently, I’ve noticed that there’s like a third feeling that I used to ascribe to the good side of splitting / the latter. It’s like just a really vibrant grey in the color analogy if that makes sense?? I don’t feel like I’m above / better than the world like usual, just on top of it. Like I can feel my faults and not like completely absolve but still feel like I’m doing better. But like too much, unreasonably so in retrospect? Like I feel like I’m in one of those “main character guy down on his luck movies” having that aha! moment. Feeling like the main character is actually a good description. I’ll get like a chapter written of this story I’m working on, trying to edit it as I go, and when I come down it turns out to be complete trash compared to what I usually write 😭. Coming down is a good analogy cause it does lwk feel like I’m drunk. But with like super high energy, and nowhere to put it. That part has been more noticeable since I’ve started meds for ADHD, cause it feels like it completely undoes the medication effects. 

I did a bit of keyboard doctoring and it seems like mania fits the symptoms, but not the time frame, cause these moods last like half a day at most. It might a couple weeks until I can see my therapist about it so just wanted to see if anyone else has had a similar experience. Thanks for any insight <3"
69,1,"My whole life i struggled with intense mood swings. it was so extreme that i could physically feel it. And it always happened after someone triggered me or if i felt attacked or unheard. Alot of my friendships and relationships ended because they thought i was crazy, or i ended up self sabotaging everything. I ended up going to the mental hospital a couple times and everytime i got out i still felt the same way i had before. and it sucks because now my mom doesn’t even want me to do public school for the rest of my 2 highschool years because she’s afraid i might have an episode again. so she’s making me do online for mine and hers sake. I wish i wasn’t like this because i want to be successful in life but
i feel like i’ll never make it"
70,3,"I don’t wanna be too specific here but I made a stupid ass tweet and got flamed for it. I am too prideful and too much of a pussy to delete it and also I still feel like I’m right honestly. I barely understand why people are so mad but that’s kinda irrelevant I think. I’m somewhat aware at this point there is no realistic way that I’m right because I’m only getting people disagreeing and being kinda shitty. Wouldn’t care as much but my friends disagree with me too and they are genuinely being very nice about it but I’m too hypersensitive and am not handling it well. 

Im really struggling keeping myself composed about this. I can’t ruin a half a decade long friendship for something this dumb obviously and my friends aren’t actually being mean but I’m just seriously not handling this well at all. Highkey BPDing out about it and I’m not really sure what I’m supposed to do here. I am not gonna argue with them obviously because I like them and I know they don’t mean to be rude. But I’m starting to get really upset and likely dramatic about this and so far I’ve just muted the group chat and kinda fucked off but I’m starting to worry that that might also be a manipulative shitty thing to do? How does one act like a normal person in this situation. I don’t want to argue with them. I don’t want to ghost them and have them worry. I don’t want to tell them how this is affecting me because I don’t want to make them feel bad when they’re not really doing anything wrong. 

This is the dumbest shit ever. How do normal people handle situations like this. I need to sit on this for a while but I don’t know how I can do that without being an asshole and making everything worse"
71,0,"I think I am finally getting adapted to the medication in a term that doesn't block my feelings at all , I don't know if I am the only one that everytime that sees a movie, film , sitcom , drama , etc , cries in the emotional moments . 
Medication stops me a bit that . Even that I felt it but after a long time I have cried again.  Not of sadness , maybe nostalgic , because a Kdrama I am watching . 
And I haven't been that emotional before. 
I know I am on the right dosis , because even that I am very sensitive, I feel I could have the rational part also more awake . 

Just sharing with you.

72,2,"It’s really been a hard few days, work and dad (who is lovely usually) telling me I don’t try hard enough and I have a disciplinary this week where I’m pretty sure I’ll get taken out back and shot, plus fibro fatigue and just feeling Sad. 

Anyway I have a drag show cabaret tomorrow in London called Life Finds A Slay (Jurassic Park themed!) I know I should go and would feel so much worse if I didn’t, but also I’m just scared about the happiness and anxiety crash. And then I’m spiralling about anxiety over this. Could someone just slap me down to earth? Probably none of these even made sense. "
73,2,"I've been freaking out for the past month or so, and this is only my second relationship, so im so petrified and not sure what to make of any of this.

As a trans femme lesbian, I've gone thru changes in my attraction, from being only attracted to women and feminine enbies, to around a year ago, trans mascs/trans men.

I've been splitting on my current partner (trans masc) for the past few months, and have been increasing losing attraction to both him but am also increasing only finding women and femmes attractive. And Im not sure if this is some form of age-regression or something else entirely (ie: realizing not into guys).

Any chance anyone has similar experience with this happening during a splitting episode, and/or if it was temporary or permanent?"
74,3,"I need help, I want to love my boyfriend and have a healthy relationship with him but his constant failure to show up for me is making me lose feelings. I’ll admit i’ve put him through a lot already, but him failing to make a phone call or come see me when i’m in distress is so upsetting. Anytime I need him he’s with his friends or busy and his communication is so lackluster on the phone.

Again, I understand I put him through a lot and i’m too much, but I know it’s not crazy to want more. Multiple times he’s failed to really be there for me, multiple times i’ve called him out and told him how to show me he cares, multiple times he promised he’d do things differently, and it’s always the same. 

I think the best thing for me to do is seriously pull back, if he can’t handle all of me I don’t want to show it anymore. I don’t want to turn to him when i’m in distress anymore, if he only wants to be here when i’m not a burden that’s fine. I just fear if I pull back our relationship will die out as I seriously doubt he even wants to fight for me or be with me. "
75,1,"i live with my boyfriend, we’ve been together for two years and before that we dated online. he was very kind online, but in person it’s different — he’s very harsh and insensitive with me. sometimes i feel like he manipulates me, but he says it’s my bpd making me think that.

i recently started taking sertraline, but even with the medication i still have these feelings. i also found something on his phone that i consider cheating, and it hurt me a lot. i wanted to hit him and break everything, but at the same time i just wanted to lie on the floor and disappear. i feel lonely all the time, and after that i felt even worse.

i was motivated to go to the gym, but i stopped going because now that he’s on vacation i just want to stay home and be with him.

i feel like a lost cause. i’m 20 years old and i’m not studying for the entrance exam or working. my mom hates me and my family only says bad things to me all the time.

i don’t know what to do, and even taking medication i feel like giving up."
76,3,"I wish I had understood I was BPD before I joined this poly... feels like I spend half my days in a living hell... I (20NB) joined this poly last year. It consists of my boyfriend/FP (29M), his wife (28GF), and his long distance boyfriend (22M). Due to dropping out of college, I moved in with him and his wife overnight. At first, everything was amazing. Eventually, however, I built resentment towards his wife. If there was an opposite to an FP, she would be it. I butt heads with her all the time and it causes so much tension around the house, and anytime any of us try to put out the anger we share for eachother it doesn't last long.

Eventually my boyfriend stopped wanting adult time with me as often and now I've noticed that our quality time together is much less talking than it used to be...

Anytime I try talking about the pain his wife puts me through, I get a mostly deafened ears from him in return. When he DOES listen, she is very quick to complain and get her way. I don't know what to do... I'm splitting on her more and more, and I split on him quite frequently now too.. anything we do to bandage the situation, is always quickly undone. Resentment, jealousy, hatred, I feel all of them towards her. I want to be near my boyfriend all the time, but trying to live with her makes into this horrible person. I'm currently unemployed so I don't have options to move out.

I feel stuck, and I can't stand the thought that he could possibly be loving me less... I feel like a major stressor in his life, a burden that's incredibly difficult to bear with.... It's getting to the point where when he knows what she's doing is wrong or hurtful, he tells me that it's not simply because he knows I'm resentful towards her. I spend a lot of time these days feeling like I can't trust her at all (she is known to simply lie or keep major details out) and now I'm worried that I can't always trust him either...

Don't get me wrong, I love him. He's a great man. Loving, always willing to give a hand, accepting, loyal to his people, protective, understanding, etc. Leaving him would absolutely tear me apart to the point where I'm not sure if I could stand back up. I just am running out of ways to cope with all of this and I feel at such a loss"
77,1,"I was sitting at the pool and some redneck started to talk to me saying he liked my style and complimented me. I then see him go over to his table and pull out a small white bag and taste it with his finger before sniffing it. He held the bag up to me and I took it. I used it. After we hooked up in the bathroom. I went home to drink and smoke weed. I already didn’t sleep 48 hours at this point and had been on redbulls and monsters. I can’t stop dissociating, it’s so random too, I’ll suddenly feel like I’m in the wrong body, my bones are buzzing, my skin feels uncomfortable. My mind feels quieter and muted. It feels not hot or cold inside but uncomfortable. I don’t like it but I can’t stop it. Sometimes hours of my days are going unaccounted for. "
78,0,"So a couple weeks ago I was really conflicted about a group therapy program I was in, it was really becoming like an abusive relationship and just wasn’t working for me at all. Thankfully, a lot of helpful folks on here (as well as many of my friends), talked me into leaving that group. 

Looking back, I’m SO glad I got out of that group, I actually have motivation to do stuff now and generally feel better about myself. I was able to find another group therapy program that is solely for folks with BPD and it’s so much better for me, way more structured too. I also got set up with a new psychiatrist and will hopefully get an autism diagnosis that I’ve been trying like hell to get. 

I really wanted to thank everyone that talked me into leaving that group though :)"

I often think of SU***** but im not gonna anymore because it will make others feel crap, so im kinda just stuck here, sleeping through days.

83,1,"As the title says me (22) and my fiance (22) broke up today. We still love each other but we see our future differently… The worst thing is, that I felt completely numb for a month, didn’t want to cuddle nor kiss and it hurted them so bad. I feel like a horrible person because now after the breakup I FEEL the love (well at least I think so). He is the best person I have ever met. He tried so hard to understand me, how to talk to me etc. Everything was perfect…but then? We got engaged in Japan. It was BEAUTIFUL I was waiting for this my whole life. But now? IDK If I got stressed or something but small things I didn’t care about just started to trigger me… I lost sexual desire for him, then I wanted to be alone and then I felt numb. I haven’t even want to hug them when they came from hospital. I booked a therapy session and it opened my eyes- well kinda. She told me, that the engagement is a huge deal for my brain and the things I didn’t care about (that he makes like 400$ a month, he gets angry easily or depressed and that he just acts like a baby sometimes) are not “correct” for me to look at as my potential husband. I got destroyed… I started crying out of nowhere and couldn’t stop. I am crying all day. I AM the bad person here and I hurt the most important person in my life. The sadness in his eyes when I told him…The stuff I did is just horrible. I honestly want to K&ll myself now. But what’s the most confusing? After the breakup I feel like I still love him and all the emotions are back…is it because of the brain panic trying to get them back? I feel so crazy and I can’t do anything to get my attention elsewhere.

Also sorry, english is not my first language :( I just needed to write this down.
Do you have any advice? Thank you :("
84,0,"

Hell of a title, I know. But I figured it's better to just come out with my red flags right off the bat, right? >.<

My attachment style is getting stupid-clingy. And if I'm being honest, I miss having someone I can get all stupid-clingy with. I miss the late-night chats, the whirlwind of emotions, the constant rambling. It'd be nice to find someone who can get inside my head and sink their hooks in.

I'm into videogames, movies, art, psychology, youtube holes, and spending too much time on the internet.

If I'm being honest, I'm not even sure I'm looking for someone to match my energy. I tend to prefer people who are mature, use good grammar, and have their shit together. Someone better than me, even. I don't know. Someone who isn't afraid to call me out on my bullshit.

Shoot me a message. Sorry for the rambling mess."
85,3,"The one person who'd been my rock and my FP the last 3 years just up and blocked me out of nowhere and is now refusing to talk to me. I'm a mess right now. It's getting worse to the point that every time I wake up, I remember that I was *dreaming* about getting them back.

What the fuck do I do now?"
86,2,"I've (20m) been talking with this guy (25m) for the past couple weeks and he is so sweet to me. He actually cares and I don't feel like I have to beg for attention or constantly give reassurance or have arguments happen. It just feels so laid back. He also makes me feel like it's love not lust, which is a rare feeling I get. 
I'm just worried that it might be too good to be true cause he is so amazing, I never get with amazing people. We're having our first date in a few weeks and are taking it real slow!"
87,2,So lately I feel like I’m showing symptoms of bpd. I don’t want to get into any details but I feel like a few days ago I split.

I’m just want to ask if I should bring up bpd concerns during the first appointment?
88,1,"I'm 43. I feel so lost. 18 months ago I had a severe nervous breakdown & I haven't recovered. I have BPD & was diagnosed with CPTSD. 

I live in continual fear & depression. I think about suicide all the time & I honestly feel like I'll end myself one day. 

I used to have a a great life. I had a beautiful partner, a daughter, 2 homes & a business. I lost everything in January 2024. It broke me. I fell straight into a severe nervous breakdown. 

I literally have been living in misery for 18 months. I'm so scared & live in pure fear. I thought I would have got better by now but the patterning runs so deep. I feel so alone & in despair. 

I have sought out multiple therapists & I have a DBT coach. My last therapist told me to find someone else because I wasn't getting better. So my therapist threw me away exactly like my partner & daughter did. I thought I was getting better a few weeks ago but I relapsed so hard & fast. 

I live in Australia & I've sought out all methods of assistance. There's not much available in the area I live in. I'm literally scared to get out of bed everyday & I just want to cry. I can't even cry. I've tried multiple medications & they all had really negative side affects. I'm addicted to an antipsychotic they prescribed me to stop my body from shaking. If I try to taper off it it sends my suicidal thoughts into overdrive. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't have any family & all my friends have faded away. I'm so lost & scared. "
89,1,it’s not fair that i have to be good all the time. i don’t want to be healing or healed or do all this shit. i want to be a normal 24 year old girl that harps to her friends about exes and goes out drinking and sleeps with someone new and cries at night. i don’t want to be the dissociated piece of shit sitting alone all the time hyperfocused on not harming myself. i don’t want to walk this tightrope of doom. i wish more than anything to be normal. why don’t i get to be normal? what did i do wrong?
90,2,"My gf (24F - non BPD) and I (25F - BPD) were out today. We ended up in the car after the grocery store. I got in and she reach out for a kiss. So I had her kiss me on the cheek because I, as an autistic person, was overwhelmed prior by the grocery store and what happened earlier (which I won't go into detail). She, after not receiving the kiss from me on my lips, acted upset making me feel bad, but setting the boundary and explaining that I'm upset and overwhelmed. She tried again and I had her give it to me on the cheek, slamming her body again the seat and steering wheel. She said while wiping her eyes ""I'm going to cry."" I told her why again.
She then proceeded to say while driving off, ""I'm not upset. It was a joke."" 
I started telling her that that it shouldn't have been a joke in the first place. That I thought she was actually upset at me for not giving her it. That acting upset and saying she was a joke was wrong in my opinion.
She kept bringing up, ""why did you think I wasn't joking? I was laughing."" I thought it was sobbing by the way she threw herself around and pleading. ""Why can't you take a joke?"" Because I took it seriously, I thought she was genuinely upset with me. ""Well, I guess I can't joke about anything with you."" That joking is not something in my opinion should be a joke in the first place. I like joking around, but when she made that seem like she was genuinely upset and saying it was a joke is what drawed the line. 
So I started freaking out because I kept explaining my opinion on it, while she was not happy with the way I was freaking out over a ""joke."" I got out of the car so upset, not even wanting my groceries from how upset I was and how much my heart was racing from being around her and not understanding my point of view on the situation. 
Am I the ahh hole for leaving my stuff and freaking out bc she didn't realize how wrong in my opinion that was?? "
91,1,"Ive been single for about 2 years now and i feel like at this point might be single forever, my BPD has detatched me so far from reality i cant even imagine myself “clicking” with somebody if you know what i mean. I feel like nobody will really love me for who i really am once they really get to know me. People always hear “bipolar disorder” and immediately never wanna talk to you but hey never bother to understand that not all of us are toxic… we just deal with a lot and accidentally project it on to other people😔"
92,3,"I need help having a healthy relationship with my BF/fp. 
Resentment is building up, jealousy has taken over, we argue a lot but generally are happy other than that and try and healthily talk things through. 
But it’s not good enough, when I split I just push him away/ am just TOO MUCH to handle. 
I am on a low dose of quietiapine an antipsychotic and just started little over 2 weeks ago venlafexine an antidepressant. But my moods are still very unstable, depression, high anxiety. The only thing stable is my impulsiveness/ pychosis. 

I dont want to loose him but I dont know what to do. 
I cant afford real therapy for BPD right now. Only lowgrade free college therapy that doesnt understand BPD. 
My psychiatrist in my country for stupid legal reasons cant diagnose me officially with BPD but literally and I quote “we are treating you for bpd because we think you have it”. Ive been seeing them for on off 3 years and every psychiatrist there has said the same. 


"
93,1,"I saw an analogy before that BPD is like being strapped to a rollercoaster and knowing what will happen, and yet being unable to stop it, and I feel like this every day.   
  
I know I'm not a bad person. It took me a long time to accept that, and even now, I still catch myself telling myself how horrible I am when my self-esteem crumbles during a depressive phase. I was never malicious. I never wanted to cause harm for harm's sake.

Despite that, I've said and done many stupid things. Things that hurt, antagonized, or unfairly guilted others. And in the eyes of the world, that's all that matters. Yes, it was wrong. Yes, it wasn't okay. And you know what? I *am* sorry. I couldn't help it. I was sick. I was lost. I was hurt, and thrashing around in confusion. I reacted inappropriately and disproportionately. I hate myself for what I did. I am ashamed of myself. I'm beating myself up for my actions. But in the end, it doesn't matter. No one will care about your internal turmoil and regret when the result is that you caused the most commotion, were the bigger aggressor, and someone ended up hurt because of you.

You think I *wanted* to hurt anyone? That person will receive support, which they deserve and are entitled to. But I won't deserve it. I'm doomed to be trapped, forced to act out the toxic inclinations of my horrible brain, forcing me into patterns that betray who I want to be. I'm possessed, hijacked by emotion and fear of abandonment, to the point where I just have to watch myself sabotage every relationship that matters to me. Even though I'm begging myself to stop. Even though every fibre of my better judgment is nauseated at my actions. 

They'll be consoled, I'll be condemned. They'll get support. I'll be erased. BUT THIS ISNT FAIR. We are both victims. I'm not the villain. It's my brain, and the people that inflicted these mental scars that are the real villains. I am a prisoner inside my own head. I have to watch, with full awareness, all the things I do during my mental breakdowns behind a soundproof glass pane. I have to watch that external interfacing part of me ruin my social image while the pure, objective part of me get smothered under the weight of my emotional, irrational side.

I CANT CONTROL MY DISGUSTING EMOTIONS I DIDNT WANT THIS I DIDNT WANT TO HURT ANYONE IM SORRY IM TERRIBLE IM DISGUSTING FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK

No one looks at someone like me and asks, “What kind of pain must they be in to do this?” Because the moment you try to understand the person who did harm, you're seen as an apologist.

I don't want a free pass. I just don't want to be dehumanized. But this is just the unfortunate reality. I will forever be the subhuman monster to others. What does it matter if I only know I've kept a good heart, while everyone else holds reservations about me? What does matter if I'm philosophically not a bad person, if the result is that I still do bad things outwardly for everyone to see? A good person that is known to be a bad person by everyone but themselves might as well just be a bad person. Who I am to go up to all those people and say ""no, you are all wrong""? I'll just look like a victim of the Dunning-Kruger effect.

Sorry for my rant, and this flows terribly and is disorganized lol, but I've already spent too long rewriting some parts and I can't be bothered anymore. I hope this hits hard enough. 

"
94,2,"This was a realization I had recently and would like others' opinions because this is making me split hard. My ex used to say that he couldn't believe he pulled a [insert race] girl. He mostly watched videos of women that looked like me or were my race/ethnicity, sometimes other races but rarely. He once said that he never expected me to be attracted to a certain other race (I don't discriminate). He also said that when we first met, he mentally tried to clock my ethnicity (what kind of [insert race] is she?).

He would always say that he would never date women of his race because ""they are too crazy"" which was super ironic because I have BPD and had found that out through therapy while dating him.

I know he really cared about me, and in his mind tried his best to be a good boyfriend (he actually ended up doing a really bad job at it), but was he fetishizing me or simply just had racial biases? It's so hard to tell the difference, especially since I have black and white thinking from my BPD."
95,2,"My ex cheated on me multiple times and left me to marry someone else right after and they’re happy and it’s been 2 years and I still constantly have panic attacks and want them back. I begged for a while for closure on what was real about them wanting to get married days before and they blocked me and threatened a restraining order and told me to get the f*** over it, a week after telling me they wanted to get married and that I’m the best partner ever, then admitting to cheating and leaving me for the other person. I’ve considered transitioning because it’s spiked my gender dysphoria and I’ve been trying to change my body to get cheated on less. I can’t move on and I’ve tried therapy but they said they can’t help me. I didn’t know I had BPD at the time until 6 months ago but it hasn’t helped knowing what the root of my anxiety is. "
96,0,"Basically what the title says, I would like to know if I have BPD. Due to my home situation I am not able to go to a proper therapist/psychologist on this matter. Is there any other way I would be able to figure this out? Thank you!"
97,2,"Me and C are in a talking stage, and I'm having heavy on/off anxiety about her as she told me she's not quite ready. 

I don't have much experience at all with relationships and I've had lots of talking stages but have always had them fail besides one time where it worked for a bit.

I feel like me and her connect on a deep level; we share views on substances, having children, dating to marry, religion, politics, and our first date was 7 days ago lasting the entire day and it went so well, with hours feeling like minutes and both of us saying that we really really liked each other and wanted to continue to see where things went.

We have really good chemistry both in person and in text, and we both communicate with each other constantly. We've both said that we want to make each other feel as comfy and secure as possible and all of these things going well has given me fears of it being too good to be true.

She said she wanted to go slowly because she is a bit of a busy person and she was still not ready as she'd got out of a long term relationship a month ago, and initially she told me that she'd like to wait at least a week of us talking before talking about it again and that she thinks we'd both be ready then. 

She also said that she wasn't trying to keep me waiting that itd be ""at most a month""  however the other day, she said that she isn't really in a spot for anything super serious, can't promise where the future is going, that she keeps a part of herself protected when it comes to relationships, and that she wants to move at a pace that feels right for her, and hopes that we can find a rhythm and is saying that because she wants the best for us and really really likes me. 

I asked if my interpretation was right that she meant that she didn't know how much time it'd take for her to be ready, and that she still wanted to work towards things even after commitment, and she said yes and was really happy I understood.

She did ask for space a little bit after our first date which has me worrying a bit because we haven't been texting as much, as I find myself asking why someone would want space from someone they ""really really like"" if everything's totally fine.

I really worry about whether or not she meant that she wanted to be ready for me- as in ""I think I will be ready for you soon if things keep going well"" but I don't want to ask her this because I fear that it'll add pressure for her to choose me which I don't want to do, but since it's been on my mind for a while I plan to at least briefly mention it for affirmation. She's said multiple times she likes me a lot, enjoys spending time with me, wants to see where things go, and yesterday sent me hearts in text which was a bit new. 

I've also noticed that she seems to have trouble opening up- she's brought up a couple times that she wasn't feeling the greatest but didn't want to talk about it each time, which was totally okay to me. 

I've communicated to her about some of my anxieties and she was happy to reassure me that she still really likes me, wants to see where things go, wants me to feel safe and secure, and that she ""really wants to be with"" me which I've had to re-read over and over because of my anxiety.

I really need advice on how to manage this anxiety. I'm so afraid of losing her despite there being almost no signs of that happening. I know that our conversation about commitment was pretty fast and we both dont know how to go slowly as it turns out, but she would really like to and I want to honor that above all else.

She said that going fast has gotten her into situations before and that the right person would be worth waiting for. 

Im a hopeless romantic and always have been, and have bad abandonment issues. 

I need help managing these thoughts that keep manifesting that seem solely to hurt me. I didn't hold back my attachment because I thought that things just felt right with her. She finished my sentence when I was about to say it on our date, and afterwards my attachment went crazy and I did nothing to be careful with it which was a huge mistake I know now. 

It's been helping re-reading her texts that she likes me and everything, and writing to myself about everything as if I was giving someone else advice, but the anxiety still gets out sometimes. 

I also wanna mention that a few things making me feel like I'm being played with- is that some people online think of talking stages as not being real and that you're either committed and flirting or not, and others say that it's necessary. 

She's been honest about everything and hasn't been afraid to tell me no before, so I don't believe that she's lying to me about anything. I don't trust people easily but I trust her just because I also know it wouldn't help me to just keep feeling like she's not into me anymore despite her telling me she is. 

We've been flirting ever since our first date through text- every time I send her photos of myself she always praises me and I love it- but when talking to my friends about everything that's been going on, they tell me to be careful, and to not believe with my whole heart that she will be ready any time soon. 

I'm so incredibly frustrated with myself because I want to be there for her and not be a burden but it's so hard to manage these feelings sometimes. Past therapist didn't work and this is a new therapist so I've been having to give a lot of back story each time which hasn't allowed me to learn any new coping skills yet so :/

I just need advice and support- is there nothing to worry about? Does it really seem from the outside that she will be ready soon? Has anyone else been through something like this? How did it go? Is there anything anyone's heard that's helped them in a situation like this? 

Thank u so much in advance :))


tldr i got attached to this girl way too fast to the point where my emotions have been depending on her. with a shit ton of research and advice from friends, I've been able to manage the anxiety the past two days, but still feel kinda depressed and think about her constantly. "
98,2,"21M ,in the last 5 months or so i have realised that i have a fear of night ,where im constantly wishing it to be 6am quickly 

I have troubles falling asleep and if i do sleep I can’t get any rest for my body and wake up tired 

Sleeping in day time gives me nightmares everytime 

Is this something which anyone else has experienced? "
99,1,"I have a friend who is basically my sister. We have known each other over 20 years. She tells me she loves me but j feel sometimes it isn't true, that she is my friend out of pity and won't leave because she knows she's my only friend. I make it worse by impulsively borrowing money (which I'm trying to stop( so I wouldn't even blame her. But how do I get over myself?"
100,1,"as the title says, i think i wont attend my grandpas funeral. i feel like shit because of it. my grandpa died 4 days ago and im devastated. i cant function, im always hugging his shirt my mom brought me from grandparents house. i have bpd, adhd and i think i have autism too. im completely paralyzed by sadness, overwhelmed with crying. i can’t stop thinking about him. the reason im not attending is that i think id collapse or pass out due to too much emotions. i cant stand looking at my grandma and mom crying. i cant stand looking at the coffin, knowing that inside is my dead grandpa. i cant attend, because that would mean im saying goodbye forever. it would mean that im finishing a chapter of my life that im not ready to finish. i love him so much, he was always like my best friend. so many bright and joyful memories and moments i have with him. i cant accept hes not here anymore. "
101,3,"I don't know if I have bpd or if I just have very bad terrible bad brain disorder™ but a couple of months ago I got too attached to a friend, pulled too hard, didn't understand what was happening to me, and spun completely out of control, and it took until I did it again until I realized something was wrong and went to therapy, but I just don't know what I'm doing anymore. hours feel like days and when I'm not getting attention from my friends its like i'm pushing them all away and like they're sick of me and if I didn't send anything they'd never send anything back and would just forget about me until they needed something from me. I don't get invited to do anything, I go out of my way to make them happy, and all I want is to feel like they care about me and want me around but then they ghost me for hours or days and instead choose to play games without me and ignore me and I just don't know where the line is between something that my brain is telling me to get upset by and something that it is justifiable to be upset by. 

my therapist keeps telling me to just let these feelings flow and to not let them control me but even if I do that its not like it doesn't still keep hurting like a mother fucker and feel like i'm always going to be too much until i just one day have enough of it all. i dont understand mindfulness or acceptance and i dont understand why im not supposed to treat these feelings like theyre the enemy, like what the fuck does my feelings are valid really MEAN?? I KNOW theres a root cause and that my emotions are reasonable reactions to past trauma and the fear that itll happen again. I get it. but what difference does that make? I dont care I just want to stop feeling this way i want to go back to before i  couldnt go a week without crying to when my friends wanted me around and i didnt NEED them to want me around either. but im just expected to swallow that there is no going back and that all i can do is work on controlling myself and shutting the fuck up and not acting on my feelings and that's just the deal? what the fuck i hate this and i hate the bitch who made me feel unloved and set all of this off for me but all i want is for her and her friends to give me their attention and i want them to want me around as much as i want them around, but again im just expected to learn how to accept that they dont fucking want me that much and that my feelings and the way that i am now repels them and i have to  now fight harder than ive ever fought in my whole life and endure more than I have have to change my entire self now to have the maybe chance of potentially being liked by them, and if they still don't like me tough shit????

this is hell and i hate that this is just my life now and i just have to get the fuck over it and start working"
102,2,"I had a major panic attack a few days ago while I was at my friends house. My chest got so tight I had to run outside, I couldn’t breathe and felt so disconnected from my body, it was the most intense one I’ve ever had in my life. No amount of deep breaths were helping to ground me so my friend put a heap of ridiculously spicy hot sauce on a spoon and basically fed me it, I spent about 20 minutes gagging and feeling like I was gonna die from it, but it worked! The pain from the sauce brought me back to my body and helped me calm down quicker than I’ve ever been able to before. Genuinely can’t believe I’ve never tried this before and just wanted to share in the hope it could help somebody else ❤️"
103,3,"I swear in the moment my emotions feel so valid and so heavy and it’s like I can’t cope with them. Everything feels so real. I haven’t had an episode in so long and thought I was doing so well, then I have moments like today. Starting arguments for no real reason. I’m sick of myself and sick to my stomach. I was such a huge asshole this morning, yelling, crying, being someone I’m not just because — like a child — I can’t control myself. I feel so disgusted with myself. It’s like the second I make progress I realize that I’m just fucked in the head and you can’t change that. I feel sad and so GUILTY today"
104,1,"I was a victim of COCSA at the age of 14, and after I was broken up with four years ago I found a new guy who I was attached to. Over the relationship I kept snapping at him and associating him with my abuser but whenever I would apologize and try to leave but he would make me stay. Now months later after a breakup I'm getting messages from his friends saying I'm abusive and how awful I am and how I manipulated him, but I'm only getting therapy now. We broke up in March and now I'm getting stuff spread about me in June now. Am I a bad person? It feels like I couldn't control myself there but now I haven't had an episode but the people who I tell my struggles about seem to leave or fear me. I know it isn't an excuse having mental illness issues but it's like people don't tell me about issues they have about me until months later. "
105,3,"I (M22) just pushed my sister (F32) because she is honestly an awful human and everyone around me agrees on that. 

She just accused me of something that she always does to us and I just lost it. So I walked up to her pushed her. She didn’t fall on the ground or anything but she threatens to press charges against me. 

My father just forced me to apologize. I did it but only for my father, not because i‘m actually sorry. 

She deserves much worse lol.

106,1,"A few days ago I left a post on here regarding a situationship I’ve been stuck in for 6 months with my FP. After leaving a 5 year relationship I was approached by this person who love bombed me into being with him. About a month ago I could tell he was losing interest in me. He admitted he had been infatuated with an idealized version of me. Now he has fallen back into polyamory. I was afraid for how I’d feel when he would hook up with someone else. Now it has happened and I cannot deal with it. I have to let him go.

It’s causing me a lot of pain to do so. For the past six months we have texted every single day throughout the entire day. He showered me in compliments and idolized me. In turn I did the same. I started falling for a version of him that doesn’t exist at all.

It’s breaking me that he hooked up with someone else considering he was only seeing me for six months. I have gone the past few days without texting him. Admittedly I feel like I’m doing better than I thought I would…but I’m having lapses where I feel like hurting myself, or feel like asking for him back. 

My psychiatrist is aware and has recommended that I go to both group and individual therapy. I’m having such a hard time functioning without his constant support at nearly every second of the day. I don’t know how I’m going to be able to move on. But I cannot go on knowing he’s having sex with someone else.

I just need words of encouragement to help keep me accountable. In this moment I’m posting this as I’m having a hard time not giving in. I feel horrible that I relied on this person for everything. I genuinely don’t know how I’m going to move on. I keep telling myself that in a month I will feel better.

I would appreciate if someone could share their experience of fully letting go.

Edit: I have to admit that under normal circumstances I don’t think I would have liked him at all, let alone given him a chance. He’s not my type. I’ve given him way too many chances though out of fear of losing the security he gives me. He’s treated me very poorly in the past month. I was panicking and crying and had to ask him to give me a hug. I make a lot of noise in my sleep so he made me sleep on the couch. Just things like that. I hate myself and part of me thinks I deserve it. I thought if I kept going then maybe the idealized version I have of him would finally come out somehow.

"
107,1,"It's coming back. Slowly, bit by bit. The things I used to enjoy don't interest me anymore. I'm losing sleep and my appetite is going away too. Depression is one of the worst things, and I'm scared.  
I can't afford to go back to therapy right now (I've been on a break from my psychologist for a few months because I just can't afford it anymore, though I'm still continuing with medication).  
Do you have any helpful, practical advice? Please, nothing that involves going back to therapy — I just can't afford it at the moment."
108,2,"We had sex a week ago and it was thr first time i done it in such a long time. Now after doing it, i've been really clingy and wanting his attention. I want him to own me, have all his attention on me, i want to cuddle with him more and i feel more sensitive.

This has baffled us, think it could be bpd? "
109,2,"So, I have an issue with stalking. Particularly stalking people that has hurt me. It's only on socials tbh, like, I can never fully let go, and I think it stems from a raw desire to see them suffer like they made me suffer.
I want to see them pay.
It's not healthy, I'm embarrassed. 
I don't want to do it.
But I seems like I just can't keep myself away from it.
I want to stop."
110,1,"I (F19) have had a long battle with mental health for as long at I can remember. I have always voiced this to both family, friends and medical health professionals. However, I’ve never been believed. I’ve always known something was wrong, and felt very different from my peers. 

I saw a psychiatrist as a 15 year old, but she told me that all my struggles would go away once I started high school (this obv wasn’t the case)I was screened for ADHD, but they didn’t have the basis to set a diagnosis. My struggles weren’t followed up by the healthcare system when this wasn’t the case, so I have continued to struggle

Once I moved away from home, my mental health took a turn for the worse. Since I moved to a big city, the recourses for mental health has been a lot better. After an S attempt, a psyceward stay and a relapse on my old addiction, I finally got some much needed help. This is where I get the bpd diagnosis

A huge weight has been lifted of my shoulders, and I’m extremely motivated to get better. I will never have to ask myself ”what is wrong with me? Why can’t I just be ok, and be like other people?“. It is however hard to read about the disorder, whereas there is a lot of misinformation and people ranting about how awful and manipulative bpds are. 

It’s a very long waiting list for treatment, so im basically ranting about it, and asking people how they handle their symptoms in healthy ways? I don’t want to be seen as toxic and manipulative. I want to be better. For the people around me, and for myself❤️

111,2,"Tw: self harm

Whenever my emotions are explosive and going completely out of control then for years I would self harm and that would immediately numb everything and all my emotions, but it never resolved anything and those built up emotions just manifested into rage. I have had fiery explosive rage within me for as long as I can remember.  

Yesterday when my emotions became explosive I remembered to do TIPP and it was TERRIFYING. I had to actually ride the wave of emotions instead of numbing them out and even I didn't know my emotions could get that big. I started having a complete panic attack but I kept using healthy coping mechanisms to help me through it and after like an hour I was finally calm and actually feeling good!? like I have no rage, no stress, no anger at all?? it actually helped on way deeper levels than self harm- I think I finally get it now? 😭 but please that was actually petrifying. Does it get any easier?? "
112,2,"Hello everyone,
I recently found out about my friends bpd and I want to be there for her but I don't want to enable her disease for lack of better wording and I need advice how to healthyly deal with couple behaviors but to not hurt her.

1. Her favourite character. She has an very unhealthy obsession with a character from some game to the point of lashing out on people who don't like him, but also hating people who claim to love him as much as him. I read it can work like the favorite person thing? How can I help her with the strong emotions around this character?

2. Strong fear of abonament. I do everything to be around her as much as I can and to show her that I'll be there for her but it doesn't seem to help much. Is there anything more I can do?

3. Disagreements. Sometimes we disagree on some issues and it gets her spiriling to the worst places. Is there a healthy way to disagree with her without making her feel worse?

I want to show her support but also maintain healthy relationship. I appreciate all advice "

115,1,"I am not sure if I have BPD, my psychologist and my psychiatrist have been talking about it during our sessions, I have found out that they told my mom that the diagnosis is ""in process"". 
I am 19 years old and trans, I have spent all these years of my youth selling my dignity to people who humiliated and despised me, all because I couldn't stand the idea of being alone. But now I don't have any friends, everyone just left me.
I started to be active on reddit and talked about this lonely feeling through the lenses of a trans person, talking about how I felt people were disgusted by me and that is why they wouldn't be fond with me as they would with other people. Some people came and started talking to me, it was fun for a while, I have really nice girl friends, but then they all just left and stopped talking to me. And now I am alone again.
I feel like it doesn't really matter how hard I try, I have read articles about talking to people and being nice, I have no problem with going out of my comfort zone, I have tried everything, but every time things go back to the same status quo. It is like a curse and I feel like I don't want to try it anymore, misanthropy is just embracing me."
116,2,"I'm 15(f) and recently got diagnosed with BPD. But I've known that I have it for a while. I've been really struggling with relationships and overwhelming emotions, jealousy, insecurity, paranoia, etc. I genuinely feel like I ruin everything and I'm worried that I'll never be able to have a healthy relationship or marriage in the future because of it. I'm terrified of hurting the people I love because of the way I am, and because of my lack of emotional regulation. I don't want to rely on medication to treat it or anything, I don't even know if there's a medical treatment for BPD. What are some ways that I can help myself get better? I know I can't make it go away completely, but what can I do to help myself and prevent any further damage?"
117,3,"So me (32F) and my bf (33M) have been together for almost 3 years. In january he moved to the other side of the world because of his job. Immediately when the news came I knew that this is going to be terrible - I’ve never been in a long distance relationship and I’m not the kind of person who could be. But I was willing to give it a try because what other option did I have. I didn’t want to break up. Btw, let me tell you - we have had 1 breakup in the past but came back together after 3 months of being in NC. (he left me and he was the one who started talking to me again.) after that we moved in together and were living together for 6months. It was quite nice. Anyway right before he left I cried all night and told him that I feel like this is the end of us. He is avoidant and when problems arise he gets very silent for days. He promised that we can do it and he will not “forget me” 

The part that is making it even more difficult is the fact that we recently bought a place together and took a loan from the bank. He was supposed to be gone for 2 years but then after we had already gotten the place it came out that it will be 3+ years. He expects me to go to this country when I finish my studies in one year. I have always wanted my own family and we have talked about it a lot. The thing is - as a woman I read that it’s nearly impossible to get a job in this country as a foreigner. He told me that we would live on his money but this is against my views. 

Now we have been arguing a lot recently. We started to have very heated arguments again in the beginning of May - mostly because I got triggered because of the past (that he has already left me once) and I could sense that he goes more and more silent and emotionless. Like no flirting no “i miss you’s” no nothing during the day and when I would bring it up it would trigger his avoidance and he just goes silent for days. I told him that i feel like he wants to leave me again but he said that he doesn’t have such intentions but yet again, he is too quiet on a daily basis. I need more than that. But the more I ask - the less he can give. 

Then I finally got so triggered that I removed him from all my socials and even blocked him for a while. He recently visited our country and out home, we were trying to talk about it but we couldn’t come up with any solutions, then he left again and we kept texting on instagram. Until recently he triggered me again and I splitted really badly. And now again, we haven’t spoken for 4 days. I don’t even know what to do anymore. 

I need more validation, more emotions, because in a LDR it’s all you have. But it feels like he can’t give it to me. Btw I hate calling on the phone. And he is not good at texting because he is constantly very busy with his job. When we lived together- it was so much easier. He is not a very emotional guy via text and before it worked better because we would still see each other every day after work. But now it’s just looking at the screen, waiting for the slow replies which makes me crazy. Hence is why I removed him from my socials. In a way i feel at peace when we are fighting and don’t speak to each other for days - because then i don’t have the waiting anxiety. 

I don’t know what to do or how to go on. Any thoughts? Also, sorry for this long ass post :/"
118,3,"I'm going though something that I think might be age regression, but whenever I look up age regression online it's always regressing to a child state and wanting to be taken care of. In my case it's my teenage years (I'm 33 now). I want to be left alone, I push people away because then they won't leave me so it won't be as painful. I snap at people, I detach emotionally and I am just moody in general. I even turn to music I used to listen to as a teen.
I've been under a lot of stress for a long period of time and it is only getting worse. Recently started therapy so I am getting help.
I have other things that also have a part in this for sure (bipolar, ASPD, PPD).
But is this considered age regression? And what have you done to deal with it? It is really starting to affect my husband a lot and I don't want him to suffer."
119,1,"I am so tired of being like this, I feel numb and then I feel everything 10X more than everyone, I over complicate myself by my thoughts and somehow I attract situations that trigger the worst parts of me, I can’t stay still, I don’t know where to go, I am tired of taking pills, I am tired of finding answers. I don’t like trying and trying and just trying to be better to just fall apart again, I wish I don’t wake up. At this point it just feels like I am delaying suicide for a decade now."
120,3,"Hi! I’m not new to mental illnesses/trauma all of those sorts.. I recently had a session with my psychiatrist after a very very triggering event (episode) where my husband left for a very short trip with his dad. I felt as though the world around me was crushing, I was small, and being abandoned. I even cried heavily telling him I don’t want him to go and leave me but I wanted him to enjoy his time with his dad. He did go on that trip, and I spiraled. Nothing felt real, I mutilated my arm, and re-pierced my nose to feel something other than the overwhelming nothingness or overwhelming loneliness I went back and forth on for four days. I did talk to my psychiatrist about this since this was the first “big” episode I’ve had in a while to this sorts. She stated I was BPD symptomatic and didn’t exactly delve into that conclusion other than to explain to me the different types of symptoms portrayed in BPD. 

 I understand it doesn’t take one session, one look to say someone has BPD. Yet, I don’t understand slightly what she meant that I was symptomatic of the disorder. What exactly does that mean? I get I exhibit the symptoms but does that mean after sessions of DBG and CBT that those symptoms go away and it’s just a mix of my CPTSD and treatment resistant MDD? 

I understand too, that you all do not know my history and can’t diagnose me. Though I will say I am on six different medications to stabilize my mood, help with my depression, and treat my insomnia. I feel as though I have been through hell and back between a mother with NPD and is an alcoholic and being sexually abused since I was 4-10 nearly 11. I have a very hard time controlling my impulsivity, and have very bad moments where I rage to the point I cry and have to hit on pillows or scream. Other times within the same day or a couple of days later the thought that I am useless being a human on this earth comes to me and no one would care if I were to die. Sometimes when I lie awake in the middle of the night the feeling to just run away and start a new life somewhere else seems the most peaceful. I don’t know at this point I’m just talking to talk. I just don’t quite understand if I have the disorder or not? "
121,3,"Like honestly. I will wake up in the morning amd immediately the first thought is ""I don't WANNAAAA"" and I have to tell myself ""Ok, I know you don't want to, but you got to"" Plans changing or not being solid sends me into a tizzy because ""WHY cant someone *else* do it?!?😭 And why cant anyone figure it out""  Like GIRL. YOU'RE THE ONE WHOS HELPING MAKE THE PLANS. It's not the end of the world if things change or fall through but it feels devastating when something gets cancelled and stressful when dates are moved. 

Going out is also a lot. I'll ask my partner for a date, and be so upset prior, with absolutely nothing outside of me going on, and all I can hear in my head is ""Why are you crying?? You asked for this, you *wanted* to go out. The only one upset here is you."" I can't even say why I'm upset but god do I feel like im gonna be yelled at, and i KNOW it's irrational. I am so tired of feeling like there is a whiny kid inside of me that hates everyone and everything, even when it's something I want. My partner is so kind and gentle and understanding of me and I feel like I can't fully give them the same support when I'm trying to hold myself together. I just wish that my brain would stop throwing tantrums all the damn time so i can enjoy my life, damnit. "
122,2,"I saw that I always tend to feel drawn to abusive and controlling men, recently my FP was one he played with my feelings so hard I excused his behavior each time because I wanted to believe he was the great person he was acting but i split on him when I had enough eventually (jealousy feels like death),

Now I miss the ups and downs and the chaos and I'm currently trying to stop myself from going back, I wanna give him his own taste of medecine but revenge will probably take away my peace "
123,3,Just had a procedure done and I’m feeling absolutely like trash. My partner is annoying the F out of me. I’m running low today. My  under eyes are purple and red. I asked for help to deliver packages to the post office. My son’s saying he’s hungry and I’m like okay wait…. He had breakfast and wanted more food. I’m trying to catch up but I can’t. I feel terrible and it’s like I’m treated like nothing is wrong with me. I have a project due today and my partner said he’s exhausted…. He sleeps more than me and I get up and do laundry and dishes even after my procedure. He left a beer bottle in my son’s bathroom and he said “yeah my bad” I’m bothered about this. Like am I in the wrong or wtf . He says I need to chill out…. He always says I need to chill out. Makes me want to leave on vacation I’m exhausted my spoons are out and it’s so early .
124,2,"First off; all of this is platonic. 

The hard thing is; every single time I’ve had a favorite person, they’d be a family-like figure to me. 

My current favorite person showers me with attention, and baby-talks me. Prioritizes me over everyone else, and makes sure that I’m always okay. 

I told them how ashamed I am of age regressing, they reassured me and told me it was a completely okay thing to do. 

That was the first time I’ve ever told someone that I age regress. To be fair, I was batshit drunk when I told them that but since that I’ve been drinking a little bit less. 


I’m scared of having a favorite person again, I know how unhealthy it can get. "
125,1,"TW for (brief) mention of suicidal ideation.

I’m really struggling right now and could use support or just to feel less alone. My BPD symptoms are the worst they’ve been in years, and I feel like I’m losing my mind. I’m back to suicidal ideation and every day feels like a fight just to stay afloat.

I’m in a polyamorous relationship structure with two partners and being poly aligns with my values but my nervous system is completely overwhelmed. My attachment to one of my boyfriends has become so intense that I feel obsessed. I can’t stop thinking about him, where he is, what he’s doing, who he might be with. Every time he doesn’t reply quickly, my brain spirals and I start thinking stupid things like I don’t matter, he prefers someone else, he’s bored of me, or I did something wrong.

I hate how much reassurance I need. I ask things like “Am I an important part of your life?” and then compulsively check if he’s read or replied yet. If he hasn’t, I spiral even more. The worst part is, I know logically that he cares because he shows me love, he tells me that my emotional honesty helps him support me better and gives me so much reassurance. But I can’t feel any of that when I’m dysregulated. I just feel like a burden and like people would be better off without me.

I feel like I’m betraying the kind of relationship I want to have. I believe in polyamory. I want to support my partners’ other connections. But my trauma brain won’t let me. It’s like my whole system is screaming that I’m about to be abandoned, even when I’m not.

What makes this worse is that I’m also dealing with intense depression. I have no energy to do anything. I feel sick at the thought of food, like my whole body is shutting down from emotional stress.

I’m trying. I’m doing therapy, journalling, DBT skills. I’m trying to hang on. But this intensity feels unbearable right now. I’ve tried citalopram, sertraline, and now quetiapine from medications but nothing has helped me feel stable long-term which is what I really need.

If anyone has been through something like this and made it through I would really appreciate hearing from you. I need to know it can get better. Because right now, I feel like I have nothing left.
"
126,2,"as a disclaimer, my partner is disabled and experiences chronic fatigue, which i am aware of. my girlfriend (22) and i (22) recently started dating this past month. things have been good. we come from very different dating backgrounds, as she's never had a long-term relationship last longer than a month or so. i was in a relationship for four years before it ended, and then after about 9mo i started to date my most recent ex for just under a year.  my girlfriend and i started dating this may 21st. 

since then, there have been a few things that have made me feel less considered. i expressed some of these worries and concerns, but i've also chalked most of it up to her not being used to this kind of romantic dynamic. but for me, the most pressing things have been her poor time management and the fact that most of the plans we make, she ends up cancelling. most specifically the ones involving my friends. 

she's only met them once since we began seeing each other, and it was a very awkward setting to meet and get to know someone. so i've been really wanting us all to hang out properly. we've made several plans to do so but she's cancelled on all of them. we made plans this weekend to go shopping for pride and then play mario party at her house. 

she sent me a text today saying she's suddenly craving isolation and has the urge to go back to her ""more predictable life"" from before, and that she wants to cancel the mario party plans. she did say that she knows this is just her wanting to return to a familiar pattern, and that she still wants to see *me*. but i cant help but feel utterly disappointed once again, and i'm not sure if i'm valid in this feeling. i want to support her and validate her, and i don't want her to feel pressured fo be apart of things she's not comfortable being apart of. but her saying she's craving isolation and wants to go back to before makes me feel a deep sense of rejection, and i want to pull away and tell her that i think i should give her space so neither of us get hurt. i don't want to cancel on my friends anymore, and i don't want to make her feel like i'm leaving her alone. but this was so important to me and i just don't know if i'm able to completely move on from this after being let down so many times. "
127,1,"what kind of existence is this. i had below average trust in my self before now its almost nothing. this week i figured out i have it, moderate to severe, prob leaning towards severe. untreated BPD runs so fucking deep. I have absolutely zero pride in this, being BPD is not a personality trait and I’ve been confusing my extremities with character and feminitity when actually, im just a character. seeing other bpd ppl being their emotionally intense, unleashed self with low self awareness and untapped/incorrect empathy, makes me just want to scorch this disease in my brain even more. i feel this even when they aren’t being flagrant, they dont have to be causing trouble.. even when they are being viewed in a positive light for their more bpd actions, i just sit there, seeing myself in them, hating this part of me even stronger. because even if they are being interesting, so much of the time they/we are doing an action that they/we wouldn’t do if they grasped something everyone else in the room grasped. impaired empathy + much less controlable emotions = fml

This shit runs so deep. A) all the micro levels of the deductive reasoning i made every day, most hours of my life… can’t be trusted B) I am a very bright person, I learn things fast, i am skilled at many things. C) But once my emotions, my needs, and/or my traumas, etc, are in play, it doesn’t matter if im smart—the dots dont connect and i make so many decisions againsts my interests. its like my prefrontal cortext gets drowned in brandy or something.

How many life decisions would be different if I just knew about this earlier? How many personality traits would be different, how different would my interests be, *how many friends would’ve stayed how many SAs could I have avoided, how many years of masculinization could have been avoided.* As I understand BPD more and learn its causes and treatments, I can’t even dissociate anymore because i literally don’t have to theres no need; my default state is now: [this emotion i’m feeling is way too intense, way too little, or the wrong emotion made from illogical reasoning habits] bc thats how often my emotions are bpd and i know they are. i know it might look like im just dissociating from high stress, or im labeling too many things as bpd, but idk. somethings different this time. its like, im a slave, my brain is my slavemaster, but now, my slavemaster just entered stage 5 dementia. “yes i already picked the cotton also this isn’t mississippi its africa and UR actually MY slave so you can stop beating me now” and it actually works consistently now, they stop beating me. but 20 years of enslavement + all these other life/mental hurdles leaves me hollow to say the least, and im still stuck on this plantation atm. and my wounds are infected. and my family is like, uncle tom house slaves (??).

this wasnt a week of research causing the red-bpd-scare in my psyche, this is years of progress finally paying off (also my bpd largely ended my long term relationship) …but i thought the years of work were going towards a better career or sum, i didn’t know it was leading to waking up from the fucking matrix. this might be a bigger kick to the head then realizing im trans. dysphoria, trans in transphobic world, and growing up as my opposite gender is awful and scarring, but bpd might’ve held me back more than girl in boy body. idk. idk so much now. thats my vent. idek what advice im hoping for."
128,2,I don't really know what to say except that I walk away at the slightest disrespect I feel from someone even if it wasn't their intention I can't help but feel like people hang out with me only out of pity so I had to learn to walk away first 
129,1,"It’s been 4 months since the breakup. I’ve had moments where I thought I was healing, where I could finally breathe without feeling like something was crushing my chest. But today? It’s like I’m drowning all over again. Out of nowhere, everything came crashing back.

This only happened during the first couple weeks after we ended things. Since then, I was slowly getting better. But today, while I was at work, I thought about her, and not in a random way. I’ve thought about her every single day since I met her. But this time… my chest kept tightening and tightening until I genuinely thought I might die.

I made a post about her a few days ago. Maybe that stirred things up again. Maybe putting it all into words brought it all back harder. I don’t know. But I feel like I’m falling apart again.

I still love her. I want her to have the best life possible. I want her to be happy, protected, spoiled, even if she never knows I had anything to do with it. Even if I never see her again. I don’t want to date her. She'll just end up miserable again, I don’t even want her to know I still care this much. But I do.

And I keep asking myself if that's making me a creep. Am I weird for still feeling this deeply for someone who’s already gone? People say, “You’ll find someone better,” but if that were true, I wouldn’t be stuck like this.

I can’t be the only one who’s been through this. If you’ve ever been in my shoes, how the hell do I make it stop?"
130,2,"I didn't expect her to tell me this at the end of our previous session, but it left me feeling shocked and sad.  I was already struggling to find a therapist after I had to drop my previous one due to my insurance no longer accepting appointments, so finding the one I have now was a godsend, and she's been nothing short of amazing.  She really helped me through my breakup, and actually listened to me and helped me through my problems instead of making excuses for me like my last therapist did.  So when she told me she put in her two-week notice with the company who set her up with me, I was left stunned.  

Thankfully she said she would help me with my options for the future, and I still have my DBT group, but it's just...so heartbreaking to be losing someone who I thought was finally the perfect fit for me.  I have been doing so well as of late, I'm so terrified of regressing back to the person I was when I met her.."
131,3,"   Sooo I used to have this old friendgroup but we all fall apart because of an argument and I'm really lonely. Then I meet this narssictic man who's one year older than me. We both always talked about this new obsession game I have together. I immediately got attached to him. We both started matching profile pictures together and even flirted together just couple days after our first encounter.
   We always in call together then out of the sudden he invited someone in our vc. I was thinking oh well maybe that's his friend so idm as long as he's here with me. But then he kept giving his friend attention and I got VERY VERY jealous. I didn't say much I just stayed quiet. I felt left out. Sometimes I would just leave the VC and they didn't care.
    One day I found out the guy he invited was his boyfriend and I fell into big depression episode. I can't stop thinking about him. Even after finding out he has a boyfriend I still contact him. Talking to him in vc. I stopped flirted with him but he keep teasing me and I feel like I'm going crazy. I wanted to leave him but I only have him. I waited for him til morning without sleep even on my shifts day I just need his attention.
   At last I confessed to his boyfriend that I used to have crush on the guy. A day after, he called me and suddenly being overly sexual and flirtatious with me. telling me how much I wanted him and I need him. Turns out his boyfriend told him that I liked him so wow I got sad and mad yk. 
   He even embarrassed me infront of my old friendgroup that I'm so in love with him. Telling everyone that I'm trying to take him away from the boyfriend. Isn't it crazy that he didn't see himself also in the wrong place by cheating on his boyfriend with me? Turns out he always cheat on his boyfriend but the boy never leaves him.
   It was almost two years situation but I can never forget it. I feel like an asshole, I feel like I'm trying to snatch someone's boyfriend but I'm just really.. attached. What I did was wrong, I apologise to the boyfriend and immediately cut everyone off. I just can't stop crying how pathetic and dumb I was in that situation"
132,2,"Hi, I recently got diagnosed and I'm trying to understand it a little more. Was wondering if maybe someone else experiences what I do and am interested in other experiences as well. For example for me it's things like huge problems with time management. Whenever I try to do something I get distracted or remember other things to do and end up spending 2.5h on a 30min task. Because of that I'm always late everywhere no matter what. I can wake up 2h early and still be late and also barely meet deadlines. Other than that I daydream a lot. Already as a child I would sometimes get up in the middle of playing with other kids and go into a corner to play with myself in my own little world. I also spent all of my teenage years daydreaming my perfect life all of the time. I had everything thought out. What I wish I looked like, family, hobbies, school, friends, everything. I'd get obsessed with anime, tv series and book worlds and characters and often imagine I'm there and the characters are my family/friends/partner. I'm 24 and still sometimes pretend my life is not mine when alone. Also nightmares and trouble sleeping? I'm taking two separate medications from my psychiatrist to be able to fall asleep and sleep through the night without nightmares and it still doesn't work everyday. But I need to be asleep before 1 o'clock otherwise I get into a depressive episode with the worst suicidal thoughts. I also can't help repeating myself when talking and talk loudly and fast without noticing. All of that next to almost all of the regular BPD symptoms of course. I'm genuinely wondering if any of that is connected or if I'm just weird. And please share any experiences you may have!"
133,0,"im posting this on here bc i know a lot of people with BPD also have eating disorders. I just wanna wanna know if those who took olanzapine for BPD related anxiety if they also had their binge eating get worse.. i would love to hear your opinions guys, thank you"

135,1,"I had a falling out with my FP

(I told them I loved them, they told me they needed time to think about it, I waited for like 9 months, they got a boyfriend in the interim, never told me, found out due to other circumstances, no actual conversation about it was had, I feel like I have no closure).

I was friends with this person for years and they told me that they care that they’d be here. And I just fucking believed them and I’m the one who’s fucked up now. I just want to be normal, I want to fucking move past this but I can’t, it’s been a year and I can’t help but want to know if they even fucking liked me. And we didn't even have a fight I dont know if he even knows why I might be mad at him, but I can't talk about it without self combusting

And I don’t even know how I could try to feel better, I’m sober. I have a social life, I’m in school, I’m getting through the day and trying to have a future but it doesn’t fucking get easier. It doesn’t stop burning. I know closure is bullshit I know they hurt me really fucking badly but I miss them. It makes me feel so fucking pathetic but there’s not a single day that goes by where I don’t want to see them again. Hear the way that he wheezes a little before laughing, the cracks in their hands, I just want to move on. I’m trying so hard not to relapse, talk to him, or SH, but I just feel it under my skin. I just want to scream so loud my vocal cords snap.

I’m just tired, it feels like I’ve had to let go of everyone I’ve ever loved. I just want to hold something and keep it for once.

And what grinds my gears is that despite all the heartbreak, the turmoil, the splitting, I do love him. I just want him to be happy, and if that’s how I convince myself to stay away that’s fine, I can live with that. But I’m tired of wondering if the people I love even liked being around me"
136,2,"Trying to understand and help my son. He’s 19.
He’s afraid of losing his job. He becomes paranoid to the point where he feels like coworkers and or boss can hear his negative thoughts. This only happens at work. He lost his job a couple of years ago and is fearful he’ll lose this one. I’ve can usually reassure him and talk him down. He’s always so stressed after work. He’s unofficially diagnosed with BPD. He meets all of the symptoms. Can be grandiose. Not sure of who he is. Can easily adapt to a character that he’s seen on television. Though it’s short lived and he jokes about it. Feels everything. Very intense emotions. Friendless 😓. Believes he will be abandoned by potential friend. If someone doesn’t return his call or text  right away, he thinks they have cut him off. Diagnosed with autism and adhd as a young child. Paces a lot. Diagnosed with GAD in middle school.

I’m already passed when he says “ma’am can I check an item on your receipt?” I was in the middle of the double set of doors when I realized he was probably talking to me. 
When I got to my car I noticed he was standing outside with paperwork and looking around. I feel like he thinks I stole something and is going to go looking into it or maybe wrote my license plate number down when I left. Idk I’m just anxious for no good reason "

I’m getting very afraid of negatively affecting the people around me and screwing up, so I want to try and be more self aware about my own feelings. Unfortunately not in a place to seek professional guidance, but I have tried journaling/writing down my thoughts, which I think has been helping. Sometimes it’s just not quite enough though.

In the beginning I thought he Must be the one because he was (in my opinion back then) the only one who could truly understand me and Connect with me, because of his BPD. At that time I was in a really Bad State but 2 years therapy really helped me and now I feel like my BPD is almost Never Even occuring anymore. Over the years I Regularly was questioning the whole relationship, every 3-6 months or so. Communication between us is still very difficult but I felt like we always in some way worked on that doubts. But they keep coming back and I am not sure if I can Trust myself with that. I tend to Push people away when I feel like they are not truly interested in me or getting to close.

How can I find out if my doubts are valid or if This is just my BPD/trauma trying to sabotage everything? Thanks for your thoughts on this, First time posting something here 🤗

Edit: the reason of my doubts is That I Feel Like I can Not Trust him fully for being there for me, that I always feel responsible for him and that we are so different personality-wise. I am a very positive Person who seeks joy and improvement in life and I feel like he is the complete opposite. He is always so negative about the world and his surroundings and I would just love to have a Partner that is as pragmatic and optimistic as me. Also we have almost no Shared interests - I like to go out with Friends, be Creative and chaotic, he prefers to stay home to read, Game, etc. What makes it difficult for me is that I don’t feel like we are embracing These differencies but rather endure it. After years of work he is Fine with me going out without him and having my Social life without him but we just alienated so much through that. He also never went to therapy for longer than a few weeks so I also feel Like all the work lies on me to make the relationship get to a better Point. I just feel like he is rather baffling me in living my life to the fullest than supporting me in becoming a better Person. And I feel like a complete asshole and arrogant piece of s* because of that because I truly love him and want him to be happy and would really want to make it work somehow. "
143,1,"I've been with my husband who has BPD for over 6 years. Last week he's been having intense dissociative/manic/depressive episodes and splitting on me like hell, but after regulating he never stopped being affectionate. 2 days ago he was telling me I'm the only one he can be this close with. We have a 2 year old girl.

Today, after saying really cruel things to me during the night (those specially tailored to hit my self steem, so much I assumed it was just him doing self sabotage) we talked for a while when he was calm and he told me that he wants to break up because he feels nothing at the moment and has been faking everything for a while (I find it really hard to believe this).

This hurts like hell and I just wanted to know if any other person with BPD can confirm if it seems like the end of our relationship or it's something he could walk back on.

He said we can still be friends and co parents but that we won't have physical contact and he doesn't know if he'll ever feel love towards me again.

It just seems surreal considering how affectionate he's been, to have him change so much overnight. Oh, and also he has considerable memory gaps in which he rewrites our arguments or conversations based on his feelings at the moment. He doesn't remember me being kind during an argument, only that it pissed him off and therefore I must have behaved in a bad way."
144,1,I 19M lost my FP 21F. We were friends for 5 years and she was my first FP ever. I feel like i have lost the most important thing in my life. Cant stop thinking about her. Its the worst feeling i've ever had. Sorry i Had to Post this maybe someone has experienced similar situations 
145,3,"I need help I think I’m a toxic partner but my partner doesn’t seem to think so. I got really upset yesterday cus I felt like they were being distant and when i brought it up I felt like they didn’t take my concerns seriously, once I was done with my episode I just kept telling them how much I loved them and what they did that made me happy. I’m struggling with feeling like they just don’t understand and being pissed off and wanting to pull away and feeling like I’m a burden and an annoyance and how they’d be better off without me and then feeling like I need them to be ok and then I’ll be ok and normal but I don’t know how to handle my episodes and still be an ok partner during my episodes. They don’t hold it against me and aren’t mad or upset with me because of them or if they are they don’t say they are. 

I don’t want to hurt them just because something is wrong with me but I believe so strongly in my feelings even if I know I’m being crazy. I can’t help feeling bad and I will text them a lot if I feel like they are pulling away I know I’m being crazy but I can’t help it. I just hate the feeling and I want to do anything to make it go away. I love them I don’t wanna hurt them, how can I be an ok partner when I feel like this when all I can do is feel like I’m fucking up and feeling like I’m gonna ruin them. I hate that they are so understanding I wish they’d get mad at me.

How do I know what’s toxic? How do I stop the toxic behavior? What do I do? I love them and I don’t want to hurt them."

147,3,"CW: Mention of eating disorder/self harm.

Hi! I’m diagnosed BPD, a 23 year old woman, and actively in therapy - sort of. 

I usually to go to therapy once a week to do shadow work and try to navigate my daily life. My current therapist is awesome and shes the one who clocked my BPD after 5 years of being misdiagnosed as a rainbow of other things. I unfortunately had to temporarily stop going for roughly a month because I ended up losing my job and couldnt afford it. About 8 months ago, I got a boyfriend who’s very healthy and incredibly patient with me. Its very hard for me to truly understand that he loves me for me and not what I can provide. I have a long history of ex boyfriends who weren’t always honest, my longest relationship being one year. I know I was part of the problem in those relationships, but they were just genuinely, mostly, shitty people. Not all, though. 

Anyway, I got on birth control recently. I have Nexplanon, the little stick that goes in your arm. Its good for three years. I’ve had birth control before and usually I’m all out of sorts for about a month or so, sometimes longer depending on my situation. Recently, I feel like I’m constantly splitting, spiraling, and always having some kind of issue.

Now, my home situation already isn’t the easiest. I’m poor, live from paycheck to paycheck, and can barely afford to keep food in the house. My boyfriend has been very helpful in making sure I eat daily and that I have a hot shower at least once a week. Currently, the only working shower in the house is inside the room of someone who has serious anger issues and an untreated victim complex. The house is usually tense, and theres a big rift between almost everyone. I’m trying to get out, but its difficult to keep a savings since the head of household is a financial leech. 

My boyfriend is also going through a lot. He just got his first 9-5 job about 6-ish months ago. He had been looking for months to find something and unfortunately the only workplace that even offered to hire him isn’t healthy. He’s typically stressed and he’s having a hard time acclimating to the typical draining work-life balance struggle. His anxiety has spiked since this job, though normally its just physical, not mental. Recently, he’s been having a harder time than usual. He claims its his sleep schedule, as he’s usually exhausted when he comes home. He says his quality of sleep is poor, and hasn’t been able to stay asleep. Sleep aid and melatonin make him groggy all day, which it does with me too. He doesn’t want to socialize with anyone when he’s this stressed out. Which I can’t blame him, as I feel the same when I’m stressed out from work too. 

Now that you have that prior knowledge, you can clearly see that we’re both going through a lot right now. He has a habit of isolating himself when he’s stressed like this. He’s introverted. I can confirm this as he’s not hanging out with his friends at all who I’m involved with as well. He still talks to me, however. 

One of my triggers is isolation. A lot of my exes wouldn’t communicate well, and they’d often begin pulling away and spending less time with me until one of us ultimately pulled the preverbal trigger. My current boyfriend is usually very honest with me and he tells me if something I do hurts him or makes him upset, which then we try to work it out together and find a solution. He does the same if I bring something up to him. 

Typically I can handle myself relatively well when he isolates. I have coping mechanisms, I can usually distract myself and I don’t feel he doesn’t love me any less. 

Until this goddamn birth control. 

Yes, we were both stressed, but we were handling it well until I got this stick in my arm. I’m medicated with Guanfacine. Its a non-stimulant drug usually prescribed to kids with ADHD, which I have. In adults, its used as a blood pressure stabilizer. I take 2mg a day and it helps to keep my stress down and my emotions easier to handle for me. Right now it feels like it does NOTHING. I’m tweaking what feels like every night. My poor boyfriend cant catch a BREAK. I’m constantly splitting (mostly on him), forgetting my coping mechanisms, and having suicidal ideations. I’m falling back into my old habit of starving myself as a way to punish myself. I feel myself getting more clingy and obsessive, checking my phone constantly and being on edge.

I feel so helpless and like I’ve failed. I know he’s going through a lot right now and I want to be there to support him in any way I can, but this fucking birth control mixed with my own issues is making it so hard keep my BPD in check. He tries to be there for me, tries to give me advice and reassure me, but its never enough anymore. It feels like I’m back at square one. I’m constantly worried he’s going to leave me and thus I want to leave first. My abandonment issues have been flaring up so bad and I keep slipping into a horrible mindset. 

Does anyone know what works for you when you get like this? Is it the birth control? Is it the fact that I haven’t been consistent with therapy recently? Or is it a multitude of things just happening all together? I’d really like some advice on how y’all deal with your episodes. I’ve gotten to the point where I stick my face in a bowl of ice water. It seems to help snap me back to reality and allow me to regulate my emotions easier. I heard putting salt on your tongue works too. Luckily I see my therapist tomorrow. Now that I’m back to a normal work schedule, I can start to regularly see her again. 

Thank you for reading, I know its a bible lol.

TLDR: I just got on birth control 3 weeks ago. My boyfriend and I are both going through our own stuff. I haven’t seen my therapist in over a month. My BPD is going insane and I really want advice on how to keep myself stabilized. "
148,2,"Hi! This is my first post on reddit and I really don't know how this works lol. I'm 19 and since my mother passed away when I was 15 I've been in a dissociative trance. The best way to describe how I feel is I constantly feel drunk/dizzy/on autopilot but this get extremely worsened in shopping centers (specifically) or where there's too much white/brightness. I'm a severe hyperchondriac alongside having BPD and I just genuinely feel like im the only person in the world going through this and it's scary. It literally feels as though my eyes are in poor condition and they can't keep up with the world??? Please does anybody understand? Sorry if this post is common in this community, I'm not too sure how reddit works. :) thank you "
149,3,Does anyone get physical pains due to BPD? I tend to get chest pains after nightmares which don’t go away for the rest of the day . I’ve tried  using DBT tools and others but nothing seems to be working other than smoking pot. I hate smoking and want some other alternative. Are there any tablets that target these physical pains caused by mental stimulation? I’m losing my mind dealing with the pain
150,1,"my bpd triggers are so ridiculously annoying, i see an attractive authoritative man and suddenly i'm suic!dal and i wanna die now and i'm going crazy and my chest is tight and i feel suffocated and i feel intense emotions i cannot really describe, and its really sad cause i'm a gay boy in saudi and not a pretty one too so i'll never be loved except for my body and that's it.. and meds they don't work istg its like chugging candy not strong psych meds.. i don't know how long i can take this"
151,1,"it is so so hard wanting to be around someone who doesn’t want much to do with you. especially when you’re used to being closer than you are right now. i feel so pathetic. waiting hours for a text makes me sick and keeps me stuck sitting there waiting, completely unable to do anything. i hate not being wanted by the one person capable of making me feel better when im sad and alone. i hate having no one to talk to and i hate that im so upset at a completely reasonable wish for some distance. i just don’t want to be in my own head anymore. i’m a bad person  and i feel like i ruin everything i ever get involved with "
152,2,"I've never met my FP in person, but we talk on Instagram and we also write letters to each other. We both know what we look like and have even called each other once. It's supposed to be a platonic relationship, but I'm so obsessed with her and I really wish I could meet her. My whole view of in person relationships has changed. I feel bitter that there are so many random people I interact with in person, but if I could meet my FP I'd finally find peace. She doesn't live too far from me, although it's a different country, and she said maybe we could meet in the future. 

I often try to find other women to be friends with to distract myself, but I don't feel anything with them. "
153,1,"I know for a fact my girlfriend truly loves me. The way her eyes glow when she looks at me is unmistakable, and she wants to spend all of her time with me. There can be no doubt about it at all, in real life.

I've never felt it. I see the loving eyes and feel nothing, other than the confusion of, ""wait, shouldn't I be feeling something here?! Where is the feeling!???!"" I can hug her, and similarly feel absolutely nothing. When I see her face, there is no warm fuzzies, and when she tells me she loves me, there is no warm fuzzies. 

I think I care about her a lot. I think about her all the time. She's my FP. I feel negative things when she's hurting, I'm scared of her leaving me, I really want her to do well in life, etc. But the warm heart feelings just feel absent altogether, and it scares the shit out of me. I feel like a broken human being, with a cold, broken heart. 

Anyone else?"
154,2,"Hey guys, I need advice on something and, although my therapist helps a lot, we focus much more on improoving my self esteem on the long run and I need advice for the short run, if that makes sense. I have been noticing for a while that, even though I can handle other people's feelings and give advice pretty well (for the most part) when it comes to my FP it's way harder. I just can't stand to see her in pain and it triggers me, yesterday I kind of spiraled because of it, and it hurts because I want to help my friend the way she also helps me. I asked advice for her but unfortunately she also wasn't sure on how to help me so now I am using my internet powers.   
Do you guys have any advice on how to separate your feeling from your FP's feelings? When someone is in pain, I can help them; but when my FP is in pain, I feel the same pain and it paralyzes me. I pride myself in being there for my friends but most importantly, I want to not be triggered by the feelings of others, specially when they are small complaints rather than something serious. If you guys know some way to calm myself down in the moment and actively separate our feelings, I'd be so thankful!!"
155,3,"TW. SUICIDAL IDEATION

I'm not sur​e if this is a common BPD thing, or just something personal of mine. Either way, I think this is more akin to the type of BPD I have (""Quiet"" BPD) rather than everything else ​

Recently, I've been getting more and more shitty at masking my episodes and overly erratic emotions. Before I'd always make sure no one ever saw that side of me, and I guess it made me out to be this ""calm"" and ""overly understanding​"" girl. But it seems now somethings just changed, and I cant bother to bottle up everything anymore. I still make sure to ""control"" myself when I have outbursts, but I guess it's more obvious now when something's upset me or triggered me. Thing is, none of these changes have been received well by the people around me.

Even if I've become more erratic, I've started to be more assertive when others have purposely upset me. And suddenly, I'M the crazy one. It sounds weird but believe me when I saw I make sure my outbursts are kept to a minimum where they can just be taken as me trying to communicate, and it always fucking ends in me being gaslit for getting upset over reasonable stuff. For example, a friend of mines has been recently treating me like shit, and when I split on him and told him he's making me feel horrible, he has the GALL to say I'm making shit up.

I don't know if I sound insane or unreasonable (or if this is an actual BPD thing)​ but I feel so upset to the point it makes me want to kill myself. I've recently started to write final letters to the few people who ACTUALLY care about me in case I just decide to pull the trigger.​ It's dumb, but I can't live feeling like nothing I say matters to other people. Any advice?"
156,1,"I am really confused, I don’t know whether I love or hate who, I don’t even know if I am able to love in this state or not, and even the people I hate, it is not just normal hatred, there is hidden anger behind it from the person himself, from my family and the people  who hurt me and everything, all of this with brokenness, weakness and pain, and I try to hide them behind a transparent curtain that the blind might notice and understand.
The fact that I have this disorder and am unable to love makes me doubt any feelings I have towards someone dear to me, or rather, I claim that he is like that, and I doubt the credibility of every word I say, “I love you,” or any other words that indicate my feelings and emotions towards someone.And I actually confirm this from my actions and feelings, for example when this person does something that upsets me, annoys me, doesn’t do what I want, doesn’t care about me as much as I need him to and I give him, or whatever the situation, at that time I feel hatred and a lack of acceptance of anyone.

Every time I feel like I start to hate myself more. How could I have been like that a while ago, maybe just a few minutes ago, I was telling him that I love him and expressing my feelings towards him Then at the same time, I find myself feeling hatred towards him, despite my attempts not to admit it, under the pretext that it might be normal anger.
The idea that we have been in a friendship with a girl for about two years, and almost every now and then (when I feel strong feelings and a great rush towards her for no reason) I keep telling her that I love her and things like that, then when I get upset I feel hatred towards her, which means that I All this time I was lying to her and making her believe that I loved her and cared about her beyond belief and that I would do anything she asked of me. “She asked me for simple things, but I meant that I had the choice to refuse, but I never refused.” She thought that I… I do this because I love her, yes part of my intention is for her, but the main idea is that I want her to love me, care about me, and do what I want for her, just like I do. “I always wait for people to give me as much feelings as I gave them, especially attention, but not once Fate got what I wanted .” The idea that I delude her with all of this until she told me that I have become very important in her life and that I am the best among all the people she knows, but at the same time, thoughts sometimes come to me that I should leave her because I feel that I am a bit restricted when, for example, I want to  hurt myself She was like a barrier, and I became annoyed by this, and the main reason is that she doesn’t deserve a person like me, a liar, a scoundrel, and a sick person.
All of the above, especially my lies and my loving words to her, most of the time they don’t mean anything to her from my heart, but I might have gotten used to saying them, and that everything is basically just attachment. Is there anything else besides the feeling of attachment in the life of someone with BPD?Even if I talked to him once in my life, I would have become attached to him😂All this makes me realize how mean, selfish and bad I am. 

I hate this so much and I hate it even more that I can't love I want to love and be loved even once in my life. I want to feel this sweet feeling, to the point that I even want to feel its pain and sorrow, the pain of pure jealousy, not the pain of possessiveness, the pain of love, not the pain of attachment. All of his pain is definitely a hundred times easier than my pain now.I want to feel something I have never felt in my life: security, stability and reassurance. A feeling that no matter what you do or will do, this person will not leave you or hate you. A feeling that you can tell me or do what you want without fear or worry of being misunderstood. The feeling of credibility and that the words come from the heart, not only for me but also for those in front of me, that there is no doubt in every letter and every word he said and says and that it really comes from his heart and he really feels it, he doesn’t just say it by mouth With the intention of pity ,consolation or comfort me


I am very sorry for the long post, and I know that many people will not read it or will not be able to read it completely, but although I have written a lot, there are still many things inside me that have not been said."
157,2,"I overthink everything my boyfriend does and I’m losing my mind. He put his phone on the floor to charge last night rather than on the bedside table like he normally does. Something so mundane and minor and yet, my brain is going “HES HIDING SOMETHING OR HES CHEATING” he has never cheated on me and I’ve never had reason to ever be suspicious about anything. I have access to whatever I want in his phone, yet my brain just won’t let shit go. Obviously this is one example but it’s constant and I’m tired of living like this. I feel helpless. "
158,3,"Edit: I just talked to her and she said “I know we have a lot of love for each other” and I said why do you make me to be a villain when I did nothing to you? Her response is that I did it in her presence. I am no longer allowed to express emotion in her presence.

I’m unwell and need to be in hospital as my depression is getting worse. my doctor told me I need a referral for the hospital. I couldn’t get one Monday so I had one today. We are on the way there and I realise I booked it for the wrong place. I’m upset and trying to figure out what to do. My nan says she’s been fucked around before by doctors and I probably won’t get the referral from a new doctor. I say ok let’s go home then. She pulls over and I think wait maybe they can do the referral, so I ask if we can still go and try. She mentions her hip pain and the issues she’s been having and I remember how much of a burden I am to her, she pays for most things as I’m struggling a lot. So I say ok let’s go home then. She pulls over and says no let’s sort this out. I’m already upset at this point and she’s trying to make me figure this all out right now after I already canceled the doctor. Whyy couldn’t we just go home and sort this out? I feel rushed, frustrated and above all I hate myself for making such a stupid mistake. I scream and have a bit of a crash out at myself, no words directed toward her and was not aggressive towards her. I’m just screaming in frustration about my situation. She then starts shaking and crying calling me abusive and I said “can we please just go home that’s all I’ve been saying for the past 10 minutes” she eventually takes me home where I can calm down and sort it out. 

Later I went out to her to talk about my plans for the week and she’s just opposing everything I say, I say a shirt doesn’t fit as I’ve gained weight and she goes, no you haven’t, you fluctuate weight. Trying to make me feel better about it but it is simply not true. I haven’t fluctuated in over 6 months, I say this and she said, “you know I’m still shaken up and in shock at your outburst today” now I understand, me having an emotional response at myself with her present has traumatised her and she no longer sees me as safe. 

I have hospital next Monday and plans this week except Thursday but I think I’m gonna find somewhere to stay Thursday and give her space. 
I’m also not going to allow her to see me in hospital if I’m so abusive and horrible

Just want some opinions on whether I’m an abuser or not. I don’t mind negative comments, it’s likely something I’ve said to myself. And I have a plan to punish myself for my actions so don’t worry about that "
159,1,"I obviously can't keep telling my friends every single time I try to kill myself. That is a bit evil. They don't need to know all that and it would be pretty manipulative and horrible of me to keep bringing it up. But man I just feel so fucking alone. And I'm honestly starting to expect I might genuinely be immortal. It's becoming near impossible to talk to my friends due to how much my current mental state is just ""SUICIDE SUICIDE SUICIDE SUICIDE"", I feel like I'm on a completely different planet from them at this point. Like I feel like I've already died maybe. I don't even feel like a human being anymore"
160,0,"Hey yall! 
So i've seen people share similar experiences regarding long lasting depression and BPD (months or years) and I wondered if you guys get muted symptoms during this happening? Like you don't feel as unstable or when you get triggered you don't have the emotional capacity to feel those intense emotions? "
161,1,Do any of you love someone so much that when you think about them it causes you pain and you want to cry? I experienced this with certain people. Like I would lay down my life for them. Would someone you feel this way about be considered a favorite person?
162,2,"I met the girl i very much dearly like about a week and half ago and since then she has said she has been feeling down a lot of the time and the other day as she still lives with her ex she did mention he had shouted at her (which I very much was sad about that someone did be like that to her) because of the dog. She was texting more before that saying she was depressed but since the shouting incident she has been not responding to my messages. I did send one earlier which was kind and I explained I am here for her always and how much I do care deeply about her and it’s okay if not ready to talk. I feel as they since she got shouted out she may have had a “split” I am new to bpd info so forgive me if I say the wrong words although I have very much taken a lot of time to read into it as I want to be with her. At the start of the week she also did mention wanting to be away from her place. I assume it’s her ex still living with her which is causing her to not be feeling good but due to having a dog together and been known for 10 years but not been out for a year now and I think it’s hard for her to want to leave maybe as she may still feel as though she needs him. I am assuming that. Also I don’t feel as though he does treat her with respect, calm and understanding which one should have when with someone who has bpd. Is it okay to message again or should I not message as much to her. As I don’t want to over do it either. I’m not very close and due to her living situation I can’t just go down and meet her. Thanks "
163,1,"I feel like a lot of people's FPs last for several years, I see a lot around the 6-7 year mark, but mine completely varies and I transition from person to person in months. This doesn't just happen to me when/if they leave, and quite a bit of the time, I'M the one to abandon THEM. I get to a point where I completely ignore their existence and my brain blocks them out as if I never had that attachment in the first place, no matter how intense it was before. It feels like I'm in a permanent split with them if that makes sense? I lose the ability to care about them, if anything I'll get annoyed when they interact with me, rather than feeling elated and worthy. Sometimes, I'll think about one of them and it feels like my soul has been ripped out of my body because I feel as though I am nothing without them--but these moments are fleeting and after a while, I wonder why I ever cared in the first place and I go about my day.  
  
I've had 6 different FPs over the last 4 or 5 years. It's really confusing and I feel like this isn't very common. I feel very invalid because of it. Does anyone else experience this?"
164,3,"I feel like I’m losing my mind. 

My partner and I have been together 2 years, share a great life together, and have what most would say is an extremely healthy relationship. How come the only relationship I’ve been in in my life where I haven’t been abused, the hardest? 

He is an amazing person, and is so patient with me. I am recently diagnosed BPD as I have been having the worst crash outs lately. I feel like the smallest little things that irk me will cause me to try to abandon the whole relationship because I am convinced I am a burden to everybody around me. 

He still pushes me to do better, gives me advice and helps me set up therapy. I cannot wrap my head around this at all, and it makes me spiral harder

Every time this happens, I hate myself so deeply. It’s like, I’m aware that it’s happening and this isn’t how I want to be acting towards the person I love, but I can’t stop. Then knowing I acted that way causes me to spiral even harder and almost try to force him to leave me? I’m talking like “I’m not good for you,
I’m an awful person, you should just find someone else.” 

I can’t understand why I am doing this and it is ruining my life right now. I have recently started talk therapy, but I live in a state where resources are low, and appointments at the place that has availability that my insurance covers seems to be very inconsistent with scheduled appointments. 

Sorry if that doesn’t make any sense I just really don’t know where to turn right now and I’m making myself panic. "

So today I (25f) broke up with my boyfriend (26m) of 6 months. The brain fog is real, so I'm just going to list dot points of things that have happened throughout our relationship in no particular order:

* I had to ask him to stop making jokes at my expense
* He told his friends private, intimate things about me and our sex life
* When I showed him an animated video of how bottom surgery works his first reaction was, ""Ugh! I don't know if I'd want to f\*ck you""
* One time when I wanted to order two ice creams he said, ""You're gonna blow up and get fat and I don't know if I'd be attracted to you if you got fat""
* I had to ask him to stop ""jokingly"" calling me a bitch
* He was speeding one time, and I instinctively grabbed the seat, and he laughed at me and said, ""What– you don't think I'm a good driver?"". I said, ""No I was just a little scared"", and he made a joke that I can't remember now and brushed it off.
* He told me on two occasions that he was uncomfortable with what I was wearing. On one occasion, we were on the way to my house and I said, ""I'm feeling confident today. I think I'm going to wear one of my 'confident' outfits"". When we got to my house, I went upstairs to get changed. When I came back downstairs, he seemed uncomfortable. I asked him what was wrong, and he said, ""I'm just uncomfortable with what you're wearing"". I said, ""But I've worn this skirt around you before"" and he snapped at me and said, ""I just don't like the skirt!"". I angrily went upstairs to change, and when I came back down he gave me a hug and asked, ""You're not splitting on me are you?"" (I have BPD) and I said, ""No"". Then he asked me, ""Was it selfish for me to ask you to change?"" and I said, ""Yeah a little"", and he replied, ""Well we can all be selfish sometimes"". (He was referring to him driving me around to do errands, which I had asked him before we left if that was alright, and even offered to take the bus but he said that he was happy to. But in that argument, he threw it back in my face. Months later, he admitted the ""splitting"" comment as gaslighting, but excused it by saying he ""had a bad day""
* I kept a lot of this bottled up for months (which was my bad) because every time I brought something up he would dismiss me, or just make me wish I'd never said anything. When I finally brought it all up, it was my fault for keeping it all in and he implied that I'd shattered the illusion of our relationship (which was me putting up with everything he was doing).

Now here's where it all came to a head last night:

I initiated sex while we were watching TV, and he said, ""not right now maybe later"" and I said, ""Okay"". Then two minutes later he said, ""actually I'm horny now do you want to \[blank\]"" and I didn't want to feel like I was pressuring him, so I said, ""Not right now, maybe later"" because I felt weird about it, especially since he said no initially. Another few minutes later, he again said, ""Okay I'm horny do you want to f\*ck?"" and I said, ""I don't know"". I didn't want him to feel like he had to, and I was just trying to be considerate. But he blew up at me and accused me of playing mind games because in his words it was obvious because ""it was all over my face"". I also apparently rolled my eyes when I rejected his advances, but I know for a fact I didn't. Also, I can count on one hand the amount of times I've rejected his advances, but 9 times out of 10 he was rejecting mine, which made it hurt all the more that he reacted like that because I never hold it against him. I explained that I just didn't want to feel like I was pressuring him and he replied, ""That's a weird reason to say you're not horny"". He walked towards his computer in a huff but I felt like the conversation was unfinished, so I said, ""James..."" and he said, ""No! I'm not doing this shit tonight"". He then ignored me for a few hours while he played video games. But he did come over to me once and hugged me and said, ""sorry"" and I just said, ""It's ok"", but it all felt too-little-too-late. Then he went back to his video games. I went into the bathroom, and played loud music so that he couldn't hear me crying in the shower. I was crying because I felt like shit and I knew that this relationship was making me feel more bad than good. Then, we were laying in bed later that night he asked, ""Do you want to cuddle?"" and I agreed. He said, ""I'm sorry for losing my shit at you before"" and I said, ""I'm sorry if I was rude"" (even though I feel like I shouldn't have apologised at all) and he said, ""That's okay we were both to blame"".

This morning, I had things to do, but when I came home he was being all nice as if last night didn't happen, and I saw right through it. He also has a pattern of asking for the night to himself after one of our fights, but it just feels like he's punishing me. I went home, and broke up with him over text (which I know is immature, but I just didn't want to be dismissed if I were to bring it all up in person). He asked to call and I agreed, and in the break-up call today, he told me that he was the best thing to happen to me, and that I'm ""too much"" and ""picking fights"" (even though I was just calling out his behaviour). He also wished me luck in my future relationships if this is how I was going to go about things (breaking up over text).

I'm just feeling so defeated. I tried really hard to mend things, but we'd talk about it, and he'd change specific things for a while, but then he'd do other things that really hurt my feelings. I felt like it was all too much to keep bringing up every new thing he did to (I feel) tear me down, and last night I decided I couldn't do it anymore.

This is more of a vent than anything, but if anyone has similar stories or can relate, that'd be nice."
169,1,"I hate myself. Whatever I say is always wrong. Whatever I do is wrong. I hate being so wrong all the fucking time.

I really hate myself."
170,1,"Advice?

I (22F) haven't been getting along with my (25M) boyfriend. I have BPD. I've been doing meds and 2 types of therapy for years. He's been saying our relationship feels like a responsibility lately. Any slip up I have is treated like I dont have any progress at all. I feel dismissed and our relationship is nowhere as lovey as it once was. I understand due to his T1 diabetes he has physical restrictions, but for the last few months every time I try to initiate intimacy he says no. I miss feeling cherished and adored. I don't want to lose someone who helped me through some shitty times but I dont know what direction this relationship needs to go. Im not sure if anyone else would be willing to put up with me

TL:DR; I feel like my needs arent being met and am unsure abt my BPD making future relationships impossible."
171,2,"It hasn’t happened yet but Ik if I do really bad on the exam I’ll genuinely freak the fuck out and like I’ve been looking into stuff with charcoal burning suicide and stuff and it just sounds appealing. Technically there’s a whole bunch of other reasons I’d do it, but I think if I flunk this exam it’ll be my last straw or something

I just wish this school had proper support and options for people like me with bpd, I don’t think enough people realize that living like this is actual torture 

Ugh"
172,2,"I (29F) have been talking to a guy recently and got to meet him yesterday. I had a genuinely great time that I haven’t really had in a while. My BPD is most uncontrolled in interpersonal relationships and it seems to be what makes me ruin every single romantic relationship I try to build. I can’t let that happen anymore so I need advice.
I knew immediately in talking to him that I was going to have a lot of fear and anxiety if things proceeded because he has a very healthy personal life with a lot of close friends some of which are, naturally, female. This guy is a CATCH. Like I’ve never been with someone so conventionally attractive like him before plus he’s charismatic and successful and kind. I already feel a pit in my stomach forming when I think about him interacting with another woman cause I’m terrified he’ll find her better than me and ghost.
So here’s where I need help- I KNOW these tendencies of mine from my BPD and I actively want to challenge them and/or find a way to help myself through these feelings. Do any of you have advice on how to:
1. Not let my fear of abandonment take over and cause me panic over nothing 
2. Not let myself split immediately and be convinced he’s the end all be all and I need to cling to him for dear life 
3. Just have fun and enjoy this beginning stage without putting so much pressure on him and myself

I just want to have a fun, healthy and happy relationship for once. I can’t let my BPD take me down the extreme route again. How do you navigate a new relationship with your BPD?"
173,3,"i’ve been craving validation from my fp and been feeling unregulated for hours and can’t seem to get a grip. the urge to send a text to ask for reassurance or worse, doing attention seeking behaviors is SO strong. we have a hangout planned in a few hours that i want to do, but i don’t know how to regulate between then and now and i feel like im on this panicky time crunch to hurry up and feel normal emotionally beforehand so we can enjoy our time. should i send a text to get it out, or just risk withholding it during our entire hangout and masking "
174,1,"Well, my boyfriend left me.. I don’t want to get into the details but I haven’t seen him for the last month.. Ever since he stopped taking his anti depressants like 2 months ago he’s grown to resent me and hate me and he’s just not who he was when we met. He looks at me with such disgust.. I found I’m pregnant 2 weeks ago, I should be around 6 weeks now. And he doesn’t care.. He texted me last night saying he’d only see me to have sex with me. We were together for almost 8 months. I feel so destroyed. I stopped going to work for like 2 months now because I was already struggling with bad a bout of depression, I recently got a schizoaffective depressive diagnosis. It just hasn’t been all to well, especially with pregnancy.
I’m planning on having an abortion, but I don’t know how I’ll afford it, I’m still waiting for disability money.
Idk. It’s been really hard. I’m either sleeping, or crying. I can barely handle being awake. I miss him so much and he hates me. He made me feel so horrible, he tells me I’m annoying, he’s never communicated that before he just snapped and broke up with me. 
It makes me feel crazy because in the beginning I was working 50 hours a week and he pushed me to get on medication and from there my life kind of went into a bad spot, he was always full of energy and could never be quiet. Then I fall into a depression and he tells me I’m annoying. I don’t understand.. I never left his side even when he was going through his things.

Idk. I’m sad. I feel too sick to do anything. I have no friends or family, my best friend is also pregnant and has 2 kids, and my mom is struggling with addiction. I just can’t handle this. This is not the first time this has happened, I can take accountability and make different choices in the future.. but it seemed like he truly cared for me. He just switched once he got off medication. I’m hurting. "
175,0,"Today I went to the doctor by myself for the first time ever to get a referral for therapy. I’ve had an intense phobia for anything medical ever since I was about 4 years old which had gotten worse through the years and developed into a very intense anxiety disorder throughout my life. Combined with ADHD and our good friend BPD, you can imagine I’ve been having a blast. 

I’ve been doing without therapy for nearly 10 years as my experiences haven’t been successful and I’ve gotten quite skeptical about it. I think I’ve gotten quite far learning about it and working on it alone but something has changed in me lately and after my latest meltdown I was done. I planned a doctor’s appointment and a dentist appointment (haven’t gone for years) and went to the doctor today. I’ve always brought someone with me to these but I went alone for the first time. She took the time to listen to me (doctor’s appointments are usually set for 10 minutes, I stayed nearly an hour) and I was very open with her about how bad it actually is. Maybe that’s the advantage of not bringing anyone. 
She gave me a referral and the waiting time is not even that long (weeks vs. months). After being ghosted and rejected by previous therapist and institutions, I am now 90% sure this one will take me and I’m almost excited to start. 

I’m genuinely proud of myself and this is definitely a small win. I’ve found back a little bit of fight in me and I’m done being afraid of myself. She can fucking get it.

176,0,"I’m not talking about how our mind deceives us sometimes while splitting- the ultimate heart breaking, self fulfilling prophecy aspect of our condition. That’s another good topic but I mean both for certain, verifiable injustice happening to us / others in our daily lives as well as even world wide international matters. 

How do you react to this? 

Are you seething in rage potentially forever over these things, do you construct fantasies of obtaining justice? I can’t tell if this for me is more of an autism thing or BPD, or if I’m just like this. If it helps, I have low cognitive empathy and high emotional till someone crosses a major line definitively; then I have zero. Anyone heavily relate? Does the empathy part matter to you? "
177,1,"I'm only 17, but I've craved personal connection with people for years, but have never been able to achieve it for long.  I've wanted a romantic relationship for a very long time, and I've tried a lot, even mustered up the courage to ask out my old best friend (didn't work out, but at least I did it), but it never works out.  At this point almost everyone I know is having some kind of romantic or intimate involvement with people except for me, and it's not like I have a problem being social either.  When I go to parties and stuff people talk with me a lot, but every time I meet someone I really like they either have a partner already or don't seem into me.  I've started to develop a really strong resentment for intamacy because of all the times I've tried it and failed, to the point where even touching people makes me uncomfortable, and whenever romance is brought up, it immediately sets off my BPD and I go into a really big depressive spiral.  Even writing this is making me tear up holy shiih. Is there any hope for me finding someone special?  Can anyone else relate?
I think Imma go chug some vodka to feel better.  Probably a bad idea but oh well.  Thanks for reading this if you got this far"
178,0,"My therapist told me that after going through a DBT program, some people are considered no longer having BPD and I was just wondering if that was true? I thought BPD was something that you were stuck with your whole life but she made it sound like DBT is the cure. What are your thoughts? "
179,3,"im losing my fucking mind right now. my significant other hates me im pretty sure he wont talk to me because i said i couldn’t handle another argent. i fucked up again and communication was poor on both ends because i injured myself wandering around on my sleeping meds mid important conversation. he said that i left him on delivered after not explaining something enough and that he feels like im leaving things out on purpose and hiding things from him. ive had issues in the past with not being clear enough on things and lying by omission but ive since come clean about all of my erratic behavior and have taken steps to try and get therapy (no openings but im calling weekly trying to get in). i just feel like nothings ever enough and all my efforts to try and be better with communication have gone unseen. i think that him hating me is justified i just wish i were different. im trying so hard to be better and change but i keep fucking up and i feel inhuman, like a directionless monster that sucks up the energy of everyone around me. i dont know who or what i am i just wish i were different. "
180,1,"kinda a longer post so i'm sorry in advance. really just need to get some stuff off my chest, but if anyone has any advice/words of comfort that would be greatly appreciated :)

i think my ex bf might be my fp. we started dating when we were 16 and then he broke up with me two days after my 18th birthday. the reason for our separation is because he says i was too mentally unstable, and that was leading to too many problems in our relationship. he said if i genuinely wanted our relationship to last, i needed to heal from things. our relationship was your average high school sweetheart type relationship. not only was he my boyfriend, he was also my best friend and my first everything. 

i was extremely depressed and suicidal after our breakup, and it took me only two months to find myself a rebound. i got into a relationship with someone five years older than me as a freshly 18 year old. wasn't a healthy situation for me whatsoever. definitely didn't help me move on from my ex. after six months in this relationship, i finally ended things with him and got back in contact with my ex.

as of now, my ex and i have been in contact for a year. he has confessed that he still has romantic feelings for me and is interested in getting back together. he always says i'm the only one for him and he doesn't want to try with anyone else. but i've noticed things are different now. when we were dating, i was extremely attached. my mood depended on him entirely. i needed his attention to function. but now, it seems as if i have the opposite problem--i can't commit. 

i know i'm out of his league. i know i deserve way better than him. i know he doesn't fit my standards. i know there's no way i can marry this guy. i turn 20 in august and everyday, i realize more and more how young i am and how i shouldn't waste my life on just some guy i met in high school. sometimes i fantasize about meeting someone new and being in a genuinely happy relationship with someone i love. i want him to be able to be in a happy relationship too, but that's impossible with me. i am too broken for love.

but at the same time, i don't want him to move on. even if i'm not into him (which i'm not), i still want him to like me. i don't want him to like anyone else. if he stops liking me, what does that mean? probably that i'm just an ugly bitch who ruins everyone's life.

so i'm stuck in this problem. i want him to like me even though i don't like him, but i understand i'm leading him on by talking to him everyday. i want to be with someone else but i worry i'll never find anyone. i worry he is the only person who will ever like me. i say i don't want a relationship, but i still text him everyday and we still hold hands and kiss and have sex like normal couples do. i say i want to be alone, but start freaking out when he actually does leave me alone and all of a sudden it feels like i'm dying.

what's wrong with me? someone please say something.

"
181,1,"I truly feel crazy. After two good weeks i ruined things again. I just want him to love me and I know with his actions and the things he says to me he doesn’t care for me. Yet I still went back to him after I was doing so well with no contact. Things will always be this way because he just doesn’t want me he just wants access to me and let be real he just wants sex. I allowed myself to get trampled by my emotions and for the first time in a long while I cut myself. Five times. Idk why. He won’t care that I did. He’ll just say I’m crazy and this is why he doesn’t want a life with me. This is why he doesn’t want to have a relationship with me or babies. Or anything. It hurts too but I just wanted to see if I could do it. Everyone and I mean everyone even strangers say he’s just abusing me emotionally and psychologically. But I love him and want to be with him. I feel so attached and it breaks me. I know this isn’t real love. Real love wouldn’t push me to feel this way, right?"
182,1,"if my partner or any friend of mine told me they were self harming, i'd feel terrible and wish they'd stop (not force them to stop ofc, since it does more damage than good). however, for myself, i feel like it's a way to self-soothe. i can't fathom why it would be a bad thing to do this to myself. i won't attempt, i won't go too deep. i'd honestly rather do this than take mood stabilizers and a bunch of other medication that i cant even afford. maybe my brain has become numb to self-harm (probably) but i honestly don't care anymore. i see it as a bad habit and that's it. "
183,1,"
i’m f22 and i have a job. that’s about it. i got my first job kind of late, i was 20 and ive been at the same job ever since. i dont like it, but its a job and nowhere else has gotten back to me, so i stay out of necessity 

my childhood/teenage years were not great. my parents fought a lot and my mom is an abusive alcoholic, so you can imagine how that went. i don’t remember most of my childhood, just the bad parts mostly 

i was homeschooled in highschool and then the pandemic happened and i genuinely think it kind of killed off any social battery i had

then i graduated, and when i turned 20, i was assaulted. i didn’t tell anyone in my family, but ive confided to a lot of my friends about it. then when i was 21, i lost my childhood dog. he was my soulmate and best friend and i think part of my died with him because i haven’t felt the same since 

i just live a very introverted life, which i don’t mind, but most of it is due to mental illness. i have major depression, anxiety and bpd. i blame my mental illnesses on my parents because i do believe it is their fault and it makes me feel angry. i’ll never know the person i could have been like

i don’t know how to drive and it’s something im honestly really ashamed of. i see people younger than me that are insanely successful and i feel like shit because i’m not like them. one of my coworkers is 19 and she can drive and has her own car and i just wish i was the same. a girl im mutuals with on instagram has her own car and works at a hospital and she’s 20 and i can’t stop comparing my life to her

it’s no one’s job to make me want to drive, but my parents never encouraged it and they’ve never made it a big deal to teach me, even though i’ve asked. i’ve asked my dad if he could teach me, but he gets angry easily. we drove around a parking lot and i turned the wheel the wrong way and he pushed it the other way and asked if i was dumb, so that was the first and last time i went with him

it was kind of the same way with my sister. she didn’t learn how to drive until she was 23 and bought her first car later that same year, but our dad did the same thing with her. i don’t have anyone to teach me how to drive and i can’t ask my sister because she moved out and is busy all the time

i’d say the only really accomplishments i have are going into therapy and making plans to move out with my long distance boyfriend, but those don’t really feel like accomplishments to me

i turn 23 in september and all i feel is impending doom. am i running out of time? i feel like i am."
184,2,"I have BPD and just started dating this one guy and it's his first time having a BPD girlfriend . 
We've been only dating for almost 3 days now and we've already had an argument over something that I barely remember. We were playing videogames, he went quiet and then afk for a couple minutes so I thought he was mad at me for no reason. I knew he was kind of tilted because of the game we were playing. Everytime I feel him getting tilted and stuff, I ask him if he wants to take a break to relax a little bit. And to make sure that he's okay. I feel like me asking him to take a break from the game and asking him if he's feeling okay might stress him out and maybe annoy him? Anyways, things got kinda heated while trying to talk some stuff out.
He said I make him feel like he's the bad guy everytime, and I kind of had a ptsd moment from my last relationship, which made me dissociate and like forget what we were talking about, or like how it even got to that point. He said that I'm not my BPD, that not everything is about me and even though I knew that, it hurt. He knew what he signed up for. He did research before we even started talking, that's how interested he was in getting to talk to me and get to know me better.

I need some like tips or help to offer him so he can like understand better, or know how to act in certain moments. Literally anything helps, anything."
185,3,"
Theres three of us. Myself [F 24], C[F, NB, 24]  and S [M NB 25?]. I have borderline personality disorder and bipolar, so abandonment issues and poor emotional regulation (actively have been working on it). Myself and C have been in a relationship for 3+ years and known each other for 7+ years. Engaged. Or we were.. we ended up with S, after less than a month of knowing them. S had domestic violence go on in their family home so we offered our place. I was uncomfortable but wanted them safe. We'd gone all the way before, but I wanted to walk it back. They asked why, I didn't have a reason, they pushed until I cried ""maybe my trauma, idk"" and then they said ""dont do that"" like I was using my trauma like a card. Then they moved in. It had its tense moments but whatever, S is going through prescription substance and alcohol withdrawal. Yesterday we went to my father's, where S drank. C also had a shot. I'm less upset about what they drank and more that we agreed not to drink and then they drank. We get home, they ask if I want to talk about it while C, who can barely walk, goes to shower. I say there's nothing to talk about, we had an agreement and you broke it- to which they try to justify it with ""I usually get blackout drunk, I didn't even get buzzed. And I ate a full plate"" and I tell them it doesnt matter that they're not drunk. They leave the room. C comes back and snuggles, I take a nap. I wake up, c goes to take out their contacts. C is gone for a long time. C made dinner too. They come in the room and sit down, turning on Hulu and talking over my curled up self on the corner of the bed. I ask them to watch that in the other room. They leave. They stay gone, before eventually coming back to ""talk"". C and I have a small talk before S moves to talk- which starts off on why they started drinking over a year ago and how they usually get black out drunk. I sit up and say ""kinda missing the point"" and it turns into a crying blow up. ""Well I'm sorry I'm an addict"" says S- which obviously isn't a genuine apology. So I have to trot out my trauma and how that boundary wasn't just for their benefit. I say its not an apology and go shower. I vent to a friend, who has them move to the other bedroom so I can have my bed back. Then they don't come back. I'll admit I send some pissy texts ""have fun watching Hulu. Chit chat like nothing is wrong."" Etc etc. Bitchy but nothing insulting. It felt like they didnt care about the fact that I was hurting. They stayed back there while I cried my eyes out and split. I live in an old trailer, two doors need to shut loudly. I startled them from the other room. C was waiting on ""permission"" but I don't give permission, they've never needed permission. The next day they come back in and I finally get a genuine apology from S but I don't care about drinking anymore, I cared about being left alone while hurting. Usually C and I would've laid in bed and talked, but this time we didn't. C sits on the ground with the dog, S talks about how I ""scared"" them and was pissy with them. I go to leave because if I'm ""scary"" then the conversation is already over. C clings to me and I pull away (which according to S is abusive because C ""needed me"")  . I stalk around outside before coming back in and saying I'm going for a drive- then I change my mind and ask to just talk to C. We talk quietly. We cuddle. We start to come back from it. Then C goes to pee, and suddenly S pops in and says ""they already made plans"" to go out. So they go out. They leave while I'm hurting instead of talking. I crash out again, I'm under the impression that they're gone while I'm wailing my soul out but the vehicle was still there so who knows. They eventually do leave. I admit, I was in an upset feedback loop and began to call excessively and texted them to not tell me i was important if I'm not. To break up with me if they'd rather ignore me. They don't respond and ignore me. Again. I call their mother and say ""hey, we got into it and they're out with a friend but they aren't answering my calls- can you tell them to call me?"" 

Well C apparently believes I would out them to a dangerous person, because they weren't sure if I would tell their mom that we were gay. I know better. After 3 years, I'd hoped they would know I knew better. Finally they call me, and they're upset because now their mom knows they have a boyfriend. I tell them I didn't tell their mother that because I know better. It turns into a blow up because I'm upset that they're ignoring me, S takes the phone and calls me an abusive bitch for ""pulling away when C needed me"" and for being pissy. I won't claim to be an angel, how I spoke was unacceptable. I had hysterical indignant laughter and hysterical sobs. Ive asked C in the past if I needed to adjust how I react to things, if I was abusive, and the answer was always no. Now there's a new person and suddenly I am? Anyway I tell S that they can come get their shit but I fucked up and said ""ya'll"" and C took it to mean them both. Now C is leaving and moving out back to their parents. It could be because C told them about having a boyfriend and now they're being protective, or it could be that C just really is that done with me. I don't understand how 3 years gets thrown away that quickly because I snapped. Ive never insulted, I rarely raise my voice (it only happens when a third person is involved how suprising) . I feel like I'm not allowed to have big emotions. Communication can't happen if you're ignoring the other person. If you need space say you need space, don't treat me like shit over it. 

I

Guess I must be abusive 

I think the world of C and if I hurt them then I deserve to hurt. 

But 

The ignoring. Hurt so much. 

I thought we could talk. I thought that when C went to the bathroom, S would come in and talk.  But then they left like I didn't matter. 

And when I go home.. everything will be gone. They aren't responding to the few messages I send. This is really it. I won't be able to hear them sing, watch them cook, hold their hand on long drives, make them laugh by doing something stupid.. it's all gone.. 

I can't sleep without jolting awake when I begin to rest, my chest starts to hurt 
I'm nauseated from crying 
I haven't been able to eat so I'm just drinking water

I hurt so much

But it's worse knowing I hurt them. "
186,1,i feel like everyone is sick and tired of me. and like whatever i’m tired of me too but i feel like a burden everywhere i go. at school i get overwhelmed with my emotions and i think people are starting to resent me. i feel like my family resents me. my friends don’t say it but i know they resent me too. how do you guys deal with feeling this way? i feel so unloved and unwelcome. i know i’m most likely spiralling but i just can’t shake this feeling that i’m a burden to everyone that loves me. is there any DBT skill you know that helps with this feeling? 
187,2,"a friend of mine has bpd, and right now she's extremely suicidal. she's talking about how there's no hope for her and she doesn't want to be alive anymore and that she will never get better and she doesn't deserve to live, and i just don't know what to do. im trying to reassure her that things can get better. i've had a lot of suicidal thoughts myself so i have an idea what she's going through but i just don't know what to do to help her. it feels like nothing i say helps. she lives far away from me and idk her address or anything so i can't go to her or call for help. what do i do"
188,1,"I’m on lexapro and sometimes I feel like I need it just to control my emotions. I really definitely do and it is the most necessary thing for me, but I just feel so damn empty and unlike myself on them. I’m usually a bleeding heart and it’s something I identify myself with and it’s just really confusing what the best route is when you already feel you don’t have an identity, it’s like accepting one kind of empty, for another 

Can anyone else agree?"
189,1,"I feel so ridiculous that I'm even in this situation right now, and pathetic how much it hurt me.

Having come out of a couple of messy relationships I got very close to a regular who would come in the pub I worked at every day and sit and keep me company because it was pretty dead sometimes.  Cute, funny, charismatic and suddenly I got that sinking feeling realising I liked this boy. And he was 22, not late 20s which I assumed. I'm 31.

Inevitably we started seeing each other - he did the classic don't want to put a label on it but will be exclusive. He turned from this lovely, mature guy into just a dickhead and it makes no sense why it all hurt so much.  The list of never complimenting me, never making plans or replying to texts, generally just pleasing himself. The thing that hurt me most was his boss' 17 year old daughter being catty about me on the phone on loudspeaker and he didn't defend me and made the excuse ""that's just how she is"". 

 I looked after him for three days and nights when he was really sick, because he told me he loved me a couple of weeks previous, and once I'm at that stage with someone then I'll drop everything. He went into hospital, I went after work at midnight to go and sort out his room for a flat move-out because there were drug baggies everywhere and his parents were going round the next day. Left at 2am. 

He was being distant and horrible and I eventually asked him over facetime if he even wanted to be in this relationship whatever it was and he said he hadn't thought about it too much but actually he'd rather be single. I asked why he'd tell me he loved him if he was finding it all too intense. He said he had no memory of that at all. 

I quit the pub and quit the village, and spent weeks really hurting over it. I was finally coming out of missing him, and for some reason made the stupid decision to have a Facebook stalk to see what was going on in the village since I left, and I wound up seeing photos of him from last year with his arm around the catty girl. 

I don't know why that, of all things, feels so crappy. I knew he'd made out with her once because his friend asked if I knew about the history and he was quick to say it was just a kiss and she didn't want it to go further. This was before I even knew him. But to see him being so kind and affectionate to someone who he let be snarky about me over the phone has just knocked me right back. I feel so ridiculous being an adult upset over an almost teenager but having someone, when asked directly if they found me attractive, said ""there's nothing wrong with you"" and ""I'm attracted to personality"". I asked him if catty girl was pretty before I'd seen her and he was like ""yeah, not gonna lie"". Also would tell me how beautiful Natalie Portman was in Star wars and dumb shit like that.  He never once gave me a compliment or made me feel good about myself. And I cried my heart out hysterically down the phone begging him not to call it off. His reason was that it ""wasn't fun anymore"" because I'd asked him to please watch a small video on BPD and make an effort to send me one or two texts in the day. And I wasn't able to drop this niggle I had with the girl at his work and he just repeated it's just her personality and he couldn't be arsed to keep arguing. 

It's so hard because it was such a short time and so the general response is ""you're better off without him"" not understanding how much six weeks can hurt so much rather than just a quick easy thing to move on from. This turned into a real essay, but seeing that photo just broke something in me I was getting on with fixing. And I can't even get closure now and find out if I was just a time filler. "
190,2,"So I’ve been diagnosed with BPD for several years now. I never had childhood trauma or abuse from parents, but got pregnant at 14 and experienced years of DV and toxicity. (We’re still together, but that’s a different topic) 

So my therapist and I have always concluded that to be a main problem. Stuff with him. BUT I was just talking to my mom and she disclosed that she felt like both her and my dad “went to far at times” and so I, only remembering being mad at my mom for petty things like not being able to go to a friends house, asked her WHAT she is talking about. 

So to the point, she disclosed some of the physical and emotional abuse that happened to me . HOW can I really repress 100% of any type of abuse ?? II thought that was only in movies. I’ve always wondered and thought to myself, why am I like this, I had a great childhood ect….

I feel like I’m questioning everything now. & idk how to feel about it. 
"
191,2,"Do you ever feel like this is just a simulation, an absurd, ridiculous simulation, where everyone is telling you that you overreact and do the wrong thing and feel too intensely etc. etc. but in reality everything is totally valid and there are people outside watching you in the simulation laughing about how easy it is to gaslight you into thinking you're wrong? 

I feel like I'm about to have an episode... I know what's going to trigger it; I even know what's going to happen. I'm going to show up to this Mexican place, and then John will show up later, and other women will talk to him, and I'll get jealous, and I'll get triggered, and I'll leave, and he'll stay, and I'll get angry and lash out at him. Then I'll feel bad about myself, then I'll trick myself into thinking I was wrong to feel the way I did, and I'll reconcile with him, and he'll think he can just walk all over me; or he'll dump me for being ""crazy"" and ""jealous."" 

I'm hoping all of that doesn't happen... But I am not feeling very confident. "
192,2,"I watched the movie [Friendship](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30505698/reference/) earlier tonight because I'm a fan of both Paul Rudd and Tim Robinson. It's about a guy who befriends his neighbor but tries too hard to fit into his neighbor's friend group, so the neighbor distances himself. The guy becomes more and more desperate, and the neighbor pulls away from him more and more. 

Although the character isn't said to have BPD, I recognized a lot of my own behavior, particularly regarding FP's I've had."
193,0,"Hi! I have diagnosed bpd, girl, 21. I’m medicated and okay-ish. I don’t understand dating at all. My psychiatrist suggested I do casual dating but it didn’t work because I got very attached to that person. Now I met a guy who likes me a lot.. but I’m not attracted to him and he will not be FP level. 

My question is if a person with bpd can date someone who they aren’t obsessed with. I could use some support and I want to see what it’s like to have a healthy normal relationship. 

I don’t feel the NEED for a partner so I think I could get in a relationship without stressing over being together forever and ever and ever and ever and just enjoy the moment. I met a guy who really likes me and we can debate philosophical issues and questions for hours. But I’m honestly not attracted to him and he is not my type though he is not ugly, I just don’t have the “intense” feelings. 

I think it is okay to let him take me on dates and see where it goes. I don’t think I’ll want to be intimate with him but I don’t think I have to do that if I don’t feel like it. I think it’s the normal way to just hang out and date and if it doesn’t work out to just tell him and be honest. Is this okay?"
194,1,"I am used to having bad mental health episodes but this feels sp much worse than usual, a lot of shit has been piling up for me and i feel misserable , i keep having flashbakcs ans awfil memories of shit i went through , i keep crashing out over friends i dont talk to anymore , i keep reverting to delusional toxic and paranoic mindsets ,  i wanted to post here but i ended up reading thru the negative sjbreddit about bpd [yk which im talking about] and it mase my episode worse [which was kinda on me but yeah]

I feel so empty , im used to sometimes having episodes where i cant be around my friends cus something extremelry stupid sets me off snd i feel i'm being  left behind but its usually just a cpuple days and i let them know before i go silent   , i have been going for 5 days so far , i dont see a pointi to talk to aby of my best friends as before , i love them but i just feel they are gonn get tired of me the more they find out of how truly fucked up i Mmentally , 

I feel the urge to cut off both of them cus i feel i'm just a fucking burden to them  , i feel so worthless and tired , i feel like none of them enjoy talking to me cus i overthought some mildly dry texring and i have just been going through an awful mebtal healtg patch fof so long that i don't feel its even worth it anymoee , my family is ableist and so is my country , i got fired recently so i cant pay for therapy rn , my last therapist kept brushing off my concwrns abt bpd and my delusions and paranoia and just told me to ""have u tried to tell ur brain not to rhink abt it ?"" , i can't get a proper diagnpsis cus my family will just chalk me up as ""insane and dramatic"" , if i get a diagnosis thry are gonna cry and whine abt how any types of meds are evil and im letting them control me and im scared they'll force me out of therapy to ""pray my depression away"" cus they did this before with my depression diagnosis 

 . I dont think i can go to anyone for hwlp , i hate speaking abt my issues with my family , i think im burdenning my friends and i cant just unload 20 years of unresolved issues and trauma on them , i don't have any method to k(11 myself that guarantees i am finished off completely with no chance of surviving it  , im so tempted to just write up goodbye letters for my friends then attempt to buy sleeping pills from the pharmacy "
195,2,"It seems extremely difficult to maintain a perspective of, ""I am just a person with some emotional problems, and the emotions will soon pass."" It feels so real and all consuming :S"
196,1,"Currently grieving my FP that no longer has any interest in being my friend. I haven't made a friend  since them like 9 years ago? Any attempt I make to meet a new person, online or irl, doesn't go anywhere. I can't dissuade myself from thinking I'm legitimately a boring, personality-less and bad person. I don't know what to do and can't covince myself there's a chance of getting better. Just fuck."
197,2,"A few years ago many important relationships in my life ended. It was really rough, some ended as a result of my (then unknown) bpd behaviour and some from them being two faced and some a mix of the two. 

Since then I have found it extremely hard making friends and dating both from a lack of interest and my extreme paranoia when hanging out with them. With potential friends, I'm constantly paranoid that they dislike me and are being two-faced. With guys I'm dating, my mind immediately jumps to them using me or not being genuine. 

This has mostly lead to me distancing myself, but in two cases where I actually opened up the guys left me specifically because of my constant trust issues making them feel guilty (oh and another one who was actually two faced which didn’t help the paranoia 😩.)

I’m sick of this paranoia controlling my life and I want to be trusting and open and interested in people again. 

Does anyone have experience of this and if so how did you overcome it? 
"
198,1,"I just visited my long distance boyfriend for around 2 weeks and I’m back to where I’m staying at (homeless), and it feels so depressing, I miss him so much already, my entire body is hurting and aching not being with him. I want to live in his ribcage. I’m so empty inside, that he is the only person who actually bring meaning in my life, without him I feel like nothing. He is my favorite person right now. He knows I’m obsessed with him, but he doesn’t think it’s healthy. He asked me, “if i died tommorow what would you do?” And I told him that I’d kill myself after, that way if there is an afterlife I’d still be with him. He told me that he’d be mad at me if that were to happen and that he just wants me to live my life after, but I can’t without him, he’s actually my everything. How do I stop feeling this way, when I’m not with him after I spend time with him? I don’t wanna be like this, but I don’t know what else I can do"
199,0,"Honestly as soon as you can or any of you can , get a cat , kitten, she has helped me , I have been nervous today, even I was about to take my emergency pill , but I come inside here my room and she lay on me on my chest , she has beeing a bit avoidant some days but as soon she felt I am nervous or anxious she comes directly to safe me . 

Just to share with you that this little moments helps me also to regulate , I will investigate more about pet therapy but I am sure it is related to spend more time with them. 

She hugs me and helped me to self regulated.
 "
200,3,"I hate myself, Other people have it worse. Literally, I know them. I just crashed out. I’m working way too much, am in the middle of moving and can’t deal with life anymore. I want to quit my job, which has so many issues all on its own and run away "
201,1,Just like the title says idk what to do anymore.  Getting married in 6 weeks and the person I'm with doesn't seem to understand that when they tell me to open up and say what's bothering me that they can't sit there and make me feel like my thoughts and opinions are wrong due to them not agreeing with it. Its making me feel like I'm not good enough and that the mini stroke i had a year ago should have just taken me. Who knows maybe I'm an idiot for even posting this. 
202,2,"I recently had a very bad mania episode which ended with me being institutionalized for 14 days. They increased all my meds. (Seroquil, Prozac, and Remeron) but since being released three weeks ago I am the most anxious and depressed I have ever been. I end almost every single day ready to have a panic attack. It feels like there is a weight on my chest. Because of this episode my long term boyfriends entire family who previously loved me have decided that I am crazy and have been encouraging him to leave me. He has assured me he isn’t going to but now knowing they hate me is causing anxiety. They’re accusing me of faking my disorder and saying I pulled a stunt (suicide attempt) and that it wasn’t a mental health crisis. How do I move on? How do I grieve my actions so that I can feel normal again? This is the worst episode I’ve had as an adult and I don’t know what to do. "
203,3,"Hi everyone, this is my first time really posting on here. I guess I am just looking for support and advice from people who might understand. 

A few months ago, I (26F) was diagnosed with BPD after an evaluation. A lot started to make sense to me about the way I had been feeling and acting throughout my life. I was relieved in a way because I had a sort of explanation, but now I am still struggling very badly with symptoms while also being painfully aware of the cause. Still, awareness is not enough to help me escape it. 

My main struggles are with SI. Other than that, I really struggle regulating my emotions at a slight trigger. The other day, I had a panic attack followed by crying for nearly 12 hours straight. I have mood swings and am overcome with feelings of fear and dread regularly that make me have SI to cope and escape. I have struggled with this for years now and I am terrified because it has never felt this bad. I keep having nightmares that no one understands me, treats me like I am crazy, and that it is impossible to get through to them. A lot of people describe me as a very happy and bubbly person, and I do very well academically and professionally. But the people closest to me have seen how this impacts me.

I feel like while my friends and family care, they will just not be able to understand and that’s why I don’t share what I go through very openly with them. When they are impacted by my emotions, I  find myself constantly saying I’m sorry to them because I feel terrible. My symptoms don’t express as aggressive or mean but rather shutting down/unable to control crying/unable to return to normal.

I have been on SSRIs for years and was in therapy over the last 6 months until very recently when I graduated. 

I would love to know if anyone relates to these experiences or has any advice on how to get by. If you read all of this, please know I appreciate you listening to my experiences 🫶🏼

"
204,2,I just need people to remind me it’s okay and maybe talk to me so I don’t continue to freak out because I’m at work and I can’t cope with this. I texted him last night and it’s nearly noon and he hasn’t responded. PLEASE TELL ME NOT TO TEXT HIM
205,1,"He convinced me to trust him, told me I'd never be too much for him, was so patient with me, we called twice a day those first few weeks. He set the precedent and told me I could call him whenever. 

After the first couple of times we saw each other, he would call me and make sure I was okay. He wanted to hear from me, wanted to know me. He told me how special I was, how he understood me, how he would never judge me.

Things cooled down. Calls started becoming more and more rare. Still, we saw each other. He kept giving me mixed signals but my heart bursted with joy whenever I was with him. A word from him was all I needed to feel okay. He started replying less and less frequently, calls would go unanswered and he wouldn't even call me back, but everything was okay, right? No. He'd leave my messages on read and not even listen to my voice messages.

I lost it. I did dumb things. I got drunk and called him. The first time, he was understanding (joy!). The second, he was cold, harsh, told me ""if I found out you lied to me I'm leaving"", ""I'm disgusted by the fact you drink to forget"" (joke's on him, I don't feel the need to drink anymore now that he's not messing with my head). Then he acted offended when I said that hurt. 

We agreed to stay friends. We were never in a relationship nor exclusive. I had sex with someone else (mistake, I just felt so alone). I told him cause I trusted him with all my heart and also he's poly and non-judging, right? Wrong. He switched on me so fast. We saw each other and he didn't even say hi. A couple days later I reach out and I'm met with contempt. This person, I trusted with my deepest fears, treated me like dirt. I still begged for an explanation for at least a month. He dangled the promise of a phone call in front of my face for weeks, until finally I just told him ""don't bother"" and blocked him.

This guy, I would have done anything for. I did everything in my power to not hurt him. I understood his depression and flakiness, his mixed signals, his forgetfulness. I thought he meant well. Now, I can only assume he didn't. I can only assume he used me to get affection, companionship, intimacy, and then conveniently ditched me when I became too much of a burden. I can only assume that my therapist is right when she says he lovevombed me. 

It probably sounds dramatic, but I mean it genuinely, I would have died for him. And he could never, in a million years, understand how it feels to care for someone so deeply."
206,2,"I’m having the worst time of my life; for around 24 years starting when I was a child I’ve had really bad dysphoria on and off, constantly. It ruins my relationships, and it leaves me constantly doubting myself. My last relationship, my ex cheated on me and married the affair partner within a few months and it made my BPD worse and I was having panic attacks every single day for the last 2 years since the break up. My dysphoria came back and has been constant for the last 2 years and I realized I’ll only be enough if I transition to be a woman and I need to transition from male to female. I’ve never felt enough as a man. At the same time it’s all I’ve known and the only people I’ve ever been loved by have wanted me as a man.

Well a few weeks ago I met someone amazing, and they knew I struggled with this. I told them that I didn’t have dysphoria anymore, because in the moment I said that I truly didn’t have it, and I convinced myself I was fine as a cis man, and told them I was ready for a relationship. The instant that I said that I realized I actually do have dysphoria and now I don’t know what to do. I have had this conversation before with this person where I briefly didn’t have dysphoria and then it comes right back after I was sure I didn’t and was ready to date them. I keep going back and forth emotionally. 

Is this my BPD causing this emotional flip flop that I’m having between feeling comfortable as I am and wanting to transition the next moment, does anyone relate? This is so painful for me emotionally and I don’t want to mess with anyone’s feelings. I’m struggling from this a lot and just want to be okay."
207,1,"BPD is ruining my life


I get obsessed in one date or even with just a few interractions.


I over-alanyse everything, I project things on every little interraction that could potentialy bring affection in the end.
I would like to be in someone's arms for the rest of my life.
I get attached a soon as there is even a few signals from them that goes in the right direction.


When I'm alone I'm miserable, I get lonely, depressive, empty, so empty I wish to die to end it.


Emptiness is the worst, there is just nothing to hang on to, just void in which in fall.


So I continue to date to not feel alone, but most people are not ready to handle BPD or just don't meet my unreachable needs/wants and I end up hurting like hell, and the cycle goes on. And I'm quite pretty so I the cycle is quite short/fast and destructive.


I feel like it's never going to work, I can't live with it like this, this is not a life.
What am I gonna do ? End it ?
Fuck I don't wan't to give reason to the people that traumatized my young self.
I just hate it...

208,1,"friday, saturday, sunday and monday's been crappy.

I had been waiting for monday just to post on reddit because I have nobody to talk to, without feeling misjudged or judged or critisezed or minimzed.

I wanted to vent to the world and let it all out. 

I wanted to say how I feel my therapist doesn't quite understand the mess my life is. I mentioned self-harm ONCE and said I wasn't thinking about it. I said how trapped I feel and how tired I am. How meditation has been futile. How I feel void of emotions with the antidepressant and how inositol brought my mojo back, but also made my antidepressants useless. How I'm losing hope but also I don't want to have hope because it feels it prolongs the suffering.

But my post never saw the light of redditday. And I feel like my post. Invisible, no-matterly, unimportant"
209,3,"Haven’t posted here for a while. I got into a relationship a year ago and I’ve been so healthy (or so i thought lol) and i was convinced my bpd was ‘cured’ or never actually existed. Boy was i wrong. I mean i have improved, i’m 2 years self harm free (yay!), my partner is not my FP (not full blown at least), and i’m getting better at communicating and not blaming/splitting.

My partner is wonderful and ever so accommodating, caring, and patient with me but she recently brought up that my emotional dependence on her was becoming a big source of pressure for her, and she already deals with crazy anxiety about pretty much everything but our relationship (the opposite to me). Basically what i was doing was telling her the second i had a bit of discomfort or insecurity about the relationship that i couldn’t shake off because i felt like i had to otherwise it would fester until i did. This was my autism i think because ‘i have to tell them everything or it’s lying’. Finding out that she was feeling pressured by this and was worrying about the sustainability of our relationship obviously made me spiral like mad but i reacted so calmly with her in person and (genuinely) congratulated her on setting boundaries which i know is hard for her. When i got home i processed it by sobbing my fucking eyes out and talking to my mum about it for hours, and i felt sick and fearful for a few days but mum suggested that i start journaling and doing breath work (breath of fire) she loves pranayama and it’s cooled her bpd ass down too. I finally agreed to try both of those things because i was desperate and i didn’t want this relationship to end.

I’ve been journaling for a month now and doing my breath of fire every morning and sometimes twice or three times a day when triggered. I can see the progress because i’ve been feeling calmer and i’ve completely stopped coming to my partner the second i’m insecure — i try and comfort myself first. What i did still do was after calming myself down, i’d then tell her that i was triggered but was able to deal with it myself and i told her this because i was really proud of myself.

Last night i got insanely triggered because she couldn’t properly say goodnight to me because she was playing a game, and i got very upset because our goodnight messages are the only texts i get during the day (she’s not a texter) and i felt really uncared for. I could tell something was going on with me because the trigger was so angry and i haven’t got like that for ages but i mostly kept my cool and just expressed that i was a little sad about it and she sent me a voice note saying sorry and that she loves me (in hindsight a sufficient loving message) but at the time i was angry but kept it to myself and journaled. I had calmed myself down through journaling and was really impressed so i texted her about how i was initially quite angry and upset but that i journaled and feel fine now. I then asked if she could send me a lovey voice note when she finished her games for me to wake up to.

The next morning the voice note she left me was quiet and upset of her feeling bad that i had been triggered and for whatever reason her response ENRAGED me to a ridiculous level. I wanted to scream and cry because i hadn’t got the response i ‘needed’ or asked for and was very very triggered. I was journaling like mad for a few hours and i eventually more or less calmed down, and because yet again i was like “fuck yeah i dealt with that!” So i sent her videos of me explaining how i had been triggered by her lack of lovey voice message but that i worked through it and i noticed my errors.

Four hours later i began to get frantic wanting a response because i had begun to spiral again so i called her which woke her up and i felt really bad but i wanted her to see my messages because i wanted to talk to her. She saw my messages and then sent a voice note to me explaining how she was really upset at my behaviour and how she felt like it was unfair i got so angry that she didn’t send me a loving voice note. I became fucking mortified because i had no idea i had done something wrong and she went onto say that me explaining that i had been triggered is in some way worse because she doesn’t get to be upset and her triggering me triggers her because she fears making people upset. She was just very upset at me and my behaviour, and i was so terrified because i genuinely had no idea that what i was doing was upsetting her.

I was sobbing on the phone to mum (this all happened at my friend’s house so i wasn’t even at home which was worse) and yeah i just feel beyond wretched. I feel like i’m going to end up alone and that if i do this again she’ll break up with me and i know for a fact that this will happen again because i have BPD and don’t always regulate healthily. But i am trying so hard. I told her that i was really proud that she was honest with me because i am. I don’t want to loose this relationship.. It just all feels unfair. Everything. The fact that i can’t explain my mental process without it hurting her, the fact that i have BPD, the fact that i’m still really dysregulated, the fact that i’m the main problem in this relationship.. It just sucks.

If you read all this thankyou for your time, i love you."
210,1,"Like the title says. My life is a joke. It’s nothing like I thought it would turn out to be. Early 30s, living in an attic, unmarried with no kids none of that in sight any time soon, can’t afford to own even a condo, severe mental health issues. It won’t ever get better. It won’t. My life was destined to fail. It’s said mental illness shouldn’t define you but literally this is a personality disorder…this is ME. my fucked up experiences and trauma in my life made ME. A fucked up failure of a human being. I don’t fit in anywhere. "
211,2,"I keep myself very composed, but if I'm pushed too much I completely fall apart and all the feelings come flooding at once. This happens very rarely. 

I find a way to suppress my emotions so much they're almost unrecognizable. If I feel rejected or abandoned, it's literally the only thing I can think about and I completely spiral, but I don't actually feel anything. Ever since I went through a significantly traumatic abandonment, I just shut off my feelings completely. 

Does anybody else relate to this? It's literally the opposite of one of the primary criteria but I feel like it makes sense in some way?"
212,2,At the moment I'm just so conflicted because I don't know who I and I don't know where I stop and my eupd begins I'm 29 and I just don't know anything about myself. I don't know what my life is and how to cope and I feel just empty constantly. I want deep connection with people but also leave me alone. I just feel like I'm constantly struggling. I don't know if anyone else out there struggles with the same and can give some advice because that would be big help 
213,3,"I am so so tired of feeling everything times a million. I am tired of being so hard on myself for every little thing. I am tired of never being able to do **enough** for my brain, even when I am doing all the things I am supposed to do. I am tired of crying all the time. I am tired of spiraling when my loved ones compliment/appreciate me because I do not feel like I deserve it. I am tired of exhausting my poor sweet partner who has never complained about any of it, except for how mean I am to myself, because he loves me. I'm tired of everything feeling so personal. I'm tired of all my interactions feeling false. I'm just fucking exhausted, my chest hurts all the time and my life objectively is very good, why is that? Brain betrayal, ""I don't deserve this, and I am going to ruin it all"" I can at least say that writing this out into the abyss, possibly to a few of you, has calmed me down immensely, thank you ❤️"
214,2,"So, I (24M), have quiet BPD, or atleast some of the ""symptoms"".  
During my life I always had girl friends (platonic, not romantic), but I only had a girlfriend once, she had BPD aswell, as you could imagine, things didn't work great.  
I have disorganized attachement style and it is so hard for me just to imagine having a girlfriend again, I have anxiety aswell, I don't know why but with every girl, things go great until things get serious and close to a relationship, that's when my anxiety spikes, I have periods where I want to be outside 24/7, hanging with friends, and other periods where something happens to me and I just isolate, I don't want people to see me for who I am, because in my mind, if I show anyone how I am, they are gonna abandon me (happened a couple of times).  
I don't ""split"" I just internalize the feelings and don't say a word, my question is, what tf should I do, start talking to people and eventually make them suffer, or make myself suffer, or just stay single and feel unloveable?"
215,2,"Not just apathy or disdain, but severe mistrust, and a need to stay away. Paranoia. It’s like my FP is a constant trigger for my behaviour and I withdraw, go cold and need space to the point where I could go days without seeing them and it honestly wouldn’t bother me. Can’t say this to them. It will upset them, and I do care about their emotions. 

Anyway, lately, I’ve been questioning whether or not I actually love them. I think I know deep down that I do, but it feels like I don’t right now. Like I’m disconnected, I don’t feel tethered to the relationship and it all feels like a chore, and an obligation. Does anyone ever feel like this? Have you ever gone through this and was it temporary? Because I don’t want to leave them, but spending time with them right now has become an issue, I don’t want to. I want space. I feel paranoid though? And like I am no longer emotionally connected to them. I don’t even have a libido for them anymore. It is irritating me, I feel like I need to leave even though I really don’t want to and majority of me hopes this is a temporary setback in feelings. "
216,1,"I've been with a girl for about 6 months, at least I was until tonight. 
We left by mutual agreement, but she was more in agreement than me I think. The reason is: 
I am a transgender M and she is a Muslim girl.... The reason is that her family will not accept my trans identity, nor her friends.
I feel, very rubbish. I regret all those times when my BPD played tricks in our relationship but above all, this transidentity which distanced me from the person I saw as the being of light in my life. I know it's not her fault, as she told me she doesn't want to put everyone against her for someone like me for whom she has no certainty regarding our future. But it hurts a lot. 
A few months ago I assured myself that my trans identity could not pose a problem and she assured me that yes but I realize that she has changed her mind (something she has the right to) but I am frustrated that she let herself be carried away by her feelings and that she could not be lucid at the beginning when I asked her the question. 
I feel very alone and I have no friends to rely on. I'm not going to do anything stupid that could put me in danger, but I'm helpless I think? 
"
217,2,"So me and my bf got in an argument tonight. Me and my roommate both have bpd. He used a rude tone of voice asking her to close a door behind her and she talked to me about it so I talked to him about it. I asked if he could apologize to her and just clear things up that he didn't mean it like that. His response was to just leave and walk 40 minutes across town to go home. All I asked for was some accountability, and he shut down and ran away. He's got a lot of childhood trauma so I wouldn't be surprised if he has bpd and/or c-ptsd, but he doesn't have insurance so we can't know for sure and he can't really get the help he needs. He said he'd apologize to both of us tomorrow but then he said if I'm done with him after that then so be it. That really hurt because it makes me feel like he doesn't care about the relationship and is more worried about not getting hurt himself, which I understand having bpd myself, but I don't know what to do about it. How can I help him work on his avoidance issues?"
218,2,my boyfriend leaves for college in a couple months and i don’t know wtf i’m gonna do he’s going to be three hours away and all i keep thinking about is girls coming up to him or him hanging out with girls bc his sister has friends down there i’m actually losing my mind over this and i don’t know what to do or how to not actually lose my shit 
219,1,"I am pretty early in my recovery, I only really grasped that I have bpd and that my view of the world and my reaction to events is not normal about 9 months ago. Now that I have more perspective I have been really struggling with accepting how awful I have been to the people close to me. 
For context: I have been in a relationship for 3 years. Since I don’t have any friends and my family has never been too emotionally supportive  I have solely relied on him for love, friendship, and everything else in between. We have had a very turbulent relationships and he has been through some brutal events due to family or other problems of his own. So essentially he has had a fucked three years on top of having to deal with my unstable, at times vengeful, self adsorbed, unsupportive BPD ass. 
I have come to learn that he has felt so alone and disrespected by me for most of the relationship since I would always split on him for criticizing me or my actions in attempts to help me or get me to work on myself. 
He is a very logical but intense guy. He is very smart and logical so he is very solution oriented. I always thought that him not focusing on emotions or on being empathetic was mean. I was always so hurt by how he would not give me emotional comfort so I got angry and often didn’t listen how to resolve my situation. 
As a result we both felt ignored and hurt which caused so many problems and resentment. 
I really think his is the love of my life but he is now fed up with dealing with me and burnt out so he broke up with me. 
We still live together and he has not set a formal date for me to move out. He still loves me but is hurt and resentful so he often vents about how awful I’ve been. How little I have improved, how I give myself too many chances and big part of me still being disordered is not choosing to be better. How he cannot sometimes doubts I ever really loved him because you do not disrespect and torture someone you love in this way. 
I don’t blame him at all and I agree with him that I have been worst than awful but now I don’t know what to do. How do I move on from doing all this? Should I forgive myself? I hate myself so much for doing this and feel like I need to do something to ameliorate the situation but I can’t change the past and he doesn’t want my help. I feel horrible about hurting him and making his live all the more miserable because I was so up my own ass in delusion that I didn’t see what was happening in his life. I did not give him the support or empathy he deserved and I completely destroyed the human that had loved me the most ever in my life and has done everything in his power to help me. 
He is the reason why I am now more self aware and working to resolve my issues. I don’t know what to do without him. I don’t deserve him and I just want to help him be okay after all I did but I think the best I can do is leave. I feel like I have destroyed my future and the best I can do now is let go of the dream of a happy life and family I had with him. I thought he would be my forever but I took him for granted and now it all gone and I have no one to blame but myself. I am an emotional mess, I have no one I can rely on, and I absolutly hate myself for this but want to be healthy instead of spiraling. "
220,0,"I've gotten to the point in dating where I think only someone with bpd will understand me and be able to handle the burden I bring. I'm sure it would be hard, but it seems like the only way for me rn. Anyone wanna shot some wisdom or share experiences? "
221,1,"I genuinely think I’m a bad person. Outside of the BPD, which is part of the problem, but I feel like the rest is just that-I am a bad person, but I don't know.

I am incredibly selfish, I belong to a huge circle of friends, but I don't give two shits about any of them but two, and even one of them, sometimes, I just stop caring about. There is this one kid that I particularly dislike, he is entitled as fuck, constantly thinks he is the victim, and is a complete asshole to everyone-except, of course that one guy in the friend group whos also kind of an ass, but that he desperately seeks the constant approval of. I refuse to address his presence, I avoid him like the plague, (very obviously), if I have to address him-I will act as physically repulsed as I possibly can, I enjoy seeing him suffer. Like, when other people give him disgusted looks, when people talk shit about him, when he gets socially isolated, when anybody gets upset with him, etc. I treat him less than human, I usually refer to him as “it”. I turn everyone that I can against him, but keep up with the kind face, like I don't want to talk shit about him, so, I just let people think it was their idea. He's called me out before, he bitched to our mutual friend that I was “obviously manipulating” everyone. I just laughed in his face, because now he sounds absolutely absurd-and I love it. Hes smacked me before, he literally boo-boo lip pouts with his fucking arms crossed like a toddler. It's ridiculous, so I hit him in the back of the head with force and he bitched; “I didn’t hit you that hard” and I just looked at him disgustedly and told him not to fucking touch me. I’m probably obsessed, but this certainly isn't the first person I’ve become disturbingly obsessed with, and likely won't be the last. I daydream throughout the day at school about brutally murdering and torturing him. Then, about all of the legal shit i’d have to deal with, and considering how insignificant of a thing he is, it's just unnecessary that my life could be ruined for getting rid of that atrocity. It makes me happy and satisfied to think about nothing ever working out for him. Like, I feel that giggly-butterfly feeling people describe when liking someone when I think about inflicting horrible suffering onto him. I’ve also recently come to the realization that I am the problem in all of my relationships-and, I find that I really couldn't give less of a shit. I’m very matter-of-fact and flat in my demeanor, and I'm very reserved. No one knows me and at this point, it's probably my fault, but I can't trust anyone. I don’t love myself, I don’t like myself, I am merely allied with myself. I am constantly irritated with everyone and in a split second that could turn into rage where I try to physically harm someone. The fantasies of torturing and hurting people is not selective to people I hate, or even generally dislike, you just have to have recently pissed me off, and with my irritation, you probably did. I’ve found that I do not, and cannot, have empathy for human beings. I can feel empathy for animals, other living things, and even sometimes inanimate objects, but never people. If your dog died, I don’t feel sorry or even a remotely negative emotion for you, but if I saw a dog die, or even just roadkill, it makes me sad. I cannot feel any romantic feelings-at all. I used to be able to in my elementary years, crushes and all, but I suppose something happened and it's just not available to me anymore. So, I’m obsessive, cruel, and I just don’t care at all-I don’t even want to become a better person-and this is while I’m calm and at my “baseline” or “normal”. My diagnosis are; ASD, ADHD, BPD, MDD, C-PTSD, and OCD, if that explains this and it's just something I’m missing. Does anybody have any idea what this is, why I am like this, or is this just the way I am?

"
222,1,"Just that really. I'm in such a horrible place right now. My baby is such a beautiful, happy, clingy, loving little boy. He has no idea his mum is a wreck but that won't last forever. He just wants to be with me and cuddling me and playing all the time and I'm so tired and so, so sad. I feel like he's wasted on me and deserves so much better. My partner is incredible and supportive but works long hours and he obviously can't cure my broken brain and he must feel he's under such pressure to be the normal parent. I feel so angry that I can't enjoy my wonderful life and all the love that surrounds me. What is wrong with me?? I just want to reach into my head and flick a switch."
223,2,"Ok so I posted about my ex-fiance who has BPD about 3 weeks ago . So here’s a update-ish and some questions about it . So her family forced her to take me to court over what had happened on the Monday 19th . I got served 9 days later , and she put the wrong date . When we got there she was walking in and seemed happyish until she saw me and she got depressed and regretful. She got even more upset and depressed when I said I’m about to start crying . By the end of the court session she had her head hung low and couldn’t look anyone in the face . The judge let me say what I wanted which was “ I’m sorry , I wish I could go back and fix it all and how I treated you for 3 years . I still love you and want to be with only you . That I’d rather fix us as many times as it takes instead of starting over with someone else “ and then as she was leaving I said “I feel like I lost my world “ .

We’ll move on a few days and I seen her YouTube is still signed in on my tv and I looked at the recently played and she’s listening to sad country songs and just sad songs in general such as “ glimpse of us “ , “ here without you “ “ die for you ( the weekend “ , “ self care “ , just a bunch of other sad songs about being in a break up / longing the guy / girl you was with . Mind you she is already “ in a new relationship “ 1 week after we broke up .

She’s also updating her Pinterest boards “ dream wedding” , “goals” , “ room decor goal “ which we made them 3 together. There is a new one “ love letters to pookie “ which was my nickname she gave me .

Does this mean she is still thinking of the relationship we had and how she’s missing it ? Is the fog of emotions finally lifting after she’s started taking her medication? Is the wall of lies her family put up to hide the emotional/ wall of love we put up together finally cracking and falling apart ? Does this mean she’ll end up coming back?"
224,3,"I (19 FTM) have disliked my fp, who is long distance and does not have BPD for the record, for a while now (maybe for the past two months or so), but I still get very easily triggered by some of the smallest things that I would think wouldn't bother me since I personally believe that I dislike them. It's honestly hard for me to be sure if I dislike them because I am still able to have fun with them and have a genuinely good time, but most of the time aside from that, both with them and away from them, I feel miserable. They are almost all I can think about in our time apart, but it's never anything good. I'm always stuck thinking about the things I dislike about them or the little things that they said or did since knowing them. But let me put it into perspective before officially asking the question.

We are not romantic partners; however, they see us as more than best friends, and we are both comfortable with being affectionate and saying ""I love you"" to each other. I do not know a title for this kind of relationship or else I would give that instead for simplicity. We used to really care about each other deeply, or at least I thought they did but for a while I've been finding myself unhappy or tense unless we're doing something I heavily enjoy (but even then, there's still risk of me either me upsetting them or getting upset myself).

We talk every day, morning till night, but when we greet each other in the morning we never exchange ""good morning"" or ""how are you"" and it's one of the things I don't like about them. I don't say it because when I used to, they would consistently act uninterested, or they would say they don't want to talk about it/""it's useless small talk"" so I stopped on their behalf, and it bothers me that they don't ever say it to me when they know that I like being checked on since I like to share my feelings and have theirs shared with me. In place of any morning greetings, it is instead a message either sharing something they like or asking me to answer our rp, if not both of these things.

I also handle my episodes alone when they occur because they don't like dealing with me when I am upset or when I so much as act a little different/risk of an episode/just sad in general, so they never end up knowing about any of them because I usually never let them know that anything was ever wrong to begin with. I often feel like I have to hide what bothers me and pretend I'm doing okay so as not to bother, and I dislike how it feels like they just don't care at all about how I'm doing and instead only want me for what I can offer them. We do say ""I love you"" when we say goodnight, but I feel like they don't mean it and are saying it out of habit more than anything and talking to them about any issues I have, like this one, feels like I'm telling them things they just don't want to listen to or deal with.

There is also the fact that we don't have a lot in common and it feels like we are polar opposites. We have maybe one shared interest in terms of media, and we share no hobbies (unless you count watching videos together and video games but even then, our video game preferences are different) and it feels difficult to share stuff I like because they hate most of it or simply doesn't like entertaining my interests often if they don't align with theirs. I honestly can't really complain too much about the last part since they do send me a thing or two once in a while, and I share the same issue with not really entertaining interests I myself am not interested in, but it feels more difficult when he expects that out of me and doesn't like to do the same or go to the same extent. Things like this make it difficult for me to make or keep friends in general, but they happen to be the only friend I have. I can't call it quits on them because I'm still crazy attached to them for some reason as well as the fact that they joke about how no one else would put up with me like they do, and I know they're right. They're all I have, and I can't find it in myself to cut contact, so I feel stuck.

I feel like there's details that I wanted to/should have included but I can't remember them right now so this all the context I can give at the moment. I'll add more if I remember at a later date/in response to someone if it's relevant to their question. I am also okay with people asking for more details in certain situations.



Tl;dr my fp is not the kind of person I find it easy to get along with/stay friends with, but I can't break ties with them because I'm too attached.

  
Is this normal for people with BPD to not like their fp despite them being their fp? I don't have it marked as such, but if anyone wants to give advice that is also welcome."
225,2, I already tried to post this and I don't think it went through so we're trying this again. I think I fucked up because I off-handedly mentioned my auditory hallucinations to my stepmother (F33?) I've had hallucinations my whole life. I was always told they weren't that big of a deal that it was just my imagination being active and it's weird to learn that most people don't hear things that aren't actually there or see things that aren't there and I'm just realizing that this isn't normal as of like today. Within the last week I've gotten really hyper aware of my hallucinations and I had one earlier. I was hearing distance screaming and doorbells. I was home alone. Nobody was screaming. Usually it's when I'm stressed that I have the intense ones. I used to see 24 ft Elmo's chasing the car and shit like that. Can I visually say them no but do I feel like they're there and sometimes can I see them? Yeah I also talk to ghosts and spirits. I see ghosts so it was often put off as that as well. And now I'm pretty much being punished for not realizing that they were an issue because if I don't bring it up in the next two sessions I'm apparently going to be pooled from online therapy with the person I trust forced to go to in-person therapy which I don't do well with. And my parents are going to monitor my sessions to make sure something's being done and I don't want to do that. And I'm still a minor so I can't do anything about that either (F17) My next medication appointment is scheduled for the day after my 18th. My next therapy is on Monday. I was supposed to have it today but things came up. Can anybody help me process this before my next therapy appointment? I don't know what to do and I feel like I'm a bad person for not realizing that it was an issue?
226,3,"Idk if it’s my bpd or just who I am as a person but it is so hard for me to make friends. And I feel like if I did have friends then I might be less likely to spiral over stuff my boyfriend does or doesn’t do..


Currently locked in the bathroom drinking vodka debating my next move because no matter what, it’s gonna be dramatic. Even if that’s not my intention… 
Im either gonna argue with him, which has a tendency to escalate, or im gonna leave the house, which he’s not going to like..  "
227,2,"So I did something I think is kind of stupid. I have had hallucination since I was little. It was always brushed off as I just had an active imagination. I mentioned it in passing earlier today to my stepmom. I (F17) did not realize how big of an issue it was honestly until today a few minutes ago. Now I feel like a piece of shit for never saying anything because apparently because of that I can't get my license and everything like that. And I'm not allowed to drive with my auditory hallucinations and if I lie about it it's a felony apparently. And now I'm in trouble for never mentioning it. It seems because now if I don't talk about it in therapy within the next two sessions I'm being pulled from my online therapy and forced to go to in-person therapy where my parents can monitor what I'm talking about which what I talk about is not something they want to hear and my next Med appointment isn't until the day after. I turn 18 in August and I don't have access to just make my appointments cuz my therapy was set up on her phone through her stuff. So I need her to make me a new appointment with Med specialist about this and now she's not responding to me. Is there any advice anybody can give me and am I a bad person for never saying anything like I used to hallucinate there being two sock monkeys in the window of my grandparents bedroom and I would watch them and they would wave at me at night and I was just laying in bed with insomnia as a 6:00 to 10-year-old in between. My grandparents and I told my grandmother about it and she just brushed it off as me having an active imagination. Almost all of my hallucinations that I've told them about was just brushed off as an active imagination so I stopped talking about them And now I feel like I'm in the wrong and that she's mad and hates me right now even though I know she's just trying to look out for me. But I also feel like I'm just wasting their money with my therapy even though I'm talking about emotion things not things like this because there's a lot going on in life that I have just talked about instead. Like my boyfriend of 5 months breaking up with me, my grandfather's cancer stuff like that and I didn't realize how bad the hallucinations were until today when I had to call my sister to ground me to reality because I kept hearing doorbells even though I was home alone and nobody was at the door. So if there's any advice I know this is long and I apologize"
228,3,So I've been breadcrumbed and discarded after many years with an FP and I'm holding a lot of pain and anger. I've worked very hard on communicating clearly and not lashing out because that's still my friend I feel empathy for but I have a lot to process and I don't know what to do with it all. I've already been in a delicate state for a while and wanted to know if someone has advice for this situation or just habits to avoid spiralling in general? Ty 🌱
229,1,Stopped seeing my fwb and it hurt more than I thought. I’m not built for that life anymore. Just turned 30 and I think I’m gonna be single from here on out. I just wanted to vent tbh my body just feels numb.

My savings is about to be empty and I’m broken. I don’t want to be alive anymore whoever give me this illness with cptsd and depression and anxiety with no sense of self image nor purpose. I feel like I was doomed from the start. Sadly I got a 8 month old I will possibly never see again because when my soon to be ex wife had her hormonal imbalance. The things she did and said triggered me. I have TOO MUCH TRUAMA!!!! I Feel I lost touch of reality I can’t even fake being okay anymore ……. It’s not even the illness to blame its all my fault. The way I reacted that caused me to lose everything. I’m too deep in my own grave. I think this will be the end 
231,0,"Been really depressed lately so I Started taking 10 mg Prozac on Thursday and I’m in love. No intrusive obsessive thoughts no over thinking. I just do. Work has gotten better, home seems easier. I feel nauseous when I eat too much even if “too much” isn’t that much but I’m so thankful for that because it’s helping me realize I don’t need that much food. I even played my violin today. I just think and do it’s not an over played drama of why I shouldn’t. I’m sitting out on my porch soaking the sun just looking around and being present. I would get scared before because who would see me. Now it’s not that I don’t care it’s that I’m more concerned with being present. I know it’s been less than a week but I feel good. I really hope all these positives stay 
Thanks all "
232,2,"He did ask me how I felt about it and at first I disagreed and said no and lashed out. Then I thought I wanted to be the cool chill gf and said he could. Now they’re leaving for the trip and I’m struggling. I had an emotional crisis last night and said hurtful things to him. I’m mad he even had the thought of going. Am I been unfair? 

Edit to add context:
1.	⁠My bf lived abroad for eight years and he met her while he was working there. They have been friends since. She is visiting for the second time. They are going outside of state to visit a canyon.
2.	⁠We’ve been together for a lil over a year. I don’t know her, haven’t met her. Only heard about her a month ago when he said she was visiting. I knew they like to send memes or reels to each other or shared music but nothing else.
3.	⁠He did invite me but I just started a new job so I don’t have any time off yet, something he already knew.
4.	⁠As she has already visited our city two years ago, they decided to take this trip so she can see a different part of the country.
5.	⁠I didn’t ask for much details about the trip. I just found out yesterday they are not flying over, they are doing a roadtrip. And they’re visiting a canyon which is 8 hours away. That’s all. She’s getting in today and they are leaving tomorrow. They are staying at an airbnb. They are not meeting anyone there. It’s just the two of them.
6.	⁠Important to mention that I’ve never taken a trip with my bf like this. He works long hours but since both of them are teachers they have the summer off from work."
233,1,"It happens to me a lot that I don't find the direction of my life, one day I am totally excited about a career and the next day I want to dedicate myself to something else, that stability took me about 10 years, I went through more than 6 careers at 27 years old. I know I'm intelligent and I can do whatever I want, but I feel like I'll never be able to exploit my potential and I can't find a single path. 
Whenever I am deeply moved by something, I become obsessed but it only lasts for months or days. 
I really want to dedicate myself to the IT field but then I sit in front of the computer and I completely block myself or I want to study or do something else (sometimes I can advance subjects and I concentrate a lot, but generally I am unmotivated).
That instability frustrates me. Sometimes I just want to stop feeling this pressure and kill myself because I feel like I will never find a place in the world. I felt like a parasite on several occasions. Everything really costs me a lot and the emptiness grows even more with the years. I think about all the good things and the company of my dog, I cling to life. Sometimes I just wish it would go away so I don't have to endure it anymore and feel like a useless shit. And I feel bad thinking like this, and shit keeps growing "
234,1,"I don't know about you guys, but the deep feeling of emptiness and boredom is very triggering. I've been trying to ignore it for a few hours now, but I don't think I'm doing so hot. It straight up makes me suicidal. I've tried watching a movie, doom scrolling, taking a nap... the feeling is so profound and intense that I feel like bashing my head against a wall or something. I don't wish this shit upon no one. "
235,3,"I feel everyone's been so mean to me the last couple of days. I hqve no motivation to do anything. When I was in the car with my older sister and my mother, they both began bullying me. My other 2 sisters have been mean to me, telling me to shut up. My dad's been rude. I feel after they know i self harm, there nice to me for a week then they don't care anymore. Im feeling really stressed about my tests, which has caused me to relapse in the past "
236,2,"I apologize for the wall of text - this is gonna be LONG. Like...LONG LONG. I don't want advice, just understanding. I've gotten enough bullshit hollow advice from friends who don't fucking get it. 

But I literally don't know where else to go with this. Please don't judge me too harshly - I just wanna talk to people who get it. I feel ashamed even saying this shit anonymously but here we go...

I had a very big crush on this person I sorta knew back in the Fall. A limerent FP-style crush. This is the first time that happened with anyone I have ever actually interacted with and it was incredibly severe.

We started talking late december, and it was great at first. But then they did a 180 and told me they just wanted to fuck me, but that was it. that they didn't care about me or even really see me as a friend - they just wanted sex and thought i would put out easily and wanted to use me and my feelings for them against me, just to subjugate me and force me into sexual submission (which i explicitly detailed not wanting BEFOREHAND). just so the fucker could have an orgasm at my expense. 

They did not treat me kindly either, admitted to not caring about me, would often sexualize and dehumanize me in grotesque ways, tried to force me into a sex act i said i explicitly didn’t want to do, was just plain mean all the time, and even admitted to not seeing me as a person and would mock me for setting boundaries or asking to be seen as one. Then, they would promise to abide by my boundaries, only to get worse. i said i wouldn’t fuck them and so they said we would never talk again if i didn’t buy them food. And so i did. For 3 months. Luckily, we never had sex or even touched. 

It turned out they had a main FWB they actually cared about and was just trying to use me as a side ho or worthless sex toy of sorts. it was just me that was being treated like this. and i did NOTHING to deserve it. 

I then cut contact like a month after this. well, i tried to cut contact then and there, but they kept trying to reach me and begged me to ""cOmE bAcK."" and i unfortunately did. but THEN i cut contact weeks afterwards.

ANYWAYS. i can't move on. I'M STILL OBSESSED. no matter what, i think about them CONSTANTLY and am back on my ""researching"" kick. 

i just saw the fucker in one of my mutual's posts like 20 minutes ago on insta. i have told EVERYONE about this whole fiasco described above - EVERYONE. well, except the people who know the bitch - we don't have any shared friends (just mutuals). So, i'm kinda crashing out about the insta post for some reason like idk WHY i should but...i am. i'm still hung up on this ugly, annoying, abusive bastard. 

TLDR: I was obsessed with an FP who turned out to be evil and abusive and I don't know how to get over them and I just saw brand new pictures of them on a mutual's insta and I'm crashing out about it. I am >> NOT << looking for advice, just empathy and understanding.

237,2," TW: MENTION OF ABUSE.

I’ve(19) been in this weird not-relationship with a girl (23) for over two years. We’re not dating, she says she’s straight, but the way she treats me isn’t exactly platonic. Nd even she doesn’t fully understand why she does the things she does with me..

She tells me I’m her favorite girl ever. And I believe her. Because even when she disappears for days or weeks and comes back out of nowhere, I still respond instantly with a smile. I love her with my whole heart. Like the kind of love that’s deep in my bones. And she loves how devoted I am to her. How I always stay.

But she says things that should probably make me run. Like how sometimes she forgets I’m a person. That I don’t even feel like a pet or a friend or a girl. Just a thing she owns. Something obedient and soft and cute that should agree with everything she says, not get upset, just follow her and be hers. 

She says things like she wants to hurt me physically, and gets extremely mean and jealous too sometimes, and admits it’s messed up, but blames it on how I act around her saying ""baby you just act like you want to be owned"". Or says it's for my own good and that i'm dumb and i don't know what's best for me. And the worst part is i think she’s right. I feel calm when she has control even if it really hurts sometimes. It makes me feel safe. But my friends keep telling me that i'm getting abused and that she's taking advantage of my fucked up mental health and the fact that she's my fp.

The thing is, I’ve been abused before. Like real abuse. For years. So I don’t understand why THIS ""abuse"" feels different. Why it feels soo comforting. Why I crave it and want to stay.

I feel broken for wanting this. I don’t know if this is healing or trauma just wearing a new face. I'm soo confused. But it’s the only thing that makes me feel like I belong to someone. And I don’t know how to let go of that.

I’m sat on the bathroom floor. It’s 3:30 in the morning. I had what I thought was an okay day. But the moment I got into bed I just unraveled into this mess. Severe urge to cry, just.. lowest of low feeling of hopelessness. This isn’t the first time- my meds that are supposed to help are not helping. And I, am hitting this thought of god, how many more of these episodes can I handle. I don’t want these. I don’t want this. These only ever happen to me late at night. I just don’t understand "
239,3,"Hi, I just found out that I have BPD and and it all makes sense now, but I need to talk to someone who understands. I found out that my boyfriend cheated on me. I mean he texted a girl to meet him. They never met and nothing happened. Normally I would never accept cheating, there is no excuse for it. But I think the context also matters. we've been together for 4 years. he's always been the person who supports me, loves me with all my flaws and appreciates me the most in the world, but I've always been critical of him, I've always reproached him for things and the problem is me. I feel very hurt now, I don't know whether to leave or stay. I look at him and I still love him. He told me that there were no feelings there, only his need for validation to feel wanted, because he's been struggling with extra pounds for years, and all I've done is criticize him every day, instead of supporting him. He told me that it's because of me that he's not losing weight. I just wanted to help him, but it seems that he's accumulated too much frustration and we both did that. I don't know what to do, I just want to disappear. I'm going to therapy soon anyway.

241,2,"BLACK OR WHITE THINKING

Diagnosed in 2021, been through therapy so I recognize my black or white thinking better than before but still have trouble with it.

Today I got triggered by realizing that my boyfriend talks more with my friend after meeting him for the first time whereas when we get to know one another (we met on a dating app), he barely texts me, I'd get 1-2 short messages in a day. He was also texting other girls before he confessed to me. 

Now, I don't see any ethical problem with it. HOWEVER, I could feel my mind starting to question things. ""Was I not interesting enough for him?"" ""Did he get with me because I was the one who stayed?"" ""Should he get with another person whom he'd have more fun with?"" was just a few of them, but I know I'm overthinking it. 

So it got me wondering, if that's a huge jump, what would common people usually think if presented with the same circumstances. Would they worry at all? And if they do, where would they usually stop? I genuinely wonder.

P.s. 1-2 short messages daily is considered normal in the dating scene in the country I'm in"
242,3,"Hey all,
I’m hoping to get some advice or just hear from people who can relate. I have both bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. Before getting medicated for bipolar, I had a very high sex drive—it honestly felt like sex was how I reconnected with my body after years of medical trauma. It was intense, immersive, and deeply emotional. Looking back, I can see that some of that intensity was probably driven by the bipolar and BPD.

Since starting Latuda (lurasidone), my libido has basically disappeared. I still get sexual feelings now and then, but it’s not the same. Sex used to feel like an all-consuming high, and now it just… doesn’t. It’s harder to climax, I feel stuck in my head during and after, and I don’t get nearly the same pleasure or emotional connection—unless I’m high, which obviously isn’t a sustainable solution.

The upside is that I’m not constantly craving sex anymore, which has helped me make better choices (especially since I’m not in a relationship and used to jump into casual sex too fast). But I really miss that feeling of connection to myself and my body. Sex has always been a huge part of how I experience intimacy and self-expression, and losing that feels like losing part of who I am.

I don’t want to stop my meds—Latuda has helped in a lot of important ways—but I also don’t know if I can live like this forever.
Has anyone else gone through this? Did anything help? Did you find a med combo that didn’t wreck your libido or make you feel so emotionally disconnected from sex?

I’d really appreciate any insight or shared experiences. Thanks so much ❤️"
243,1,"Hi, I am a 24F who was diagnosed with BPD a few years ago. I personally feel like I am living in my own hell. Relationships seem to always play out the same. First few months, I seriously am the happiest person, everything is great. But after a while, the highs and lows are unreal. The immediate feeling of resentment or fear of abandonment will overtake, and I tend to push them away. I feel like I cannot control these emotions. 

Is this really what’s to be expected in a relationship? What’s helped you guys overcome these obstacles that seem to arise everyday? "
244,3,"***CW: Emotional abuse, abandonment, medication pressure, emotional labor***  


I’m a 22-year-old woman with autism and BPD, and lately I’ve been reflecting on the pattern I keep finding myself in. Not just in dating, but in family too. I grew up with a biological father who came and went from my life, blaming my mom for everything and expecting me to just understand and forgive him without ever offering true accountability. As a kid, I had to go along with whatever made him comfortable and when I finally spoke up as a teen, he walked away again. I never got a real apology, just vague guilt trips and emotional avoidance. He always made himself the victim. And I’ve realized now, that dynamic didn’t just damage me growing up I carried it into my relationships.

In my last relationship, I found myself doing everything: emotionally, mentally, and practically. My partner didn’t have a license, a car, or any real plan for the future, but he had expectations of me. He used my home like a temporary vacation rental. He’d leave trash, ignore the way I asked for things to be done, act passive-aggressive when I set boundaries. He even left condoms in my house after I told him to please just keep them in his own overnight bag. I was already the one on birth control, and now I was apparently responsible for managing that, too. There were other things that made me feel invisible, like a lack of aftercare or having to constantly explain why something felt wrong. I was exhausted.

I’ve been on medication before **Venlafaxine (Effexor) for 2.5 years**. It numbed me to the point where I wasn’t “better,” I just stopped reacting. I stopped caring. And once I quit, I started to reconnect with myself again, with my feelings, my anger, my boundaries. But my partner wanted me to go back on the meds not because he cared about my health, but because I was easier to deal with that way. Quieter. Less resistant. More “stable,” because I was too drugged out to challenge anything. It made me feel like the version of me that had opinions and emotions wasn’t welcome.

His family even said I made him a better person like I was a rehab program in girlfriend form. But as soon as I stopped overextending myself, I was too much. I stopped carrying the emotional weight for both of us, and suddenly I was the problem. I’ve spent so much of my life being the person who holds it all together for others, whether it’s my dad, or a boyfriend who wants support without offering any in return. And now? I’m tired of it.

I’m tired of being someone’s therapist, emotional support animal, life coach, or substitute mom, instead of a partner with her own needs. I’m tired of being praised for my resilience while being quietly punished every time I use my voice. I’m tired of being “too much” the moment I ask for emotional equity.

I know I’m intense. I feel deeply. I analyze everything. I care more than I should, and I try to fix things because I don’t want others to feel what I’ve felt. But I also know now that I’m allowed to stop fixing. I’m allowed to say this isn’t love when it feels like I’m drowning. I’m allowed to choose myself, even if it makes other people uncomfortable.

If any of this sounds familiar, if you’re tired too, you’re not alone. You don’t have to make yourself smaller to deserve peace. You don’t have to medicate your truth just to be tolerable. You don’t have to be the person who absorbs everyone else’s mess just because you’re capable of holding it.

I’m not bitter. I’m just done. And maybe that’s the beginning of something better."
245,1,"I'm so done with everything. I'm done with friendships, I'm tired of being unconsciously hurt all the time, trying my best to explain why I'm hurt and how they should act differently and still being shut down, even though I've voiced this exact issue. I'm done with my mom, I'm tired of making her see that she's my mom and has an obligation to take care of me. I'm also done with therapy, I'm tired of explaining and explaining and being misunderstood and given no help whatsoever. People just believe the wrong things all the time and I don't have the energy to try and make people treat me right.

I think I'm at a point where my mind is almost accepting that there's noone coming to save me, there's no reason to be angry, stand up for myself and try to make other people help me. Noone wants to anyway. How is it possible that everyone in my life who's close to me tells me they're ""so sad for me and wish there was help for me!"" and then refuse to help themself. I don't want to be in this much pain anymore

I've been thinking about how my BPD has kind of saved me all this time. If I wouldn't have these anger outbursts, messed up relationships with people and pursued with all I had to be so sick I'd be cared for - if I had accepted that there's just nothing I can do about it and nothing anyone else wants to do about it, >!I already would've killed myself.!< I haven't felt this sad in a long time. I still can't let the realisation sink in, I still hold onto the anger and the insanity instead of laying down, resting and being finally done with everything."

I've been jumping from favorite person to favorite person since I was 12. It’s always the same cycle—either I find someone new to distract me from the last one, or I crash out.

Right now, I have a new FP at work. He’s been incredibly patient and supportive, taking time to teach me and encourage me to do well at my job. But his last day is Thursday, and I can already feel myself spiraling. I barely talked to him today cause I was gonna cry.

 Honestly im embarrassed he became my FP so fast. I’ve only been at this job for two months, and I already feel deeply attached. I hate that I’m bracing for this emotional crash over someone who has no idea how important they’ve become to me"
247,2,"My fp is my younger sister. For context, I'm 22 and she's 15. I always want to talk to her and she gets super annoyed. She also gets super irritated when I try to relate to her.

I seen her part her hair a certain way and I thought it was super cute so I started parting my hair the same way too. How do I make sure that I am not crossing any boundaries and making her uncomfortable?

Edit: Seeking advice. Yes, I know that she shouldn't be my fp!!!"
248,1,"Hi my name it Nat and I'm 19. I want to start by saying I'm not making this post to try and get a diagnosis. I am only asking for advice on how to handle my situation and if I should bother going to a doctor about this. Also I don't know all the terms for what I'm feeling but I will try my best. I'm posting this on multiple subreddits to hear the opinions of people who have multiple different issues that I think could possibly be the cause of my symptoms. Feel free to ask questions.


   So for some background I'm disabled and am extremely limited in what I can do to begin with. So when I am (probably?) manic I can't do very much anyways so I'm not a huge danger to myself. I've noticed for the past couple of years that I tend to have high highs for a about 1-2 weeks that are followed by extreme lows for another week or two. This lack of consistency has been very frustrating and difficult. I have brain damage as well and have difficulty remembering things and get confused easily and having no consistency seems to make that worse.


   HIGHS-
 When I'm feeling these highs I get very antsy and want to do lots of things. I want to try new foods and explore things and I end up deep cleaning random things and getting more exercise and I engage in socializing much more. I tend to do these things so much that I burn myself out and cause flare-ups with my health issues and autistic meltdowns from too much socializing. I also tend to be much more sexually forward. The things I do aren't really all that crazy or reckless like I see being associated with mania when I research bipolar disorder, but I was thinking and it makes me wonder if I just don't do reckless things because I literally can't? Deep cleaning and exercise alone are very painful for me and make me at risk for passing out, injuring myself, or triggering stroke-like symptoms. When I'm this phase though I keep doing it and am very determined even if I'm suffering. 


LOWS-
  When I'm getting these lows I feel extremely depressed. I can't get out of bed, I can't feed myself, I can't bathe, and my symptoms of my health issues are worse for overdoing it when I was feeling good. I get extremely suicidal and can't stop crying when I'm by myself. I also experience paranoid delusions. One time I thought a pair of pants on the floor was secretly a demon that was watching me and I freaked out. Another time I thought my house wasn't actually my house and was a fake demon house. These delusions have been happening when I get rlly depressed before I started having these ups and downs. I've been having them since I was about 14. Now I don't get these delusions EVERY time I have these depressive episodes. I get them maybe every 2 sometimes 3 episodes. I sometimes get rlly depressed for a shorter period of time when something goes wrong or someone says something slightly wrong and I mean REALLY depressed. Like as if someone died like I get painfully depressed. And it makes me want to lash out but I just tell my bf that I'm having an episode and he helps me through it and then after I'm back in my own head I handle whatever triggered the episode.


   By posting this I'm mostly trying to figure out if I should bother going to get this checked out and how I should go about it. I already have to go to the doctor extremely frequently so adding more appointments can be overwhelming and expensive. I'm also wondering if maybe I have something and am not experiencing it the way most people do due to all my health issues. Feel free to ask questions and please give me your opinion or input.

252,3,"Hey ya'll! I am 20F and have been diagnosed with BPD for two years. A lot has happened since then (I'm a year completely sober from all substances but caffeine, just beat my bullimia, left a bad college situation, got a stable job and have kept it, went to IOP group therapy, workout and eat everyday, have a few good friendship, have a better relationship w my parents, and have fixed my relationship w my partner). There are two things I struggle with and one is hypers\*xuality and money spending. This post is specifically about spending money. 

Do any of you guys struggle with this? It's been so bad recently. Every time I get a paycheck I don't look in my bank account and just start buying things. It's not always when I'm unhappy, but I just do it whenever I feel particularly like doing it. I have no strategies for how to stop this and it's getting worse and worse and I'm about to move and need to save money. Have any of you guys curbed your compulsive spending habits with healthy tools? It seems that whenever I beat one addiction/symptom another one replaces it. 

Should I just monitor what I'm feeling that day and try to let ""cravings"" to spend pass? Should I treat it like how I treated my alcohol addiction?"
253,1,"I'm untreated, and don't have the funds to look for a phycologist, so all I've been doing it trying that dbt app, but I don't really know how to use it. 
But before I get distracted and off track: I had a favorite person, I cared about them, they made me happy and they made me feel loved, but I was incredibly jealous of their friends. They were good people, they all were but I was insecure and I felt like I didn't matter because my favorite person had been friends with them for years, and they weren't going to drop them for me. (I didn't ask for them to drop them, I asked for them to not leave me if I ended our relationship with their friends)

To add onto that, I was incredibly two-faced. I pretended to like the things they liked, I pretended to like the same interests as their friends, I tried to fit in and I *did* it, but I couldn't convince myself that it was real. Even if my favorite person reassured me over and over again that they cared about me, I couldn't believe it because I was lying to them and I couldn't believe that I was Loveable. 

But then I found out that even after all that effort into pretending to be someone I wasn't, I wasn't enough. FP's friend didn't see me as someone they wanted to be close too and I just completely snapped. I couldn't control myself, this was one of my first major meltdowns I had over people before, and I didn't know what to do with myself. I tried so hard to be likeable, I was loved by so many people I didn't care about, but I couldn't be liked by this one person. I know that logically not everyone would like you, and I knew this but I kept crying, I kept tweaking out privately in the DMS of my favorite person...and they just couldn't understand me, they kept pushing me to get me to tell them what's wrong because they couldn't understand why I was acting like this. I didn't understand either at the time. Even if I told them, they still didn't understand because they didn't understand the logistics of why I was crashing out. Then I just lashed out at them, I gave them attitude, I told them to don't bother trying to help because you obviously wouldn't get it. I lashed out at them and I immediately felt regret, because I noticed their tone. They way they spoke to me after and I tried to make it up. I apologized over and over again but it wasn't enough.i just made my favorite person realize that they needed me out of their life if they wanted to put their mental health first.

My favorite person was always so mature, they were so cool, and they were amazing. I cared a lot about them because they just seemed to have everything put together. So I shouldn't be surprised that they would cut me off, and I knew I should try to be better and I've been trying

But 50 days later since they ended our friendship (yes, I keep count) they never left me. I hate thinking about them, for regretting every choice I made, for missing them. It makes me feel better if I just hated them but I know they don't deserve it but I don't know how to cope with their absence. Since they left, I couldn't get back into my hobbies, the things I loved doing but I miss the things I used to do but each time I try to do them. I'm reminded of that loss, and what I did wrong, and how I should've known better and I feel so regretful over it thst I just can't bring myself to do the things I love anymore.

How do I let someone go? I want to do the things I love again, but I can't turn off this grief of mine. It's been days, and that encounter is done and over with because I know my favorite person had moved on and doing the things they always done (I don't actually know, I hadn't checked their accounts and their friends for days and if I saw them I would have a panic attack, but I knew how mature they were so I already know that they'd move on) so I should be able to do the same things too. But I can't. 

It feels like I need their permission, or something to move on. But that's stupid lol. So I've been forcing myself to push through the grief and do the things I love but I think that just made things worse. 

I even sobbed and begged God to get them out of my head because I just want to forget about them. It's been long over but I can't seem to move on. I just want to do the things I want again..I even got new friends, new community. 

How do I achieve this? What did you guys do? "

I’m currently trying to avoid crashing out bc I haven’t heard from my boyfriend in 24 hrs. I last spoke to him yesterday around 11 via WhatsApp (we communicate there bc he’s in the late stages of his divorce). We stopped texting to avoid any harm coming to him should the ex request discovery, it’s a messy and brutal divorce. That being said, he hasn’t responded to me since lunch time and I am having a very hard time concentrating on anything else. I’ve still been productive today but I cannot rid myself of this gut sinking feeling. Every worse case scenario has riddled my thoughts like what if he’s dead or hurt or lost his phone or mad at me or I’ll never see him again? I hate my brain does this but I have to remain calm. He did have a court date today for a mediation hearing, his last hearing stopped around lunchtime but I would expect it could take all day. Certainly not longer than 4-5 PM though. He is aware of how silence triggers me so I hate to think he would intentionally try to ruin my day. Should I wait patiently until 4 or so? Should I text him and risk him being mad at me but at least getting a response he’s alive? Or should I take this as a sign he doesn’t respect me and my mental health and what is needed to keep me regulated and break things off?

Now I feel bad for even writing it. She’s not upset with me, she offered to help me find a good therapist and she is the most supportive mother I could’ve had. Can anyone relate to suffering in silence to spare the ones who love us most? How do people with our diagnosis walk the line between total trauma dumping and simply reaching out for a shoulder to cry on? That seems to be one of the areas I struggle in, I either tell people EVERYTHING or nothing at all and I recognize that’s not fair to my loved ones who are just trying their best to be supportive. 

(Below is the entry she found last night…)

""A soul-crushing emptiness so isolating, that it makes the next life look like a warm embrace."" 

All my life, at my core, I have felt alone. That pitting, gut-wrenching lonliness is the only thing that never truly leaves me. My family tries to be present in my life, but they only know what I've actually admitted to them. They dont know that every moment I spend by myself feels like an eternity of emotional torture. They dont know how much I obsess over building and maintaining relationships, even to the point of manipulating people to stay present in my life. They dont know that sometimes the lonliness is so intense that it causes physical pain which feels like someone ripping my heart and lungs out of my chest with a barbed wire glove. They dont know that I truly do not have intentions to live once Lady passes away. They do know I have issues with my mental health, but they dont have the slightest clue how bad things really are and how bad they have always been. Part ot me wants to tell them, to get help and feel better, but I dont want to be labeled as a “problem"" in my family, personal life, or at work.
I've always been the girl who could handle anything, who always gets back up after being knocked down, the one nobody had to worry about. The ""strong one"". When my issues would show a little bit, I would be labeled ""dramatic"" or just simply punished/reprimanded for my words or actions. Even when I was put in therapy due to my parents divorce at age 7, the focus of those sessions was surface level, and I hide my real issues well, so nobody ever bothered to look deeper, to understand me, to *really* listen to me.
My childhood home held so much love, and I did make a good amount of friends, but at the end of the day it was always just me, alone, in that bedroom."
260,3,"I've had the same FP for around a year and a half now (they don't know they're my FP, but we're extremely close friends) we have actually been childhood friends for years now, since we were young kids. We are now both at our own respective 'real' first adult jobs full time and are probably going to move away from each other soon. That hurts a lot. We haven't been apart since we were kids. I've laid the ground out to establish that this person, FP, is going through an extremely transformative period in their life, for other reasons I cannot say, but major ones.

I have agonized over this person for almost two years now. I know they love me but in my perception, it's always been up and down and insecure as I feel they don't provide me enough security about our friendship/relationship (it's been strange...). I've suffered so much mentally BECAUSE OF MYSELF, NOT THEM, but still, because of this friendship. I've tortured myself so much and have been thinking about cutting them off, my longest friendship, for months now. I've become toxic and only seeking out certain aspects and causing stress for them. I've tried so hard to become 'normal' again, to not see them as an FP anymore, but I just can't. I just can't. And I feel like a horrible friend. I beat myself up for it every single day. I hate myself for ruining such a good thing in my life.

I often talk about this when I'm drunk, or all the time, or thinking about it, and I can tell it's been so annoying to my friend group. The other night I got really upset and drunk and blocked FP. I unblocked them after my friend talked to me and opened my eyes. They said that it was selfish of me to only tell FP that their friendship was only worth it to me if it included certain aspects (which I told FP when I was drunk one time), and that FP really needs support right now during such a difficult point in their life. They said I wasn't thinking clear when I first blocked FP (who didn't realize I even blocked them cause it was so late at night), and that it was something that would both hurt us so much.

It made me realize how selfish I've been, and how much stress I've been causing everyone, but that friend was wrong. I've been thinking about blocking FP, my dearest friend, for years. To protect them. I can't bear to see myself in their life knowing how I am, and how they will still ultimately suffer for it. I have tried so many times. But I can't change myself. I think it's for the best mentally, for the both of us, even though I know FP will not understand and will resent me for the rest of their life if I do this. I don't want it to end in such a horrible way, but it's just that the only way I can get over things is to completely cut them off from my life, or to just disappear.

I don't know what to do. My heart is breaking so much. For two years now, I have not been able to get over FP. I have ultimately come to hate the kind of person I am, the friend I am to others, and it's a constant source of how much I hate myself and relapsing over and over in multiple ways. I feel like I'm at an all time low. I don't know what to do. I don't know what's best."
261,0,"My sister has BPD and I’m trying to understand her better, but I struggle with how often she seems to twist the narrative. For example, in the past she was abusive towards her ex, but now she minimizes it and says she only scratched him. I know not everyone with BPD acts this way, and I’m not trying to generalize or be disrespectful, I’m just trying to understand. Does she actually believe her version of events? I want to be more compassionate, but it honestly drives me crazy and I’m not sure how to navigate it."
262,3,"Was playing a video game. Had some people over the mix start to flame me and talk shit. Telling me I was stupid, calling me slurs and other terrible things. Instantly I crashed out, exited the game, and then deleted my account.

…fucking why???

I had so many coins built up. And I wasted it all. Why? Because a few people made me mad. It’s a *game.* In every game there are people like that so why tf do I even care???

I hate myself for that because all those hours I spent building up points? Wasted. I spent so long trying to grind to a higher rank and then some people are mean to me and I instantly delete. I’m a grown adult and can’t take a few people saying mean things on a video game for fuck sakes

Maybe this isn’t a big deal. It’s a game who cares 

But I feel like I do this with everything. Why? Who knows. I just want everything to stop or go away sometimes. So I crash out and just give up. 

I wanna bang my head on a table "
263,0,"i am diagnosed with bpd. recently i have come to the realization that while yes i do experience all of the criteria related to instability in sense of self and one's personality, i have noticed that during times of emotional conflict after being triggered, i almost feel like there are two distinct opposite sides of me constantly fighting each other. one is irrational, immature, and reactionary, the other is rational, mature, and calm. i wouldn't call them separate identities or ""people,"" but they are definitely two very different facets of my personality. is this sentiment something that is common with bpd? or should i ask my therapist to look into DID?"
264,3,"I’m crying so hard over physics. I just can’t take it anymore I feel stupid I can’t learn it and I have an exam tomorrrow and i’m just panicking and crying so hard over it I just wanna pass, I don’t wanma disappoint my mum anymore. That’s all I can’t sau much because i’m so exhausted it’s been hours and hours and I still have a shit load of papers to study"
265,3,"I can't take anymore today. It's 12:18pm and I'm DONE.

Therapist insists I should get a job once I move cities to take care of my parents (ALZ, diab, H.B.P) so I have the oportunity to create friendships and not be all day long with mom/dad and then by myself.

In theory is a good idea. EXCEPT for the fact that in Mexico there are no part-time jobs. Only full time jobs. She knows this. 

So by the time I get home, being 6pm the earliest and 7pm the latest, my dad will be tired of dealing with my mom and the house. That moment, when I get home, will be the time dad will disappear to vent, cry, breathe, do whatever he has to do for himself. But I'm already tired, right? I mean, I already worked a full shift. I have to get home, talk to my mom, do the dishes or clean the kitchen and be happy and smiley for my mom's sake.

By 9:30pm, the time my folks go to sleep, that's when I'd be going to my own home. That's the time I clean my own kitchen or pet my cats or clean my house and vent and scream and cry. And go to sleep and repeat. When do I actually rest?

It will be so...tiring and frustrating. And it feels like she doesn't see that. When will I have time to bpd myself and let it out and scream? 

She said: ""you can tell your dad, 'dad, today was not a good day, im tired, i'll be here just a little bit but i'm not all here'"" that is NOT going to work. 

I quitted my job and I am moving cities to help out. My dad has told me several times that If im not going to help, I shouldnt move at all, just stay where I am. 

I feel so frustrated, so tired. I feel like I am drawning all day long. It feels like no one understands the turmoil in my brain. My brothers...one might be neurodivergent, the other two are normies. I am the only one who is not married nor have a federal job, so im the only one who can move. I'm the only one who can uproot my entire life and abandon it and relocate for my parent's sake.

Father WON'T have a nurse taking care of mother. He won't have any stranger at home. He insists he doesn't even need anyone to help him clean the house, but constantly  complains about how dirty and dusty the house is and how mom won't even do the dishes anymore. Sometimes I feel like shaking my dad DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND HER MIND DOESNT WORK AS IT USED TO, ANYMORE! DON'T YOU GET IT?

but I feel like a bitch for having those thoughts.

Mom still knows who we are, who she is, where she is...but two weeks ago, she could no longer remember what she was doing (cleaning coffee, something they do regularly), she had to ask dad and it broke my heart.

I want to scream, shout, bark, bite, hit, destroy....I feel like a fucking nuclear bomb getting coold down with cold wetted clothes.

My nose is runny and I can't stop it. I want to cry all day long. I feel like throwing up also. Cutting myself doesn't even appeal right now. I just want to cease to exist right this moment. 

Everyone in my family is tired. So I can't talk to anyone. I barely have any friends left. And I feel like everytime I talk to anyone, all they hear is Hope complaining and complaining.

I started a meditation course because therapist thought it would be a good way to self-regulate. Joke's on her. I can't meditate shit. It's guided meditation, so I am hearing the words, pushing all thought aside, focusing in the words but my mind is black. I can't see images. If they say: ""you see a wooden door...."" I see shit. Sometimes I'll see wood, no door, no gilded mark, no intrincate wooden work. Just a piece of wood.

And as I listen to the words, I can see nothing...and I feel left behind, like im doing sometjhing wrong. Because to ""make the trip"" I have to follow them, right? I have to walk beneath the trees, I have to taste the magical tree's fruit.

But I can't.

And when I mentioned it they told me I'm overthinking...so I have to do more meditations to meditate.

So, RN, I'm at work, crying in front of the monitor, thinking rapidly, who can I talk to? who can help me feel like I'm not an imbecile?

imbecil? ...fuck my life, i can't even speak properly and this goddam keyboard has hard keys that won't push.

I'm tired. I wanna die. I just want to leave. I won't be able to go through the pain of watching my mom disappear and after her, my dad. And she's like: you need friends, you'll get a job, you need to have activities...

Last week I wanted to give some positivity to others going through this nightmare. But who am I kidding? 

Don't flag this post, seyaing you're concerned about me. I won't end it today. I have to be here, to take care of my parents, right? AND FUCK MY FUCKING LIFE after that. 

Has it ever happened, that you try to blow your nose with all your force and might to force the buggers hiding, out? But then you do blow hard and your nose is like FUCK YOU IM CLOGGING MYSELF OUT.

Don't send help. No one can help.

266,2,"I've known this for a quite a while now but lately I've been thinking about it. 
They called borderline personality disorder, now Emotional dysregulation disorder, though the term borderline is still widely used. 
Some consider it offensive because what they mean by that is ""being on the borderline of neurosis and psychosis"".
I understand why some people with this disorder may consider it offensive, but man for myself lately, I've just been really noticing how accurate that judgement is and it's kinda mind boggling. "
267,0,"I’m talking especially about mindfulness and distress tolerance. I’m wondering for those that went through DBT, post treatment, did anything in your life happen that you handled it much different than you would’ve prior to that? 

Maybe handling something that was especially triggering for anger issues but you did not explode or lash out. Or maybe something you’re usually anxious about and keep dwelling on but after treatment, something happened but you kept composure and was much more calm about it. "
268,2,"Hi everyone. i’m seeking out some answers or support as i just recently went to a psychiatrist and got diagnosed with bpd. I asked my psychiatrist three times if he was sure and he told me to print off a symptom sheet and check off the ones i have. I did that, but for whatever reason i kinda feel still in denial or like im making up everything. idk. i have ocd, major depressive disorder, and cptsd as well, but im just kinda wondering why i can’t accept the fact i have bpd despite me recognising i have almost every symptom. I just want advice or thoughts on how yall felt after a diagnosis and what you did for support. i was recommended dbt and medication called abilify. i completed IOP treatment but wasnt helpful at all. thanks in advance. "
269,1,"I have both BPD and bipolar disorder. I’ve tried to reach out before — even posted on SuicideWatch once — but I got banned. That really hurt because I was just being honest. So I’m trying here, because I don’t know where else to go.

Every time I make a mistake — even small ones — I spiral into huge distress. I end up cutting my arm with a razor blade. It’s not for attention. It’s the only way I’ve found to deal with this unbearable emotional storm. But people around me don’t get it.

My friends have noticed the scars. Some of them make comments like, “Why would anyone sane do that?” They don’t understand that I’m not trying to scare them — I’m trying to survive my own mind.

Today I told a friend that I want to do 4 research projects this summer, one of them about suicide detection through social media using machine learning. He knows about my previous suicide attempts (there were 5). After I mentioned the project, he just stopped replying. Ignored me. It made me feel so stupid and ashamed. Like I don’t deserve to talk about these things or try to make something meaningful from my pain.

That silence made everything inside me explode. I had just woken up, but I went back to bed out of exhaustion. The emotional intensity is too much. Now I’m here, fighting the urge to cut deeper than I have before. I don’t want to do it, but I also don’t know how to make the pain stop.

I guess I just want someone to see that I’m not crazy. That I’m trying. That I’m not seeking attention — I just don’t know how to be okay.

If you’ve been here, or if you understand… please talk to me."
270,0,"Hey everyone,
I’m a 29F diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder comorbid with Bipolar Disorder. Just wanted to share the current meds I’m on and get your thoughts/experiences. I know everyone reacts differently, but sometimes it helps to hear from others in similar boats.

Here’s my current cocktail:
💊 Axonyl (Quetiapine) 100mg – Helps with sleep and mood swings. Honestly, one of the most stabilizing ones for me. I feel less reactive and more emotionally regulated overall.
💊 Imovane (Zopiclone) 7.5mg – For sleep. Works well but I’m aware of dependency risk. I only take it when really needed.
💊 Solian (Amisulpride) 200mg – Antipsychotic. This one’s been weird. Some days I feel clearer, but it sometimes flattens me emotionally. Still figuring out how I feel about it.
💊 Deroxat (Paroxetine) 20mg – SSRI. Been on this a while. Helps with anxiety and intrusive thoughts, though it blunts me a bit emotionally.
💊 Nozinan (Lévomépromazine) 100mg – Heavy sedative. I take this at night when my thoughts spiral. Knocks me out but makes me really groggy the next day.
💊 Anxiol (Bromazepam) 6mg – For acute anxiety. A lifesaver during panic or intense episodes, but I try not to overuse it.

🧠 My overall thoughts:
Some days, this mix makes me feel like I’m floating through life but at least not drowning. The mood swings and suicidal ideation aren’t as violent anymore. But I still feel so sensitive, like everything touches me more deeply than it should. I don’t want to be numb—I want to feel like me, just safer inside my own head.

💬 Has anyone else been on a similar combo? What helped you most with managing both BPD and Bipolar together?

Thanks for reading. It helps just getting this out. ❤️"
271,0,Is anyone on Vraylar for bpd? My psych is prescribing it and I can’t tell if it’s working/worth it. It’s an expensive-ass medication (have to use a voucher to pay for the copay) and I’m constantly having to up the dose. Has anyone else used Vraylar?
272,2,"Okay, so I've had depression for about five years now, and I've been prescribed sertraline for it, my parents say it helped me a lot, but personally i couldn't tell i think my improvements were circumstantial because a lot of things were changing at the time, also tried aripoprazole for a bit, terrible. Then for depression again respiridon, terrible. Then for intrusive thoughts some olanzapine, also terrible. 

Fast foreward to now and i have bpd, im in a clinic for horrible intrusive thoughts bordering on psychosis, with the opportunity to try out quetiapine, my doctors know i dont want antipsychotics because ive responded awfully to them before so im hesitant to try, 

my thoughts are maybe trying to get off sertraline as i dont know if it really does much anymore, and get on something else like fluvoxamine? the question is i guess, does anyone know any of these meds and how were they for you?"
273,3,"Yesterday I was coaching at a sporting event and was pushed with two hands by a male instructor. I am really upset and I am unsure if I am over reacting or how to proceed.

He had asked me to step back away from the mat which I did do, but afterwards I stepped forward (not onto the mat) as I was coaching. He then took two hands, one on my hip and one on my arm and pushed me sideways to move me out of the way.

I am 5'4 and this was a 6ft+ man trained in martial arts. There were many witnesses.

The instructors immediately closed ranks and denied it happening. I spoke with the chief ref who told me she was police and that they wouldn't do anything or be interested. 

I of course had a full bpd/autism episode and cried for about two hours. They refused to remove the man from the room and he continued to coach whilst I missed my students competing.

When I arrived home I watched the live stream and they have deleted the 15 seconds of footage that shows the push. This means that they know im telling the truth but dont care.

I am so hurt as I have a good working relationship with this organisation and they hsve all closed ranks when they know I was assaulted. 

I want to go to the police but I dont know if it will just add more stress and upset and create a permanent barrier if I do decide i want to work with them again. 

Alternatively I could put in writing how its affected me but they obviously dont care.

I just feel so defeated and eveytime anyone tries to touch me im melting down, even my husband."
274,1,"I'm so, so desperately sad and can't ever see myself not feeling this way. Ever since I was a very young child I knew there was something different/wrong about the way I thought and felt about things. Some part of me that other people have is missing, or I have some awful extra part and it's such a painful and lonely existence. I've tried every SSRI, antipsychotics, different types of talking therapies, meditation, going teetotal, changing my job, leaving my toxic relationship, reaching out to friends, being more active, everything everyone suggests. I suffered emotional neglect as a child, have suffered some fairly calamitous life traumas, had an eating disorder for about 15 years (recovered for eight now) and have a chronic, energy limiting autoimmune condition in addition to a BPD diagnosis. 

I have a beautiful baby son and a wonderful, supportive,  patient partner who I rely upon heavily. I cannot fathom why my partner loves me or wants to be with me and I feel incredible guilt for having a baby and subjecting him to me as a mother. I thought having him would make me happy and fix my brain, but now I'm just exhausted and lonely and devastated with a poor, innocent baby in the mix. I'm terrified that I'm going to pass all of this trauma onto him and often believe he would be better off without me around. I can't kill myself because it would ruin my partner's life and leave him to care for our son alone. I'm not religious but I pray every night that I won't wake up the next day or that I'll wake up fixed. I've attempted suicide twice. Not serious attempts and I think I knew they would fail. 

I have no idea why I'm writing any of this really. Please has anyone else ever felt this way and did you manage to claw your way out of it? 

I've run out of hope."
275,2,"Hi 
So my whole life i’ve (f25) only ever had 1 super close friend (some would argue unhealthy how obsessive and borderline romantic) and wasn’t able to form connections with others.
The 1 friend has changed over the years but it has always looked like this:
I feel like i am socially inept, when in a group of ppl i only talk to my 1 friend. I literally have no idea what to say or how to speak with other ppl, considering my age this is quite embarrassing.
Any friend group or add on friend would just accept me as my 1 friends side kick. No one seems to like me, if they do it will soon be over.
The 1 friend always seems to be loved by everyone, included in everything.
I don’t understand how i’m able to form such a deep connection with 1 person but unable to form any kind of connection with anyone else.
I also don’t understand why these people even like me (the 1 friend) when they have so many more normal options. 

I was just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience. Is it a bpd thing or a me thing? "
276,2,"Have a history of this with my ex.  How do i help her.  This has been going on for over 10 years.

Everytime she's done it I thought she meant it.  The first time we broke up she said this.  Then later changed her mind.

She also said this to me 2 years ago and later reached out to me again.

Now she's said this to me a few days ago, and I don't know what to do.

She's done this many times.  Now naturally if someone tells you ""leave me alone, I don't want to talk to you, and I never want to hear from you again"" your heart sinks.  And you're afraid of harassing them.

But if they have a history of doing this, then it's not so certain.

What am I supposed to do when I get pushed away?  In fact the first time she broke up with me was because she said her feelings were getting too strong and she didn't want them getting even stronger.  But she regret this 2 days later."
277,0,"Hi all! My partner has BPD, and I'm just here to ask on tips on how to handle the cycles and how to support them. We have been dating for 8 months now and only recently found out, though looking back, there were signs (not saying this in a negative way, just saying it made sense!). 

We only really found out yesterday. Nevertheless, even before that, I have tried to be as accommodating and supportive as possible. I will continue to be, as I want to be there as a support and I dont want them to feel like theres something wrong with them. How can I better handle splitting/cycles/etc? What are things I can do to help? I have always tried my best to be reassuring, comforting, and a good communicator. 

Sorry for rambling and if my wording is off, english is not my first language. Any help is appreciated. Thank you. "
278,1,"I have made far too many 'woe is me' posts on here. I keep reliving everything I said to me ex boyfriend out last week together. How I started to emotionally abuse him and put him down. And it wasn't until my mutual friend showed me my exs suicidal text messages that I went as white as a ghost and was horrified. Because I was certain he was handling the breakup well. But to be fair, I went from telling him I loved him one week and then dumping him by text the next.

At first I wanted to blame him, but then our mutual friend forced me to confront my own actions. He had been in contact with my ex since he got out of the hospital. And my ex showed screenshots of our conversations to our friends. And they all agreed I was being emotionally abusive. And I didn't want to admit it.

But it was true, I did emotionally abuse him, and whats worse is I did it with a smile on my face because I told myself 'He'll find someone better than me, and I'm just a stepping stone for him.'

But for him, I was apparently the end game for him. 

Everytime I try to get bitter and angry at him and try to show my side of the story, our mutual friends show me the kind of texts I used to send my ex. And I realize I'm not angry at him, I'm angry at my family who abused me and caused me trauma.

And I became horrified when I realized the way I treated him at the end was EXACTLY like how my parents treated me.

I can't do this to anyone, I'm officially enrolling in DBT and numerous other therapy programs. I won't do this to anyone again. My ex honestly deserved so much better than what I did to him.

I just wish I could apologize to him"
279,3,"I'm so sick of battling with this! It's a constant, malignant feeling stress! I'm constantly battling crashes of severe crying spells, panic and paranoia but nobody notices around me! It's getting too much and I feel like I'm losing myself and everything I hold dear. Losing everything and everyone sucks, it's a stupid inevitability of life and I simply don't want it. I'm not good enough to meet new people and these symptoms are only getting worse.  It all feels hopeless. I'm not even sure if they are leaving, I might just be going crazy again L O L! 



It's so so difficult, I just want it stop! Spent the whole morning in a heated argument, would NOT come down and then I cradled up, bawling that I want this all to end, over and over again. I'm sick of these feelings, sick of watching my loved ones die or lose people one by one, being such an unimportant person in everyone's life. 


I try so hard to make everyone that I love feel appreciated or taken care of but then those who are closest to me, I lash out on because I hold so much in and then it all blows over. Fuck, I'm not even able to do that anymore rn. It's so fucking intense all of the time. I wish people around me knew. I feel like a catastrophe "
280,2,"I'm a female in her early twenties who is about to finish college in a big city that isn't in EU or North America. I was diagnosed with MD, anxiety and with BPD and OCD symptoms by a professional a year ago. Before that, I had frequent intrusive thoughts, guilt and obsessive-compulsive behaviour. I started feeling better after starting a new antidepressant. Even as a kid I would ask my mom if she still loved me when she got angry with me. I also had a very stressful childhood and a close relative with bipolar which contributed.

In my childhood, I didn't have many friends. I was also severely emotionally and psychologically bullied since I was a kid. I hated my bullies and I was helpless against them and my friends were unreliable and untrustworthy. I was also in this school with these people for 12 years which was suffocating.This led me to cut off all contact with my friends around highschool because I wanted to start anew. Boys didn't seem to be interested in me so I turned to the internet and discord for relationships which led me to get into an abusive long term and long distance relationship with a 17 year old when I was 13. He was very controlling about my hair, body and behaviour. He would also force me to send him nudes and insult me when he didn't get his way. During the time I was with him, I self harmed for the first time in my life. During this time, I had one best friend that I spent all of my time with. I started questioning my sexuality around then. I was also pursued by different pedophiles for many years.

When I finally started university I was socially inept. I tried making friends but found myself  eager to get into relationships with girls instead. Over a long period of time, I met hundreds and made friends and fixated on/obssessed with what I would assume to be forty girls each lasting maybe 2 weeks. I couldn't keep a friend for more than a few months or a year at best. My behaviour toward them would vary from indifferent, interested, intrigued, obsessed, resentful, disgusted and more intense emotions. Over time I made some serious mistakes like stalking them at school, appearing at their lectures without prior notice, trying to talk to them through their friends, continuing to pursue them romantically despite disinterest, trying to apologize which only made them angrier, behaviour that is too friendly or intimate and so on. I couldn't fix this no matter what advice or treatment I got.

About 3 months ago, I made friends with a guy from school who showed interest in me. Initially, we met because I was trying to flirt with his female friend but she didn't show interest so I quit my pursuit. I was surprised when this guy wanted to be my friend. We played video games, chatted about people, studied together. Yesterday I realized he was treating me coldly, in fact on active guard. When I went up to him and asked him, he told me that people saw him hanging out with me and they warned him about the things I did. He said he had been hearing rumours about me for a long time but paid them no mind and thought it was an inappropriate thing to confront me about so he didn't tell me. Then he said many people came to him telling him everything I did: the stalking, the harassing, the neverending texting, the following... He said even though I tried to make amends and apologize to some of them, I was shit at apologizing and the things I did were so severe that they could never be forgiven and that I would have to live with this for the rest of my life. I hadn't told him anything at the time because I was trying to move on from my mistakes - everything I did generated a lot of shame in me that I am still trying to repent for. I put all my energy into becoming better but apparently that isn't working. He continued by saying that I was making his friend (the one I met him through) uncomfortable all the time and that she wished to have nothing to do with me. He said I was obviously neurodivergent and hadn't harassed him only because I only went for girls and he was a guy - which wasn't true because I have also harassed men in the past.

The truth is I think there is something wrong here that I don't quite understand that others see very clearly. I feel like the giant guy from Of Mice and Men - like someone is bound to end my horrible streak of hurting people in ignorance by ending me for good. In a diary entry of mine from 2023, I said: ""I am terrified, or at least I ought to be terrified that this could essentially just be who I am and there might not be real change in my behaviour ever. Maybe I do have some sort of learning disability that doesn't just surface in a clinical, diagnosis setting or an educational setting but just throughout life, as other people are taught social norms and what rules to abide by and how to behave and I have just completely missed that class.""

I have been doing this for my entire life. I'm not suicidal. I want to lead a good life, but it seems that I have done such horrible things and I am inherently such a person that I will never have the big friend group or supportive partner I dreamed of. I want to get better and I want to fix this but I don't know how."
281,2,"Hi everyone, so I’ve been diagnosed with BPD along the side with disassociative identity disorder and I was in a relationship with the guy and so I tried breaking up with that guy the reason was he had more mood swings than me and whenever I try to address any kind of problem, he’s gonna shrugs it off he’s never gonna listen to me and he always make any problem into a me problem that I am the cause of this all my disorder is the cause of her and I tried my best to keep this thing to keep the strings okay but trust me I can’t do it anymore is really my disorder disrupting my relationship and mind that I also have an anxious attachment style so and he went to a trip to Maldives and he was there with so-called two of his lawyers who were females and he said he was working there and everything and on video call I heard a woman voice in his room. Let’s just call her am okay and after that he posted a picture coming back in two days and it was a selfie and he had a ring finger on so am I being delusional that he is married and mind the age difference I am 24 and he is 30 i’m gonna add more into it. He know every single thing about me but I don’t know anything about him and he will always say that he have his reasons or he’s gonna tell me later but that later never came and I am stuck in the slow pool and I’m not able to get out of it so am I the problem what is going on and now he is really pushing me to be with him, but I don’t want to be with him. A part of me want to be with him. I don’t know what to do so please guys I need your help."
282,2,"An old friend recently became very close to me. We talk everyday. We FaceTime every day. She travels over 2 hours a week to visit me at least once a week (years ago, i got the bus everyday to go to the city she lived in.) 

However, 
I’ve noticed a change in her, and I know it’s stupid but I can’t help but worry. 

She said she can’t come down this week because she wants to watch a TV program with her dad. Logically, that that very reasonable reason. 
But 
My Brian is going ‘she made up that excuse. She doesn’t want to come anymore’. Or ‘she’s trying to distance herself. She’s leaving me’ and I’m going into a mode of panic, anger and guilt. 

What is the correct way to deal with this? I don’t want to come across as needy, or controlling. "
283,1,"As everyone knows, BPD is usually related to childhood neglect/trauma. I was neglected as a child and my needs weren’t meant due to my younger sibling being special needs. Glass child syndrome is a term used to describe the experience of children growing up with a special needs sibling. Because of this, no one paid attention to my needs or loved me the way i needed to. As a child i remember resenting my younger brother and even wanting him gone. As an adult i struggle with BPD & i can’t relate to others who describe their childhood and their bad guardians. I know it’s not anyone’s fault, my parents tried their best but shit happens. 

I just want to see if anyone here has had the same childhood? i doubt there’s anyone who hasn’t also developed BPD due to having a special needs sibling. "
284,2,"well it’s like the title says. and no it’s not a healthy amount of thinking about it. i have bpd, ptsd, anxiety, and depression with psychosis and all i keep hearing in my head is the voices constantly saying “when you get divorced you won’t have to worry about [insert random scenario]” or “when you get divorced you can do [insert thing]”. it’s honestly just freaking me out. i want to marry this man. he’s the most supportive, kind, loving, gentle, intelligent, silly, honest, and amazing person i have ever met. i am so excited to spend the rest of my life with him but i keep hearing these things and its bothering me so much. has anyone gone through something similar? do you have any advice? idk how to stop it "
285,1,"i’m on seroquel and zoloft. i’ve been been on lamactial and prozac the most recent one. i am so so so depressed. so so so angry all the time, so emotional all the time. it’s like suicide and self harm is a background thiught at all times. i’m also just getting so aggrwsive towards people in my head. i’m so tired of doctors not helping me. why the fuck am i on blood pressure meds for insomnia and anxiety i’m DONE"
286,3,"BPD has ruled my relationships for a very long time. I stayed single for four or five years to avoid the heartache and stress. In this time I made some unhealthy situationship choices but eventually went to therapy and worked hard and felt like I'd made great progress in managing my moods and symptoms, and I finally entered a relationship again this year. And it was going great. Phenomenal. My mental health was pretty well under control, the relationship was very healthy, I was still very independent and didn't need unreasonable amounts of reassurance. Four months into our relationship, my partner left for work. One month away. About twelve days in, it felt like the floor gave in. I was anxious. I never used to obsessively think about him, but suddenly all I can think about is his absence and how hurt I am that he's gone (not that I blame him, nor do I want him to make changes to his daily life while on work leave to accommodate me, it's just that I'm very wounded by his absence). I'm having trouble with my sense of self. I'm needing absurd amounts of reassurance. I went from missing him so bad it hurt to a few days ago going completely apathetic and numb, not wanting anything to do with him, not wanting to see him on my wallpaper, not wanting to text or call. I forced myself to text him every day and tell him I loved him, even though I didn't feel it through the numbness at all, because if I can't be rational, I can at least be consistent until I am again. But it kept getting worse and worse. I made some extremely stupid choices (unhealthy coping skills, not anything like cheating) this week. I've surprised myself with just how awful I'm handling this separation. He's trying his best to be supportive but I can tell he's at a loss for what to do. I want to be okay and I'm trying to function normally but I'm hounded by these anxious thoughts and insecurities and urges to send him walls of text both asking for reassurance and begging for forgiveness for how I'm acting. I'm crashing out really bad and there's still over a week to go. He will need to be gone for over a month at a time pretty regularly. I'm scaring myself, I'm scaring him, I'm not handling this well at all. What if it doesn't get better? Should I break up with him to find a partner who won't leave home so much? I really like this guy and want to have a long relationship with him, but I am not handling this separation well at all. I'm in that really spicy BPD zone where my normal safety checklist and normal coping skills cannot even remotely touch the amounts of impending doom and fear that I'm feeling. I'm ashamed for slipping up this week and not following my safety checklist. I told my partner and he is uncomfortable that I relapsed. I really do understand his side of this. I imagine he's very overwhelmed. I sure am. Is this going to get any better at all? I feel like I've lost all of the progress I've made the past five years. Any kind words or advice deeply, deeply appreciated. No, this isn't either of our first relationship. I'm almost thirty, I'm in therapy, and yes, I'm safe right now. Just needing some advice or kind words."
287,2,"I have a small amount of debt I need to pay to university. I have part of the money but need a one grand asap and I don't know how to get it. 

I know I could probably ask my boyfriend and he would gladly help (of course I will give it back) but at the same time where we are living rn is payed by him. He is the one working and I am well, studying.  I try to help as much as I can with the food, bills and so on but rent is literally out of my budget by a mile so I can't...

I know I could probably ask him for the money but my stupid mind thinks that if I do that he will leave because he will see me as a burden and be mad and so on.... o just don't know what to do.."
288,3,"i have bpd, and i’ve been in therapy and on medications and ive learned how to reclaim my life. im so proud of my progress and how far ive come.

now, my best friend has been in my life for about a year, and things have been steadily declining since the start of this year. she constantly accused me of not loving her until it started to feel true, and then she would constantly tell me that she loves me expecting a response back. she starts petty arguments and demands that i apologize for things that i don’t feel like i need to. she constantly controls me and how i spend my time, and if i tell her no to hanging out or calling, she keeps asking me and telling me “it would mean a lot to her” until i give in, drained from all of it. this is pretty much only a small list of the things that have started to bother me.

she thinks we have resolved all of these issues, but with my bpd, i feel like i have to censor myself constantly and not tell people how i really feel, because i don’t trust my emotions or my reactions ever. i constantly fear that in an hour im going to regret what i just said so i simply keep quiet and let my boundaries get crossed every. time.

i’ve started to feel hopeless again, feeling like i have to resort to suicide rather than just ending this friendship. the truth is, i don’t know how. i’ve never done anything like this before. and she is so dependent on me that i would be riddled with guilt for a long long time if i had to end it. but my mental health has been so much worse because of all this, and i imagine a life without her and it feels so much more peaceful.

basically i feel bad about cutting her off because i feel like i need a reason and she’s either not rlly gonna understand them, thinking it’s things we had already resolved, or she’ll have a rebuttal for everything. or she’ll start guilt tripping me like “so you lied about loving me?” & at this point even if things suddenly turn perfect i just don’t want her in my life anymore. 

do i need a reason to cut her off, or can i just tell her that im not getting anything out of this? i just want my life back. i can’t worry about other people when i have to worry so much about myself"
289,3,"Feeling like I'm relapsing into all habits and ways of thinking. I have a lot of good things happening in my life rn. I run a quite successful social media platform, I'm in press day in and day out. I get Collabs. I'm not getting payed quite yet but it is turning out better than I anticipated when I started. 

So, I'm currently at uni studying something in the field of medicine and I had some serious money problems so I could not pay for the fees, they uni are claiming them, which is completely reasonable. I have part of the money but need extra that I just can't get as of the moment and I don't know what to do about it. 

I know I could ask my boyfriend but in my mind if I ask him he will leave so I don't know what to do... "
290,1,"I've been loved only on the last 6 to 7 years. I can point 3 people that love or have loved me. How sad is it that it is so rare for me to be loved? How sad is it that I am 26y now and spent the majority of my life living throught fear, hate and rage? I thought for 20 years that everyone lived the same way as me, I was shocked to know that other people are cared for, are loved and received afection. That's such a crazy notion for me, that other people did not need to survive hell for entire decades, at least not the same hell as me. Just now I'm beginnig to understand what it is to not hate myself and how not to believe the voice in my head telling me I am much of a regret and a joke. Not only I've been loved, but I've loved back. This three people let me love them and it gave sense to my life, gave me purpouse and makes me believe everyday that I can make it throught.

All this is kind of a bittersweet feeling and right now I cant talk about it with no one in my life, so I wrote here. Feel free to interact. "
291,1,I'm feeling very triggered. I reside in à homeless shelter. I don't have any friends except those in the shelter. A few people triggered the BPD. I feel like self-harming. I gave someone my razors so I can't hurt myself. I'm flickering a rubber band on my wrist. I drew red lines on my arm because I want to see wounds. I'm having suicidal thoughts. I'm isolating myself so I don't snap on someone. I feel like I'm going crazy.  
292,2,"I usually don’t hang out with people outside of work, but we get along so well at work that we decided to hang out of work a couple of times. It was our first times hanging out with anyone outside of work. It was super fun & I was like omg I might have a new best friend. Then two days later her and I are working together and she told me that she hung out with another coworker a day after too. I got so jealous, but I didn’t say anything. I’m not into women, and usually my fp is a man, but I’m just so upset that she hung out with a coworker that wasn’t me. It’s like I feel betrayed for no logical reason. Like why the fuck are you hanging out with someone else too, do you get along with them better ? It feels so selfish but I just needed to put it out there. I’m not gonna say anything to her, but my heart is broken. That’s when I was like oh shoot she might be my new FP."
293,0,"I have talked to her about BPD multiple times and how I think I may have it. She is a very good therapist, passionate about her work and extremely helpful and she disagrees with the diagnosis of BPD but knows I am working on researching this disorder on my own and tells me to come to her with my results and see if I can change her view. I want to know what you guys think.
She says that BPD doesn't explain much, she says its a bunch of symptoms clustered together with no explanation why. I agreed with her on this part of the lack of explanation, while researching BPD ive found that I had to dig very deep to find explanations for the symptoms. ""People with BPD are impulsive"" Okay.. Why?? (Ive figured it out but it took a while) needing to resort to going onto reddit to understand why these symptoms exist. But I do think BPD is a valid diagnosis, she sees that bpd is similar to cptsd and thinks that cptsd would be a more fitting diagnosis rather than bpd. 
What do you guys think about this? Why do you think cptsd is different than bpd and how? I wanna come to her with your guys thoughts lol. "
294,1,"I had another episode. It was 100% preventable. I was 3 months sober and things were great. I was still dealing with mood swings, but overall everything was so good. I had left drinking on the table after going sober because I thought it was just a bad night. So Friday night I said yes to a small glass of wine. What I quickly found out was I am an alcoholic and I have no self control when it comes to drinking and I got drunk. Wasted to the point of a black out again. I trashed everything. I screamed I yelled. Apparently I threatened suicide and cutting and I hit my partner for the first time. This is not BPD behavior, this is an uncontrolled individual who had no empathy or love in That moment. I am ashamed. I broke so many things and I can’t even remember. I just have the bruises and wounds. I’ve never been this bad before. This was my worst episode in 26 years. I know I need to accept my reality. I am seeing my therapist in an emergency visit. I just can’t grasp why my partner wants to stay with me. Part of me wants to leave while he is at work to save him. Because I don’t know how to protect him at this point. Obviously I’m sober for good. I’m never touching alcohol again and I have started meetings already. I just can’t fathom why he would stay. This is abuse. I am an abuser. I feel like I should respect his wishes. But I also know, people stay with their abuses out of hope, better, and just inhaled wounds. And I don’t want him to have to heal anymore from me. I’ve caused enough trauma in our 3 year relationship. I want to forgive myself, but I have surpassed my own morals and boundaries that I am really wedged into my shame spiral. I’m sorry for how blabby this is. I just needed it out. "
295,1,"I’m really trying to understand why I’m sat on the bathroom floor, sobbing silently, trying to stay quiet so my husband won’t wake up it’s 3 am. I had an okay day. As okay as it could be. And then as soon as I got into bed, everything unraveled. I took my meds today. They’re just not.. working anymore. And I keep just thinking to myself, really how many more of these can I have. It’s not the first time. When is my breaking point. I hate this. I don’t want this anymore. "
296,2,"i don't know if this will be relatable, but i need to get my thoughts out. i realize that when im feeling the way I am now, feeling suffocated by my family, i want to injure myself or relapse into bad habits that i know they wont like. it feels freeing, doing things they'd be disappointed in me for and keeping them a secret out of resentment. i want to feel like i have control, like i can run away from them by making my own drastic choices. I feel like i have control over very little in my life, i can't drive, i can't find a job, i rely financially on family and live with them. and my mom has been venting to me every day for weeks about her own job and ranting to me. i felt like i just needed to do something to distance myself from her, even just in my head. some reason, resorting to self harm felt comforting in a way, like my own secret that i have for myself. 

as a kid, i used to skip school to give myself a safe place to exist without judgement put on me, and i feel like that's coming back in the form of secretly acting out to give myself ""freedom"".

also, i don't know if this is a bpd thing or not. might just be a general cptsd thing or tied to another personality disorder. i just know im diagnosed with bpd"
297,1,"I’m so exhausted dealing with the constant lows. Nothing I do can shift it. I’ve waisted my whole life dealing with a disorder I would give anything not to have anymore. I don’t want to have to deal with it for the rest of my remaining life too.

The thought of secretly wishing I’d die in an accident because I’m not brave enough to do it myself is 24/7. Some days I can push it to the side but most of the time it’s front and centre screaming at me. The pain is constant. I can’t manage my lows anymore and I also can’t seem to respond to any sort of help. I’m so tired. "
298,2,"Hey everyone, hope y'all are doing great. I've always had some mental issues, though I used to just chalk them up to my depression. Recently I've started looking into things a bit more, and I've come to realize that I am exhibiting a lot of the symptoms of BPD. (I know I shouldn't self diagnose and should see a professional, I'm planning to do that in the future once i get properly settled, just need some advice to work with in the meanwhile). You know, being super insecure and looking up to others for validation, fear of abandonment, very sudden mood swings, need for constant attention, thinking a friend is the worst person in existence for not responding to my messages, and then them becoming the best person in the world once they start talking to me again, etc. I've started to realize when these bad thoughts start appearing, but no matter what I do, I can never change how I behave.

Lemme expand on my current behaviour. I start feeling that friend xyz is ignoring me/doesn't like me that much/ hates me on the simplest of things (these things don't seem simple to me, I feel I had a really good reason to believe that, but that might just be my BPD brain overthinking. I'm not sure if they're just not that interested in me because of my dry personality, or if that's just how normal people are). This leads me to start ignoring that person. Part of the reason being to sort of punish them. Maybe once they realize that I'm not responding to them, they'll start feeling how much I meant to them (but this never ends up happening). The other part of the reason being me thinking that there's no point in trying so hard to be their friend. I've put in so much effort, and this is what I end up with, someone who probably doesn't give too much of a shit about me. I know this has been ruining my friendships. I know this will just end up with me in a loss. I've tried changing it, but I've succeeded.

Part of me wants some advice to deal with this. Part of me also wants some advice over what to do whenever you start feeling like this. Do i keep trying my best to be friends with someone you strongly suspect doesn't like you as much, or do I just not put in that much effort of them and try to separate myself. Thanks for reading this long post. Hope you all have a nice day."
299,1,"(33 F) I've had 2 real relationships and 4 not so real ones (the others have been more situationship/flings). In almost all of them I've been the one that's been rejected. Why am I always the one willing to stick through the hard times and who sees the value in the other but that's never reciprocated

Today was the first day that I decided to end a potential relationship. We only went on three dates but I fell hard and got attached. I made it clear i wanted long term and he (at least i thought) said he wanted the same. We slept together (I'm now never doing that again so early on) and i felt an awkward shift between us

He's so nonchalant and confusing and I decided to just end it, but when I contacted him to do so he immediatly agreed and almost sounded happy. It hit me so hard and I've been spiraling all day

It seems like when I have sex with potential partners they pull away and it feels more and more traumatizing. 

I've spent 6 years alone, no sex, no relationships and I'm tired of not trying but how tf do I stop being do sensitive? If anyone has recs for therapy I'll do it.

 I just want to live my life and not feel so empty and at the same time like a raw nerve that cant take any rejection. No one in my life really understands and honestly I feel like I'm at the end of my rope "
300,1,"Hey, I’m very much clueless as to how to even start this so I’ll try my best and hopefully someone can piece my words together.

I’m overwhelmed by how lonely I feel, I am sure this is a feeling we’ve all had to face but tonight it has unraveled into something more- and for once I want to try and make something out of it instead of letting it win. This feels rather pathetic, but how? How do you lovely people do it? Where do I look, what do I say, how do I even tackle such an enormous task?! How do I make a friend?

It’s not like I have been a recluse my whole life or anything, but recently I’ve come to realize that I truly am alone to fend for myself. No matter who I reach out to they always seem to have somewhere else to be, no amount of asking or begging allows me to get a fraction of their time. I feel hopeless, and I want to stop feeling this way so my only thought is to speak into the mirror and if life takes mercy on me I’ll find someone with an answer to my question.

I don’t wish to divulge too many personal details but yes, this cry for help stems from my favorite person finally reaching their limits with me. It was inevitable, the writing was on the wall but in the middle of it all you don’t prepare for the aftermath.

I am not looking to be loved overnight, although that would be a dream come true. I wish to have a way to go, a place to look at, some advice as to how you might have met others like you, how you met that person you can claim as your favorite.

All I want is some answers, to feel like there’s an alternative to the endless mindless roaming, that there’s someone out there meant to cross my path.
"
301,2,"Four days ago, I had an appointment with an online psychiatrist from a reputed institution and she’d said I very clearly have BPD. She didn’t want to tell me at first, but then when she said it, I felt relieved. When I read up on it, everything fit perfectly. All these years I’d felt something was wrong, and it was as if I’d gotten the key. My mom wanted a second opinion and so we visited another doctor today and she said I might not have it and she’d have to decide after two weeks of me recording my thoughts and emotions. My family is happy that I might not have it, but I feel lost. And I don’t know if I can wait two weeks. So am I just overthinking my symptoms? But I am feeling very suicidal now."
302,1,"Mention of sh 

I was 16, my gf broke up with me at the time and I was in a world of hurt. I reached out to my guidance councilor as a last resort. I felt truly lost and I thought they could help me, I told them I had thoughts and within 5 minutes, two cops pulled up and took me to the ward. They searched me and took my vape (which the school later gave me a referral for). I got there and they do the check in and things of that nature, I slept in this waiting room/lounge for a night before they moved me to the main whatever in the back. I think it was afternoon the next day when they took me, I was sitting in a chair waiting for whatever they had to do, and a doctor/male nurse looked at my sh scars and told me that it was all for attention, and went on a whole rant in front of whoever else was there patients/nurses. He said the classic if you wanted to do damage you would do it vertically, I hadn’t reached out for help for years since that moment. But recently I went to the psychiatrist, I’m not sure what I was expecting obviously not some bombshell breakthrough or something, but I paid $30 just for her to ask me baseline questions they already asked me over the phone, and for her to prescribe medication. She referred me for counseling as well so maybe that’ll be a better experience. It just feels as tho I’m some captor to them, and anytime I try to reach out it creates this hostage situation, where they have to talk me down before they take me out.  A false sense of empathy, you know they hear you but they don’t see you. When I look at the homeless man on the street I don’t look down upon him, he is my equal and I know very well I could be in that same position, people like to segregate people based on evil or good or whatever other differentiator to discern themselves from that behavior, they feel as though they could never stoop to that level. I believe all humans are capable of anything, and the more you deny that the closer you get to that anything. The Lucifer Effect is a great book on that. I find it hard to even be around people, my family, strangers. I feel as if I’m fighting to keep my composure every second, sometimes I walk past a stranger on the street and feel tears well up, it’s like my body want that’s human connection but my mind to fucked up to let it happen. Just wanted to let that out."
303,3,My answer: after being rejected by multiple therapist and studying psychology myself and taking antidepressants and still struggling I knew I had something intense but with more trauma and no good health insurance . I just struggled with getting properly diagnosed until my major breakdowns recently happened. After trips to the psych ward and all I got diagnosed and ………..I felt relief this is why I’m struggling so hard and everything is so difficult and why I can’t relate too much with people. I felt happy until I did further research and self reflected and that’s when I realize my entire existence will forever be a battle. Without meds and therapy and having the finances or proper insurance. .. I felt hopeless 
304,1,"I don’t know what to do with myself right now. I think I just need someone to hear me. 

There’s this stupid void in me I cannot fill. Sex helps, as does alcohol or marijuana, but nothing else seems to even dull it. 

I get manic episodes and I cheated. I was miserable but I don’t think it was my relationship. I think it was me and I was just trying to fill the hole. We had issues but most were my fault. 

I’m falling apart right now, trying so hard not to spiral out but I fear I’m about an inch from the edge. Please someone tell me how to get better, how to stop hurting the people I love most. I can’t live like this. I don’t want to anymore. "
305,2,"Hey so basically I’ve started seeing this guy, I was off and on with him for ages after my ex broke up with me and he liked me the whole time I was with my ex. I lied to my ex that I was seeing him straight after my ex broke up with me because I was terrified of him hating me and then yesterday I decided to tell him the truth and basically he hasn’t replied to me and he told me to go away etc etc (btw my ex treated me so badly and this guy I’m seeing now treats me so well) but yeah I’m kinda tweaking out because for some reason my ex still has control over my mind. Idk if it’s just abandonment issues flaring up but yeh pls can I have some advice. Also I have spoke to my ex a bit beforehand bcs again I’m still slightly attached but I feel like the worst person in the world. "
306,1,"How often do you cry?

I have always considered crying like a type of “emotion”. I cry everytime someting unpleasant happens. Sometimes its 10+ times a day. I thought everybody was like this, because I usually hide when crying so I thought everybody does that as well.

I realised it was not normal when my therapist told me its too much. Then I started noticing how neurotypicals view crying :

“I was so sad that… I even cried!!!” - something extreme omg

Or they reactions to me when they see my eyes tearing up
“Omg are you crying?”

I did not realise it is such a big deal till now lol for me its like a sneezing"
307,1,"I am bod and I find the lack of favourite person in my life very torturing im terms of facing the emptiness that comes with lonliness in our case.

308,3,"I've read the rules a couple times, and am going to try and be as compassionate as I can, and post with as little emotion as possible.

For background, I (17 M) have lived a very normal, lowkey traumaless life. Like I've had it very easy, and I'm extremely grateful for it. My girlfriend on the other hand (17 F) has lived a very very hard life, full of genuine abandonment and struggles with all of the relationships around her. We have been dating for over a year. 

At the start, everything was wonderful. She's the first and only partner I've ever had, and it was truly amazing when everything started. However, through a year of really really hard issues, I have been completely broken down. 

To kinda cut to the chase, I am currently going through another one of my ""breakdowns"" as I call it. My girlfriend has once again, made me feel trapped and upset. From discarding me, to loving me, to not allowing me to do anything with my friends out of a fear of abandonment. I have these breakdowns where I research BPD and BPD relationships for hours to see if there are any kind of solutions but all I get is negativity.

Do I want to end the relationship with my girlfriend? No. But the whole world keeps seeming to tell me that its the only thing I'm able to do. I am her sole support person, everyone tells me that ""shes not your responsibility"" but she doesn't give me an option other than having to be responsible for her. 

After really traumatizing situations where I have been with her in the middle of hours long breakdowns, I just cannot do it anymore. The relationship exhausts me beyond I can comprehend and it just makes me want to sleep forever. (Not suicidal, more like just rest forever.) 

At the end of the day, I just feel so trapped. I do not want to end our relationship, nor do I blame her for anything that she has done. I just want to have a healthy relationship where we can both support each other. I don't have the strength, or the energy, to handle how things are going on anymore.

For everyone who read all the way through, thank you, this has been a big old vent. However also, I want to ask what all of you think I should do? For some extra context, my girlfriend refuses any forms of therapy and any forms of medication, and (from experience) will gain nothing from being forced into these treatment options. 

Thank you again. "

310,2,"I'm (32F) diagnosed with BPD 4 years ago & Bipolar by one psychiatrist. We all know that we are having chronic depressive mode every now and then. So I have been sleeping too much for a week now and very sensitive, and then my partner surprised me with a visiting friend along with her child.  I was so happy, me and my friend's daughter played all night. I gifted her a stuff toy which was given to me by my partner the same night — my partner got that for me to make me feel better. The child was so happy when i gifted her the stuff toy but while I was dressing up for the night cause we about to go outside and eat dinner... my partner asked me why I gave the stuff toy to the child, it is his gift to me. I was confused & sad, i don't know how to tell my friend & her daughter that i need the stuff toy back. So while they were in our garden exploring our backyard, I hide the stuff toy somewhere they cant access. While we were in the car, the child was crying and missing the toy but i dont know what to say, i just felt guilty. This morning i found the stuff toy tagged by her name already and found myself sad... i dont know if i should give it to her or please my partner because he said it is his gift to me? I just dont know if im a good person or bad because I dont want to give the toy to the child anymore yet i feel guilty "
311,1,"It’s been 4 months since we broke up, and I still can’t stop loving her. She wasn’t perfect, but she was perfect for me. Before I met her, I’d never heard anyone say her name in my life. It was rare, beautiful like it belonged only to her. And after we broke up? It suddenly became the most common name in the world. Every time I hear it, it just… stings like hell.

I never felt anything remotely close to what I felt with her. I knew I was in love with her on New Year’s Day. Planned to confess around noon. But she beat me to it. She confessed to me that same morning. It felt like something out of a fictional story. Like it was fate. Like it meant something. And maybe it did. Maybe that’s what makes this even worse.

I even tried talking to another girl. She fell for me, told me she loves me. And I… told her she was like a sister to me. I'm still on good terms with her we talk daily but that’s as far as it’ll ever go. Because that’s all I could feel. That’s how deep I still am in love with my ex.

God, I hate calling her that.

Before I met her, my life plan was simple: get a job, marry someone, pretend to love her, and give her everything so well that she’d never question my feelings. I know that sounds wrong, but I’d never felt real love before. I thought that’s just what being a man meant showing up, providing, doing your part. But then I met her, and everything changed. I felt something real. For the first time. Honest-to-God love. And now that it’s gone? I can’t go back to that old plan. I can’t fake love anymore. Not after knowing what the real thing felt like.

Our relationship wasn’t perfect. Almost everyone around her was skeptical of me. I had to constantly defend myself prove I wasn’t a scammer, a trafficker, a liar. Like it was somehow unbelievable that a person like me loved someone like her. But I did. I really, deeply did. She was the funniest, most beautiful girl I ever met. Smarter than me, even if she never saw it. The only dumb thing she ever did was not realizing how amazing she really was.

The worst part? I didn’t even want to leave her. On our last day, she misunderstood something I said. She thought I was ending it. And in that moment, I saw how miserable she looked having someone like me in her life… so I just went with it. I let her believe it. I gave her an out. I didn’t fight. I didn’t explain. I just let her go, because I thought she’d be happier without me. That decision still tears me apart.

After the breakup, I spent two weeks lying on the floor. Didn’t eat. Didn’t drink. Barely slept. Just stared at the ceiling like a ghost. The only reason I’m alive right now is because some distant family members invited me to dinner. I didn’t want to be rude. Took a few bites, almost threw up. I’d gone so long without eating that my body didn’t know how to accept food anymore.

I tried every coping method I could think of. Talking, music, distractions nothing sticks. The only thing that helps, even a little, is exercise. But the second I stop moving, her memory comes crashing in. So I push my body until I’m sick or too exhausted to stand. Just to keep my mind quiet.

I'm somewhat at peace with it now. I’ve lost hope in ever seeing her or anyone like her again. I’ll probably spend the rest of my life alone, but it’s okay. Because even though it still hurts, I’m grateful. Grateful for the good memories. For the love I got to feel, even for a little while.

I’m not really sure if I'm looking for advice. I just needed to say it. To people who might understand this kind of grief. The kind that doesn’t leave. The kind that owns you.

This is my first time using Reddit, so I apologize if I made any mistakes posting here."
312,2,"i (20f) got diagnosed with severe depression at the age of 16, bpd when i was 18, and ever since, i distanced myself from everyone cuz i didn't want anyone to get near me -then get attached to them- only for them to leave me, and, i didn't wanna hurt them because i know how i act when im raging and it happens every. single. day. i went to psychiatrists and therapists and understood what was going on and how to deal with it, but for the past 6 months, i stopped taking my medications because i thought i got better (i was in a euphoric period). 

two months ago, i met someone who became my favorite person, and he (24m) treats me so well i get happy, confused and scared at the same time. i didn't tell him i have beautiful princess disorder because i didn't wanna ruin things and i was scared he might think im crazy and leave me, but i eventually told him and he kept on supporting me.

i noticed that he's been a bit off with me lately and i got so angry at him for being busy (we're not even dating) but i didn't say anything so that i don't ruin things out since he is the only person i talk to and actually care about. im trying my best not to believe that he hates me which is nonsense but i feel like he got bored of me and, me being a people pleaser, decided to text him always all the time and ask about how he's doing, i think there's some family issues going on with him, i wanna be there for him and let him know that im always there because i genuinely love him and care about him, but he doesn't like to talk about his issues.

im scared of him leaving me which is why im so stressed out and for the past 4 days ive been so off cuz i got triggered of something and i don't wanna ruin his mood, so, im not talking to him about my problems and feelings, but i need to talk to him, at the same time, i don't wanna be seen as vulnerable. 

i know that if i talk to him i'll feel better, but i don't want him to get upset and ruin his mood, i dont wanna be a burden to him cuz i have always been a burden to my favorite person(s). i keep on dreaming about him and me hugging him and crying on his chest and venting to him; that's how much i need him and his affection, i don't want anything sexual from him, all i want is him to be there for me. i think im falling in love with him but i don't want to, because i know, i'll leave him, i'll destroy everything and i don't wanna hurt him.

313,1,i was just so unhappy and so unfulfilled emotionally but losing him just feels worse than that pain and i feel so empty and tired i just don’t even know what to do anymore like he was my whole life and now i feel like i have nothing and my life has no purpose
314,2,"anyone with quiet bpd who has gotten therapy for it, what was it like? i’m considering it but i’m worried i’m too “self aware” and it would be a waste of time. what did your therapist recommend? did any of it help in the long run?"
315,1,"All I want is to have a small friend group of girlies where we go out together, support, and love each other for who we are. All I have is my husband and a long distance friend who also has BPD but we never get to see each other and barely talk. I’m still grateful for what I have though. But I’ve never been able to keep good friends and the ones I had in high school said they only kept me around to make fun of me to make themselves feel better. I’d do anything to have 2-3 close friends at least. I can’t help but think about how I’m cursed to be lonely for life and how my funeral is going to be pathetic because hardly anyone will be there. "

There’s no one I love more than my grandma and I hate that I act this was towards my loved ones when plans suddenly change even if they are for the better, I feel like I have to constantly have control over situations. I’m 23 and have never been to a psychiatrist for a diagnosis, I’ve never even considered getting one, but I’m just so upset with myself for how I acted that something needs to change, but I’m also scared that meds might change me for the worse (depression, extra anxiety). Please give me advice 😭 I’m struggling "
317,1,"So I have bpd, and not gonna lie, the past like 6 -7 ish years have been terrible for me mentally. 6th grade (when I was 11 or so) is when everything started to go down hill. It got much worse in 7th grade, and I continued to spiral with some ups and downs in 8th grade through all of high school. My mental health and anger problems were worsened in the end of 10th grade when my best friend left me for a reason she didn't even really explain. Something about rose colored glasses and who I was dating at the time. Anyway, 11th grade was horrible, so much so that by the end I got kicked out. In 12th grade I had to go to a different school and its program was for kids with emotional needs and shit. Anyway, 12th grade was so bad for me. I was constantly being set off by the littlest things. It had been getting increasingly worse from middle school up until then, but 12th grade was a whole different thing. I felt like a monster. My parents (who are really good people and very understanding of mental illness shit) almost kicked me out because of how bad it got. Things that didn't used to mean anything to me would make me flip my shit in the worse way possible. I was never not angry, but sometimes I could hide it better than others. Anyway, to spare you the details, shit was really bad. But then summer passed, and I started getting better. I got a job (which I still work at), and I started community college. I still live with my family, but I'm planning to move away to a four year school after the next fall semester. The thing is, ever since college started it was like a switch happened. All of the sudden, I feel great. There were no med changes at all, and my environment is arguably more stressful than before! But this past year I haven't had a single outburst. To put that in perspective, in 12th grade I had to have an outburst at least once every two weeks ish. My anger was just that unbearable. But now its like everything is gone. NOTHING HAS CHANGED AND IT IS FREAKING ME OUT. It scares me because whenever things get good, even worse things are bound to happen soon after. That's how it always is. I fear that I'm holding shit in subconsciously but idk. Obviously have my bad nights; everyone does. But for the first time in literally 7 years I feel fine. But its an uneasy kind of fine. Everyone around me is so happy that I'm not terrible anymore, and I'm so scared that I'm gonna fall back into my normal self and disappoint everyone. I know its coming, and I know if I suppress it then it'll only be worse when it eventually comes out. But that's when I begin to wonder if I WANT to get worse. Because if I'm doing bad, then I feel like myself. Being unbothered isn't normal for me. I've lived in a hell of my own making for so long, so now that I don't feel like shit anymore what do I do? I need to feel like shit, and I know I shouldn't be thinking this. I just don't know whats going on, and I know for sure its gonna get bad again. I know I'm being dramatic, but I can't help it. I wanna start doing shit again that I can't say here cuz I didn't give a trigger warning flair, but I KNOW I can't. I KNOW that its bad. But I need to start self destructing again because I hate this feeling of nothing that keeps overcoming me. But I don't need to so I shouldn't. Idk maybe I just shouldn't even post this cuz it makes no sense and its so late and im so tired lmao. I guess I just need to know if anyone relates or if this is normal or what the fuck is going on."
318,2,"So my wife and I live in florida, and we really don’t have the money to pay for a full time therapist or psychiatrist at the moment. We are pretty sure she has bpd but there has been no formal diagnosis, and we are not necessarily seeking one anyway, we are more focused on finding guidance and learning tools to help us navigate out of this low point and beyond that just general maintenance skills. We cannot afford dbt therapy or anything else right now, is there anything anyone can recommend that actually helped them learn coping skills and improve relationships and splitting episodes before they were able to talk to a professional? Thank you in advance 🙏🏼 "
319,3,"My boyfriend is going through a really rough time, and basically said he needs alone time to get his head together. We are still together and monogamous but I am deeply struggling with:

•feeling abandoned and like this break is just an opportunity for him to leave me

•I'm struggling to understand why he doesn't want to work together on his mental health although I am not doing so amazing either 

•I'm getting very resentful 

We were texting twice a day just a good morning and goodnight but it just made me angrier. He keeps apologizing to me about this break and that makes me angrier too, because he's the one who needed this. I told him we can do 1x a week check-in because daily check-ins are just escalating my anger. 

Today was our 10 monthery and he sent me flowers with a note saying I'm the sweetest person with a wonderful heart in the world. 
That just made me angry too because if I'm so great why does he need space? 

When he said he wanted a break, I initially broke up with him because it made me so angry but then he asked me if I really loved him, if I cared about him and if I respect him and his time. 

I still want to break up with him over this. I don't want to feel this way. Allegedly he's happy with our relationship and me, even though I definitely am heavily flawed. 

I do not know how to cope with this break. At all. I can't concentrate on my own life and it's difficult not to obsessively think about him or relive conversations. It's also difficult for me to even picture this break ending well. I don't know what to do. 

This may be the most difficult thing I have ever attempted in a relationship because I am the person to dump them and go. "
320,3,"As the title says, sometimes I really need to not talk, talking became uncomfortable, even painful sometimes. I’m not sure if someone else can relate to it. Its strage because sometimes I just burn all my social energy and need to stay silent "
321,3,Words are really hard for me and often when I write or speak I run my sentences into nowhere and say nonsense. it's super frustrating because I need to really focus and often I times I also just zone out during stuff which makes this even more challenging than it needs to be. also my head just feels super stuffed and my thoughts feel like I can't grasp them or think clearly. my thinking just feels like there is thick fog or slime sticking up my head making me not think clearly. also I really can't read right now without getting a headache and making my eyes hurt 
322,2,"My friend and I got in an argument yesterday, partly my fault.. It blew up and escalated more than necessary, and I got upset, but in the end we agreed to disagree and said we would forget about it etc. Later, while she went out, I heard her phone going off every time she got a message and I went into her room to turn off the notif sound. My curiosity got the better of me and I read a recent message she had sent to our other housemate/friend. Big mistake because it was a message basically talking shit about me, that majorly triggered me. I obviously couldn't say anything because it was my own fault for looking, and I know people say things when they're angry/after an argument. But, obviously it has still really triggered me, as the message was not nice. I had a panic attack and started feeling extremely paranoid about my friends perception of me, and now I feel really uncomfortable. I just need help rationalizing this, for someone like me it is so difficult because I am already so deeply self critical, and this just makes me feel so upset and empty...  I stopped going to therapy a few weeks ago because Ive been doing good, maybe it would help to have a therapy session to discuss it with an impartial person? Just feeling really shit now :("
323,3,"So right now I'm feeling this surge or a wave inside me. 
And it kind of demands instant stimulation like playing chess, reading, and brainstorming. I want to just get extremely busy somehow and once I've overstimulated myself and the mind is completely gone out of control, the wave is silent and I'm completely burnt up and exhausted and I won't feel like doing anything for the next three to four hours.

I think it might be the transitioning from high to low state. I don't know. I also think that I might be comorbid.

Has anyone else gone through this kind of experience?


"
324,3,"I’ve recently been diagnosed with BPD and I’m just wondering if this is a part of that? I’m seriously at the end of my rope here. I’m confused and my therapist also just quit so I’m lacking real guidance

This is going to sound absolutely ridiculous, but: I had a long distance/online relationship on and off for about four years. It ended last year officially with both of us going completely no contact. During the relationship, I feel like I can safely say we were emotionally abusive to each other, and just toxic partners in general. I clung obsessively to him, and he to me, (think: “I don’t know why I love you but I love you so”) and then one day about a year ago I rejected a final advance from him after a huge blowup and some steady contact because I had recently found a new partner, IRL this time, (one I’m still with as of rn) and he just stopped chasing me like he would. I thought that would be it, and id stop chasing him, too, as with other exes/relationships I’ve felt the ‘normal’ amount of missing someone. Craving attention, approval, all the curiosity- but this time it’s on a whole different level. 

I’ve spent hours just gazing at his house on Google earth. I used to watch his car move on traffic cams from his area, I make new accounts to stalk his pages, and other terrible shit like that I don’t want to admit I feel so guilty. The works. (Luckily I’ve stopped myself from the more stalker-y stuff recently, promise) I started neglecting my responsibilities because I felt the need to just watch and think about him. I just have this compulsion to monitor him, or something. I hate that I have this. Whenever I think about him or someone mentions him my heart perks up and my brain immediately kicks into an overdrive of dopamine. I watch all of his Twitch streams, and whenever he mentions how many viewers he has at that moment it happens again and I’m totally on cloud nine for the next couple of hours until something else kills my mood. Anyways, last night I found out he has a new girlfriend; a girl I actually used to know. I felt freedom for a second, like I was finally going to be able to move past it and accept that he doesn’t think about me anymore, yet here I am once again losing sleep.

I feel terrible because I’m still in a loving, happy relationship IRL. My partner knows about him, but not to the extent I’ve described. I just can’t get over this and I seriously cant hold this in any longer. How do I stop this? Is this an FP? Thanks for reading. Sorry if this is too long"
325,0,"Jusr curious about this I guess, and looking for song suggestions.  When I have big mood swings, I tend to listen to music and take really long walks until the episode dies down. My personal favorite artist for this is Green Day, but hbu? Any specific songs/albums/artists?"
326,2,"I welcome advice or people sharing similiar feelingsbut I mostly just need to find a way to put this into words.

  
I'm still working on this thought but I've realized that the difficulty I have with regulating my emotions makes social interaction very stressful and fuels a lot of my social anxiety. Like I tend to be easily offended or embarrassed but I'm also at the same time aware of it, so I end up trying to supress those emotions but due to my trauma related behaviors my brain just goes blank and I disasociate. So basically what others see is me getting offended and then shutting down.

  
Like sometimes someone will correct me about something and I experience embarrassment that causes strong emotions despite the situation not warranting that much of a reaction. So I kind of end up in a cyclical panic and disasociation that becomes so normalized that I view it as just being how social interaction makes me feel. 

Most of all its just hard knowing that people watch me randomly shut down and they don't really know why, I feel like they might sometimes assume its more personal than it is.

  
These random moments of clarity and selfawareness is kind of strange and confusing "

330,2,"I meet different BPD criteria at different intensities at different times. I'm sure that's very standard for BPD, since it's basically the Chaos Disorder. But one I never thought I met, through ups and downs, was the impulsivity one. I drove recklessly in high school, but that was the last example I could think of. And I was doing that in the immediate aftermath of SA, so maybe it was a situational trauma response thing.

Addiction runs in my family, so I knew I needed to be careful from a pretty young age. My (long term sober) alcoholic dad drilled it into my head: don't touch substances. Don't do it. Alcohol was never available in the house. Never partied, never touched weed, didn't even drink before I was legal. I told myself so many times I knew better than to start something I might not be able to stop. I think I started to believe I was too smart and self aware to have a problem. 

Anyway....I was lying to myself. I was drunk and/or high for four days straight, including at work. It's been three weeks since that stretch, and I think about how much I want to be drunk or high a dozen times a day, even though I talked through the original trigger in therapy and feel legitimately better about it. Two years ago, I was the same way for a solid year. And I told myself that since I wasn't drinking that many drinks per day, it wasn't a problem. But I'm on three different meds that enhance the effects of alcohol, so one drink for me felt like three for someone else. I was drinking too much. I stopped for a bit, so I called it situational. But it's all situational, because life is full of FUCKIN situations!!!

I wish I had words of wisdom for myself, but the truth is that I am too ashamed to talk to my dad, and I'm scared to open this can of worms with my therapist. I know I need to. I know intellectually what I need (I think.) But I'm having trouble dealing with the shame/doom spiral associated with realizing you're not exempt from the family curse. 

Tldr: I have a problem with substances that I've been in denial about, and it sucks. 

If anyone else has any similar stories or words of encouragement (reality checks or accountability are also welcome) I would take it. I am trying very hard not to get drunk about this."
331,3,"Thank you all in advance for reading this. I’ve been feeling so heavy lately, and I just need to let it out.

A while ago, I randomly moved in with my boyfriend from the west coast. I was mentally exhausted and honestly didn’t even like him that much at first—I just needed an escape. He paid for everything and has always shown up for me in ways I wasn’t used to.

Somewhere along the way, I fell in love. He became my entire world. Being away from him physically hurts. But the truth is, I feel broken. I’m scared he’s going to wake up one day and realize I’m too much.

I started using cocaine to make sex feel bearable in the beginning. He didn’t know. And now, it’s like I flipped a switch—I’m constantly wanting sex, but I don’t know how to show him love in other ways. I barely kiss him or show affection. He deserves more than I know how to give.

He does everything for me. And I love him. I really do. But I’m scared I’m going to lose him, or ruin it all because I don’t know how to be okay.

I don’t really know what I need by sharing this. I just know I’m tired of thinking, of feeling like this, of pretending I’m fine.

332,2,"What advice can you give to someone who’s just starting to seek treatment for bpd? What therapies have worked for you and how did you find your therapist that worked for you? 

Also, I’ve heard some suggest to ask bpd is not put on your medical file as some insurances refuse to cover treatment for bpd and to have a generic mood disorder on file instead. Should I be wary of having this documented for coverage purposes? Is this something any of you have experienced?

I have not been diagnosed with bpd by a professional but my partner and I have come to the conclusion that I likely have bpd. I’m finally trying to find a therapist that is non-judgmental and can actually help me get better and possibly diagnosed. I know to look for those that do DBT. I wasn’t a fan of DBT in my IOP program a few years back but I’m not sure if it was the lady running it or just my mental state that wasn’t open to it at the time, so I’m willing to try again. I feel like I’m actually spiraling by the day and I’ve put off looking for someone for too long. I really want to put in the work to get better but I’m worried of starting with a therapist and wasting my time or it not being a good fit. I feel like that would just make me worse. Any advice would be so appreciated!

I was recently diagnosed after many years of suspecting this might be what I'm dealing with.

Through it I have also lost some of my closest friends. I feel like looking back at my actions, it almost feels like a doppelganger or some alternate reality version of me. I don't understand.  
I am since sober (this was also linked with a long standing substance abuse problem) and working on things through therapy. Even though it doesn't feel like me I am of course taking accountability and I know it was me.

I cope well and don’t take my issues out on anyone but I told him I need weekly check ins with each other for mental health and that I’d like if he’d comfort me when I’m sad or having an episode. He told me I can’t put all that pressure on one person. I said I am not trying to crush you with this weight but I’m asking for you to carry some of if when I need like I said in the beginning. He said when I get worked up even if it’s not about him he can’t handle it because he’s bad at confrontation situations or giving advice. I asked why he continues to date girls with BPD if he doesn’t have the personality for it. His ex had BPD and she was awful but it also sounded like he never handled her well.

I stay calm in situations but I need my person to rant to. I don’t put it all on him, I’m very strong. I also have always been supportive with his own issues like depression and severe anxiety. I always talk if though with him and offer anything I can do. Should I not get the same treatment? He is a very kind man, I love him. But I need to explain to him that I need more support than other girlfriends and if he can’t be what I need he shouldn’t date girls with mental illness."
338,2,"Hey, I am diagnosed with BPD and was recently in a relationship that only lasted a month. We were friends for almost a year and we were so close platonically that I thought I was in love with him. And he liked me but as soon as the first week of dating went by I felt burnt of my emotional capacity to be in a romantic relationship. I’m almost 19 and it was the first boyfriend I had and I think I started liking him because he said he liked me first and I had never experienced a boy liking me in that way. We are still friends and he understood why I wasn’t able to continue dating and he is very sweet, but I was starting to hate talking to him cause I felt exhausted. I feel a lot better tho now that we’re just friends again cause there is way less pressure. I was curious if anyone ever has similar struggles? I also cut things off romantically because I don’t want to have a situation when I become emotionally abusive towards him cause I don’t ever want that to happen. I’ve never been in a position to abuse anyone but I’m deeply terrified of ever unintentionally hurting people. So I did things in a healthy way by stating how I felt and he gladly understood. Advice is nice if you have any, but also if anyone has similar struggles I’d like to hear them. ❤️"
339,3,"Hey! I have BPD and unfortunately I find it insanely hard to communicate to my partner my needs, feelings, and thoughts. I know this bothers him (it would bother anyone) I feel terrible. Sometimes I get upset by something he does and says and then I’m over it in 5 minutes and sometimes it lasts longer. But lately we’ve been arguing a lot and we really need to figure out how to communicate properly and constructively. I usually have trouble getting the way I’m feeling out or being scared of being judged because sometimes it IS the small things. And sometimes I’m scared he doesn’t understand because he doesn’t and it suck’s. I try hard to never say “its because of my BPD because I feel like that’s just shifting the blame to my mental health instead of the issue but sometimes it really is just the BPD and I struggle so much to think rationally and I know he doesn’t understand what I mean when I try to explain to him how I feel or he says that it isn’t a big deal, but it is to me. "
340,2,"I don’t date, but I’m extremely clingy towards my friends. I get unbearably jealous whenever I see them having positive or even neutral conversations with other people. Usually I try my best not to react, but there was one time I really couldn’t control myself. I made a fake social media account and messaged someone one of my friends was talking to. I told them that my friend did horrible things to me and they shouldn’t keep talking to them. They didn’t believe me (the logical part of my brain is thankful, but the BPD part of me kinda still wants them dead) and they’re still friends to this day.

I haven’t done anything like that since then, but now whenever my friends vent about someone they know, I purposefully phrase all of my responses in a way that makes the person they’re upset about sound worse. Sometimes I voice my insecurities in hopes that they’ll comfort me and tell me they like me more than their other friends.

I know it’s horrible and it makes me feel disgusted with myself. I don’t want to do it but I don’t know how to stop. Sometimes it feels like it’s out of my control. I feel even worse saying it’s because of my BPD. What if I’m not mentally ill at all and I’m just destined to be a bad person? It’s not like my manipulative behavior is the only thing that prompted a diagnosis but it still feels like I’m faking and villainizing BPD sometimes. "
341,0,So guys a while back I was referred for emdr therapy not specifically for my bpd more in hopes of helping my night terrors. But was hoping some of you guys may have has some experience with it and could let me in on what I could do be better the experience for myself 
342,3,I keep getting urges of running away with her and disappearing into nowhere. I connect with her on such a special level that I don't always with my SO. I feel like I need to distance myself from my friend for my safety. it's really difficult to not self sabotage and fuck up the little I've built for myself. why can't I just be multiple at once and have everyone. I don't want to hurt either of them but I think I will end up hurting both of them a lot. I'm a human hurricane to those around me. 
343,3,"My (21F) boyfriend (20M) is also my fp. We are going through a rough patch at the moment, because he feels drained by my constant nagging for reassurance. It has led to lots of minor fights where we make up in less than an hour usually, because he cares and knows I’m unstable. 

So from the outside everything does go back to normal, but I know from our conversations that he is getting more and more convinced that we should break up. 

Last fight, I saw him cry for the first time in the 2 years we have been together - he was feeling guilty of wanting out because he doesnt want to hurt me. When I ask him he says he does love me but he doesnt know if he wants to stay together.

The perspective of breaking up is making the BPD flare ups harder to ignore and more frequent because I just know there is some truth to what the little voice says.

Anyways, I don’t want my fear of abandonment continuing to weigh him down an tear whats left of the relationship.

How do I stop being so needy.
"
344,2,"CW Self harm: 

I’m 18 and I’ve recently started thinking more critically about how I express pain and how others react to it.

A little while ago, I self-harmed in a way that resembled a homophobic slur. When my pediatrician saw it, she didn’t seem alarmed—instead, she framed it as me “claiming myself” or asserting identity in some way. I’m out, and I explained that to her, but… is it weird that she wasn’t more concerned? Is that just her way of staying calm?

I’d also self-harmed elsewhere, and she remained generally unbothered. Do you think that kind of neutral response could be a strategy to avoid reinforcing behavior if it’s attention-seeking? (I know how BPD-coded that sounds, lol.) Or do you think that given that because I could really only explain why I did it as because I was supposed to / it was inevitable, there was a genuine lack of validity to it? 

Also, she wondered if I was manic given that I was smiling etc. when describing various really not good things that have gone down. I sort of didn't think that was right especially given my understanding of Bipolar mania vs BPD euphoria and can tell you that in that moment I was not feeling euphoria. I guess my question on that is about being calm/happy when describing things---are you guys like that? How do you explain that?"
345,2,"I don’t think a lot of ppl actually realize the amount of ableism around this diagnosis. People just casually literally will be so fkn ableist to u and forget you have an actual mental illness so quick, even worse when they don’t like you they will use ur mental illness against u and isolate you as “crazy”. 💀💀💀 it will go from just chill to 100 so fast with this shi it’s crazy, I think it’s in part due to the media portrayal of BPD, implicit and unconscious ableist bias and also this idea that it’s not a real disorder and we’re all just bad ppl lol. Crazy world"
346,1,"Idk if this is just straight up toxic to myself, but having bpd and still not being able to pull someone (not just romantically, also sexually), is having me spiralling. 

I feel like people with bpd (or any other personality disorders) are most likely to pull people like a magnet, bc of their charismatic aura. 

I dont. At all. Maybe its also bc im a lesbian living in a small city, but i feel like its just too easy to settle it like that. 

I cant stop convincing myself that im just an unlovable person or unatractive. Cuz why else would no one ever want me? "
347,3,"Had anyone been or knows someone with BPD crises who needed in patient admission? Did it help?  
A lined one seems to be in BPD crises which has escalated to violence on parents. I'm afraid admission will do more harm than good"
348,0,"Hey everyone! I am currently trying to search for a hobby because my therapist told me I need ""controlled chaos"" in my life, so if anyone has any hobby examples of this, I would very much appreciate it, because I am driving myself insane without blowing up my life. I need a hobby that will give me that same feeling without the consequences. Thank you in advance!"
349,1,"hey, so i've been writing a lot lately while trying to keep myself sane

im translating it from my native language so it may be even shittier than normal lol 

anyway, here's some

Blood Eagle

I am nothing but your blood eagle. You mercilessly break my ribs—and rip my still-living lungs from my back. You give me wings, but not freedom. I don’t even need a cage, because I am always your slave.

What I feel for you is nothing but a sick sense of gratitude, almost masochistic, possessive, damned. How could I deny you anything? How could I refuse one more moment near you? In the end, it doesn’t matter how. It never did. And if you long for me to be nothing more than a hot, aching pile of flesh, pus, and blood, so be it. It’s not like I’m anything more than that when I’m away from you. 

I forgive you, and I will never forgive you. But I will always be yours. Inevitably yours. Painfully yours.

Home

My old memories are buried beneath the old floorboards of the house. I have lived here for as long as I can remember. 

I find myself on my knees on the barbed floor. Bleeding, trembling, and on the edge of sanity. 

I push my fingertips through the cracks, trying anxiously to reach the memories that shine there, beneath the floor, but my efforts always prove futile.

The floor is a deep crimson, stained with my blood, like a cursed painting by an artist who painted their own death shortly before they died. 

There is no food in the house. I have grown accustomed to eating the mold on the rotting walls, since taste was the first sense that left me since I locked myself in here. 

The constant dripping of water in my head only gives me enough water to get through the day, and even drinking it never seems to take away my fatigue. It never quenches my thirst. 

When I rest my head against the boards, I can hear muffled voices in the background. I just wish I could hear your voice clearly once more. 

I don't even remember what you sounded like.

My Angel <3


I hear you through the windows in a gust of wind

Like a simple, frail melodic sound

An airy, melancholic song fading in the pale blue sky

I see you in the hyacinths of the old flower shop on my street

In trinkets and thrift stores that only a few find value in

In cheap jewelry and rings that change color on our fingers

You’re the one who decorates my Sundays

With sensitive eyes, moist with tears

With your warm lap and hands on my skin

With the way your scent drifts into the air and becomes mine too

Comforting like hot tears after days without crying

I didn’t even see you arrive

It was like being happy again



"
350,1,"I've been struggling with minimal supports. I met this guy i really connected with. It didn't last long but we talked constantly and it was just so easy, you know? I can't remember the last time i had that connection with someone.

I thought we were good, moving as friends and supports. And then out of no where he said he needed to stop talking to me. 

I didn't know him long but I was getting attached. I missed talking with people, having that connection and support.

And I'm feeling really alone right now. "
351,1,"I tend to stray away from super emotionally driven posts/vents on here, but I have nobody to turn to. I can feel the people in my life growing so exhausted of me. As much as they deny it. I’m such a burden. I can’t imagine putting up with someone like me. I hate how fucking angry I get at everything. Getting emotionally attached to people so strongly  is a fucking disease. I cannot put myself through this shit again. I just won’t ever talk to anyone anymore forever. I hate how obsessive and insane I’m perceived for splitting when I can’t fucking help it. Maybe don’t hurt me then? Maybe don’t trigger me on purpose? I just want to be loved, but everyone I’ve ever truly cared for deeply in my life has abandoned me. Every FP I’ve had either hates me, or thinks I’m too much. It’s always that. When I try my absolute best it’s still “too much.” I try so fucking hard to manage my symptoms and communicate with people as rationally as I can because I get it. I really do. I’m draining. The stupidest things make me feel so worthless and small. But at the same time…Why do people promise they understand? That they won’t leave. Then they’re gone the next day like poof. Maybe don’t fucking lie to me lol. Bpd has made me completely disposable and unlovable to people. Like I’m just not even a real person to them. I hate being seen as soooo evil. It took so much horrible shit in my life to happen for me to end up this way. Imagine how I feel. I miss my current FP who abandoned me so bad I wanna scream at him and just ask why why why he would that to me. I wanted this so bad. I wasted so much time just for the same outcome every time. Nobody understands how I feel. They claim to but they don’t. I’ll never feel anything other than pain. I wanna curl up in a hole with no food or water and just lay there to let myself rot. "
352,2,"I just can’t do it. Can’t stop assuming the worst, can’t stop assuming they’re secretly plotting against me and hate me and want me gone, can’t stop assuming they think I’m a liar or a coward or that they talk about me behind my back. I want to stop doing this for so many reasons but I’m scared that if I don’t doubt them, it’ll happen. Like the second I let my guard down it’s the end. If I’m not constantly on the look out for signs they dislike me, how do I prevent it? I’m just waiting to be told by all my friends “Actually, none of us like you. We want you gone. You’re meaningless to all of us, we only talk to you because we feel like we have to. We only pity you, there’s no genuine care for you”"
353,2,"I had a friend and he liked me but I never had anything for him, he's been with me in my bad times and he was interested in me and I kept on asking so I said ok just to not lose him. And eventually when he met a girl he used to talk about that she has a lot of mental health issues who's been in toxic relationships, I was okay with it as I was never into him, they met they made out because she made him drink and started cuddling and they ended up making out. He tells me that and I get the reason to break up or whatever it is because before that too I told him you are not emotionally available and i stopped being same with him but he didn't accept that and when met that girl I got a good reason to part ways, but he tries hard to reconcile and eventually we stopped talking after a few months we became friends again but she never gets over me, that girl is an activist or something i and i followed her on ig she seemed fun but had a weird superiority complex but that wasn't that apparant she, told me she likes  my friend do I have something with him and I tell no, and she is like I like him and I tell that he might have some interest in you, also that time I was going through a breakup with I guy I met on hinge her gc helped me with it, and then in one day she tells my friend, I am an attention seeker and she's going to remove and I was like wtf i didn't even do anything I felt so insecure and I left all of her gcs and she again slut shamed me to our mutual friend, and I blocked her

It was so hard, she meant something to me, it was such a betrayal one day she says sorry the other say calls me a bitch and then only i block her, she lies to make her seem better, and through her gc i started talking to this guy, and eventually we get into a relationship but he is still in her circle, she calls him to meet, they have weed as she's asking it from him and as it's banned in my country they go to a room, she talks to him nicely and gets angry seeing my name on the screen of his phone, tells him that why are you friends with her, she came between me and a guy and as I told him that please don't talk to her about me, he just ignores those questions in front of her, and she goes home and calls out mutual friend asks him why am I so needy, says that I am a slut and a bitch and said that she started liking my bf and she's going to cut herself because of me and stayed depressed for days, also my friend is like it's not that they are together and i didn't tell him about my boyfriend and i as he's still into me, he gets shocked and says you betrayed me and I stop talking to him, and she also removes my boyfriend from her gc, and talks shit about me in a mutual server and gets me removed, and my boyfriend thinks that it's not good but never stopped being in one of her server, he's active there and would tell me about the messages and everything and it tho he never directly talked to her, it makes me feel like a girl that is so toxic and tried so hard to slut shame me and calls herself a feminist, but i understand that he's different person and has a different way of dealing with people so I let him be.

He takes her side some time and I feel horrible because of it, I have been slut shamed by my own dad and it's something that triggers my anxiety, they be in mind contact and it doesn't trigger my anxiety again except for a few times, and it's not that I am insecure that my boyfriend would have interest in her i know that's never gonna happen, it's just her nature that she is like this i feel insecure of being targeted again like that.

After a few months my friend that broke friendship with me calls me and tells she's apparantly living with her ex and never told anyone about it, she adds nuances to it when he confronts, her arguments are so fragmanted that you can't even remember them, my friend cuts her off and then she texts my boyfriend and he tells him that she said that when the second time she talked to my friend after a break, she lost interest in him, he's a complete different person and she starts developing interest in him and to move on from him she keeps on talking to my friend because she was emotionally dependent on him, and when my friend and i weren't talking, he even showed interest in her she's like think about it deeply.

Also my friend got to know about her live in thing because she's going to meet another activist and she met him in a room, she in told my friend that she is showing interest in her but she isn't reciprocating, but when he got to know about her live in she said she's taking revenge from him by being with him, and now she claims she is interested in that another activist and after that she talks to my bf about how she's interested in him.

I told him everything yet he said he doesn't agree with my perception of her says like if she approaches him, he will refuse but that isn't even my concern, i feel insecure of she being in his life as even after knowing how she is he is choosing to be contact with her she told him she's interested in him, she could again accuse me of anything, that makes me feel anxious.  WHAT DO I DO IDK, i confronted to my bf he's like I don't like being controlled i never controlling but she is just too much to handle i want her to forget that I exist."
354,1,"I hate being in a relationship sometimes. It makes me vulnerable. I hate missing him when we’re away from each other. It makes me want to run away 😭 
He doesn’t deserve this! 
Does it get easier?! "
355,3,"I, much like everyone else who is unwillingly forced to live with this disorder, am so sick of seeing ""BPD abuse"" being brought up out of nowhere across the internet and I just need to scream into the void about it for a minute.

Everywhere I look, at least once a week I will see a post or video discussing something completely unrelated to bpd \[but usually mental health-esque\] and there will ALWAYS be someone in the comments bitching about us and I just genuinely do not understand the obsession non-bpd individuals have with trying to convince everyone else that we are the spawn of satan or just straight up the devil reincarnate.

I often find myself repeating the same thing to people \[I know it's impossible to get through to these types but I try to fight off the stigma regardless\], ""People with bpd are not inherently abusive or manipulative. Some people are just bad people regardless of having a mental health condition. It's like saying 'I am a victim of bipolar abuse, anxiety abuse, or depression abuse.'""

I don't know. It's just so upsetting and I really try not to think too much into it but this stigma is exactly what keeps us from getting treatment for the disorder that ""makes us abusive"" so- pretty counterintuitive wouldn't you think? I also don't understand why someone wouldn't take 30 seconds to google what bpd is and/or how it's caused just to get a better and more professional understanding of what it is they're spewing bullshit about y'know?"
356,2,"We’re in a long distance relationship and can only physically see each other once a month or so. We text every day and talk on the phone every night. 
They’ve been a little busier than usual and I feel like we haven’t gotten to talk as much this past week, which is fine because I know life happens and I don’t expect them to be glued to their phone all day. 
But I miss them and I’ve been getting really clingy feeling and really emotional about everything and what I want to ask them for is a day or even just a full evening/night of their undivided attention and watch movies or FaceTime or something like that. 
Does that make me pathetic and desperate?"
357,1,I don’t know if this is the right place to post but I just don’t know what else to do. I don’t even know what to say or what to do. My friend (29M) died very suddenly and unexpectedly on Friday morning.. his mom went to wake him up for work because he wasn’t up and he was found unresponsive. We don’t even know what happened fully and I have 0 closure. I’ve never felt pain this badly. I have been nonstop weeping and I have a 4 year old I’m trying to shield from me sobbing. I’ve never dealt with loss other than my nana I knew was getting old but this is by far 10x worse than that. I just don’t know what to do. It doesn’t feel real. It feels like a sick joke or a bad dream. I just don’t know what to do.
358,1,"I was diagnosed on my 16th Birthday.  I have been mental as long as I can remember. The best I’ve ever felt is being completely single doing whatever I want to do. The most euphoric I’ve felt is being in  love, but being euphoric in life be is also the most destabilising thing - For me, no matter how healthy the relationship. Now that I’m an adult (25f) and have healthy coping mechanisms, it’s almost a relief when a relationship ends and I can be normal again. Does adult BPD and healthy relationships exist symbolically? Success stories please 
"
359,3,"Does anyone else feel like this? I don’t know how to describe it other than I just feel so exhausted all the time. Like every day is just so intense and overwhelming for me. My emotions feel as if they control me and it’s been that way for as long as I can remember. This community has helped me a lot because being like this can be so isolating. I also wonder can anyone relate to the constant feeling of guilt that persists for no reason?? Every time I feel happy or look forward to something, i inevitably go and ruin it by freaking out or breaking down. "
360,2,"I’ve (24f) been to multiple therapists over the last 5 years which I ended up quitting very early on (split on them, surprise surprise) because I was not ready to work through my past. I’d freak out any time things started getting too deep. 

I recently started seeing a new, very qualified therapist who is actually a doctor, because it’s time I work through my childhood and get to the root of my issues. I thought I was ready. 

Since digging into the trauma, I have completely regressed. I’m feeling paranoid that all of the people around me hate me, are plotting against me, are talking behind my back. 

I’m anxious 24/7 which hasn’t been a problem for me in a long time. My emotional instability is back with a force when it was pretty under control for the last couple of years. 

Is this normal? I plan to tell my therapist this when I see her on Tuesday. It’s just discouraging because I want to sort through things but I also hate feeling miserable like this. "
361,2,"long story short: I was able to contact the doctor who rescued me on the medical car after my attempt about two years ago.
we are having such a deep, intense and human exchange through email.
here's the dial: things won't last forever. there will come the time of the last email, of me having to go back to study without being excited for the possibility of recieving his email.
how do I cope with this? now that I unlocked such a beautiful feeling, how do I accept that it's destined to end?"
362,3,I feel like i am always the one that is listening and helping and like literally burning out from all the stuff that gets put onto my shoulders like heavy shit. But idk if im bad i cant communicate OR they dont wanna understand. Maybe both. Idk. I feel so empty.
363,1,"how do u deal with the emptiness and depression ?? I still dont have a therapist for bpd and im just rlly lost and dont know how to like handle it, its just getting worse idk. What do you do? rn im sleeping everytime it happens but i keep sleeping for way too long like its too unhealthY"
364,1,"hi idk i just need to share somehwere. one of my online besties told me she isnt friends with a guy anymore and now they posted snapchat stories together, apparently she „hired“ him for a photoshoot - after saying they dont talk anymore and she wont hire him. And they looked like really cheerful and happy in the videos too. Idk its rlly not that deep bit at the same time i feel really depressed betrayed and empty. Like so empty. 😭😭😭 "
365,3,"I'm pretty certain that my mom has BPD. She has extreme self image issues and thinks that everyone hates her. Pretty much any benign thing you say can be suddenly misconstrued as a personal attack against her and ruin the entire day. You can never try to explain yourself because she'll just become self-loathing and threaten to let herself die. The mood swings are very extreme and she'll become very angry. She has insane road rage. She was also an alcoholic for most of my childhood, only quitting after she had to because it was going to physically kill her.

I'm an adult. I would just move out, but I'm autistic and have PTSD so I've really struggled to hold a stable job. It's also not cheap around here, so it's not an option at this moment. I still do love my mom, but this behavior is hurting me AND her so much. She constantly talks about wishing she was different and wanting to be better. When her mood is stable she's not a bad person and there's some level of self awareness. She's never been physically abusive either, I just think her negatively consumes her. I feel so much frustration for how this has affected me, but also so much sadness for how she continues to rip herself apart. Is there any hope to get her help? I have no idea how to broach the subject without offending her. I just want her to have help for both of our sakes. "
366,3,"I've been suffering with bpd and depression for many years. I feel like I've been recovering from the depression and for some reason nobody talks and helps with 'post depression' life. I feel like I wasn't supposed to live past 25. I'm now 31 and I'm working full time and my salary is so low I can't afford nice holiday, or even a dentist. Been using the same smartphone for past 5 years and I feel like I'm stuck not knowing what to do next. I've lost many years of my life just trying to survive. Ive quit weed, alcohol and cigarettes. Medication was working for me for a long time but also made me put a lot of weight and I hate the way I look. I've been with my partner for 5 years now and it's not always easy as she suffers from bpd too. I moved to England 12 years ago and I still haven't made any real close friends. Which is partially cultural issue and partially me isolating myself in the past issue. My partner says she's happy with the way things are and doesn't need any other friends. While recovering from depression I started taking an interest in various things. At the begging it started slowly. I noticed I was able to watch and focus on films again. So I got excited and went on a rampage. Ended op with hundreds of DVD's. Collected some CDs and vinyls as well. Then my focus was getting better and started reading books. Also collected hundreds of books over the last few years. Started doing art again. Little bit of painting, little bit of collage, and photography. In the meantime I moved to slightly bigger flat, which allowed me to get a few animals. Acquired a few BB guns to have some fun with targets. I took my passion for design and furniture little bit too seriously and started refurbishing second hand furniture. I started making a jewellery thinking it would help me make some money on the side. But it didn't work out as I thought it would. I guess it needs a lot more attention than I can give it. I started another apprenticeship to get more qualifications. Started learning german. I bought a car because I wanted to learn how to drive. Recently I got a pair of roller skates and started skating again. At some point I was thinking about getting a camera and start filmmaking, but luckily I didn't. I feel like my brain is trying to compensate for all the lost years and I'm picking so many hobbies at once. And I get so overwhelmed and frustrated that I don't have the time or space for all of it. So my flat is rather cluttered. Full of unfinished projects. And every time I think of giving up one of them up. I give it little bit of attention and I get I kick out of it and I decide to keep it because it makes me happy. All the doctors, psychiatrists and therapists want to get the job done and get you out of crisis. But nobody prepares you for what happens after that. The explosion of emotions. The limitless opportunities that you start to notice. But you're not able to control those desires. It it gonna pass? Is my brain going to adjust and get used to the idea of living and just calm down. Or im a going to live trying to prove to myself that I can master thousands of things and never be able to just ""waste"" some time and relax my mind. "
367,2,"Something so frustrating about my anxious attachment is not feeling able to thrive without my FP. We are working on me being able to spend time or nights away from him, which is important when the guy you're dating is in the military. So I have a friend that I see once a week, either they stay at my place or I stay at theirs. My boyfriend was relieved to see me put energy into other friendships and be happy. However, I get homesick every time I'm away from him for 24 hours... I find that I can't stay at my friend's house for long until everything feels way too quiet and my skin crawls with sadness. I try to watch a movie or something but can never get my mind off of my FP, so then I go home again. He's proud of me just for trying, but I feel like a failure..."
368,2,"UPDATE: I am AuDHD as well, and I’ve never lost interest in a special interest so fast in my life. After struggling to just survive for years and then finding my passion in activism, I’ve realized I can’t do it anymore. This comment section changed my entire perspective and now I just want to move out of country and throw my life as is away. 

I genuinely wish rude people or people who intentionally make you feel bad or take the wind out of your sails… I genuinely wish they could feel how much it impacts me. 

I feel it in my chest. I feel it in my toes. When someone unprompted does shit like that? I get so angry, sad, frustrated, and just like WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS?! 

I posted to an activism group and just asked “Please don’t do this(insert thing)” and was not only told “Wah sounds like you just suck and you aren’t even from here so…” (summarizing  but you get the gyst) 

Once again it’s an activism thing about community and safety and… yeah this is how I was talked to. I mean it upset me to the point where my 2 anti anxiety pills I took an hour ago to sleep on this bus is doing nothing. 

Also my knee jerk reaction to these instances is to always block and then I just want to leave or ban myself from the location, group, or whatever it is. I just feel like I want to crawl out of my skin. The whole — “you don’t even belong here” thing just… 

I don’t belong anywhere so… anyway now I’m spiraling and feeling hyper depressed and just overall like a kick to the gut.

369,1,"I have been telling my family about my diagnosis for the past months, I bring it up occasionally because I want to know whether they did some quick research at least but they never did, no matter how many times I tell them it is a huge burden to my life and that's exactly why i feel the way i feel, 

They never tried to understand, they just don't care, I tell them ""hey can you do a quick research now?"" Them ""nah I'm tired"" 
Like damn just 1 minute "
370,1,"I finally foud came to terms that I'm more comfortable with short hair . It doesn't cause me dysphoria like long hair(by long hair I mean anything like a bob or longer). Against my mother's will obviously I started getting frequent trims . Almlst everyone likes me with short hair, and they tend to motice how more comfortable I'm with it.
Last time I got it cut , she yelled at me for sometime about how ugly I look, that I cant be a girl with this short of a hair , among other not so noce things!!
Generally people mistake for a boy with my hair cut and I usually found it funny. Never even felt the need to correct anyone. I just didn't care. But after last time I started caring ...I even started considering growing my hair even though it always throws me in a loop. Regardless I pushed through  it .
Today, I got my hair cut again cause it was starting to get too long for my liking and I felt shitty in general about how I look. The hairdresser was overly enthusiastic with the cut . He cut too much even for my liking, and now it's too short in the back. I tried to make myself feel better about it by buying more styling products and assuring myself that it will grow back any way if I Don like that much .
Once she saw my hair cut she started yelling again. Said even worse things, how ugly I look, and if I look back at old photos with long hair I'd find out just how fucked up what I did is. That I'm disgusting,  and will probably get slapped by a stranger for looking this way !! ( I live in a conservative country,  vut even that sounds extreme).

That made me feel even more shitty. And I don't know. I know I'm not less of ""woman"" or whatever because I have short hair . I know gender is kinda a preformance, and it should mean to me whatever makes me comfortable etc.. but she got in my head , and I hate myself even more !!"
371,1,"I tend to get a lot of depressive episodes late at night, and I'm pretty sure my sleep schedule is more disappointing than my penis size lol.  I usually get these really sad and lonely episodes about every other day, around 1 or 2 am, and they last about 1½ to 2½ hours, so some nights I don't even fall asleep till 4:30 or 5 am.  They also come with a lot of suicidal thoughts.  I have no intentions of ever acting on them, even though I want to in tbe moment, but it's safe to say that falling asleep during this is impossible.  I usually just sneak out of my house (I'm 17) and take a walk until I'm too tired to keep going, or the episode has passed, but it still doesn't solve the sleep issue.

Anyone else have a similar problem, or have any ideas to fix this that doesn't involve medicine?"
372,2,"Good morning everyone, if it’s morning where you are.
I thought I was doing good and for some reason that made me believe that me spiraling wouldn’t happen anymore. I really don’t know why I thought that as my therapist hasn’t said I’m in remission.

Well yesterday my SO got a text from an ex that they would frequently talk about. I only know because they told me they got a text from this ex. I sat quietly for a while till I asked “so are you keeping the text or deleting it?”
Only to get an answer of “I’m just going to ignore it”

Me first thought is why not just delete it if you’re not going to respond?! So you can have her number saved? So when you’re not around me you can text her back? I don’t know how to get that out of my head. That as soon as my SO isn’t around me they will jump on the chance to text the ex back. Because I’m not good enough. Because they don’t really love me. Because she’s much prettier than I ever will be.

This has been my thought process all night since being told about it. I keep randomly breaking down crying over this. It really deeply bothers me that he won’t delete the text. Why?! 

I’m feeling not good enough all over again. Like I’m not worth loving. I’m not enough for anyone to just want me and be happy with just me. I don’t know how to rethink this and stop from hurting over a text?! I get to a lot of people this is such a small stupid thing to be upset over, I just don’t know how to tell my brain to stop?

All I keep thinking is “if he responds to this text and I find out I can’t be with him. I won’t be with him. This is why I could absolutely never ever date someone who stays in touch with exs."
373,1,"i literally hate myself so much i feel like i just ruin everything ever. my dad came over to my moms today for fathers day and i went outside to hangout with them. i was kinda upset because i have this constant problem with my psychiatrist where i will text her a week in advance for my medicine refill and she will not reply or refill it until i have run out for a few days.

i was complaining to my mom about it because its frustrating and she just kept blaming me even though i have this issue EVERY month. she just kept telling me to text a week ahead like I AM LITERALLY DOING THAT and kept going in circles with me trying to find a way to blame me for some reason. i got fed up and just yelled at her that she never supports me and is always out to to get me. i yelled that shes always sucking my psychiatrists dick and never takes my side. i already feel guilty and embarrassed about saying this stuff.

i stormed off to my room and now i am just sitting here. my dad left a little bit ago after my outburst and i just feel like i have ruined everything. i hate myself so much. we are going  out to dinner tonight so i hope i can turn things around. i don’t know i just feel like the worst daughter in the entire world. i have no control over my emotions and everyone will leave me or hate me because of it one day :( "

I want to so bad but I know I can’t and what I am feeling is temporary but I can’t help it I don’t know what to do with myself and no one can fucking help me.

376,1,"Hey everyone, and thank you in advance if you’re taking the time to read this.

I’m 20 years old, and aside from a breakup a few weeks ago, my life is actually going pretty okay (I’m not alone – I have a few friends, I have a job, I’m about to start an apprenticeship, I live in my own apartment – it could definitely be worse).
Unfortunately, my BPD and depression don’t really care about that.

When I’m not at work, I pretty much just lie in bed and watch something. It feels like I have no energy for anything else. Even meeting up with friends feels like a huge challenge. I kind of want to, but also kind of don’t. That’s how I feel about most things lately. I want to do things, but at the same time, I really don’t.

I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. Should I even try to do anything? I’ve been at this point before where I just accepted it and waited for the phase to pass – but I don’t know if that’s the right approach. I believe that acceptance is important, but acceptance alone won’t break the cycle.

I’d really appreciate any tips or kind words you might have!"
377,1,"Im 18 mtf and i have a working diagnosis for bpd, and social anxiety, and im extremely lonely. I feel like I push away my ""friends"" because I feel they don't like me. They never talk to me outside of school, im quiet and introverted which is different then alot of them. Im also the only person who's not a cis heterosexual male in my friend group, and I know alot of them don't like lgbt people. I dont like being around them. There last time I hung around with them outside of school, I went to play basketball ball with them, and i was the first to leave because after a while I just felt they were boring to be around. Sometimes I'll unfriended them all on snapchat if I feel like there excluding me, which they are. "
378,0,"I’ve been looking for a good mood tracker that works well for bpd, but all the ones I’m finding cost money. I really need a way to track my triggers and emotions so I can share with my therapist and psychiatrist, especially while I’m going through medication changes. There are a lot of free mood trackers that I’ve seen but none of them really take the ups and downs of bpd into consideration, and they’ve never worked for me because of that. If anyone has one that works for them, I’d love the help."
379,2,"I'm so curious at this point.

I know people are like social media means nothing, fair, I disagree, at least nowadays since everyone (especially Gen-Z) is very chronically online and just my personal experience. ...

There's this person I've never met before, and I quietly adore them.

Although we don't interact, and they're taken. We haven't spoken in like 12 weeks, maybe 13. We never met, I flaked on them.

Don't think we will ever interact again, and nonetheless they got a partner so I don't care to bother further.

That said, they view my stories all the time and I can't tell why.

E.g I'll post multiple snap stories, and then like I've noticed they will watch stories with my face in the thumbnail much quicker. Opposed to the thumbnail being something else.

Typically I post beyond dumb shit. Lately hockey snaps, or icecream and or views, nothing remotely interesting. And or me crash-out ranting about my boss, and or dumb shit like that. Nothing entertaining.

But if my face is in the thumbnail they'll watch immediately, or they'll tap in, tap out, couple mins later, tap in, etc it's a weird pattern I've noticed.

At this point like...

We'vw never met.
I flaked on them (out of my own depression and anxiety issues).
I post nothing remotely interesting, I'm boring, or nerdy, 🤷‍♀️
We haven't spoken in over a month.
So like....

Is the outcome merely just ... Hate watching like... ""Oh she's dumb, oh she's annoying?""

Cause like I can't think of any reason of why to watch my shit and keep viewing?"
380,2,"Hi, I (F21) just broke up with someone (M21), and I’m scared that afterward, I’ll start begging him to come back and have a crisis AGAIN. 

What can I do to avoid to go through this situation? 

Knowing that I'd broken up with him several times and started up again, it was a vicious circle, and I want to take a break from love in general because it's not for me.
It was a long-distance relationship that lasted 3 years, we saw each other a few times over the years. I deleted his phone number and blocked him in all socials.

Any advices will be appreciated, thank you for taking your time reading this…"

382,2,"Hello. So my boyfriend and i have been together for 2 years. I have BPD and a lot of things trigger me. In the last week we haven't seen each other. That made me really sad because we were together 24/7 but it was because he was working. I'm gonna be 18 in a week. At first he was like ""why is it a problem if i don't go?"" 
He doesn't see birthdays as something important and he never celebrated his.
Here 18th birthdays are the most important ones because i'll be an ""adult"".
I told him how much i care for birthday and how much they are important to me and he agreed to go.
Let's get back to this. So we haven't seen each other in a while and he kinda dry texted me or it's all in my head?I was paranoid and before when we had arguments he would always say that everything is okay(when i do something that hurts him but i'm not aware of it). Then when i stop worrying about it and when we have to go to an event that i was happy about and planning for us he just tells me that he doesn't want to go in the last minute and then when i keep asking him what's wrong he tells me everything. So i'm always scared that he would do it again.Since we weren't seeing each other for a week(saw him once and he was tired so he went home) that really triggered me and i was asking him if everything was okay and he said that it was. The problem is that i wasn't sure if it was okay. I was scared that he's mad at me and from the things that he did before(when he's mad he lies that he's not then cancels an important event)i asked him if he will go to my birthday because that's an event and if he's mad at me he would say no. He said ""thank you for asking me this"" and then he said like ""it depends in what mood i'm gonna be in so i'm not sure"".
Turns out he wasn't mad at me but now i made him mad because i asked him this. I told him why i asked him this but he didn't care and told me i hurt him. I really said that i'm sorry and that i understand how i make him feel and i was begging him to understand me how i feel.
Now he said that everything is okay with us but he's not sure if he's gonna go even if he knows how important this is for me.
He just stopped reading my messages and said that he's gonna go to sleep. Now that triggered me more because he knows that i can't sleep when we have an argument and cry all night and i'm here crying while he's sleeping."
383,1,"I am a useless, abhorrent and downright insulting vessel of a human being. I was supposed to be sorting my life out by now and all I can see in my path is suffering. 

I think I wanted to reach the point where I could justify the utter self loathing I’ve been feeling all this time but had no intention of expressing outwardly. This is why I wasn’t doing what I needed to do to progress, why I was smoking weed and doing nothing. Avoiding the inevitable until I explode and eventually collapse into nothingness.

I’ve never felt the urge to harm myself more than I do now. I see a knife in the kitchen and my first instinct is to grab it and start stabbing myself. I can’t stop having violent thoughts about harming myself. I’m supposed to be doing better. I’m supposed to be out of the woods. What is even going on? Why do I feel like this was it? Why do I feel like I’ll be dead soon?"
384,3,"I felt like my medication and therapy really improved me the past few months. But one interaction with my fp today made me feel really horrible. It felt like the days before therapy/mediaction -  like all the progress disappeared in seconds. I was overwhelmed with shame, panic, and this crushing sense of abandonment. I've had bad days/moments on medication before, but this just felt radically different

Just needed to let it out. "

386,3,"This is also a little venty sorry:(. 

Hi, I (21) got diagnosed with bpd in 2021. I believe I fall into the quiet/discouraged category. I’ve been in therapy on and off since then, but due to financial restrictions I am unable to go right now. I don’t deal with my emotions, especially stress, well. Im terrible at communicating. A lot has been happening recently in my life. But I feel like my biggest trigger right now is I’m pretty sure my boyfriend is falling out of love with me and is also not attracted to me anymore. I don’t know what to do. I try to look better, but it does nothing. I try to act better but it does nothing. I just feel like he’s starting to get bored of me and it really really hurts. I don’t know what to do. It’s such a large hurt that it’s debilitating me. I don’t want to go anywhere I don’t want to talk to anyone. All I want to do is cry. It’s been impossible for me to stop crying. I cry in front of him, and he wants to know what’s wrong but it’s like the words just won’t come out. I really love him and I’m scared this is the end. If anyone has any advice it would be really appreciated. Not even like just to make things work between us but how to just get out of this funk. Thank you !! "
387,1,"Having BPD is tough, makes even simplest of the relationships difficult...

So is my life, a BPD loner here, with no romantic relationships (only 2 situationships which ended because I was too scared to open up and share the raw me). Have little friendships and that too fading away because of my fear of being judged for who I truly am.

I am the quiet type, and my favourite person js my therapist. I was neglected most of my childhood and started therapy almost an year back. Had to switch 3-4 therapists until I found her. And I know what everyone says any attachments towards therapists is bad and a dead end. But idk its like this sort of a sibling bond with my therapist is what keeps me alive, couple times have literally saved my life because the only thought that revolted against my wish to disappear was I wouldn't be able to talk to my older sister-like therapist anymore and she would be sad. I know her license would be at stake if she decides to reciprocate (that is if she ever felt that). 

I always searched for family outside of the family I was born in because of how I was scarred by them, can't trust them (or anyone tbh). But this therapist has shown me multiple times that she's going to be there and has allowed me to call her sis during our calls (video therapy, because in-person isn't available). She is the first person I have felt completely safe with and be able to say 'love you (sis)' to, and she did smile when I said that.

Can you guys tell me who your favourite person is and how is it going? 

(Sorry, it became a long ramble about everything all at once)."

i hate going out because i sometimes even feel more lonely around people then being home alone.

389,2,What actually helped with your paranoia if it feels like it’s consuming my whole life? I’ve been very stressed and anxious lately and it’s not helping…i feel very bad about my own thoughts 
390,0,"I want to hear some positivity, it might help anyone that is currently at their lowest, 

What did your therapist tell you that you thought about for quite a long time even when you trying to calm down whenever you got upset"
391,1,"Hey everyone I'm new here, and I'm still pretty new to my disorder. I have been feeling overwhelmed and I like to write it out. It's simple and not probably worked out but I need someone real that isn't AI to see this shit.

Can it be painless?
Can existence be just good? If not how can it be just bad for me? 
If life needs to be low sometimes. How can I live only on low. Without highs? Doesnt it mean there is no lows or highs? Isn't life just another joke by the universe to destroy when the odds are stacked correctly? Is it me, or is it everyone else that never gets better? Because I seem to do everything I can, or have the power to atleast. But it is in vein. 
God if you hear this one prayer I have, please just let me die. When I sleep today, don't give me another day, don't give me another meal, don't let me see another sunrise or sunset, don't let me have another sip of cold refreshing water, or a hug from a loved one.
Just let me go, I failed, or I did exactly as I was supposed to do, but this instinct to keep living, to keep experiencing, I hate it. 
I don't need it. I don't want life, yet, from all the good people I did meet, I'm the one still breathing. 
I guess you do let evil flourishe. 
Dear universe, you do have beauty, but I used all mine up too quickly. And now I have nothing else but the ugly to see.
What do you do when everyone abandons you? Do you, keep going? Do you find other people, just for them to also, leave? Because they all do. 
What kind of sick joke is this? How can life be just pain, without something on the other side of the scale balancing it out. 
I can write a thousand words but nothing can put into words the exhaustion I feel everyday. It's like you have a time machine to go back in time to change everything but you still see that no matter what you change around you, nothing can change in you. 
You are what you are. I am what I am. I am lost. I always was. Sometimes I hope that anyone can just see that and say, it's alright here you have a place. It maybe temporary, but it's a resting place. 
I can keep looking for my savior in my habits. In the lines, in the pills, in the art, the only thing this world hasn't still taken away from me, music. But can I keep it up? How many more ups can I have until the comedowns get to me? Until I have no more ups.
The pain is like a million knifes that keep stabing me in the back, not deep just enough to leave a mark but not a scar, and keep that cycle going on without an end. 
God, please, I just ask, that you give up on me. 
Dont give. Just take. One last time from me, take everything.
Not half way, all the way through, because I don't have the strength, to do it. Not yet. 
But you ignore me usually, so maybe, tomorrow I will have the strength, 
That is my only hope.

And I think going forward, I will never make another friend or allow myself to have a significant other ever again. This is the third time, and it's time that I learn everyone & the whole world is better off without me.

I need to figure out an isolationist life. Minimal contact with co-workers. Zero meaningful relationship contact with people. Only transactional interaction, like with bartenders and waitresses, nothing else.

Nobody understands how I feel. Nope, I'm just crazy, or I'm wrong. I completely lose sight of myself around other people. I can't focus. I can't stop comparing. When I see someone successful in dating or anything that resembles a normal life, I want to freak the eff out. I just can't anymore. I can't \*anything\* with other people. I need to be alone.

399,1,"Like the title says, made a new account just in case since this concerns my close ones.

Basically, might be because of splitting but my brain makes me feel like I'm a curse to others since birth, not a human. My poor mother has had bad luck with men and most of those men made it clear I was the reason why my mom was hard to date so she was single or cheated on a lot of the times.

Then at some point I got a girlfriend but her family was homophobic (I'm a woman) so they made it clear I caused her depression and that I'm the source of all bad things that come to her.

We broke up, not because of me but because she felt like her traumas made her unfit for relationships. 

Now I'm in sort of situationship where we're practically like married couple but because my ""partner"" has similar trauma as my ex she also fears going official, plus her parents are also homophobic even tho they try to pretend we're just friends and like me as a person.


But anyway, the thing is her and my friends and my mom all try to tell me they want me around. They love me, I don't need to prove anything etc. Etc. All that.

My brain doesn't believe it, no matter what I'm told. Any moment now, they realize I'm the curse in their life. Any moment now, they'll see I wasn't a human after all.

So my FP, the woman I'm sort of in relationship in but not quite. She said she's so scared constantly that she can't help me and that I'll sink. She feels she's tried every way to show or tell me she's not leaving and that she loves me.

My therapist tells me to be kinder to myself but to do that I'd need to believe I'm a human again. I don't know is anyone else with bpd suffering from this? If so, how did you start to feel human again.

I don't want to disappear, I try my best to listen to therapist and be kinder but I still fall to the ""I'm not real, I'm not human"" pipeline in the end.

If anyone could share their experiences I'd really need to hear I'm not alone with this."
400,2,"I’ve made a really stupid mistake.

For context, I (M20) do not agree with looking through phones it’s an invasion of privacy which is well deserved in a relationship. I do know however, that my boyfriend doesn’t really share my opinion, or more so just doesn’t really care, he’d let me and would expect me to let him. I don’t mind at all, I don’t have anything to hide.

Today though, he left his phone at home. I couldn’t help myself. it goes against my morals and it made me feel gross, but I had a quick peak at his messages and saw that he had messaged his ex relatively recently. 

He and this ex are on good terms. Do not talk often though. just left everything well I guess I don’t know I don’t ask too much, I know they were important to each other at a time. He had sent a message wishing him all the best, along the lines of “I’ve been thinking of you and how you’re doing, im glad you’re doing okay on your own”. 

I feel sick to my stomach. I don’t know what to do because I know this is completely and totally my fault. That message is not bad. He hasn’t done anything wrong. The simple notion that he is thinking of him makes me feel so so upset I am shaking so hard I can’t walk. We have had a few conversations about this specific ex that maybe weren’t completely resolved in the past, which could  be part of it, but im just so angry at myself for invading his privacy and ultimately ruining my own day. I don’t know how to just be normal when he gets home.

I am extra torn up about it as we bumped into another ex of his at the shops yesterday. Another on good terms that I have had some uncomfortabiliriea with but also had no resolved conversation about how I was feeling. I’ve never met her. She ran up to him, hugged him asked how he was, while I payed for my things. I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to awkwardly interrupt, but I waited for an introduction. nothing. I didn’t talk about it because im not owed an introduction, but my god it made me feel awkward and unappreciated. How do I stop overthinking and overreacting about things like this. Any help at all would be appreciated, I hate hate hate being as cold and jealous as I feel I just want to be healthy."
401,2,"I often times have difficulty differentiating between platonic and romantic feelings for someone I care for very intensely. I feel like I am becoming a stalker almost and I often picture moments of intimacy with the person which I never know how to feel about. I almost never ""like"" people romantically outside of the context of an FP which makes it even more confusing. DAE experience something similar?"
402,3,"I have been diagnosed with BPD recently, with 8/9 criteria fulfilled on DSM-5 scale.
I am currently 19, doing MBBS from Delhi. But I am stuck in a serious problem. One day I want to become a doctor, another day a judge, another day a civil servant, another day a forensic expert etc etc. And all with the same conviction. I'm confused what I will end up with post my graduation. And if I will keep changing careers like this, how will I survive in this world.
Do you all also face this difficulty?
Any solution for this?"
403,0,"Hey all, got a question for ya. 

Do you sometimes feel music? By that I mean sometimes it hits so much harder and resonates right down to your soul. I'm listening to one of my favourite songs today and it's rocking me straight down to the soul. I know with BPD we can feel some things intensely, I just didn't think music was one of those things. 

So, does this happen to you? "
404,2,Im getting so tired of this disorder or illness or whatever but anytime something good happens with my bf or basically FP im happy and shit but then a few hours later I’m like “but what if-“ and those intrusive thoughts won’t stop no matter how much confirmation I get that he won’t leave it keeps on coming back like a fucking fly and it always and never fails to make me upset in the end I don’t know what to do anymore because the thoughts always win it’s like I’m not allowed to feel secure in my relationship or anything even happy 
405,2,"i’m high so if any of this is offensive i am sorry. 

i have bpd, and i feel like a lot of the characteristics of bpd are pretty similar to anxious attachment. i feel like i definitely at least used to have anxious attachment, but now im EXTREMELY avoidant. like as soon as someone likes me back, it makes me sick and i just lose all emotion for them. or i can last in a “situationship” for a few months before things get too serious and every part of me shuts off. still extreme, but it seems like in the opposite way. 

anyone else struggle with this? "
406,2,"For context: I’m definitely a shy person and withdrawn from being social with others. Props to you, years long of untreated BPD.

And I feel like my work colleagues confuse my shy personality with me feeling uncomfortable and I still spiral even with my meds.

Should I tell them? Idk.

Also since I knew my boss before my diagnosis, I think I should throw in the BPD part. He’s very supportive and I feel like it’s good to have a sound basis to work on, so he doesn’t get the idea I feel uncomfortable around him.

Its just I the typical spiraling out of control and I think this can help it since I can’t avoid them like I usually do.

Does my problem make sense? Idk.

In other words, should I address my problems with the people i spend 8h a day with? And if so, how should I start the conversation?"
407,2,"Relationships are hard. And I feel like every time I find someone I ""like"", I ruin it somehow. I've researched about how BPD can affect relationships, initially feeling like I correlate love and attraction to obsession. I always make sure to disclose that I have BPD among other issues to anyone who shows a mutual interest in me, but these days it seems like social media has basically romanticized mental health issues, so it's hard to tell whether the person I'm talking to genuinely understands or sexualizes the disorder. 

I'm talking to someone right now, and they've told me that they ""only want me"", and reassured that I'm the only one they're after. I can understand jealousy is a common theme in relationships, but for some reason it seems I take it to a whole new level. I constantly check all their socials, I hang on their every word, my emotions are heavily impacted by the little things they do or say. One moment I feel such a strong attachment to them, but as soon as they do something to give me even the slightest bit of doubt, or even if I misinterpret something they said, I switch up completely. I almost feel a sense of disgust and hatred towards them. But that passes too, it feels like a never ending cycle. How can I be so utterly infatuated with someone one moment, just to feel like I want nothing to do with them the next? 

I can tell I have obvious abandonment and trust issues, but I always thought it was normal to feel the way I was. I couldn't comprehend that other people didn't take relationships as seriously as I did, and that really hit me in the face when I got cheated on previously. The worst part is, I took them back after they broke my trust, TWICE. 

It doesn't seem like any of my close friends really understand, and there isn't anyone else I can talk to about all this without them assuming I'm a nutcase or something. But this can't just be me right? "
408,0,Has anyone here with BPD tried K treatments? I've pretty much tried everything when it comes to medicine for symptoms and not much helps and then the things that do either stop working after a while or are harder to be prescribed. I have a lot of unresolved trauma I want to work through and was wondering if anyone has gone this route and weather they recommend it or not and why? 
409,2,"So the situation is I'm a 28F, and hes a 30M. We met through a mutual friend through a group therapy with friends. He just went through a TERRIBLE breakup with a girl who also had BPD. And basically during their last week together, she emotionally and mentally abused the hell out of him to the point that he had a nervous breakdown and wanted to 'check out' early.

Now we just started out as friends through our group therapy. But honestly he is a REALLY great guy. Like we started hanging out outside of group and he helped me get my cardio back up to where I can apply for this job I couldn't pass the fitness test for. He's really smart, has a college degree, hes a hard worker, and during our group therapy sessions I found ubout he sacrificed so much to keep his ex happy only for her to turn on him like that. And at first I was skeptical, but the mutual friend who invited me let me know 'No, hes telling the complete truth, hes not just a bitter ex, we sadly saw it all happen, and its why we had to find her a new place to live because we were all angry at her for what she did.'

Like he legit was ready to transfer his education benefits from the military over to his ex so she could go back to school, and its like 'Woah....this guy is so sweet.'

Ive been trying to drop hints that I'm starting to see him as 'more' than a friend. But honestly the problem is I also don't want to take advantage of him.

He admitted that his therapist has also diagnosed him with BPD, and hes scared of getting close to anyone because 'What if I hurt someone the way she hurt me?' 

Even though apparently hes what people call a 'quiet' BPD? Where as all the anger and mood swings he should feel and devalue other people, he just does it to himself. Which isn't good, but we've known each other for months and he has been nothing but kind and sweet to me. 

Should I just try and ask him out? Or should I give him space?"
410,3,"i know the answer to this is gonna seem ridiculously obvious but i just kinda wanna know what you guys would do in this situation. 

so, my bf (?) and i had an argument the other night. we got back to his house after having a few drinks w some friends and his roommate accidentally locked him out. it’s hard to explain exactly how but essentially he locked it from the inside in a way that you cannot unlock from the outside. it was the only door we could come in from. it was almost 3 am and it was 4 degrees outside, his roommate was asleep. it was fucking freezing. well, as soon as my bf realises this, he tells me to go home, and that he will just sleep outside on the couch they have on their back patio. i find this insanely ridiculous, and give him several solutions. a) to call his roommate to wake him up and let us in. b) come back to mine w me and sleep on my couch in my warm house ( i live w my parents who usually don’t like sleepovers but would have been fine given the situation) . or c) go back to our friends house and sleep there since he offered us a place to sleep if we needed anyway. he refused ALL the options, and started to get extremely frustrated with me as i kept begging him to not sleep in 4 degree weather. he was just getting over being sick, i didn’t want it to get worse. the more i pushed, the more frustrated he got. he started calling me insufferable and implied that i was dumb all because i wouldn’t leave. i still didn’t leave, so in an attempt to get me to he said “we’re done” and walked away. he broke up with me. 

the next day, i had to pick up my stuff from his house, including my car. so we spoke, and he said that he didn’t actually mean that. he didn’t want to break up with me, he just wanted me to leave him alone and he didn’t know how else to get me to go since i kept pushing my case. while i understand how frustrating i can be, and somewhat relentless when i have a point, i don’t think i deserved any of this. we’ve been speaking, it’s been weird. he still wants to be with me, but i’ve left it to him to fix everything and told him he has to ask me to be his gf again if he wants that. 

i know he will soon. i just don’t know if i should say yes or no. i love him, he’s my best friend, my favourite person, he has been for 4 years. i don’t want him gone. but this hurts. what would u do? i fear my attachment to him is making it hard for me to decide (pls dont bully me for being silly lol)

411,1,A girl who I like (pwBPD) isn't currently sounding so well. (Unfortunately I am not close and don't live near her) Sounds down and depressed the past week and half and I know with BPD can be very low mood it just sounds more lower mood than usual though. Is there a good way to ask what's making her feel down or a good way to ask how she is. It's has been since mostly I last met with her and she still lives with her ex and I don't think he is been too good around her but I can't fully know either. Thanks
412,2,"Why is my first instinct to run away when presented with a problem. I know part of it is the fear of getting hurt, but if I know consciously I can trust the people around me to get me through this, why does my brain still tell me its better to run away when things get hard? Am I wrong for desiring a space where I can express my needs without feeling like a monster? Am I selfish for feeling the need to hide and run from the people who love me when im scared I might hurt them? 

Ive heard some of the biological explanations, but I would also just like to hear some other voices who go through this kind of struggle. "
413,1,He said he’d always be there through everything and he’s not. He wants to divorce me because of my mental health and my depressive episodes. This last depression lasted around 2 years after psychosis. It’s the longest it’s ever been. I get it’s a lot to handle but he promised me we’d always be ok. How do I even start to deal with this? I’m truly broken right now.
414,0,"In 26 years of my life I fell in love twice and had a serious infactuation once. 

- Infactuation lasted 3 years
- First love lasted 8 years (it took me 8yrs to move on)
- And now I'm still in love with my since 5 years. 


But in all cases I fell in love in days! Under a week.

Do you experience falling for someone quick & fast? Like in 7 days. 

But moving on from them take you 7-8 years?
 "
415,2,"I know mindfulness tries to deal with that. Look at the facts at hand of what has happened and not false info impulses to worry.

But the issue is that I struggle a lot with that. I always imagine the worst case scenario. Because in my head I’m having my guard up so that I will be ready. 

Say you’re at work and your boss says hey can we get on zoom randomly in the middle of the day for reasons you can’t think of.

You might begin to be anxious or think I’m getting fired. Mindfulness will tell you not to do that.

But then at the same time for me if I DON’T do that and it is the worst case scenario I feel even worse. And it always feels like a dopamine rush and relief when it turns out to be far less bad than i thought it is.

To me it feels far worse to be optimistic or not worry about things and then experience the worst case scenario then to have your guard up and take the blow. "
416,3,"It's not even been a month since I was diagnosed, had a huge breakdown and successfully brought myself into a positive healing space thanks to reconnecting with what I've learnt in DBT so far.

Now I feel like I've been hit by a train that I'd only managed to delay.

The person I've been seeing for years barely talks to me and can't give me any clarification so I'm assuming it's over, still being ignored when I'm trying to at least be a supportive friend and I can't stop thinking it was all a lie this whole time and they're seeing someone else and just don't have the stones to tell me. My best friend overdosed today and I had to pathetically call for help when I was told not to and I feel tremendously guilty that I've saved her but not as much as she needed saving. I've already become distanced from any other friends, I've tried to reconnect and slowly start getting ignored for longer. My dad's talking more about what'll happen when he dies. My only rock in all of this is my partner who's also feeling the isolation really badly and despite how strong we are, with the way everything else is going lately I'm scared eventually I might not be enough. And if I end up alone I'm as good as dead for many reasons.

I feel like I've been doing everything right to the best of my abilities. I've handled the splitting before it reached anyone else, redirected my energy to self-nourishment, focused on active self care instead of dissociation and distractions, kept up with my meds, made time for people, and I just end up with more and more holes in my heart as life crumbles between my fingers. I'm back in childhood where every foundation threatened to collapse at any moment and no matter how much I try to pursue health I can't outrun this stupid fate. I don't know how to live in this constant shadow of loss."
417,2,"What are your best tips for dealing with jealousy? For me as I’m sure many of you can relate to, my jealousy is heavily linked to the fear of being abandoned more than anything. Insecurities ofc contribute but more than anything I’m terrified that every other person is better than me and that I’ll be replaced. So sick of feeling like I’m going to implode from anxiety when something triggers my jealousy, probably one of the things I hate most about this disorder as it has caused the most dysfunction in relationships."
418,1,"Time passes by, year after year. I feel so far away. Minutes turn to hours and hours turn to days. I want this feeling to stop. I want to feel okay.

Looking back on the past, all the time I wasted. Death is what I long for, some days I can taste it.

Looking back on memories, I don't want to loose a thing. Can you see it in my eyes? I've been distant. I can't tell if this is the beginning or the end. I know I haven't been myself. I'll admit it. Rend.

You were my light when it was too dark to see. I see you in my dreams. I could stare into your eyes and I see my future gleam. A moment with you was a moment of peace. Without you, it's piece after piece. I tear myself apart. The voices, they get so vicious. It feels like I'm rippin' stitches. You were my sanity. You are my heart.

I'm staring at the ceiling. I can't shake this feeling. Jaded. Everything is faded. The walls are closing in. Agitation becomes frustration. Air becomes thin.

I pick up the knife and slice once, twice, thrice. I'm gone, gone and going. Going, going and gone. I lay on the floor crying, bleeding, panicked. You're behind the door crying, starving, manic.

Chimeric.

Breathe in and breathe out. That's what I tell myself. Doubt. There's hope in my mind, but the fire is drowning inside.

I'm cut up into pieces, looking for a reason. I can't stop the bleeding. I'm looking for a meaning. Throw me a line. I can't do this on my own. I spend every waking night disconnected. Alone.

All I ever wanted was to find someone. Holding it together is the hardest part. Holding you was the best part of me. When we spoke, words didn't do it justice. We are apart, but my love remains."
419,3,"This is what I do as someone who is trying to recover but is NOT in therapy, and has no resources available to them. I’m 18f and am engaged to my fiancée. I’ll be honest I’m not really looking for advice, I’m mostly trying to document my progress.
I was diagnosed with BPD TRAITS at about 16, my grandma has bpd as well and she has given me some advice but it is more or less just venting sessions (on my side) 

I don’t really talk to anyone else so it’s just my fiancée I split on. He has an extremely bad habit of triggering me further (I know that sounds accusatory, what I mean is that I’ve set clear boundaries on what triggers me more and tried to help him understand me better) if he does trigger me more while splitting I tell him to stop. Stop what he’s saying, and make it clear to him that this is making me split worse and I need a moment. I take a moment to clear my head, wipe my tears and (if possible) I explain why exactly what he said triggered me more. 

I never apologize until I’m sure that I’m okay. I want to make sure I’m calm and I’m not going to lash out again, 2 seconds after apologizing to him. So once I’m calm, and we’ve talked through our issues I tell him how unbelievably sorry I am. I always always always apologize in as much detail as possible bc 99% of the time I know exactly what I said and why it was wrong. My issue is just preventing it from escalating to that point. We always make sure we’re okay after a fight. He or I will ask ‘are we okay’ or ‘can we be okay’ and rarely do one of us say no. It’s helped me with my need for reassurance. After fights I beat myself up about the things I’ve said. 



I do wanna detour a bit and just talk about how much better I have been doing. I still split, I still say nasty things but I’ve gotten so so so much better at controlling my volume which I think has made a big impact. I used to scream, like screammm at him to the point my grandparents got upset with me cuz I was too loud. Now I’m able to control my volume. It’s just a matter of controlling the words. I also want to go back to what I said about my fiancée triggering me more, he has started to understand me more, and gotten better at controlling himself in these heightened situations as well. He knows what to say to calm me down and does it very well usually. He is very patient with me and I’m so grateful for him. He knows how much of a struggle this is for me and he does his best to support me and I try to show him how much I appreciate him. "
420,1,"if i'm irrationally angry with someone, then i usually just have to wait a few minutes and it fades away. but the problem is, it's exactly the same for RATIONAL anger. someone i care about can do something genuinely awful and abusive to me, and i'll feel this intense rage. i'll leave the room to stop crying, but i'll try to hold onto that anger, so i can have the strength to hold them accountable for what they did. then something distracts me, and suddenly the rage is just completely gone. suddenly i don't care what they did. i love them again, and they're perfect. i still know i should put my foot down and make them understand that it wasn't okay. i want to tell them i'll leave if they continue acting like this. but i just can't. it's like the horrible thing they did never even happened. i know logically that i should feel betrayed or violated or hurt, but i don't. i just want them to love me"
421,3,"Hi all, I've lurked for a long time, suffering with BPD for most of my life.

I (30F) got with my ex (34F) back in January and things were great, but we moved fast due to my circumstances. I moved in with her and we were happy living together until a week or two ago when she dropped the bombshell on me that she was moving. Add into the mix that she is severely autistic, and I was struggling with a stressful job that was making me miserable.

I panicked upon wanting to hand in my notice, and unfairly unloaded a tonne of questions over messages on her, and she panicked and told me to move back to my mums place. She helped me move my stuff out of the old place and then we cut contact for a few days, after which she sent a message saying she wished to be just friends.

Today, I spoke to her again and got a lot off my chest while I'm numb enough to communicate rationally, and she confessed that she lost feelings right after I sent the texts. We used to cuddle in bed, she'd wake up early just to say goodbye to me before work and tell me she loves me, and we were a really touchy-feely couple.

I'm so scared. I've lost one of the loves of my life because of this and the British health care system have said time and time again they can't help me. I feel like I'm falling apart and I don't know what to do."
422,0,"Hello everyone,

(31 M) Been going through it recently and am in need of people who understand what it's like to go through this. Are there any online support Groups or Chats for people with BPD? Is stating a whatsapp chat a viable option? It can be co-ed or for men, whichever is best. "
423,1,"It sucks when they're your favorite person but you're not there's. 

It sucks when you make them a priority in every facet of your life, making sure to think of them before making decisions, but they just do whatever they want without a single thought of you. 

It sucks when you have to wait on them all day because you have plans, but they don't communicate that things will run late so you spend the entire day doing nothing.

It sucks when they seem to decide when you spend time together and it's never when you want to do things. 

It sucks when you've been swallowing your feelings, splitting alone, dissociating, etc without telling them because they make you feel bad for having emotions and reactions based on their actions. Actions they know trigger you.

It sucks that everything revolves around them for you. But it's not reciprocated. So you end up being a side character in your own life since your life doesn't change or move without them. 

But you couldn't imagine a single day without them so you suffer instead 🥲"
424,1,"Ok so ive struggled with relationships soooo much. Ive been with my fiance for almost 3 years now and I know I can trust them. Most every relationship ive been in has ended with them cheating or abusing me in some sort so I dont do relationships well. 

Today they got a handmade shaw from a regular at their work and it made them so happy. I feel crazy because I feel jealous and horrible about it. Now I cant stop thinking about this random person thinking they like them and that im not doing enough. Ive been hella depressed and struggling and I feel like im not doing enough. 

I hate this. I know my feelings arent right, this ones a good one but omg I feel like the worst person. I dont know how to contain my feelings or even share them because its so stupid and crazy to me but it wont stop."
425,1,"For some background; I broke up with my ex bf nearly a year ago. I feel that I’ve healed completely from this, and have talked to two different people between now and then. Both didn’t end up working out, and now I don’t have any potential romantic relationships in my life. I currently live alone, and although I have a couple of close friends who I try to see often, I feel desperately lonely. I constantly think about how I don’t have “my” person in my life. I know that my closest friends have other people in their lives who they are much closer with. Since everyone can’t be with me constantly, I spend a lot of my time alone thinking about this. I wonder if I’ll ever find the person for me, if I’ll ever be good enough. I also desperately yearn to have someone in my life romantically. It’s all I can think about, and it’s starting to send me into a depressive spiral. Things have been going to well for me, and I’m terrified of hitting rock bottom again. I feel myself getting worse over time and don’t know what to do or what will help. I try to fill my time with coping skills, hobbies, friends, and family, and yet it doesn’t seem to help fill the emptiness inside of me. Could really use any words of advice or support. Thank you for taking the time to read. "
426,0,"I know a lot of us have moments where we split on others, and then usually feel intense rage. I found a way that helps me to prevent damaging relationships, calm myself down, and de-escalate my anger.

I write a “rage letter”. It may sound silly, but hear me out.
Once I isolate from the person I’m splitting on and communicate that I need space, I go to an environment where I am alone. Then, I grab any piece of paper I can, usually from a lined notebook. I get a pen, and write “Dear _____” (person im splitting on). Then I just start writing everything I want to say to that person, holding nothing back. All the diabolical, mean things I want to say, I write in the letter. Everything I’m upset about with them for, I put in there too. 
I usually start to feel relieved once the letter is finished, as there’s nobody yelling back at me to trigger me further, and I got it off my chest. Sometimes once I’m done, I’ll practice “check the facts”, a DBT skill. I basically highlight phrases that stick out to me as maybe untrue, and then ask myself questions & write notes to debunk them. Example: “They are always mean to me and I hate them.” — Do you always feel hate for them or just when escalated? Are they actually always mean to you? How often is it happening?
Once I realize I’m not completely speaking factually and rather emotionally, it calms me down that the emotions will pass and atleast I’m not harming others by saying these things to them.
Next, I will take the rage letter outside and burn it. As it burns to ash, I meditate and imagine the anger leaving my body and as the smoke floats away, I imagine my rage leaving with it. 
*note: if you practice witchcraft, you can also burn herbs with it. You can even hold a crystal in your hand as you meditate while it burns. Then, you can cleanse the environment as well as yourself to close the ritual.

This practice may seem simple but it has truly saved my relationships with others, specifically my partner. I wanted to share in hope maybe one of you could try it out and see if it’s beneficial to you as well. "
427,2,"Hello! I am currently researching BPD because I have read some things that I identified with and may explain some frequent and damaging traits I experience regularly. 

However, as I understand it growing up in an invalidating environment is a core aspect of developing BPD. Thing is, I never had anyone actively deflect, ignore, or criticize my feelings as a child.

I did, however, have an incredibly depressed mother (my primary caregiver for my entire childhood) who spent most of her free time sleeping away her depression in bed. This largely led me to being a very isolated child, woth very few friends, pretty much never seeing friends outside of school, and later, as a teen, keeping all of my feelings ans thoughts bottled up and essentially communicating with no one. I was incredibly isolated socially, and I'm wondering if this fits the bills for an invalidating environment.

Thank you. "
428,2,Have lived with bpd my whole life my partner of 3 years asked me at the start of our relationship what diagnosis I have i explained no forma diagnosisl but  have suspected bpd manic deppression and axiety well turns out I am now coming to terms with the fact I have lived 30 years with bpd unknowing without diagnosis I am just wondering how other people managed after this point I am now currently at.
429,3,"So today a guy [21M] I [18F] matched with on tinder a while back asked if we could hang out after I had mentioned I didn't do hookups, he told me the date and time and gave me his addy 

He said we'll watch a movie, I replied with ""is that code for fucking"" and he said ""no but whatever happens happens""

So tbh Im confused, parts of me knows that he's obviously looking to fuck but my bpd is screaming at me to still go cause at least I'll get attention and compliments and all that 

I've done this shit before where I go meet up guys because I think they genuinely like me and want to hang out but I always end up forcing myself to do sexual stuff with them and I hate it so much :( 

Convince me not to go pls!! "
430,3,"We're long distance, been together for a couple months. She's very strongly into me, an a strongly attached anxious sort of way, where she feels shattered at any indication that I don't love her back. She is quite open that she would let me marry her and then she would move to be with me, if I said the word. She's also quite open about the fact that it makes her extremely upset every time I split on her, and that she'll ghost me if it keeps happening (My splits are acting cold and distant for a while, and feeling unsure of whether or not I want her, I don't get angry at her ever.) 

It's a decent arrangement. She wouldn't have to be super lonely anymore, I wouldn't have to suffer alone either, we get along quite well in person, she has a lot of trouble getting along with new people, I have a list of ailments that make it really difficult for people to want to be with me (cfs, ADHD, bpd). 

That said, this feels like a nightmare arrangement also.

* It's incredibly difficult not to have out of control highs with someone who continuously expresses that she loves me forever.
* It's incredibly difficult to keep abandonment fears in check with someone who I know will actually ghost me if I don't get my shit together emotionally.
* I don't know how I can keep black and white thinking in check inside of a relationship where the difference between feeling good and feeling bad might literally be the difference between having a wife and being alone forever.
* It's very difficult to disguise the splits with someone who is preoccupied with me and who wants to talk for much of the day.
* I can't even tell if I really like her, as I can convince myself anything is true in a crisis where it feels like I might get abandoned, and if I act cold for a while, it creates such a crisis basically every time.

Is this as insanely toxic as it sounds? idk wtf is going on anymore

431,2,"TW mentions of suicide. 

(would also like to clarify that i’m not asking for my behaviour/thought patterns to be excused. i just need help identifying what the fuck is actually going on) 


anyway i can’t say for sure, hence why i’m asking on here, but every time my loved ones leave me (as in. they go back to their own homes) i’m pretty sure i split? sometimes it’s more intense than others, but as soon i’m alone, i quickly descend into heartbreak, resentment, loneliness, anxiety and this defiant, shipwrecked feeling. as if i’ve been left behind and forgotten about and i’m so, so cross about it. 

you know that scene from rocketman where elton john says “for my next trick, i’m going to fucking kill myself” and then jumps, delirious, in the pool? a big part of my brain (which is not in fact suicidal in any way) wants to react like that just so everybody will know how upset i am. i feel marooned and desperate and intensively needy, as if i’m lurching between:

“COME BACK, I LOVE YOU, I NEED YOU, I CAN’T LIVE WITHOUT YOU”

and 

 “HOW COULD YOU LEAVE ME!? i am so hurt and so resentful that i am now going to push you away/give you the cold shoulder so that you feel guilty (even if you can’t logistically come back to me)”

then, when the person does eventually come back, i’ll hurtle back into ‘i love you and i can’t live with you’ mode and generally speaking i can never bring myself to be standoffish or upset for more than ten minutes - half an hour.

soo. is this splitting? my bpd isn’t romantically focused (anymore) and i’m trying to work out if it is now applying myself to my relationships to family members.

i’m not asking for professional diagnoses or anything but if anybody could shed some light (even if it’s just telling me your own experiences) then that’d be great. thanks"
432,1,"As the title says, she wants to help but just stares at me usually. Sometimes she will try to rub my back or pet my head silently. I feel like it makes me feel worse sometimes, cause my episodes can last hours and I feel like I am dragging her into my episode too like she sits there sad too just staring at me. It makes me feel really bad about being sad like she is just going to stare at me until I stop and I am wasting her time. And when she leaves me alone I feel like she abandoned me. I don’t know what I want her to do, I don’t know what would cheer me up but I don’t want it to keep being like this. I want her comfort but I don’t like it like this help :( "
433,1,"A realization. No matter how much I grow, how much I learn, I keep circling back to the same place. I start out so sure, so full of hope and intention. And then without fail I spiral. I second guess everything. I retreat. I swing from wanting deep connection to pushing it away like it’s fire. It’s not fair to me, and it’s definitely not fair to whoever is on the other side of my bullshit. 

It feels like I’m only truly built for friendship and honestly I think I’m okay with that. I can be a hell of a friend but I’m not a good partner. I can show up there. I can be dependable, supportive, funny, present..everything that makes a friend solid. 

But in relationships, that stability slips. My symptoms show up full force in relationships. I become unsure, inconsistent. One day I want closeness, the next I feel smothered. One minute I want reassurance, the next I’m pulling away because it’s too much. And I hate that.



I hate that this pattern keeps creeping into my present regardless of the years of work I’ve  put in. So I think it’s time to reevaluate the relationships i create with others.

I’ll always be half ready, almost there, working on it. And I’ll keep losing good people because I haven’t figured out how to let someone love me without drowning in it.


So yeah, honestly maybe I’m just better as a friend overall with anyone, ever. Which I’m okay with. That’s where I can be consistent, kind, and real without the pressure that relationships bring out of me. Without the emotional chaos I haven’t learned how to tame. I don’t think I’ll ever change in that aspect. And I mean it’s okay. I’m a great friend and love being there for people.

But relationships are too much for me. I can’t commit to one. I’m so back and forth with my splitting. 

But TLDR: I don’t think I need to pursue anything with anyone ever outside of friendships. I can show up as a friend but my symptoms are unbearable in relationships."
434,2,"I am SO not okay. And haven’t been for weeks. 

Before advice rolls in:
• no money for therapy 
• no money for different (non physically ill making meds)
• no family 
• no community— besides literally Reddit
• no job opportunities in my field 
• not healthy enough to work much 


I went to protests this weekend because genuinely it’s the only thing that makes me feel proud, productive, and whole. I love activism. Then after putting myself through literal hell to travel and get there, to protest (which was AMAZING and just uplifting as hell), now on my way back home…. Just to find out that the group I protested with is somehow a bad group. They have alternative beliefs on how our country could run — which same - and they give like light-culty vibes but I also come from the mindset of as long as we all have a common goal then I don’t see a problem. 


Then the other activist groups - who refused to be in attendance at all today (in this area) - tell me that the group I met today is bad. They are “not friendly” and by “not friendly” — the other groups just hate them. It’s not mutual at all. 

So… now I’m spiraling. Losing sense of self. Feeling very very very dissociated like… idk what to do anymore. I’m so tired I just wanted to stand up for what I believe in but it’s still so fucking hard to even do that right!! 

I’m 3 days without weed and not by choice. I’m fucking losing it. Like fully and truly losing it. 

So here I am on a bus home. Finding out I can’t do anything right… and unable to sleep. Move. Speak. And NOW there’s a lady in front of me clearing her throat like every other second for the last 25 mins 

I’m loooosing it "
435,1,"It’s so exhausting to feel this unbearable emptiness all the time. This constant void, this feeling that I’m always disposable, always a burden in everyone’s life... Sometimes I just wish I could 'switch minds' with someone else, like everything — the world, life itself — would be a thousand times better if I simply didn’t exist.

Sometimes I say I’m fine, and for a moment I almost feel like I am — like I’m getting used to it. But then a single word, a look, a feeling... and everything collapses again. It’s like my mind hates me, like I’m destined to always feel this way.

But like Taylor Swift said: 'I’m a real tough kid, I can handle my shit.'"
436,2,"Just got told by my ex she slept with someone, said I should know, even though she told me she never could again and accused me of seeking out women. Between the false accusations and just hearing that, I'm really trying not to lose my shit. I have so much to say but I don't want to lash out. I hate the feeling inside."
437,3,"Going through a breakup after a betrayal and still losing my mind 3 months later. It’s getting better and some days I’m actually doing well and now that we don’t have any contact whatsoever and I have no reminders of them I don’t get so trapped in the past. 

My issue now is 1. I feel different and stronger than I was pre this 2.5 year relationship and I’ve worked on my BPD A LOT. But I also feel like I’ve kind of reverted in some ways. Especially since it was a betrayal and trying to manage my emotions in not reacting how I want to. It feels like the worst kind of abandonment. Like I thought someone was choosing me but they were repeatedly choosing to abandon me and my love behind my back the whole time. It feels like I never really had the love and I feel so upset for past me because I was sooooooo in love and I thought they were genuine. I’m trying not to feel completely hopeless and feed the thoughts that are trying to “prove a point” that people are always going to end up hurting me or that good things don’t last for me and there’s always a catch. It’s the first time I’ve managed to actually let myself trust a partner and the longest I’ve managed to stay with someone past a couple months. Unfortunately chose the wrong person to finally be myself with. It’s like the pain has now spread past this person and everything just hurts. 

2. I realise that they were a very good suppressor for me and my BPD. I mean I could still get quite bad and especially in the winter I am pretty much always depressed but things did seem a bit less intense internally because I always had them to vent to and distract me. I don’t feel too comfortable venting everything with anyone but I am trying to share a bit more with other people but it just doesn’t feel as comfortable and then I miss him. And everyone is so busy, it’s so great when I can see my friends and people make time outside of work but it’s not often and so I’m alone most of the time. I work from home, mainly because of my BPD. It makes working a lot easier to manage and I can regulate and cope better if I’m not in the best space normally but right now it adds to the overwhelming feeling of being lonely and BORED. 

3. My boredom is one of my biggest triggers and I hate being back in this space. I’m trying to use my skills but it makes it so hard. I want to do reckless things more, sex, spend spend spend, SH, drink a lot more often… Ive always had the boredom but when he was around I could at least tell myself wait and someone’s coming and we can watch a movie together or something and I’d make it an event in my head. Something to look forward to even if we weren’t really doing much or anything new. But now, I’m trying to save up so I can’t just go out to eat or take myself on cute little shopping dates like I was a few weeks ago and I’m going insane. I feel so depressed. I want to see my friends but they’re busy most of the time, I want to take myself on a date but I don’t want to spend the money, I go on dates and then feel bad because I have a good time and I still feel like I owe my ex something and this nasty voice in my head tells me I must’ve not loved him then but I know that’s obviously not true. It’s like everything feels like it’s bad because it makes me feel emotional or worse or it’s bad because I feel good and I’m not supposed to or I feel like I don’t deserve it idk. I spend most days just with myself not doing much but working and eating and lying in bed and trying to go to the gym a couple days a week. 

Idk I feel like people think I’m doing well because I’m not constantly in tears anymore and tbf the first couple weeks after I wasn’t moving at all or eating or sleeping so in comparison I am doing great. I am happy I’m working again and exercising and that I do see people when I can but it’s like if I’m not at work, in the gym or on a date/seeing people, it’s like I’m just waiting. I find everything so boring but the things that excite me cost money that I’m not able to spend for the next few months. How do I get through this long period of still grieving but not having much access to fun or are there other things I can do by myself to feel less dead inside? It’ll also help with the compulsive drinking because although I don’t drink loads, I do it too often because I’m bored"
438,1,"This isn’t something I would usually do especially now that I feel like I shouldn’t tell people how I feel. It’s been a few years since I’ve been diagnosed with bpd and it wasn’t until I stopped dating that my problems started affecting other relationships in my life. Before it was mostly solely towards my romantic relationships and while it still affected my other close friendships, it wasn’t enough to notice a change. Maybe it was because I was so hyper focused on the person I was dating, that my brain didn’t react to the problems of other relationships as much. But now that I’ve tried to heal and not be with anyone, it’s gotten worse. I’ve lost so many close friendships that I thought i couldn’t and I even find it hard to connect with new people without automatically assuming it’s gonna end and driving them away with my pessimistic outlook. I think now I truly understand the dynamic that plays into one’s life when it comes to having bpd. I think for me now more than I ever, I crave being understood. I catching myself romanticizing past toxic relationships/fps, wishing I can go back to them. Even though I know I wasn’t exactly understood, it felt better than being alone. The constant triggers given by one person masked the fact that I needed more relationships to be okay in life. Idk it’s just something I’ve been thinking about and idk if it’s a vent or more of a question. "
439,3,"I tend to just detach when things get too stressful. But is it related with bpd (like all or nothing) to detach completely? Not empty , just like wtf it all disappeared.  When i broke up i cried passionately and took it off after going home. or when something gets too unbearable that i cry 24/7 suddenly i just snap into reality and step back. As if it was all just some kinda past memories like changing tv channel or quitting a game when i realized that actually didn’t matter that much"
440,0,"This is purely hypothetical and I would certainly hope if this did happen this is done humanely with people who have unfortunately been in accidents. 

If you lost your memory, since Bpd is (most certainly not entirely and can 100% be genetic) to a degree something that is effected by environmental factors, triggers, childhood trauma and experiences, would you still have Bpd? 

I could imagine you’d end up with cases  perhaps where they don’t remember why but they are upset by things or respond certain ways. But could there be a case where they were kinda just a blank slate? 
Going off the idea if they were a blank slate, over time might they piece things together and end up back to where they were? 

Sorry I don’t know if this is dark or not I think it’s an interesting idea, though I’m not having a great night (I’m ok truly) I just get to thinking about these complex things sometimes "
441,1,"This probably will get taken down but fuck it, I've been struggling lately. ex pwBPD and I went through the trenches together, stuck with her through multiple attempts, her getting diagnosed with BPD, we professed our love to each other more openly than I ever have in my life (and that's saying a lot). I held her hand through the valley of death, and then we both just leave each other in the cold. Shit is tragic. It's honestly the second most heartbreaking thing I've dealt with in life since her attempt. I can't even show it to anyone because they're so tired of hearing about it, but I'm still devastated. I put my whole life on hold because I cared more about her being alive than I did about myself and I don't even deserve closure? a fucking goodbye? Being locked in a stalemate with the person you're in love with is the shittiest feeling in the world, pure agony. I wish she could see that I'm not her trigger, that shame is, and that's why she runs from vulnerability and accountability. That all she's ever had to do is say sorry and mean it, and I would have too. Instead I just sit here waiting like an idiot for her to say something, anything, anything with a heartbeat. Meanwhile she just dates and moves on like I'm a ghost. Been going through it over this with a dagger in my chest, finally up the courage to send her one loving goodbye, to just find out she's got some new guy. Ouch. Only the universe knows why I still hold a torch for this girl, because logic overwhelmingly dictates I do the opposite. After seeing that, naively, think I may have another fighting chance at letting go, then a friend sends me some recently developed polaroid from 2 year prior, it's of us and a guy we met after a big concert in town, probably one of our best memories together; Ouch again, fun times. Takes a lot not to send it to her, like why do I have to be the one to shoulder seeing that alone?

I wish I could tell her I'm sorry for everything that happened, that I still think about her, and that I wanted to marry her too.

I know one day this pain will go away, but today is not that day."
442,1,"Not sure what tag to put this as so i’m just going with general. 
I just had my appointment with my psychiatrist and to sum it up, he basically said I’m gonna die of su*cide. That was pretty hard to take it not gonna lie. I am spiralling. Our appointment was supposed to be from 12pm - 5pm and it’s always been supposed to be that long. But i always wondered why our appointment never lasted longer. It doesn’t even hit the 1 hour mark. This one lasted even less than 5 minutes. I’m being treated so shitty just because i’m borderline and i hate it. I hate that i have this. "
443,2,When I overdose I usually get scared in case I do actually die form it especially when I end up on a bad way on oxygen etc. does this make me attention seeking as it seems like a lot of people who do overdose don’t get scared 
444,1,"Im 15f and last year I was dating a guy who (long-story-short) ended up raping me in my sleep. After a few months, he broke up with me aswell and said it was because I was too crazy and all of his friends said that I was a lying manipulative bitch. I spent months trying to get him back, I promised that I’d figure out what was wrong with me, but then he told me that I was disgusting to date. 

However, I feel like that’s true. I rely on my partner because I don’t have any friends and my family basically shun me, and I’m always depressed. He told me I was masochistic since I asked him to purposely physically abuse me like my parents do. I’m not sure why I did that, but I thought it would feel nice coming from him. I was insane, jealous, and lazy. He even told me once that I was terrifying to date because of the amount of times I’d mention wanting to kill myself. But I was just comfortable with him and I wanted him to know what was going on in my head. 

If I date again I wanted them to love me. How can I make them do that? I don’t want to scare them. I’m a nice girl, I just have some problems. But that doesn’t define me. 

(Btw I found out about my disorder after the breakup. I am doing talking therapy, but I am not medicated because my parents won’t consent.)

445,0,"Hi
I am 23 M diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder for about over 2 years. I haven't met anyone in my society

There is just one thing, my best friend isn't happy as I am. I do talk so much about this, already planning what we do and he is so like ""oh today it's so hot, sorry that I can't show such a reaction"" and it hurts.
I know he is happy living with me but I am sad he doesn't show it right after such a huge thing.
"
447,2,"My friend sent messages to her boyfriend the past two days and each time he opened the message but didn't respond. She went from happy two days ago to despondent right now.

She realizes, on some level, that her mind is being irrational. She mentioned to me she was like an animal without ""object permanence."" The animal forgets that objects not seen still exist. She said it was like this way for her and love.

She also stated that she thinks her boyfriend hates her, she doesn't want to bother me, her friend anymore, because she sees herself as a burden, and she says she hates everybody now (which I know is not true because she doesn't hate me, obviously).

She is getting therapy right now but does not see her therapist very often.

What advice would you give her to how to approach her boyfriend? How can she deal with the fact that he doesn't respond to her every day, because sometimes he is busy?

Thank you in advance for all your help!"
448,3,"i put “political” in quotes bc im aware the state of politics has become about human rights. i am 100% against the way the world is headed, for Palestine, Ukraine, Women, Trans people, etc, you get the point. But i really struggle to engage in conversations about it, more so being in protest environments. i feel like im being a part of the problem by not speaking out. i really believe in making the aggressors uncomfortable but to speak on it literally consumes me. I know its not a comfortable topic, nor should it be, but I just can’t take the mental load (spiralling, depression episodes etc comes very quickly after a single conversation or researching it) I feel terrible about it because there are people who can’t choose to not talk about it because they are living it. I don’t know how to help or be apart of the help, without hurting myself. I don’t want my effect on people to be a negative 

edit: i put this in this sub in hopes someone else with bpd has experienced this and has found a way to cope "
449,2,"so me and my bf see each other 4 days a week with one sleep over. we had a sleep over last night and the plan was to go fishing after i finished work, we had this planned for a few days now. my boyfriend also had dnd planned with some co workers for a few weeks now which he thought started at 7pm, so he picks me up from work and we start our drive to the lake (about 45 minutes) 20 minutes in we stop for gas (around 1pm) and he checks his phone and realized he forgot that dnd was switched to 1pm, so we start driving back so he can still go to dnd and he apologized multiple times and said we’ll go next weekend or the weekend after that but this has triggered me because i feel like he chose them over me, he also couldn’t do it tomorrow because he has prior commitments with his friends who he can only really talk to on the weekends since they live in a different time zone. however he did the the time after dnd tn to bring me out to my favourite cafe to get some dessert and then drove me home and apologized again. did he do anything wrong?"
450,2,"I'm dating a guy but he doesn't know that I'm diagnosed with BPD should I tell him or leave it like this?
I think If he knows that I'm diagnosed with BPD he will leave me or he'd think that I'm crazy. What should I do has someone go through anything like this?"
451,0,"bpd doesn’t automatically make someone a bad person; it’s what that person decides to do about the disorder that can make them a bad person. 

people 100% use this disorder as an excuse to be abusive, but i don’t believe bpd is necessarily the reason why, not with every person at least. they are just a bad person, with or without the disorder. (please share your thoughts on this)

please consider this when you’re feeling down or guilty about having bpd. you aren’t doomed. you don’t have to be apart of the stereotype. it doesn’t have to control your life if you don’t let it. 

even when it feels impossible or like you’re regressing in the healing process, keep going. you can’t become the person you want to be if you don’t try. i believe in every one of you and you are not alone. "
452,0,Am I the only person with BPD who whenever something happens that causes a knee jerk reaction to being upset that asks themselves  “Am I tweaking?”like hearing something that can come off rude or passive aggressive. I always noticed that it helps me stay in reality and not let my BPD jerk the steering wheel. 
453,1,"I've always suffered from intense feelings of loneliness and void. At the same time, I've always tried my best to make and keep connections, especially with friends. Since I've decided to not pursue romantic relationships anymore, I've invested everything in friends: I met new people, expand and frequent different groups in different setting, I've played respect and attention to all my older beloved friends. Of course, a lot of time my mood swings ruined and led to discussions, arguments, fractures. I am not a saint, I'm understanding that everyone have their own feelings and issues, I'm trying to be there for them and to support them putting aside- when I can- my own difficult emotions. 

Like I've said, I'm not perfect, but I try hard to be the best friend as I can be. I propose to hang out, I call people when they need me etc...but often enough these friends (ALMOST EVERY ONE) let me down. They cancel a meeting for example, they exclude me from some activities, they judge my emotions harshly etc .. and in general I'm feeling more alone than ever and this makes me want to die, to disappear also to vengeance myself. 

Maybe you would not understand me from this post, and you would think I'm somewhat extreme or that I ask too much, but I truly believe that I ask for the bare minimun. I feel that my problem is also deeply rooted in nowadays society when in general non romantic relationships aren't valued as much. 

I would like to text all of my friends telling them this, that I love them and they are one of the main reason I keep going on with life, but they will probably read it as manipulative or like I'm blaming them for my sadness. This is not my intention! I just would like them to know that I'm hurting as hell, and I care so much, and I would like them to be closer to me but I'm afraid that asking I would scare them.

If even friends let me down, I don't have any hope "
454,3,"hi, i just made a new account so the one friend i have on my main wont see this. unnecessary, but i feel like it. im only 16 so i cant be officially diagnosed with bpd, at least not where i live. im not saying its confirmed i have it, but my therapist told me and my dad that i fit all the criteria and she thinks its more than likely. because of everything ive seen, you know, everyone who says people with bpd are all terrible and abusive, i didnt want to relate. once i started looking into symptoms and tendencies of bpd havers i realized that my entire life is being explained by a brief google search and now i just dont know what to do with myself. my dad is making things so much harder on me when im trying to get better and heal and i cant have a real diagnosis(i have a referral and will be seeing a psychiatrist soon, but i need to be 18 before they can diagnose a personality disorder)
in the middle of writing this my dad walked in to tell me ""people with depression dont act like this""(because i still take time to look pretty, god forbid) and that i will be facing consequences like losing my right to privacy and wifi if i dont get it together and that hes tried everything with me but i have no idea how to control myself and my emotions and inability to do fucking anything normally ever, im failing my classes and i literally live in garbage if my dad doesnt say anything for long enough

tldr: im losing my fucking mind please tell me it gets better(without medication) or some general advice on what to do with myself im new"

I got into an argument with my mum and unknowingly to me her partner has filmed it from the next room, i haven’t seen the video and i don’t want to but my mum has said it’s just me screaming and crying, he’s also posted a pretty nasty caption about me and people in the comments are calling me feral and saying “i deserve a slap” it has over 1000 views. I have tried multiple times to get help since i don’t want this to ruin my life any longer. Was it deserved for him to post the video to shame me or is it wrong to post me in a mental health crisis - I am also 17 and still a minor. 
He is also refusing to take the video down and is claiming he’s posted it “so i can learn” 

Update: i’ve spoke to police and they claim they can’t do anything as it’s not sexual and i’m not nude 

update he’s taken the video down!!! obviously i wish it had never been posted even in the first place and it ate me alive to think there was a video of me in a state like that but at least now it’s no longer there and if anything it’s motivated me even more to be better. it happened it was awful and now it’s up to me to move on from it.

She was my FP but we built a real friendship over 18 months and then she got a boyfriend. It became evident that he was jealous, and she and I got into an argument about it when she said something that hurt. I called her out on it and demanded an apology and she decided to sever the friendship permanently. 

I am devastated. I took the high road and my last message was civil. I told her I’d be there for her if she needed me. I cried and cried but somehow it clicked into place. She has split on me. She just said the most hurtful thing to me that she could have knowing it was going to hurt me. At first I split too. I pictured her as an evil monster and I thought that our friendship was a complete farce since I had spent so much time and emotional energy in it to be treated that way. 

But when I realized she split, I understood that my own thinking in extremes blinded me to reality: she was neither monster nor was she the polished idea of her that I had in my head all along. She’s just a person who loved me in her own way. The friendship was real and valid. It just ended tragically for me. 

I will grieve for a long time. But one day I’ll feel good about this. Everything for a reason. "
462,1,"This is not some bragging. Please, try hear me out.

I am living in quite apartment (2 rooms, bathroom and workshop made in 3rd room), sourranded by expesive stuff, that I can use (my PC, tv, kitchen stuff) or he will help me with it (3d printer, AC). I have small income from alemony plus extra money from my 2 side jobs. He has almost 3x much money as me from his parents, without work. But summed up, we are in very confortable situation financialy and residentially. 

He is very inteligent, smart person. Nice, helpful, always honest. He can do a lot (woodworking, metalworking like welding, 3d projecting and printing, fixing stuff like fridge, AC, tv, PC...). He is about to finish mechatronics study. And adding to all this brain stuff he is also tall, handsome, with nice voice (and smell).

So basicly I could be set for life if I wouldn destroy our relationship being BPD monster towards him for years. Now I am still in good situation, because we still living together, he is kinda trying help me with life (I am living rent-free, all my income goes on groceries and other shopping).

He is at least once a day reminding me that I could be in doorms alone. That if my work laptop would broke, I would probably spend a lot off money in service unnecesary, when now he can fix it this for me for free. That in doorms is hot, tight and here is AC and is very spacious even with mess that I am doing. He reminding me that if I move out, I will be alone and without out cats (and without word about them even if something happen or the will die...).

He is at least once a day telling me that I have super situation that I am not greateful at all. That I have everything even I don't deserve it. That he is amazing, cats are cute, life is easy if I am not making problems from nowhere.

But I just can't be happy. I am not happy. I am smilling, I am enjoying having all this stuff, using some of it. I love our cats. I am attached to him (he telling me that as pwBPD I can't love, that I can't even understand the love), I want him succes with everything, to gain full health and potential, to lose weight and be happy from his life. But I am not happy, just I don't feel it inside :("
463,0,"I have this game that I play the walking dead series the one with Lee and Clementine, i play those games when I get stressed out or age regress they make me feel safe, what would that be called? "
464,0,"I cannot express how much having a good and healthy support system is key to our success. I was sick for over five years with constant spirals dating , someone who lied , cheated and made dating him a competition. He was psychologically and sexually abusive and manipulative . Constant gaslighting and being absent due to also being married and refusing to fulfill any promises. 

Now flash forward- I have a supportive partner who is fully transparent. Communicates consistently and follows through on what he says . He is genuine , kind, compassionate and honest. When we have any discussions he is supportive and communicates thoroughly to make sure nothing is unresolved. He genuinely cares and loves me deeper than anyone ever has. 

I can’t stress this enough. Pick the kind one, pick the consistent one, pick the one that shows up for you and chooses you . You are worthy of love and communication."

466,2,"My ex cheated on me for a few months; I had no idea as there were 0 signs, and because they told me they were ready to get married and loved me 9 days before they came clean, and they were sending me a ton of nudes the night before. I didn’t know I had BPD at the time but I begged and begged for closure, they blocked me and I made fake numbers begging for closure and they said I’m mentally ill, then they got married within 4 months or so. The only thing they told me as the reason for their cheating was that they thought I’d hurt myself if they broke up with me. 

Fast forward to 2.5 years now since they left me, and I still have constant panic attacks. I’ve been to multiple therapists and they said they cannot help me, and told me that they’re sorry. My friends don’t understand why I care that they cheated and left me for someone else, because they say no one cares that much about someone else. Does anyone have any tips on how to handle being cheated on and deal with the aftermath, when you have BPD?"
467,3,"I feel it in my soul. ""Ohmygod don't leave me! Don't take them away from me! Oh God don't leave me"".  
  
Had this my whole life. A girl is nice to me / in a relationship, and the __mere thought__ of them going off with someone else fills me with such a sense of tragedy, loss, grief, shame, fear, anger, overwhelm I would do anything to not experience it.  
  
What is it? Why is it there? The emptiness underneath feels unsurvivable "
468,2,"Holy fuck can I be any more dramatic?? IT IS JUST A FOLLOW. But it’s not just a follow, I haven’t spoken to him since I was a sophomore in high school, almost 6 years ago! After years of back and forth, that ended with him ditching me for the same girlfriend he’d cheated on over and over, what could he possibly want?? 

I want to tear into him, tell him every shit thing I thought about him. I want to ask him if he even ever actually wanted me or just wanted my attention. Why he has to add me even when he has a long term girlfriend. I hate my brain. I wish everyone who remembered me just forgot I exist and left me alone  : )"

470,3,"My fp has a problem were they will just not reply to my stuff or take ages to reply, I have talked with them about this and how I don't like feeling like I am being ignored but they haven't changed, which caused me to split really hard on them today and push them away

I usually don't mind if someone takes time to reply when they're busy, but since they're unemployed and living with their parents they're always kind of available, and sometimes they will just see my messages and not reply to them, completely ignoring me

Idk if they will want to reconnect with me, but does anyone have any tips to keep myself calm while they don't reply? Or when they ignore me and talk about other completely unrelated stuff?"
471,2,"Yesterday I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1lama2n/urge_to_act_on_emotions/) about having a crush on somebody, which was very cathartic.

I'm a loner because I struggle socially and because I want to protect people from me being unhinged towards them when I'm feeling emotionally dysregulated. At the same time, I yearn for a connection with others and to expand my social circle. 

I've come to realize that the reason why I've never had any long-term relationships is because I'm afraid of rejection. Whenever I finally settle down with a partner, I begin to test them and try to chase them away so they'll reject me; as that's my greatest fear. I want rejection to happen on my terms. If I can't scare my partner away, then I break up with them. Then I hate myself. It's so messed up!

I currently have a crush who I think has been flirting with me but I'm too scared to find out for sure; because if he's not gay and/or interested, I know it's going to hurt. So without finding out if he likes me, I've come to realize that I have the urge to do things to guarantee he's not interested me and so that I feel shame and won't want to see him; thus rejecting him or setting him up to reject me.

I want nothing more than to get married someday and settle down, and yet look at how I'm feeling towards somebody giving me positive attention that isn't even a friend.

I know I need to read his reply to the sassy email I sent him, which will help me to know where I go from here."
472,1,"I am so terrified that I'm going to end my life before I'm able to get better, but I'm equally terrified of having to live like this. Life isn't good for me. I can't feel happy consistently. I struggle with my trauma everyday. I'm so horrible with any sort of relationship. Living is painful for me. And I don't know what to do. I am 14 years old and living with bpd, bipolar, c-ptsd, and gad. I'm just a kid, and it's so hard for me to function. I am terrified of what highschool is going to be like. I'm horrible at managing myself and school. I hate this state of existence but at the same time I won't let myself get better. Part of me feels like I have something to prove. It's like I need to get bad enough to be valid, but I don't know where that line would be. I'm addicted to cutting myself, I've attempted suicide eight times, I've struggled with alcohol and cough syrup abuse, I've struggled with binging and purging and starving all together, I've been through an insane amount of therapists and medications, and I go through a horrible depressive episode every other week. How much worse is there for me to even get? I feel like I'll never be satisfied with my own sickness. My mind keeps telling me that if I get better so early in my life then none of it was really worth it. I don't know. I'm just so terrified and so extremely exhausted. "
473,2,"Hi guys,

it's been a while since I've posted here even though my BPD symptoms have been acting up and I could have used support, but I figured I'd try to handle it myself this time and I think I did.

My BPD symptoms were actually very minimal until 2 years ago (after a period of a full year when they were horrible) and they started again once I entered a relationship. The worst part of it has been fear of abandonment but I think I figured out why I have it and how to handle it so I thought I'd share it here, maybe it helps someone.

**The cause**:

I strongly believe that my fear of abandonment comes from my lack of self confidence. I always feel like I am not good enough in some way, especially for my boyfriend since we share a really big age gap and I sometimes feel like I am not ""mature enough"" for him. However, the reality is, if I wasn't, he wouldn't be with me, especially since he isn't a big fan of our age gap (it wasn't planned, neither of us sought it out, it just happened since we are truly compatible as people).

**Triggers**:

Triggers for me are pretty much any woman that is next to him at any given moment. My mind keeps telling me that he will see someone more attractive than me and just dump me for that someone else. He has not given me any reason to think this, it's literally just all in my head. I also go out of my way to stalk the women in his life and I am trying really hard to not do it (I had a few fake accounts where I added these women but I deleted those accounts). I would stare at theid photos for hours and compare myself to them, so of course I'd feel terrible, it's really easy to convince yourself that you are ""worth less"" when you are looking for problems.

**Solutions**:

1. **No more stalking** - It only does harm. All the time I spent stalking could have been used for something actually productive.

2. **Practising self love** - When I was single, I would take myself on ""a date"" to the city each week, I would grab a coffee, go for a walk while listening to music, buy myself something, however, since getting together with my boyfriend, I've stopped doing that. I will start again. I love spending time alone. Granted, I have cats at home now and love being with them but I can find the time to go somewhere alone once a week for an hour or two.

3. **Physical activity** - This is something I have been doing for 5 years, specifically weight lifting in my case, but it can be anything. I also used to take daily walks but had to stop due to knee pain (training, cardio at home and walking were too much, had to cut something out). I put physical activity on the list even though it's something I have actively been practising for years but I figured I'd add it because it could get someone else to consider it. It is actually the only thing that has been keeping me sane in midst of it all.

I know that everything I wrote isn't something groundbreaking or special, but it genuinely helps me so I feel it was worth writing down and sharing.

"
474,2,"My therapist is often telling me to sit with discomfort, stop hiding and running and I am AWFUL at it. I’m miserable not running and hiding but I am trying to also be better and tonight I sent my husband on a wild goose chase for discount Chinese food and just KNEW that I was gonna get in trouble, that I was an idiot and that I shouldn’t take him up on his offer to correct my mistake because I need to be punished. 

And I sat with it. And it sucked. And I did nothing but feel anxious. And then suddenly I got sad and realized all that anxiety was something 6 year old me felt, and I never had a safe chance to stop running, because I was always feeling like I was in survival mode. 

So I took some deep breaths, asked for what I wanted and I know that adults make silly mistakes and it’s not worth the spiral, because it does indeed go nowhere good. 

Also I don’t know anything about anything really so take it all with a grain of salt 🧂 "
475,0,"Hi, I am new to this sub

So I recently met a girl who I am really into. She has been honest with me and said she was diagnosed with BPD and I am more than willing to do what is needed to make sure she feels the reassurance she needs and all, so those negative thoughts don't come back and try to hurt her. She is someone who has hurt herself in the past and has done a few questionable things the moment she felt that she has been abandoned again. Though she has told me that reassurance and such is all she needs, any advice other than that? I am absolutely more than happy to give the reassurance she needs and when she needs it, but any other advice to what I can do to make sure she knows that I am not going anywhere? Any tips or advice are more than welcome.

Also we are lesbians if that's important"
476,3,"Im dissociating heavily right now. The last time I dissociated like this was 4-5 months ago and I ended up cheating and having meaningless hookups. It caused horrible disruption for me and my boyfriend. Now, we were on the path to healing but Im dissociating again and hes making it worse. He blows up my phone, threatened to ruin my life, and refuses to give me space. I keep asking for space, at least for a few days, but he refuses because he thinks space will cause me to dissociate more. 

I feel so suffocated and I just want to leave. He is bothering me so much. Everytime I try to leave, he gets super angry and threatens me. Im so stressed, I keep telling him that his overbearing behavior is counter productive but he disagrees. He has probably called me around 30 to 50 times in the past day and a half. 

I just want to be left alone. It makes sense for him to be stressed, since the last time I behaved this way, I cheated, but hes crossing my boundaries and being disrespectful. Please help"
477,1,"I don’t want to feel like this anymore. She tells me she doesn’t want a relationship and wants to be single but then treats me like her girlfriend. We will be on the phone for hours, talk to each other abt our deepest secrets, play games together, and even sometimes talk about our future together, but she keeps telling me she wants her freedom and doesn’t want to be tied down. It is long distance and she was planning to see me for pride in 2 weeks and now i recieved a text that she might not come anymore because she wants to focus on her music career. Why the fuck would you even tell me that you were going to come because you miss me so much and you NEED to see me and all she wants to do is just be with me and hug cuddle and kiss me, JUST to switch up on my face like that. Now i’m spiraling because i won’t see her for another month, but i can’t leave her. I just can’t it’s so hard to leave her i feel like she’s my twin flame and i cannot leave her life but at the same time i can’t deal with the intense pain and emotions of feeling abandoned by her anymore.

478,1,"I’ve experienced a lot of trauma in my life, especially over the last year & I just don’t know how to continue. I can’t stop ruminating about my SA’s, being cheated on, lied to, my self harm, being abandoned over & over, this diagnosis, the chronic pain I’ve been in for the past year+ due to a back injury, not knowing what I want to do with my life still at age 27, etc. It’s becoming such a burden to get out of bed, feed myself, shower & work. I can’t stop pushing people away & I’ve also been experiencing stress induced psychosis for the last month or so. I feel so different from everyone around me, especially seeing other people in relationships & marriages bc why tf do so many people decide to trust someone else like that? & publicly? Its embarrassing to see, they’re literally signing up to get screwed over. I’m just not seeing the point of sticking around anymore & nobody in my life understands me"
479,1,So I downloaded tinder and now I am getting attached to people I barely know :33 fucking kill me already please. I already know I will fuck everything up by having bpd so I don't know why I even bother trying to be loved. 
480,3,idk i js got diagnosed with bpd and everything is starting to make sense and i think me wanting to break up with my bf was a little more valid. when i had the convo i just wanted a break to learn myself and work on myself and now ive learned i have bpd and i feel like i need to seriously work on myself and my mental health. my therapist told me my biggest trigger is my boyfriend and that i need to do something to help me with that. in my head the only logical thing was to have a break from him when i can learn to work on my emotions but idk if it’s the right thing. he makes me feel so guilty for wanting to work on myself without him in the picture yk.. i understand he’s hurt and doesn’t want to lose me bc i don’t wanna lose him but he’s said multiple times that he can’t handle me and im too much and shit like that. was breaking up with ur partner good for u and ur bpd?
481,1,"I have been not having an fp for almost a year, and my life feels so much better than before. I can actually breath. I still think about my fp sometimes, but not as often as before. At the same time, I feel like I am missing something. I need someone to care for, to fight for, to obsess over, to cling on. I do have some friends, but I don't feel any connections with them. I care for them, but it's not the same. I can basically not talking to them in a month or even a year, and I'll be fine. Sometimes I wonder why can I be normal? It's all or nothing for me. Oh well, I hate having this disorder. "
482,2,"title sums it up. context, 24F lesbian, 1 year out of a breakup and i’m “allowing” myself to try and date again. had a crush on a new. friend for a few months, and my other friend kind of woke me up by asking me “do you like her, or do you just like her because she’s showing you kindness? or do you just admire her?” 

long story but stopped contacting original crush, got over her and now i have a new crush and i’m asking myself the same questions… because this girl isn’t really my usual type haha! i do think she’s a really good friend and i have a soft spot for her but i’m having a lot of trouble differentiating attraction and appreciation because in the past, a crush = obsession. i’m working on tempering my feelings and mood, trying to hold back on obsessing & fixating on my new crush/goodfriend. but this is the first time i’m having a “crush” after tempering my obsessive tendencies…

any advice? also the queer aspect is making this even harder—new crush is also a lesbian so boundaries are even more difficult to assess. hopefully this made sense, i think i was rambling hahah"
483,3,"I am diagnosed with StPD but since those diagnoses are close together i want to post there. I am so tired of relationships but I don't want to end anything because i fear abandonment.

484,2,i met this guy and we've only been talking for 2 days but he's been really sweet until now and complimenting me on a lot of stuff. and it's really nice but instead of being happy and flattered i just keep freaking out and feeling uncomfortable. not because of him i think but because it feels too much and i don't know how to handle it. im also not used to this as i've never dated anyone and romance has never been a part of my life. ive always wanted this but now that it's happening im iust constantly anxiousand freaked out. has anyone else experienced something like that ? i tried all of my methods to calm down but nothing works and even when i try to think rationally about it i just panick even more ? 
485,0,I was thinking of the word mania but I saw it was ‘exclusive’ to bipolar so I guess I’m going w euphoria but how does intense highs feel like for you — I’m really curious bc I have never had those moments before n I’m lowkey wondering 
486,3,"I'm 19, and I got diagnosed last year at 18 (albeit I know BPD was put down in my psych ward records, some outpatient places have put cluster B traits to help sorta not have the stigmatised label).

In other words, it's a VERY avoided topic with professionals. It was only brought up by 2 in the same ward unit and they both were awfully blunt just saying im **this** way and **that** way, with no context beforehand to the diagnosis.

Anyways, I've found that I get invested in people in general. I don't really have a 'Favourite Person' due to avoidance of romantic relationships, and platonically the last one was my psychiatric nurse a year ago. 

I get really trusting, and fascinated by another person. Like I am absolutely ecstatic when someone is nice to me, I take notice of all the ways they are just *amazing* in my head. I'm very empathetic, to a fault that it's probably stupidity. 

Then it just seems to flip the second there's something I feel is a threat, danger, or dislike. I can get bitter, pissy and detached.

I don't lash out but then im just hyperaware and avoidant. I've been told often I seem like impassive, not expressionate then to animated and very theatrically enthusiastic?

I never trust my own feelings, often I ignore the red alarms of danger in my head bc I think I'm having a stark swing for no reason. But then I do end up in bad situations with someone that way. But if I act on it, then I flatout cut myself off from any relationships with other people, or pre existing ones.

since ive left home, I've realised I think I get very confused and all over the place with my emotions and thoughts. Because I was never treated nicely like people usually would another person. The unstable household of irregular moods and not knowing what would happen has me so fucked on understanding."
487,1,I (17F) have been in therapy for roughly a couple months. It has been amazing and I was somewhat hoping it’d never end. I was diagnosed with BPD and I was told that he wanted to see me once a week. My insurance company has paused my visits for some reason and I have to be honest I’m struggling. I even found myself falling for him which I know isn’t healthy but to be truthful I miss him. He told me that he’d help me which I equated to “I’ll never leave you”. I’ve been so upset since I haven’t been able to see him. I don’t know what else to do besides wait it out and even that seems merely impossible. 
488,0,"I came here because I wanted to offer something different than what my friend recently found in another subreddit that basically boiled down to horror stories about people with BPD. It hurt them, and honestly, it broke something in me. Because that is not who they are, and it’s definitely not our story.

I love someone who happens to live with BPD. And it’s been one of the most impactful, raw, and honest experiences of my life.

What I’ve learned is that friendships like this aren’t one-sided or tragic; they’re alive. There’s growth and repair and depth and effort. There’s emotional intensity, sure. But there’s also unmatched honesty and compassion like I’ve never experienced before.

From the beginning, something in them just got me. They’ve taught me how to slow down and really observe the world. The way they notice things the smallest details, the softest shifts in energy, but especially the sounds of the world it’s made me pay attention differently. They feel everything deeply, yes, but they feel beauty deeply too. That’s changed me.

There have been moments where I’ve messed up, said or done things that landed wrong. But even in those moments, they don’t punish me, they communicate.

This friendship has stretched me in the best ways. I’ve had to look at how I communicate, how I affirm, how I show up. I’ve learned that loving someone with BPD doesn’t mean tiptoeing around. It means being clear, being present, being real. It means understanding that love doesn’t always sound like reassurance. Sometimes it’s space. Sometimes it’s silence. Sometimes it’s just staying, even when it’s hard.

They’ve helped me see I am braver than I ever thought. They’ve taught me to be more patient and softer especially with myself.

If you have BPD and you’ve ever internalized the idea that you’re a burden, or that you’re too much, or that no one could ever really stay please know that’s not true. And it’s not true for them. They are not a horror story. They’re a miracle. Maybe messy sometimes, yes but powerful. Transformative. Human.

So if you’re reading this and you live with BPD, I hope you know; you deserve love that sees you. You deserve to be chosen, even on the hard days.

And for those of us who get to love someone like you, we’re the lucky ones. I know I am.

489,2,"hii . so i’ve come a long way as far as managing
my bpd, but i have noticed lately every night after i leave work even if i had a positive shift ill always leave after or even after an interaction w people close to me and ill feel like “everyone secretly hates me.” and i know it’s not rational
bc i have no valid reason to support that claim but it sucks. :( just wanted to post to gain some insights "

Just found this song today and reminds me a lot of how I feel with my FP. Without him, I lose my sense of humanity and personality. If it weren't for him I'd always feel like I'm a horrible person. I feel I depend on him a lot for serotonin and a sense of stability in myself.

What do we think?"
491,3,"They took all their stuff out of our house and told me to never contact them today… I thought our relationship was the strongest it’s been in years…the night before is when she broke up with me..I didn’t believe it was real life. We were literally cuddling the hour before…frustrated more than anything… she always took care of me I haven’t lashed out in years… I worked out everyday..took care of my self physically, financially.. I thought we were going to be together forever. Great. We didn’t even argue anymore I just don’t understand..it’s hard to breathe but typing this out makes me feel better. We just came back from a wonderful anniversary in vegas.-. When I asked if there was someone else she told me no, I believe her. We spend so much time together she would never. Told me she wants to be alone.. said we will grow more without each other. No I haven’t feeling happy babe let’s fix this? I feel like my world got flipped upside down, this has to be a dream. I’ve only slept 3 hrs in the last 2 days. I currently hate life. She’s never done anything like this before I’m distraught. Now what will I do with myself with my only reason for wanting to be alive just abruptly gone"
492,3,"yesterday i tried killing myself over a spiral w my fp, now i feel like i wanna commit for real but i dont wanna let them down but i feel like they dont care about me and just using me. i wanna talk to them but i feel like i hurted them and dont wanna talk to me. i have nothing to commit so im just isolating myself again. i have urges to talk to them and tell them im sorry."
493,3,So after 8 months of being together things have gotten pretty rough. Knowing what I feel I know now I know the part I played in some of these things but ultimately idk what to do. Recently we had a fight that lead to complete stress induced psychosis for my partner. My partner wanted to go to their safe space ina city 2 hours away which I was support especially since we’d smooth things over and calmed down together. In the event of my partner had lied to me to turn off their location. I have an old phone that has their families life 360 and saw they were at their exs house. On their way back they came clean about a huge insane web of lies that they had made. From not texting their ex to even letting a horrible person back into their life because they couldn’t help themselves. This is someone that I helped cut them out when we first got together. My partner is known for running and truthfully I don’t want them too. They agreed to stay together. They feel they don’t deserve a second chance but truthfully I’m that kind of person. Knowing their struggles not only with bpd but schizophrenia and autism. A couple days after that big thing happened I wanted to work on our relationship but their internet friends of 5 years are down for the first time ever. I let go of my feelings and didn’t fight them on going to see them for 3 days. My problem is they are super dry texting me and I don’t feel like their partner anymore. I’m genuinely trying to be supportive at this point even tho I have problems with her friends and vice versa. Should I be worrying that it’s over or is this part of the cycle and how should I approach it. I truly love this person and want to help them with everything. I’ve handled so much in my life and feel that I’m so equipped to navigate and help my partner. Any piece of mind would help
494,2,"Am I schizoaffective or borderline personality disorder? I’m currently in the hospital not for depression or suicidal. It’s because my damn brain won’t stop obsessing about anything over and over and all damn day long. Fighting a battle in my head that doesn’t exist. I’m on a new med now. 

Paliperidone. It’s suppose to shut my brain up. So far so good. 

Not I’m questioning if I do have borderline personality disorder or is it just schizoaffective disorder?

What do you guys think? "
495,1,"So if you've read my previous posts, you know I've recently traumatically dumped my ex boyfriend and hes been in therapy because of me. I'm not proud of it and the guilt is killing me, but he wants nothing to do with me.

But life has only gotten WORSE since I dumped him. I finally managed to get a job, and the pay sucked, but it was a stepping stone. But its in the worst neighborhood in town and I've been sexually harassed by homeless guys outside my job. 

My first week of work, I had a ovarian cyst rupture and I spent a week in the hospital, lost a few days of work, and now I could possibly lose that job. I have no car, I have student loans, medical debt. And when I was in the hospital, the only thing I could think about was how sweet and understanding my ex was about my condition.

He knew I had BPD and he wanted to support me, he drove me everywhere I needed to go, he paid for everything on dates, and the most painful part is he was thinking about going back into the army reserves because he wanted to transfer his education benefits over to me so I could go back and finish my degree because he didn't think it was fair I had to leave school because of health issues. 

I kept telling myself he was too good for me and that I had to break up with him....but I did it in the WORST way possible by degrading him and making him think he was inferior to me.

Now I'm all alone, and all I can think about is how much I miss him and what I threw away."
496,1,"It’s always a cycle, I think I’m getting better ways of dealing with my abandonment.
Finding out new coping strategies and finally feel like I’m getting some more control and clarity of with stupid disorder. 

But it’s always the same, I always end up splitting on the people that are the closest to me,and that’s what breaks my heart, it’s ruins everything no matter how hard I try. 

then going down the deep rabbit hole of I ruin everything, I’m worthless blah blah blah and I now feel like I haven’t made an progress and I know that’s not true but I still feel like a failure. 

It’s always a horrible circle, and it’s the hardest part of it for me. 
The shame, the guilt knowing hurting the people I love no matter what I do. 

It’s breaking my heart but on words and upwards ig, the cycle start again 🤷🏻‍♀️"
497,1,"Edit:- reposting this because I really really need some advice and guidance as to how to navigate this cuz ive relapsed to SHing

It is pretty much my fault i had rage outbursts and i ended up accusing her that she supposedly was subtly trying to put me down and obviously she got upset over it and decided to stop talking to me and cut all ties with me and i wish we could get back together. We have shared so many memories, we have shared interests we love the same characters from the game we loved and she had made a couple of artpieces upon my requests and we have been vulnerable to each other. I treasured her too much and it feels like the end of the world. I wish I could do something to correct myself and keep the friendship but it seems like she will never come back. She also unfollowed me on social media and that crushed me even further. It really feels like hell and my mind is swinging between loathing her to loathing myself to >!kill myself and hurt her!< 

It doesnt help the fact that my exams are approaching in a few days and i am not quite prepared and this incident is taking even a bigger toll on me "
498,1,"I had a gf who I was there favorite person for a long time after a change of routine from both of us I wasn’t able to there for her and someone else was , that someone else has now became her fp she has left me which feels like for him as she says she’s there for him and such and does hang out all the time from dust to dawn what should I do ? I feel as I am left in the dust as my feelings don’t matter I am hurt and don’t know what to do as we are “friends now”"
499,1,"(19 F) if people won't see you for who you are, be able to handle you, love you, care about you and be there for you in the way you want, what's even the point of being here? 

the love of my life only sees me as a friends with benefits and can't handle the overwhelming deep feelings I have for them - so much to the point they have to leave me to let me go, so I can get better, so I can move on, and so they can stop hurting me. so what's the point of being alive? I can't live without this person, but they can live without me. they care about me, honor and cherish my feelings and vulnerabilities, but don't reciprocate my love and is moving to another state by the end of the year for college. today they told me ""I can't fix you, Im not god or a superhero"", ""you can't let me go yourself, so I think I have to leave you, which sucks because you've been through so much. but you need someone who's gonna be there 24/7 and I can't do that"", ""I dont always know the right words to say, but me not saying anything hurts you, and I don't wanna hurt you anymore"" I guess I am just too much 

yesterday, I go over to their house to talk about my feelings and what's been going on with me. I confessed my feelings a few weeks ago. and instead we end up hooking up. so yesterday we fuck and today they're gonna leave

I am just too needy and too unbearable and thats why no one knows how to love me. that's why everyone, including one of the best things to happen to me, leaves. that's why the first person to make me feel comfortable, safe and protected on my body may never talk to me again. we may never hold each other or sleep together again or share anything again, because I am just not a loveable person with worth. it's why my own parents abused me and treat me like worthless shit. its why none of my siblings talk to me anymore, besides my younger sister. it's why so many ""friends"" have betrayed, abandoned, and taken advantage of me, it's why I had that abusive ex. it's why the main person that makes me happy now is leaving me too

because why would anybody love a disgusting, unworthy, worthless borderline freak? why would I ever be worth anything being the person I am and going through the things I have? I'm not and I never will. theres no point being alive then

update : I think my fwb blocked me on insta and deleted their reddit profile. I have no way to talk to them now. I feel shattered"
500,1,"I mean , life has got in charged that , I feel honestly numbness , upset , depressed but numbness , every single thing that has been happening, has made get into a mood of just , yes this is bad , or yes this feels bad , but I am now numbness , no crying , no shouting, not even trying to self hurting me , just like well , what can I do ? I shouldn't be surprised. 
Rejection is painful in BPD , very painful , but people seem doesn't care and when I say people I am referring close ones , because in my case I don't care about strangers , but close ones , pff hurts a lot , but right now I just feel numbness.  
As I said I shouldn't be surprised at this point of my life . 

And no I am not happy , I am not grateful, every single time that I could feel greatful or happiness , something happens , so no , happiness I think it is not at the menu.  

Only being disappointed once and again and again and again . 

To the point of numbness ."
501,0,"So I made a post about wanting to make a group chat for people here. After some thinking I decided to do it on snap. I just feel like a lot of people wouldn’t be 100% comfortable with sharing there phone number to people on Reddit lol

My snap is Kourtney2952

If you’d like to join send me a friend request and let me know you’re from Reddit. "
502,2,Please before she leaves me. I don't know what to do. She doesn't understands me but I genuinely can't talk with her directly. I'm scared. She thinks I'm just talking with her as a joke or that I'm crazy probably. She even said I go insane if she doesn't texts me for 3 days yet I don't text her for weeks..
503,1,"I feel that, some people instead of trying to real fix things they mess them up more . 
I tried to put from myself . 
I tried to do what my psychiatrist says . 
I tried to work on my trust issues, but life is just showing me up more and more how not to trust . 
Life show me that people even if they say that they are not mad at you , or that they trust on you , or that they want the best for you , only life shows me the opposite thing. 
They don't really believe in me . 
They don't really care about me. 
They think that because of my mental health disorder I am burden . 
They never think how their words can make me feel . 
Doesn't matter how much information they could read , it is just like or they don't care about it , or they just don't want to understand, or they really don't understand. 
I feel disappointed completely disappointed and disconnected. 
I don't even have friends right now for sharing how I feel because one of them was like what I have described . 
I feel pain in my heart but the same time numbness . 
The type of numbness that is , well ok , it hurts but it doesn't surprised me that once again people can't understand or doesn't want to understand my BPD and how painful could be words and answers, etc .
You know what a long time ago like 7-8 years ago , everybody used to know me to be a cold person.  Very neutral and objective, funny but neutral and putting distance . This was before me being detected with BPD . 
I know that being a cold person and trying to not connect deeply with people it is an armour , but you know what ? At least you don't feel that much disappointed, depressed or upset.  
And honestly I feel that version that cold version of me is coming back . "
504,2,"Okay uhm well I have Borderline personality disorder Probably, I hope it's okay but I'm not diagnosed yet. I'm pretty sure that I have it and I'm currently in a process of a diagnose. The diagnosis just takes long.  (I read the rules and I think it's okay yea)

Basically my best friend or also my favorite person, who I am emotionally dependent on heavily is upset with me currently. I fucked up I think. I isolated myself and haven't talked with her in weeks. She thought my parents took away my stuff and that was what I said but I lied kinda. I just wasn't feeling good at all. I isolated myself. I was feeling sick. I posted a vent on my TikTok yesterday, where I said I wanna harm myself. (I was also kinda having an episode there). She saw it right now and is angry at me. Please I'm scared that she'll leave me. If she leaves me I can't do it anymore. I'm so TERRIFIED of abandonment. 

She said (summarized) ""why aren't you replying? Hello? How are you excepting me to do something when you don't even talk with me? Do you think I don't care? Why are you doing a viedio but don't talk with me? Ok make a Viedio I don't care but you don't even tell me anything?! I thought you aren't allowed to be online for a while and stuff bro. You go and make a Viedio and post it for strangers to see. But you don't ask me for help??? What do you want to start with that? Why do you never talk about these stuff with me?? I genuinely don't get it. I swear I am trying to understand you but you are the one who doesn't wants to talk even though you say ""I'm the only one you trust"". I don't know how I should continue with you if you don't even talk about that with me. If I don't text you for 3 days you go crazy but you can just not text me for weeks.""

Please I'm scared. She'll leave me. I don't know how to talk about it. I don't know what to do. I never talked with her about that because she's the only friend I have. She's the only person I know IRL. I don't have ANY other irl friends. I know her for 6 years. Please help."
505,3,"I’ve been feeling very apathetic lately and I fear it may be affecting my personal relationships, especially with my girlfriend. I have never known what to do during my apathy moods besides just let it go and wish for it to go back to normal, but i’m already overwhelmed and stressed. So I figured there was no harm in asking other people for advice about how to deal with apathy. 

What exactly works for you, if anything?"
506,2,"My situation might seem a little strange, but I currently live with my ex-partner who is still my best friend (ended on good terms, no issues there). She is from out of town and we live in my home state. We have lived together for 3 years and haven't been separated for more than 4 days and she has never left to go out of state without me. I was healing a lot from my BPD abandonment issues until this December, we had a little bit of a falling out because of my attachment issues and that is when we were separated last because I left to go stay with family. That was a really traumatic time for me and I hate thinking about it because it was so lonely and being apart from her causes me major anxiety. Fast forward to now, she is leaving tomorrow to go on a week long trip with her family 14 hours away from here and I feel like I'm spiraling about it. I know that I will be okay, but the anticipation of having to be without her for a week for the first time in 3 years is killing me. Also the fact we aren't going to be able to call very much or text as much as we normally do when she is here and we aren't together. I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to cope or at least some support. The thought of having to say goodbye to her tomorrow for a week feels like a death sentence, it feels like I'm saying goodbye to her for a long time which I know isn't true because a week is barely anything to people without BPD. I hate how BPD controls my life, I wish I could be normal so badly. Ugh. "
507,1,"Most people’s fp are people they were in a serious relationship with but mine is just a guy I was casually with and he is young and immature and I knew he wasn’t the relationship type but when he asked me out I still went out with him because I thought if I stuck around long enough and didn’t act desperate for a relationship he would then want one. He would text me every 3-4 days and ask to hang out and we’d just have sex and watch a movie or cook together. That lasted about a month until I got mad at him for his last minute texts and I told him I need to know in advance. Then we got back together a few months after that because he texted me. We saw each other again and hooked up and I thought we’d start our casual thing again where he texts me every few days to hang out but a whole week went by and he didn’t. So I got mad and told him he got what he wanted and instead of ghosting me he should just tell me he’s not interested and he said he didn’t mean to ghost me and yeah he got what he wanted which was some time with me and “I’m guessing you wanted something else”.  

I guess it’s over he didn’t even care to see me causally, just a one time thing. But for the past few months the thought of us getting back together was the only reason I kept going. It was the only reason I was living, and we did get back together just for it to be a one time thing. I don’t know how to get over this. It’s embarrassing cause everyone else’s fp is someone that actually liked them and treated them well. Mine is always guys I’m casually seeing because guys don’t want a relationship with me. Last time i had an fp breakup with a guy I was also causally seeing, I ended up trying to take my own life. My mental health and just life in general is much worse now than it was back then, and with this fp breakup I don’t know if I can get through it. I don’t know how I’m gonna go to work and take care of myself. I can’t help but think it’s cause I’m ugly or unattractive or else he wouldn’t have done that. "
508,0,"remember, you are never alone. This is a safe discussion for people who wish to break the cycle and get better. Therapy is not affordable these days and it can de debilitating to try and cope without it. Let’s all stick together and help each other :))"
509,2,"Hi everyone,
I’d really appreciate it if people could share their personal experiences with psychiatric medication.

I’ve been in therapy and have worked really hard on myself, but I still struggle with intense and unwanted emotions that feel overwhelming. I’ve been diagnoized with early stage BPD and my therapist said that medication is not necessary if I don’t want to. Lately, I’ve been considering medication, but I’m scared, mostly because my only exposure to it has been negative.

My mother also has BPD. Instead of being supported with therapy or other tools, she was immediately put on medication. Growing up, it was rough. I never knew if I’d wake up to a loving mom or someone completely detached and unpredictable. That experience really shaped how I view psychiatric meds, and it’s left me afraid of becoming “numbed” or losing myself.

At the same time, I’m exhausted. If anyone is willing to share how medication has helped (or not), especially in combination with therapy, I’d be really grateful."
510,0,"I was unfamiliar with borderline personality disorder until I met my current partner. I believe mine stems from childhood trauma, having grown up in a toxic, abusive household. When I was younger, I did not think it would affect me as an adult. And it’s alarming to consider how frequently this condition can go undiagnosed. I am relieved to discover that I am not the only individual experiencing this issue. I find solace in knowing that I am not alone."
511,1,"Im wondering: what triggers your suicidal ideations? And how long do they last? 
I’m at the psych ward right now suffering from suicidal ideations. I have had constant suicidal ideations for two months that got much worse with time. No triggers whatsoever. "
512,1,"Normally my mood swings last from a couple of hours to a couple of days (eg. dsyphoric episodes), but when I  am drunk it's like my mood literally changes every 10 minutes and it's so fucking weird. 

One minute I am like ""life is great!"" and dancing around without a care in the world, and then literally only  a couple minutes later I feel incredibly depressed and start thinking things like `""life isn't even worth living""`. 

And then I go back to being happy... lmao. It's exhausting, honestly. And yes, I know that the solution to this would be to stop drinking."
513,0, I have heard mood stabilisers help with certain symptoms but I’m confused as to which symptoms does it work to alleviate. Has anyone here been helped by medications? What did it help with? 
514,1,"I have bpd. My partner is healthy/stable. I know you’ll are aware of how this goes. We fight every week, I’m always sensitive and he thinks I’m too critical of him and blow everything up. He always says I go into this ‘weird’ state that isn’t me. He has noticed I want affection/love but I’m mad at him and he think I’m being manipulative and that I enjoy arguing. 

He uses terms of splitting without knowing what they mean. Anytime I’m upset now, he says I’m splitting and I don’t even know how to tell if I am and being sensitive etc or if he is manipulating me 

I feel like I don’t even know who I am. Or how to live. My mind is a battle. 

Last night we argued yet again. He said I’m starting to scare him how quick I can change … said it’s creepy how I snap into someone who isn’t me and he is walking on eggshells again. 

I’m gutted. I’m so fkn gutted. I want him to be the one I marry but I can’t help but to notice everything and think it’s the end of the world. I’ve just always been this way. Every relo I thought they were an awful person but now that I actually have a good guy I’m confused to find out I’m the problem. 

I think I’m better not in a relo but I’ve always been in one because I just can’t be alone. Either way I suck. 

EDIT:
Don’t tell me to end it with him. This post is re guilt after a bpd split. He wants to keep trying and support me etc. I’m just scaring him and making him be cautious of what he says cause I react to every little bit of rejection and he tries to rationalise with me but it makes it worse. He is srsly not the problem here. He is the most kind, loyal, patient, thoughtful gentlemen. 

Don’t need to flag this either, I don’t cut and am not suicidal. "
515,3,"Hi, I got diagnosed with BPD 2–3 years ago, and I’m currently on meds and in therapy. I used to be very mentally unstable and suicidal—until I met my boyfriend. At first, everything was like a fairytale. He was very loving, obsessive, and jealous, which I also am, so I didn’t think it would affect me badly.

After the first month, we started to fight every day over small things, and it would always end with him trying to kill himself or telling me he was going to harm himself. He doesn’t want me to have any friends or go out without him. He always cries whenever I mention I want to meet with a friend. He always cries over these kinds of things, and it turns into a fight—then he tries to kill himself. He doesn’t want me to have a life unless my life is all about him. He doesn’t want me to dress the way I want, upload videos on social platforms, or do things like that.

My parents are kinda strict, and I have to be at home at 7. He says that I have to do everything to spend more time with him—he says I have to fight with my parents or even make them get arrested if needed. He always asks me if I still love him or if I’m going to leave him, and he always cries. He cries all the time.

He doesn’t take no for an answer—even when it comes to intimacy. Whenever I say “no” to him, regardless of the topic, he starts crying and tells me he’s going to kill himself. He says I’m his only reason to live and that he would even kill someone for me. I know he loves me in a very unhealthy way. I understand him, because I used to be like that too—I’ve just managed to control it now.

Whenever I tell him that he needs therapy or meds, he says, “This is who I am and I can’t change.” I love him, and I can’t leave him—he threatens to kill me and my family if I do. I still love him.

I am exhausted. Even at home, I have to be on the phone with him 24/7—even while sleeping. I meet him every day. I’m with him 8–9 hours a day. I don’t have any friends left. My mental health is getting worse. I need help."
516,2,"This is a super long story and honestly I dont have the motivation to tell the whole thing but I'll do my best lol. Also, unless its very particular things, I have basically quote on quote ""outgrown"" my diagnosis of bpd (was officially diagnosed in 2020 and havent had any major symptoms or meltdowns past the occasional flicker of thoughts since 2022) (yay me!) so, even though there's a part of my gut twisting at the thought of my FP not ever seeing me again or wanting to be with me, I also have another part of my gut that knows that everything is going to be okay and that I know that I'm in the right, and therefore I need to defend myself first and foremost.)

I got a concussion 2 months ago and, as I'm sure people know, head trauma is very very serious. I randomly blank or dont remember where I am or what Im doing. Games I've been playing for years suddenly I dont know the basic functions or rules. Insomnia, headaches, dizziness, mood swings, the whole works. If you think it's probably involved in head trauma, it probably is and im being affected by it. There are no short term disability resources or checks in my state and I havent been able to go back to work, plus all the other things you can probably imagine going into having to survive and pay rent and food etc while not being able to work and having just recently used up all my emergency funds because I got fired because I texted my manager that I couldnt come into work that day because i was extremely ill and had no voice instead of calling out. I'm unfortunately dead serious. Was ill for over 2 weeks and applied for 58 jobs before getting one 3 months later, hence why I had already used my emergency savings. 

I've had several other people, including a therapist, confirm that I am quote on quote ""in the right"" concerning my friend, we'll call him Jack. Jack, long story short, has been gaslighting me, dismissing me, and saying things like ""you arent a victim. You did this to yourself,""(talking about my concussion) relative to several conversations I've tried to have with him. I had asked him to help me because i didnt know where i was or what i was doing in the middle of a Magic The Gathering game, to which he said ""No, you can handle yourself."" To which I responded, ""I have a concussion. I can't think."" But that's all I could say because..well..I couldn't think straight. Anyways, after the game, I went to text to him about it (I prefer text so that I dont forget the conversation that happened) and he completely blew up on me and tried to flip the script, then when that didnt work, tried some other stuff, and I kept asking him questions and doing ""therapy speak"" on him trying to get him to open up and to understand why the freak hes so defensive and angry when I didnt even accuse him of anything and thought him saying no i wont help you was a misunderstanding of just how bad my concussion was. 

Q a few weeks later. I've refused to play two commander mtg games with the pod of 4, me, Jack, a roommate and my FP. The other two players besides me and Jack also agree that Jack wasnt being nice that night (he also made several comments besides the main one that night). My FP wants to be out of the fight because we are mutual friends and I suggested that, since I dont feel safe playing with Jack (hes yelled at me for doing things during mtg in ways that i felt like i couldnt play a normal game without him yelling at me again) that he is more than welcome to play with my roommate and Jack at my house and then we can find a different night where I can play with FP and roommate. He says he doesnt want to take sides but I said that I didnt understand his logic because by playing these past games without me but having Jack but refusing to play with me and without Jack, he's already taken sides. After debating for a minute (not a fight) I came to the compromise that since I didnt feel comfortable playing games with Jack and he didnt feel comfortable playing games with me and not Jack, that we would play together or play at dedicated places that strangers can meet up to play with us so I dont have to miss out of playing with him. Thought all was scored.

Q yesterday, where Jack, FP, and roommate are playing a game and I'm upstairs, coming down periodically to just do some laundry but not really talk. Never gave anyone the stink eye, just minded my own business. Basically, the short version is that my FP got really mad at my roommate making a deal with him and then double crossing him, apparently multiple times, and my roommate was mad at my FP because apparently my FP was bribing Jack and vice versa with REAL MONEY. Saying ""hey if you dont hit me this round or play this card ill give you $30."" Stuff like that. Things got so heated that at one point, my roommate suggested that FP should come over and play with me and roommate like a real man so FP couldnt hide behind Jack (Jack likes to go to other players board and play their cards for them if they are in a bind or if it suits his interests, unless it's me, apparently. He's helped roommates game a few times but has never saw roommates cards and played one for him. He has done that multiple times, however, with FP.) 

FP got really mad and said that he just didnt want to get in the middle of it, and, even though I did tell my roommate that i felt bothered that he would play games with just Jack but not with just me, I also told my roommate that we had come to a solution. My roommate told both FP and Jack that they were ""terrible people"" and they got really offended. He apologized to them and said that they werent terrible people, but they were terrible friends. I never told roommate to say this and, from the story my roommate told me (I was upstairs the whole time) he never said ""OP said this about you/OP told me to say this."" Roommate just also felt like FP not playing with me was taking sides and knew the whole story and read the EXACT texts with Jack and I so he knew I wasnt lying about the horrible things hes said to me. FP stormed out of the house and said he was never coming over again. 

Before roommate told me the story, I messaged my FP and asked if everything was okay because I know normally he likes to hug me goodbye before leaving. No reply. A day later I sent him another text. No reply. He isn't the type to go several days without texting, even when hes upset, if he wants the friendship with you. He IS the type, however, to ignore your texts for days on end or just ghost someone out of the blue with no remore (picked a great FP, I know) if he doesnt want a friendship with you.

Great. So my roommate snapped my friendship with FP, and I'm pretty sure the same gaslighting Jack did on me he's doing on FP to get FP to think I'm the one in the wrong. So kind of a wombo jumbo of some sort. A double wammy. Now I have no more friends, and I have a concussion, I have brain damage from some other things going on with my neck (long story), and I cant go back to work, along with some other stuff that compounds. Having no one to just hold your hand and watch a funny movie while you have one of the most difficult times in your life is just brutal, man. Absolutely brutal."
517,3,"I’m in the early stages of pregnancy, and it’s honestly one of the hardest emotional experiences I’ve ever gone through. I’ve been having breakdown after breakdown…screaming, breaking things, saying horrible things to my partner that I deeply regret. I feel like I’m completely losing control.

The truth is… I’m not where I want to be to become a mom right now. And I have made a hard decision. It’s not one I ever thought I’d be faced with, and the weight of it is crushing. But I know it’s for the best…for my future, for my healing, for my stability.

What makes this even more heartbreaking is that deep down being a mom is everything I want. I used to think I was infertile. So finding out I can get pregnant brought me this quiet joy and hope, it was something I didn’t think was possible for me. In a strange way, I feel grateful… like my body whispered, “It’s possible.” But it’s also not the right time. And letting that go is devastating.

Everything feels louder, darker, heavier. I’ve had moments where I wished I could just disappear because the emotional pain feels so unbearable. But I also know that this is temporary that somehow, I’ll get through this, and it won’t feel this hard forever.

I don’t really know why I’m posting, maybe just to not feel so alone. If you’ve ever gone through anything like this, or even if you just want to say hi, I’d appreciate it.

Thanks for reading.

518,0,So I was diagnosed with BPD when I was 17 (22 now) and I’m seeing a new therapist. I just found out at my last appointment on Tuesday that my psychiatrist never even told him about it. I brought it up on Tuesday and basically he said “wish she’d told me now I understand you a little better”. I don’t know if I’m happy about him knowing now or if I wish I’d kept my mouth shut lol. 
519,2,I struggle with deep abandonment issues and trust issues.  I have been with my husband for 18 years.  He is the most loyal man I have ever met.  Yet I find myself constantly waiting for the other show to drop. I push him away constantly so afraid. Of him leaving me.  I fear for my life. I have never been so terrified that my mind will ruin my life.  
520,3,"Idk what to do anymore. I feel like internally I am going insane and I just want to beat the shit out of him. I have so much rage towards the person I thought was the love of my life. Now he just seems so distant and I have tried everything that I have been told to do that is the ""healthy"" and that still hasn't gotten me anywhere. Ive tried being honest about how I feel and how I feel neglected. And nothing. And so now I've turned to "" testing the relationship"" and being petty, and passive aggressive towards him and I constantly feel like he's pushing me to make me break and make feel like I'm the crazy bitch so he can look like the sane one. 

I'm so tired of relationships but all I want is to be in a stable relationship. Why is this so hard? "
521,1,"TW: for suicidal ideation as well (sorry can’t have more than one flare)


So I just got broken up with Tuesday. I got told it was apparently more causal for months. We were dating another woman together for six months about then me and her just fizzled out. He was still seeing both of us so I understood when he said he wanted more time to himself since he was juggling two people. He was seeing her 2-3 times a week though and me once. I knew she was going back to school soon, but it was really hurting my feelings. I was becoming way more anxious on a daily basis not knowing exactly when I was going to see him either. I also want to put here I’m not doing well financially on top of this. I sent him a screenshot of a note asking if these four days would work for me to see him and if I could sometimes see him twice a week. He responded with that he wanted a more flexible schedule. He said the feelings and attraction just haven’t been the same for him for a while. He said he was sorry he couldn’t give me the attention, affection, and love he used to because he knows I need that. He just was doing it for me and couldn’t anymore for who knows how long.

So, yes, I “crashed out.” It was before my meeting with my case manager so I proceeded to tell him there was no reason for me to keep trying because that was my small bright spot in life just gone. Worse than gone, he hadn’t been feeling it for months but still was having me over. We were still having sex off and on. I kept telling him how badly I wanted to kill myself. I full on felt as if I were dying anyway. Got my stupid ass sent to the ER, but I calmed down and was able to go home.

I saw my best friend that I’m FWBs with Thursday into yesterday. We had a ton of fun, and he always has cheered me up. He took me to Olive Garden, we got ice cream, had a nice walk, and the sex was bomb as always because we trust each other a lot. 

Now I’m home again though and realizing I won’t be going on a trip to see him mostly likely for another month. The anger, the tears, the lessened feeling of dying and more just heart break, are all starting up again. I also never did like being in my house alone many nights a week. I’ve struggled with this since I moved out five years ago. I feel very bored and empty and depressed living alone. I think it also reminds me of when I was left to my own devices a lot in middle school because I was a good kid so my parents didn’t “worry” about me. The emptiness I feel is so hard that I immediately want to start trying to find another person to date even though I’ve said I won’t. How do I get better at this? Do these feelings ever go away living on your own?"
522,2,"Im starting to think its outdated information on what is healthy, bc from what im aware just sitting there not doing anything makes you fucking hate them, makes you try to desperately figure out whos in the wrong, and give it half an hour and youre trying to kill yourself bc during the ""space"" youve been alone long enough to convince yourself its all your fault and you should be dead. Literally everytime ive tried to ""give space"" it takes about 10 minutes to convince myself i should die brutally and its the only way i can fix it. i can only imagine what my partner goes through.

now its 6 am. my partner hasnt turned towards me once in her sleep. she wanted space but im not stupid i know what space does. I tried so hard, so fucking hard to appease her and make her happy i tried everything i could think of but she insisted on space and i know now shes going to leave me. She was left alone for 4 hours, more than long enough time alone to come to the conclusion that im a horrible person. im dreading her waking up. 

She told me if i just... asked her for comfort everything wouldve been fine. But it wouldnt be fine. It wouldnt be real. If they dont offer comfort, they dont want to give it, so you DONT FUCKING ASK AND ANNOY PEOPLE. I was taught that my whole life. Didnt get comfort? You didnt deserve it, they didnt WANT to give it, bc if they really did they wouldve without asking. She doesnt understand. It needs to be real, it needs to be natural, and their idea. Otherwise its fake and i forced them to comfort me. No partner will say ""no"" to asking for comfort or thatd make them horrible, of COURSE theyre going to say yes. Doesnt mean they mean it. 

its 6 am and i cant go back to sleep. im dreading every second that passes. i dont know what to do now. 

Edit: I am so sorry to everyone who had to see me losing my shit. A few days later, ive snapped out of it. it took what caused this post to do so. My partner woke up being affectionate, and it confused me so much bc i was so certain she was gonna leave me that it snapped me out of it. Not before having an anxiety attack though </3 worst timing

I am also schizophrenic, and bpd and schizophrenia are actually a horrific combo. They literally work together to try to ruin your life if you dont take anti-psychotics. Im on meds, but no amount of meds can truly stop bpd spirals sadly </3 im hoping at least itll be a good while before the next one"
523,2,"My(F25) FP(M21) recently got a package from their female friend they met on Rednote out of no where and the box itself is absolutely covered in stickers and notes, she wrote like two whole pages worth of writing and it included lots of gifts. Like personally, I wouldn't do that much effort and writing for someone I'm only brief friends with? It's making me uncomfortable and I'm trying not to trigger over it. They also just don't understand why I'm so bothered by it like how can i not be!? that's so much effort no one sends all that without some clear intention.

I just want to know if I'm overreacting to this or if this is a valid thing to be upset about? Like, gosh. It's just making me feel so on edge like they're just going to abandon me over it."
524,3,"i really want to get better and i think that this will probably be my only shot at it, but im not sure if i can. i know logically speaking the ideal thing to do is to prioritize my studies and work and i truly wanna do that! but i dont think i can, what i mean is i just feel like theres something stopping me but i have 0 clue what it is! is it pure laziness? or do i just not want a good life?? i really dont wanna live my whole life like a zombie with 0 life goals staying in 1 place depending on others for my survival but i dont know how one even begins in improving their life

if i dont get my shit together ill probably end up either killing myself or leaching off others for survival and i dont wanna end up doing either things 

i dont want to let this disorder hold me down any longer but i also dont know what to do to get better, i really hope whoever is reading this understands what i mean as english is not my first language

any replies are appreciated (before you comment get therapy/go to a psychologist my next appointment is on monday 11am so dont worry i am getting professional help but its not really working out right now)"
525,2,"Hello all, I’ve met this guy at work. He’s been coming to my workplace for a few months now, very cute, kind, funny. Today we finally formally met, shook hands & I gave him his coffee. He later came back and asked for my number. We’ve been texting all night, he seems really awesome, I don’t want to get attached too fast, but that’s a whole other advice thread. But I’m vibing with him really well, and I don’t wanna mess this up. I’ve already made the “I’m crazy” jokes, and we literally had a conversation about being “double trouble” in a bar fight if it comes to it lol. But I know my bpd can affect my relationships a lot, I’ve been struggling with a fwb situation too and have been kinda down on myself. Again, whollleeeeee other thread. But idk, I’ve messed enough relationships up, being so aware it’s my bpd & just letting it happen. (I am attending my first dbt appointment next week to help with all of this!!! (: So excited I finally got recognized by the healthcare system, I literally got kicked out of cbt for being “too self aware”, they had more important patients) but anyways. When is too early to tell him I literally am clinically insane, I’ve got bpd along with a string of other disorders. I don’t wanna dump it all on him, but like idk. My bpd shows a lot, he’s actually seen it at work multiple times when he’s come in during a rush and I split on my coworkers, nothing crazy just muttering and looking angry. Any advice? I really don’t want to scare him away.."
526,1,"I honestly can’t stop thinking about him.
Every thought, every feeling — it’s all about this one person.
Since we broke up, it’s like life has lost all meaning. I don’t feel like existing. I’m not even interested in starting something new with anyone else — it feels like betrayal, even just imagining it.
I know people say time helps, that things get better, but right now I feel completely stuck in the past.
He wasn’t perfect — far from it. There were intense highs and painful lows, especially with the emotional unpredictability that came with his BPD. But still… I loved him more than I’ve ever loved anyone. I saw the pain behind his walls and I wanted to be someone who stayed.
But now he’s gone, and I keep wondering — is there any way back? Can relationships with someone who has BPD ever heal and work again? Is it just wishful thinking?
Please be kind. I’m not trying to romanticize the pain — I’m just grieving, deeply.
Any insight or shared experiences would mean a lot right now."
527,3,"So for full context, my GF got a new job recently. She moved back to her home state and has been searching for a job ever since. Last week, she found a good Japanese restaurant to work at, and she loves her coworkers there too. I was really happy for her initially because it provided her with new friends and the pay was good + she was happy. Now though, I'm starting to feel really aimless anger towards it.

Tonight is the second night where she's still working and it's 12am. I thought we were gonna sleep otp together, I didn't even know she was still working until she mentioned it in passing. I closed our messages and I don't have my notifications on because I can't talk to her right now. I'm going to get really upset and I'm already having urges to relapse. I don't know how I can manage this. I know its not her fault, she cant control how late they keep her, but i feel so upset and angry"
528,2,"Okay, title is exactly as it sounds. I’ve def been causing a little tension with my partner lately. I’ve just been feeling so anxious around them lately. Last night, they asked me if I could buy them a new vape or stop vaping off them which is a valid request, but all day today I am just thinking about how annoyed they must be, how I’m causing issues in their life, that I’m so draining on other people blah blah blah blah. 
Fighting every bone in my body to not call them and ask if they’re mad because that will actually be annoying. But I feel like I’m going insane like if I don’t get confirmation they’re happy with me I’m gonna start crashing out. What to do ???"
529,3,"Hey, guys! Boyfriend of someone with BPD. She doesn’t have the medication for it yet, if that means anything.

My girlfriend, let’s call her Amy, texted me earlier saying she thinks she is going to have another meal breakdown, and explained to me being incredibly overwhelmed and feeling like she is breaking too often.

The other day, while we were on the phone, I encouraged her to rehash some of her old friendships that she lost, just so she could have other healthy relationships and friends by her side. (I am her favorite person, but I know it feels isolating sometimes, and I really don’t want her to be too isolated all the time. I mean, I know it’s sometimes mentally necessary, but you all kwim). 

She was talking with her friend and catching up. She told me today that talking to her friend last night really made her realize how unstable she’s been. She told me she disassociates from that a lot, and hasn’t fully realized until just now. I told her it was likely because of her period, because like my periods, hers make her really emotionally vulnerable and whatnot. And consistently she started having more of the breakdowns she is referring to while she was on it/right before it, so I suggested that.

She says she doesn’t react to people normally, or situations, and it’s not fine because it is harmful to the people around her. I can tell she is very frustrated and angry with herself, and I am trying to reassure her that she is getting help soon, and that she literally cannot help the way she feels about people or situations (because she can’t). She believes it is still not an excuse and wholely not okay.

And it’s not, but I am biased because we are LD, and I may not see how she interacts in her every day life. I don’t feel harmed taking care of her or regarding her mental breakdowns, so I don’t get much what she means. But I believe her if she believes that. She is getting a lot of intense dread over hurting people that she has passively felt for about a year now, she says.

I have tried telling her maybe she can try to fix it, and she doesn’t believe trying has gotten her anywhere. After a bit I told her that once she gets a therapist again, she can get some advice and actual things to implement. And I asked her if she wanted me to search the Internet for some help and if she was okay with a post being made, so here we are.

What can I suggest to her that she can do? And most importantly, what is the best way I can support her?

TL;DR: girlfriend is upset that she has hurt others cause of her BPD, I don’t know how to advise her to help her. Please help!"
530,1,"Hey everyone,
I’m posting here because I feel completely lost. I (29M) just went through what feels like the final discard from my long-distance partner of 12 years. She (29F) has BPD, and for the past 1.5 years, our relationship has been a rollercoaster of extreme emotional ups and downs — mainly push/pull cycles, frequent splits, and painful discards.

She recently ended things with messages that weren’t angry — they were full of sorrow, calm, and finality. She said things like:

“I can’t keep waiting for a version of you that shows up fully.”
“I’ve already lost so much of myself trying to hold this together.”
“I need peace, not just love.”
“I’m not giving up on love — I’m choosing myself.”

That tone shook me. I’ve seen her split and discard many times, but this feels different. It doesn’t sound like she wants me to fight for her — it sounds like she’s emotionally done.

But here’s my side that I want people to understand — I’ve been through hell too. I’ve been hurt repeatedly by the words she said during splits, the shutdowns, the blocking, the cycles of feeling loved and then rejected. But I never held it against her. I always knew she wasn’t trying to hurt me — it was the BPD, the fear, the dysregulation. I stayed. I gave her my loyalty, my love, and my belief in her healing, even when I was mentally and emotionally falling apart.

The truth is, I started to shut down emotionally. I became numb. I didn’t express affection the way she needed. I didn’t make her feel special or safe — and I own that. I thought she was doing better recently, and I got complacent. I felt exhausted and depressed, my business was falling apart, and I just didn’t have energy left to “perform love” in the way she needed. And now that she’s finally walked away… I hate that the reason was something so simple and so in my control — like not showing up with love and consistency.

Despite everything, I still want to make this work. I love her deeply. I know she loved me too. I know people will say “you deserve peace” or “walk away” — but I’m not ready to give up yet. Not when I know what I did wrong. Not when I know I can do better now.

⸻

🙏 What I’m asking the community:
	•	Has anyone experienced something similar — especially with a BPD partner?
	•	If they walked away calmly like this, is there a chance they’ll come back?
	•	What’s the best thing I can do right now to not push her further away, but leave the door open?
	•	Is no contact the way to go right now?
	•	Can genuine, quiet growth on my end ever be enough for someone with BPD to see that I do love them, even if I failed to show it the right way before?

I’d appreciate honest advice — even the hard truths — from people who really understand BPD dynamics and long-term emotional burnout. I’m still here, not out of desperation, but because I believe in what we had. I just want one more shot to do it right."
531,1,"The meaning’s been gone for ages. They used me and tossed me aside. Then I tore myself apart just to throw myself away too. I’m done. Turns out, I’m not the brightest. Everything’s gone too far. "
532,1,Or was it always there. ??  Every single person that I loved has abandoned me at some point in my life. From childhood until now. 38 yo.  Both parents.  And step parents. To both long term partners of 9 years and 8 years.(mothers of my children.  F this illness and f this world I’ve had enough.  Everyone always gives up on me so fu££ this. I’m going to give up too.  I thought it was drink and drugs.  So stopped all that.  Still suicidal.  20 or 30 different meds. Still suicidal. Therapy. Guess what still fuc??n suicidal.  There is only so much a person can take. 
533,2,"I went to multiple therapists as a kid and had horrible experiences each time. The overall consensus was that I had really bad anxiety. I told myself that I would never go back to therapy. Now, as an adult, I regularly see a neurologist (I faint a lot). We were talking and it got brought up that I have pretty intense emotions. She ended up writing me a referral for therapy. I didn't want to go to therapy, but I did. Only because I hate fainting and want it to stop. My thinking was, ""if it really is my emotions that are making me faint, I want to do everything in my power to get them under control."" So I went and got diagnosed pretty quickly. My therapist recommended group DBT during our first session. 

At first, the diagnosis made so much sense. But now that I think about it, I don't understand how she diagnosed me so quick. It seemed like she knew I had BPD from our very first session. I am so confused how I got diagnosed because I was literally just honest and being myself. 😭

I'm not too sure if this thinking is rooted in reality but I'm pretty sure my neurologist and therapist think I'm faking. My neurologist probably sent me to therapy because she thinks I'm faking fainting. And my therapist diagnosed me with BPD right away to shut me up. I don't even think I'm really diagnosed with it. I'm pretty sure she only told me that I have BPD just to see my reaction. I feel like she thinks I looked up what the symptoms of BPD were online and reiterated it to purposely get a diagnosis. I did none of this. I am honest with my neurologist and therapist, but something deep inside of me is screaming that I am lying and purposely orchastrated this entire situation. I can't stop feeling guilty. Everytime I see both healthcare workers, I feel so ashamed of myself. I feel like I'm taking advantage of the medical system. 

What should I do? Should I tell them that I feel like they are distrusting me? I also told my therapist about my childhood and I feel like she is doubting that too as it sounds like an episode of it's always sunny. I don't know what to do or think, I feel paralyzed!!

"
534,2,Hey I'm talking to this girl I really like and it's been going well but she's been really expressive about her bpd. She's pretty awesome but today she had like a mood swing. She's always been nothing but sweet to me but today she said i'm trying to hard and it almost feels fake. It's not fake at all It's just the way i am. Anyways i decided to tell her that im sorry if it looks like im being to intense and ill relax. She's really open about all of her family problems too (she has a good amount of them) She has a history of self harm and depression and im just wondering if anyone has any advice for me. Is there anyway i can help out just a bit.
535,3,"I'm just so tried of it. I can't help but care about the people I love, and when they're struggling I want to be there for them in every way possible. I'd give everything for my close friends and (some) family. 

But I feel like I'm carrying everyone's burdens around with me 24/7. There's so many secrets that people confide in me that I can't tell anyone else, and they're fucking heavy. It means a lot that they trust me but my mind is FULL of everyone else's problems. I feel like I can't even scratch the surface of my own trauma. I can only afford therapy twice a month if that, and it's just not enough to offload all the shit in my mind. 

I remember telling my mum that she could do with therapy after she essentially had a therapy session with me, and she just said ""do you really think I'm bad enough for therapy?"" I guess that suggestion doesn't matter if I'm filling that role "
536,2,"I (25F) was diagnosed with BPD at the beginning of this year. Up to that point, I had never had any desire to seek out a relationship. I contemplated a lot whether or not I was asexual or something was very wrong with me. Maybe other people with bpd have experienced this? Anyway, I was prescribed estilaphram and it's helped me come out of my shell a bit. I got into a relationship and it hasn't been the healthiest. It's had a lot of ups, but a lot of downs too. He hasn't hurt me or anything else, if you wondered. Everyone I know tells me that I'm better off alone or I can find someone better suited. I can see why, but why is it so hard for me to let go of the relationship? I've grown an emotional bond with him and I fear abandonment. That's one of my biggest issues and fears. Has anyone else with BPD experienced a hard time letting go of someone who you've become close with? Whether that be a friendship, or relationship. I'd really like to know. Thank you!"
537,1,"Psychologist let me know today she's not going to be practicing anymore, probably for the next 6 months if ever. 

I feel like a piece of me died when she said it. I went from being on the edge to finally feeling heard and understood by someone and it gave me a second shot at life. I know I'm not being abandoned, but I feel abandoned. 

I'm honestly a completely different person to who I was a year ago, even on my worst days. I can actually sometimes self regulate, step away from things, sit on my big emotions. She's the gentle parent voice in my head that helps me work through things in healthier ways which I never had as a kid. I know that those skills won't go away once we've ended the therapeutic relationship but she's been such an integral part of my journey and it hurts to see that go. "
538,2,I haven't had a fp in a while and have since realized it's probably in my best interest to not have one as losing my last one was pretty detrimental to my health and having one in the past has put a strain on my relationships/friendships with people. I was hoping someone may have some advice on how to hopefully not develop one again or at least to try and avoid it?
539,2,"my overthinking got to a breaking point today, me and my girlfriend don’t argue, because she is so patient with me that it never gets to that point- but she dropped something today that feel like it has completely ruined my perspective of our relationship. 

we’ve been together for about a year and a half, and today she told me that early on in our relationship she decided that she would give up trying to keep up with her friends and social life after an incident where i split on her while she was out with her friends ( terrified that she met someone else when she was out, ect, you know how it goes ).

it just broke my heart. i see myself getting married to her and spending the rest of my life with her, i still do, but i don’t want to do that to her detriment. i have always said i never want to separate her from her friends, but ive done exactly that. i’m so tired of genuinely meaning everything i say, but my actions never reflecting that. 

i asked if we should break up, yet she reassured me multiple times that she wants to stay with me, that she loves me and can’t be without me. i can’t fathom why, i feel terrible, and i borderline tried to convince her to leave me despite that being exactly the opposite of what i want. 

i just don’t know how to get out of this hole of genuinely wanting her to expand her horizons, but when it actually comes to it, i shut down, become jealous and anxious and ruin it for her. i dont want our relationship to be a sacrifice she has to make. 

if anyone has any advice on how i can get over this, please, please let me hear it. i am tired of hurting the person that i love the most. "
540,3,"No friends, no family members who show they care about me, and a spouse who also is infuriating and can't show me they care. I'm overwhelmed, constantly in uproar and can't do anything. I just want it all to end."
541,1,"so, I (26)F have been off my meds for awhile/ have not been consistent about taking them. (i am back on track now, and have a psych apt scheduled) this past week has been extremely hard. i have been so depressed, crying on and off for hours everyday, extremely agitated to the point im punching and breaking things. i have not let my bf see my aggressive behavior, ive been able to keep it contained to in private. we had a deep convo and he said hes numb to my depression, that he just takes a step back, and it’s too much for him. too much so in the fact he shared he thought about leaving me at times. he says he still loves me, but I cannot shake this. my worst fear of him abandoning me could be a reality. this has been playing in my head like a loop, i wish my emotions didn’t go from 0-100. fuck this disorder man. "
542,2,"So I was diagnosed in 2021 with bpd. I work on myself constantly but I just entered into a new relationship and it’s getting serious. He’s a great guy! So good to me and accepting but of course, my brain feels different. I can’t tell you how many times I have asked him if he’s sure he wants to be with me or if he’s sure he’s into me as he says he is. The constant paranoia of if he is really into me or is just saying that and just the constant feeling I have to question things is exhausting and he’s done nothing for me to be questioning. I’m sure it’s getting annoying and I’m scared he’s gonna run. He knows I have bpd and is very supportive. Any advice would be much appreciated! Thanks for reading!"
543,2,"To start off, I’m not diagnosed with BPD but that’s because I just started therapy and haven’t had more than one session so far so I haven’t been able to bring that up yet. But as the title says, I feel like I’m ruining my relationship. My gf is very understanding and says that she is okay with all of my mental stuff, but I know my tendency to freak out is weighing on her. Every time she’s a little bit off or something goes wrong, I either get very anxious or very rude. I say things I don’t mean and wouldn’t say if I was thinking straight. I just have so many emotions and I want to know if there’s any advice for dealing with it. I can’t keep ruining perfectly good days for her and everyone else. I love her more than anything and I’m not willing to lose her over my shitty problems, so any advice?"
544,2,"Hello, is it common in bpd to lack awareness of the severity of situations or to be unaware of danger, without it being suicidal in the moment?  It’s like being a child who’s completely unaware and relies on loved ones to point everything out. For example, constantly putting oneself in danger without realizing it, not knowing what could be deadly, and sometimes, during dissociation, doing serious things and forgetting them upon returning to reality, yet still being in danger despite oneself. This very often put me in danger.. What can be done? Thank you"
545,0,"Just wondering if not having FP is a rare case…
I was diagnosed 2 years ago, meet 9/9 criteria. I always see that people on different BPD sites and subs have a FP, but I never had one. Do you have similar experience?"
546,1,"My BPD-

• A strong fear of abandonment. This includes going to extreme measures so you're not separated or rejected, even if these fears are made up.
• A pattern of unstable, intense relationships, such as believing someone is perfect one moment and then suddenly believing the person doesn't care enough or is cruel.
• Wide mood swings that last from a few hours to a few days. These mood swings can include periods of being very happy, irritable or anxious, or feeling shame.
• Ongoing feelings of emptiness.
• Inappropriate, strong anger, such as losing your temper often, being sarcastic or bitter, or physically fighting.

Other things I suffer from-
  
• major depressive disorder
• anxiety 
• social anxiety
• probable ADD/ADHD
• past eating disorders 
• possible Bipolar 
• possible OCD symptoms 
• past attempts
• past self harm"
547,3,"Several years ago I was diagnosed with this Silly Emotions Disorder and took DBT and some pretty intensive therapy for it, but I was also in a truly garbage situation both relationship and living situation-wise. I moved back in with my folks(boo) and am still in a shitty living situation now but at least I have an understanding long-distance boyfriend and no one yells at me anymore! Sometimes it feels like things are going really good, and then I trip up and do something stupid and the immediate emotional response is just.. revulsion with myself. I feel like a caged dog almost, it's like this feral energy that doesn't have anywhere else to go. 

I hate it because it feels like I'm on the outside looking in - I know these emotions don't necessarily make sense when compared to the trigger, and I know it's harming my relationship, but it feels like my brain is so stubbornly set on 'freak out mode' lately. My SO and I do a lot of writing/role-playing as a way to bond, and I found out he has other characters with other people, which is fine, I think..? It's so hard to wrap my mind around it. He's Poly but extremely respectful and honest about it, and I don't even think I'm actually mad about him dating someone else(he informed me when it was a confession, and again when they became a thing), I'm just hurt that they've written stories together, with original characters I used to love and sex and children and families and all of the worldbuilding we used to do. I'm just afraid I'm going to lose him, but I can't talk to anyone else about this because it's absolutely ridiculous. It's just words, it's just fake characters. Aaah. 😭"
548,2,I'm leaving my FP for a few months.  We have been inseparable for a lo g time.  I'm taking my medicine and am stable.  Do I talk to my FP on the phone e while I'm gone or would that just hurt me more?  Would I just be an emotional burden for her?  Boundaries?  Ideas? 
549,2,"Does anyone else sometimes want a new fp? I love my current fp and they make me so happy, but i feel like im just scared theyre going to leave or get bored of me and i want to find someone new and get attached to them before that happens. This occurs with every fp ive had, and im just wondering if its a common experience."
550,1,"i seriously don’t know what’s wrong with me recently and i just need to rant but i’ve been stuck in an anger episode for days now i just split on everyone and i get so mad. I don’t feel stressed, i’m taking good care of myself and do my chores i don’t feel depressed but i just can’t stop the feeling of anger i just wish i could be alone for ten fucking years i hate everyone right now and i keep fucking saying awful things i feel as if everyone is out to get me and do things to hurt me intentionally i feel like i can’t take a deep breath everything is so IN MY FACE i just want to block everyone and start over i hate everything i hate everyone so much. i told my boyfriend i hate him and that he’s stupid and i don’t even feel bad but i know i should. "
551,0,"My friend hast quiet bpd and I would like to know your opinions on how to build a better friendship with him because it is hard to talk with him about it.

He is often isolates, socially withdraws, doesnt answer texts, is easily stressed and told me that he doesnt feel like people like him.

I tried to offer him social activities, by inviting him when im out with friends(or sometimes just him and me) what he often declines.

Then I thought i could at least integrate him socially by sometimes sharing personal stuff to make him feel included(almost never answers unless he can closely relate to the topic)

And lastly I try to make him feel appreciated by giving him short positive feedback about our interactions, to which he almost never answers what I think is somewhat weird because he is really apologetic and sincere when being criticised.

To conclude, I dont really know how to continue and would value any Input or feedback you can give me."
552,1,"Me and my boyfriend just decided to break up mutually, we want to stay really good friends though but I’m still feeling absolutely heartbroken right now to the point i feel like ending my life to end this overwhelming pain"
553,2,"I’m feeling sensitive to loved ones’ tone of voice and text messages, I know I’m overthinking it or misinterpreting it that they don’t mean harm, idk why the little things feel threatening to a relationship "
554,3,"I confided in a close friend, Cam about my BPD and I feel like I made a huge mistake.

My BPD is pretty well-managed, I always try to sort through my feelings before I bring them up and I always do so respectfully, not with emotional outbursts even though it can be really hard to keep in. This past week I had a hard conversation with my best friend,  Jess, after talking about it with my therapist & we mutually discussed how to bring it up.

Well, Jess took it pretty badly and left without any resolution. They acknowledged that my feelings were valid and they were at fault, but left when I was looking for support. After that, I spiraled and bailed on a scheduled hangout with some other friends. This is extremely unusual behavior for me. I NEVER bail on plans at the last minute, as it's a pet peeve of mine. I felt terrible and apologized, and tried seeking support from some members of this group, but didn't receive any response. This stung, and made the abandonment I was already feeling much worse. I acknowledge they don't have to comfort me after I've neglected them, but at the same time, this is one out of a handful of times that I've been responsible for canceling, where other people in the group have done the same.

I tried scheduling an appointment with my therapist, but she couldn't fit me in.

This is where I tried confiding in Cam. I told them about what had happened with Jess, and the other group. And despite not having been there for either of those things, Cam started telling me I was selfish & manipulative for trying to discuss my feelings with Jess, that I wasn't owed comfort or support, that I treated my friends terribly etc etc. All they could focus on was the fact that I ""made"" Jess feel so bad that they left, even though Jess themselves agreed that they were in the wrong, and how that plus my behavior with the other group ""looked bad."" And I admit, it DOES look bad, but it's like it's impossible for Cam to imagine a scenario where someone could treat me poorly.

Then Cam suddenly brought up a bunch of other issues they had with me that they'd never mentioned before. That I'm mean and I haven't given my friends enough time (even though we have a weekly hangout that I show up to every week & random movie nights besides that?).

I acknowledge that bailing on the group was irresponsible, but this is the only time I've done that. It's not an excuse, but it just feels unfair to label me as selfish and a terrible friend because of a mistake that's extremely out of character. And it also feels uncalled for to suddenly bring up their issues with OUR friendship as proof that I'm in the wrong in a completely different situation.

I previously told Cam about my BPD and idk. It kinda feels like they've just decided that I'm manipulative and toxic and are working backwards from there. I've also TOLD them about how afraid I am of treating my friends unfairly, and how hard I work to combat that. It feels like they're targeting the thing I'm most afraid of. I don't want to just dismiss them out of hand because I accept that I'm not perfect. But it feels like they're seeing a pattern that just doesn't exist because they suddenly have a problem with me. I feel completely messed up and don't know what to believe at all because now I'm worried that all my efforts to avoid being manipulative have backfired completely."
555,2,"My friend's FP is this guy he met online 6 months ago (goes deeper than just a FP though, my friend definitely has a crush on him as well). They have a deeply unhealthy dynamic- he does not give my friend the time of day and is quite dismissive towards him-.FP also has a tendency to make everything about himself and guilt my friend. It's like every molecule of my friend's self-worth hinges on what this guy thinks of him(and I don't say that with judgement, I had a VERY similar dynamic with my ex-best friend).

He latches on to every miniscule thing the FP says or does as proof that he cares about him and then lapses into self-hatred when FP ignores him or does something mean. I don't know the FP well enough to say if he's necessarily a bad guy, but their dynamic is definitely unhealthy and continuously has a bad effect on my friend's mental health and self-esteem.

We're at a point where my friend is fully aware and has admitted that they have an unhealthy dynamic and he needs to cut ties. But he won't and he hates himself for staying. I'm trying to be supportive but I don't know how to help him. He talks to me about it a lot and asks for my opinion but whenever I say something he doesn't want to hear he shuts me down and says he's not comfortable with the conversation which is frustrating cause I want to respect him and his boundaries but we're also not going to get anywhere if he asks for my opinion and then shuts down when I say something he doesn't want to hear.

I just really want to help him- advice?"
556,2,"Hi guys. I don't really post on reddit, but I don't really want to use my main for this. My spouse is hypersexual and diagnosed with BPD. I do not have BPD, and I am asexual (it fluctuates but for the past few months I've been completely sex repulsed). I have nothing against her, in fact I love her deeply and despite being new weds we have been together for quite the time. I just feel like every time I bring up the fact I'm ace, she splits on me and I never really know how to handle it. She won't listen to me when I stay calm, and at this point I'm finding it hard to believe me being asexual isn't becoming an issue. I know she's splitting, I know she isn't in the right headspace when she insults our marriage but it still gets to me... A lot. Can't say I really enjoy being called friends, even while knowing this is an episode. Is there anything I can do for her to help? Is there a way I can calm her down? I don't want my asexuality to cause her to split anymore but I'm just kinda lost. Sorry this is all over the place, I'm a bit panicky right now I just dunno where else to turn to. I'm sorry if anything I've said was insensitive. I know how to calm myself down at this point I just want to know what I can do for *her* specifically. Thank you."
557,2,"So I’ve (22f) been dating my boyfriend (20m) for a year now and he truly does make me very happy. However, I’ve been feeling extremely terrible and anxious purely because he’s been spending more time gaming with his friends.

I don’t mind that he’s hanging out with friends, but it’s the fact that he can go all day without even a check in text for hours on end or even half the day which makes me feel like I’m just a second thought to him. I know that’s not true, but battling these thoughts makes me feel like I’m in a damn war zone and I just don’t matter to him at all. 

I’ve communicated my thoughts and feelings to him to the best of my ability before as this has happened in the past, but now that it’s happening again I’m not sure what to do. I don’t want to feel this way and I don’t want to do anything to ruin my relationship as I truly love him and want a future with him. I’m terrified of blowing up and splitting and saying something I don’t mean.. My BPD has been getting worse lately as I’m currently unmedicated and previous methods I’ve used to get my thoughts under control are no longer working. 

Please what can I do to get these thoughts and feelings under control? I need help. "
558,1,"Hi there. I am a 22-year-old man, currently diagnosed with Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. I have had a terrible life, not just a traumatic childhood, but a painful teenage phase and young adulthood as well.

My father was well-educated and used to work in South Korea. He fell in love with a Korean woman, and they both wanted to marry. But when he returned to Pakistan, my paternal grandfather didn’t allow him to go back and marry her because of religious, race, cultural, and ethnic differences. While in South Korea, my father drank a lot of alcohol, and after being forced to stay in Pakistan, he began to mentally and behaviorally fall apart. My paternal grandmother, his mother, was already a diagnosed schizophrenic.

After that breakdown, my grandfather arranged his marriage with my biological mother. Initially, my maternal grandfather was hesitant to accept the proposal, but he was convinced by my paternal grandfather, who told him that his son was only acting psychotic because of drinking abroad, and he would recover soon. My parents got married.

When I was around 6, my father completely lost touch with reality. He got diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder and left me and my mother. Since then, I haven't spoken to him. He is still alive, wandering the streets, shouting, abusing people, and laughing to himself.

At the age of 13, my maternal uncle took me to a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with OCD and Schizoaffective Disorder too, mostly because of strong genetic predisposition. But in my country, the mental health system is a complete mess, unethical and incompetent, so life just dragged on with antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and antidepressants.

When I was 8, I was sexually abused for a year by a family member. Then again at 13, I was raped by another man from my town. At 8, I wasn’t even aware of what was happening, so it didn’t bother me as much. But at 13, when it happened again, my body dissociated. I felt like I was dreaming, like nothing was real. I went numb. I was terrified he’d kill me afterward, but he didn’t. He just gave me a trauma I have carried ever since.

By the age of 22, I have tried to take my life three times. First at 17, due to existential despair. Second time at 19. Third time at 21. Each time, I was driven by a mess of nihilism, extreme paranoia, self-hatred, academic pressure, family dysfunction, relationship chaos, irreligious disconnection, and unrealistic wishful thinking. What stopped me, sometimes barely, was either luck or my love for mother.

And there's been a lot of self-harm. I have done it more times than I can count. My thighs, hips, and back are covered in scars. I once thought of going even further, something that would leave a mark people couldn’t ignore, but I stopped myself. The thought of my mom seeing it haunted me more than the urge itself.

Right now, my mental condition is awful. It is pure psychological agony, no relief at all. My current psychiatrist, whom I have been seeing since January 2025, diagnosed me with Complex PTSD and BPD. He still hasn't recommended therapy because he believes I am not mentally stable enough yet to sit through it.

He has me on:

Lurasidone 120 mg

Olanzapine 5 mg

Lithium 1200 mg

Sertraline 200 mg

Clonidine 0.1 mg

The only thing that keeps me alive, barely, is music and escapism.

559,1,"I texted pieta house yesterday. It took them 3 minutes to respond from when I texted them. They asked what's wrong. I sent back ""I've had an awful week and I feel worthless. I'm crying in a supervalue bathroom right now"" 4 minutes ago. I texted ""I've began my leaving cert, and I've been doing pretty badly. My parents have been mean to me and have been annoying me. Yesterday I decided to ask a guy in my class to the debs. We're not close but I have a crush on him. When I first told him he thought I was asking if I could go in a group with him, and he said I could go. I then clarified that I meant just me and him. He thought for a while and i kept repeating its fine if he doesnt. I cant even remember if he said no, I tried to get away as fast as I could when he didnt say yes straight away. I have no friends so I've felt really lonely"" and they texted back 3 lines. I texted them a bit more. It felt like I was answering a questionnaire. I felt worse after it. I eventually told them I was going to the cinema, I was but not for another 2 hours, I just wanted to stop talking to them. I didn't go to the cinema, my choices were the newest mission impossible, I have seen any of the other ones so i decided not to see it, lilo and stitch, and how to train your dragon, and a xouple of movies id already seen. I have an omnipass, so i only have to pay a euro to see a movie, but I decided not to go, I didn't want to spend 2 hours by myself in a massive room filled with people. I'm feeling a bit better today, I've been waiting 3 hours for destiny 2 and all its dlc of ps plus to download, but i still have to wait another hour. I'm doing ok, you don't have to worry, I'm not in any danger "

561,1,"Why do I attribute my self image/worth to how I think others view me?? I often  have thoughts of no one liking me that I try to  challenge but I keep thinking why doesn't anyone like me, why do I feel alone. Why do I lack the motivation to live, why is it I feel too tired to be alive. I would rather not think at all, I hate feeling paranoid because I feel like all my thoughts are illogical but that's the way I feel. I feel alone forgotten and the emotions I feel towards others feel irrational and too much all the time, I just want to shut my brain off and drift into nothingness. Every time I feel positive it feels fake, like it's not me and it's just me lying to myself so that I don't commit to SI."

563,2,"I'm almost done DBT after 2.5 years and the past several months have been the longest sustained period in which I've experienced unpleasant challenges that have affected me emotionally; and yet I haven't acted on my emotions. During this period of stability, I haven't done any emotional damage or anything to make me feel ashamed despite my urges.

Despite my pride and progress, I'm sitting here writing this as I'm desperate to act on the emotions I'm feeling because I'm upset and nothing feels better than lashing out on somebody who has upset me. Part of the reason why I'm choosing to post here is because I'm too embarrassed to call my therapist because what's causing me to feel this way seems silly. 

I have/had a crush on somebody. I won't get into a lot of detail, but if you're curious to know more about my crush than you can go through my post history. 

This is hard to write, but I'm feeling rejected by my crush which is making me angry. I saw him on Tuesday, he was on the phone and it sounded like he had to go into an urgent meeting. On Wednesday, I saw him (don't know if he saw me) but I stood there for 2 minutes. Although I think he's been flirting with me, I am way too shy and socially awkward to confirm one way or another.

To add to my ""rejection"" yesterday I emailed him saying, ""Remember that nice thing you said you were going to do for me a month ago? It still hasn't happened yet."" He replied to me apologizing saying he'll do it right away and said that it probably got lost due to our lengthy emails between each other. That added to the rejection I'm feeling from him along with anger because he's the one who started sending me long emails. I hastily replied back saying I'll never send him another email again. He replied back to me and I archived the email without reading it.

I don't even know for sure if he's gay/queer and if he is, than I also don't know for sure if he was flirting with me or just being overly-friendly. I also know that I've purposely been avoiding him in-person and thus coming across as uninterested; if that's the case than he could be feeling rejected by me. 

I have the urge to completely release my emotions on my crush because of what I'm feeling, despite it not being backed up much and my feelings aren't his problem. I feel like him and I are finished despite the fact that we never really started; I also don't know if this is true.

Although I haven't read his latest reply to me, I think it's safe to assume he's told me he's not discouraging me from not emailing him at all. I know that if he also has a crush on me, releasing my emotions on him will guarantee nothing will ever happen between us. In the grand scheme of things, my sassy reply isn't the worst thing I could have done and there's an opportunity for me to walk it back; I'm near certain that I haven't passed the ""point of no return.""

I'm feeling shame for putting him on a pedestal and expecting so much from him while giving so little in return. I don't know what to do next other than reading his reply to me and possibly sending him a much shorter reply walking back my sassiness. I know that replying angrily or doing something nasty isn't the solution and yet I'm desperate to find a release for the intense emotions I'm currently feeling."
564,1,"
I’ve never been diagnosed with BPD or tested for it professionally. I have gone to therapy for GAD and it somewhat helped ease my brain. But the more I research about this disorder, the more I notice how much I relate to the symptoms, especially the obsession part. 
In 2023, I had a small crush on this girl that snowballed into a very painful obsession. I was in shambles thinking about her for hours everyday, and it ended in me confessing my love to her knowing damn well she had a girlfriend. I sobbed over the phone, was embarrassing looking back. Years before that, me and my family had to abruptly move to a different state. I had a close friend in the area we were living in, and I would stay up every night for months crying hysterically over the fact that I would never talk to her again. And I mean EVERY night, until like 3am. It was a miracle I was not exhausted in my day to day life. 

These incidents didn’t seem like much until I realized this is how I handle virtually all of the close friendships or relationships I’ve ever had. I could dive into others but they’re similar to the examples listed above. One of my friendships I broke off by going on a very destructive and rage-filled rant. This was over text, and I took screenshots to go over what I said when in a better state of mind, and GODDAMN. I looked utterly insane. I said I would harm myself physically and accused this person of a lot of stuff that seemed justified in my angry brain. When I looked over it after that incident, it was almost laughable how I thought I was in the right. 

Nowadays, I find myself in a similar situation of being obsessed with a person who doesn’t reciprocate. The pain of knowing they don’t care about me as much as I care about them dwelled on my mind and eventually I resorted to cutting myself a few days ago. I was also really jealous whenever I saw them talking to their friends and ruminated about it for weeks.
I recently blocked them to avoid a repeat of the angry rant with the other friend. It seriously hurts, and it annoys me that I need to do this whenever I get too close to someone. "
565,3,"For most of my \[M33\] life, with or without knowing it, I've experienced violent rage in response to things not being the way I want them to be. This has often been triggered by my mum but comes up when I am trapped in historical resentment at people / places / things I feel have wronged me. 

Other times it's just dealing with day-to-day life while feeling that I'm on a treadmill to unconsolable grief and devastation. I step out of isolation and I experience: ""oh my god what am I doing I need to stop but I can't because it's so unbearable and ohmygod mum's going to die what am I going to go do""... and the grief comes

The feelings of rage that I feel are overwhelming and lead to problems in my personal relationships / self harm / breaking things / getting into altercations / staying in painful relatioinships etc etc.

With my mum, with people who wronged me it is a feeling of ""HOW COULD THEY / Why ARE THEY F-ING DO THIS TO ME?! HOW DARE THEY DO THIS TO ME?!"" 

It's part righteous(as-I-see-it)-anger, it's hurt, but underneath (and especially when it's just me on my own) it's shame, grief, torment, a feeling of a total loss of agency / control and devastating remorse at  the gulf between me and my mum as I see it. ""TAKE IT AWAY MUM, TAKE IT AWAY!""

I am not confident that in every case, the rage, OR even me being ""right"", can be justified. Did my mum really do to me what I think she did? If she did, why the rage? Why can I not just move on? Why does it never go away? Why does the pain never go away?

When I think of it with my mum, and a previous girlfriend, or a previous bully, I become so angry it manifests in my body. I feel I can justify so much of it towards my mum ""she was awful, you weren't there you don't know"" but I'm questioning that now. Whether true or not, I can't get to a consistent story on ""how things were"" and even when I feel I can I'm so overwhelmed with pain and ""MUM MAKE IT GO AWAY!"" that I hide and avoid. 

I feel lots of this rage comes from a real core wound lack of self-esteem or ""the emptiness"" (one that I feel my mum and dad both have) that is so absolutely unbearable to feel (it feels like a mortal wound) it becomes ""I cannot countenance this person 'winning' so they're going down"". In those moments it's so hard to access ""wise mind"" / ""truth"" / ""what would be helpful to do"". (I partly think unless I'm able to get into and through that wound once and for all I will never truly ""get out"" of what feels like the destructive or avoidant cycle I'm in).

Does anyone have strategies for dealing with this rage (or ideally not ending up in it in the first place) when it comes up? When I'm faced with my mum a metre away and I feel unbearable anger and frustration I can't access anything other than resentment at how I feel she is unjustly treating me (some of the time she is). I dunno. At the moment I feel my life is not liveable; all roads lead to hell."
566,1,Recently got diagnosed with BPD this isn’t the first time I feel like I’ve lost all sense of self after a breakup it’s times like these that I truly hate this disorder I feel like I have no idea who I am anymore I feel like I have no plans or hopes for the future because eveeyhting I did have involved my ex life just feels very confusing and hazy I hate it and have no idea how to find myself again 
567,1,I hate being told that i need to do things on my own or that i need to rely on myself or that i need to grow up or whatever  .my entire life has been me being on my own why is it so wrong to want to be taken care of. i dont understand it why do i always have to be alone why cant i rely on someone to love me and take care of me and find me special why cant i have someone take care of me. ive been alone and taking care of myself since forever i just want someone to take care of me for once. i wish i was still a little kid so tgat i could be taken care of instead of having to be independent. i hate this i feel sick what did i do to deserve nobody ever being therebfir me. i know i sound like im whining i dontcare anymore im so tired and cantnstop cryigg 
568,2,"tl;dr my ex girlfriend has bpd and keeps hurting me on purpose despite telling me to move on as well as saying she wishes we could get back together but ""cant""

we've been broken up since the start of may and it has been an absolute rollercoaster. me and her are very attached to each other (i'm her fp) and it has been hell to navigate :( she is scared of me loving her and it breaks my heart because it shouldn't be like that. she doesn't want a repeat of all the bad things that happened but i find that silly because i just want to work through whatever comes at us together. regardless of all the recent bad i still love her and i don't think she's a bad person in the slightest, but she just doesn't believe me (or anyone for that matter). she just wants me to move on because it would be better for me but it doesn't feel that way at all... i don't want to move on. you cannot expect me to move on when you tell me you wish you could be ""normal"" and accept that i love you or that you wish we could be together but we can't. how am i supposed to accept that? what am i supposed to do to get through to her? i feel horrible being so angry and upset but i genuinely feel cheated. she wanted me for the longest time and finally got me but is now running away... it just hurts. i'm not going to be satisfied unless she agrees to be with me again or at least seriously promises we'll get back together after we both do serious work on ourselves. i'll even settle for that at this point. what can i do to get through to her?

569,1,So today I had my second episode this week and wanted to end my life.  Or change how I felt  if only briefly. I have been crying on and off for around 7 days. Really struggling which my partner knew.  (Had to move out because got sectioned) last year.  Was heavy cocaine user and my partner gave me the ultimatum to stop or would leave me.  As hard as it was. I needed her. So went to na meetings every day for past 3 months but today I fucked it all up and now she is done.  I have a massive fear of abandonment and can’t think of life without out her.  I was suicidal before this. And now I am planning this out.  I don’t know what to do. I genuinely think my kids and everyone is better off without me.  I fucking hate my self and the person I am.  I can’t keep fighting this illness anymore 
570,2,"Does anyone struggle with having a lot of voices in my head? 
Like.. 4 thoughts fighting each other: a screaming crying young child, an adult that’s trying to calm down the child, a young consciousness that’s just tired being good, and a rebellious teenager that just want to put on rock music. I know they’re all me (I guess) and they don’t have individual names or memories or anything like that. The ‘personality’ consciousness that pop out differ from time to time. "
571,2,"So the girl I like PwBPD 27f has been talking to me and for a while now I know she lives with her now ex. At the start of talking to me a few months ago she wasn't happy with him living there and was asking him to leave and sounded like he might do but then he said he can't afford to move out to her or things like that. Since then I did meet up with her and she has become more depressed the week after meeting me and she still talks to me and things but I for some reason feel as though the way she is living with him doesn't sound right and can't really tell why as she doesn't fully say and I'm not one to push on to questions as I don't want to sound as though I am coming on too much about things with her situation with him. She has said things over time which I don't think sounds too good now that I re think about it and the person she lives with now ex she told me he shouted at her and also at the dog and I don't know or not but I starting to think the maybe there must be more to the situation. As the past week for context she has very subtly said things like she may want to be back on anti depressants as it is not like her ever to say things like that, Not in my view of her anyway. But straight after she said he shouted she sounded like she tried to have an excuse for his actions. I am concerned as I do like her and I had thought someone with BPD maybe isn't good to be around someone who does shout or maybe I don't know be more a bad way which I can't say yet as not much has been said and I don't want to assume things. I only have really thought about it as since meeting me it seems like she hasn't been too well even though she sounds like she is okay wanting to talk to me still. If I were to try and ask her if she is okay is there a good way to ask as I am not wanting to come across as going to tell her to leave or do anything like that but I assume some things are not good and would be good if she could maybe hear from someone that is is not good for someone to shout at people. Or come across in some threating way 

Thanks any help welcome"
572,2,"Well. I split again. I finally found the perfect most understanding guy and I can’t stop cutting him off every other week. We’ve been talking 3 months and it was great up until like 1.5 months ago. He sucks at texting. Which is huge for me and I’ve told him this multiple times. We finally hung out and it was perfect but then he goes missing for over 24 hours. No text or anything. So eventually he reaches out saying he’s busy with his friends sorry he didn’t text. Also, he went on a week long vacation without telling me which I guess I’m not really entitled to know but that’s so strange not to mention. He knows this texting thing bothers me and continues to do it. I know I can’t change him it’s just so frustrating. So anyway I told him that he’s obviously not interested and he insisted he is. I also said there must be someone else involved for him to go missing so long and he swears up and down there isn’t. I wrecked it all though so too late. I ended up texting him asking if we can talk in person but no response…."
573,0,"I’m curious, if anyone here believes in stuff like having “intuition”, how do you tell the difference between what is your intuition and what is like an intrusive thought? Is there a feeling you get to distinguish the two or how would you explain it? "
574,2,"This I believe has something to do with attachment maybe, but Im not sure. It makes me sad when I know I won't be able to communicate with my partner for awhile and they don't truly seem bothered.

Like, I am going traveling which I am SUPER excited for. But I'll be in a whole different time zone and won't have my own private room to do calls or watch shows. I plan on still being able to message if I get wifi, but I want to enjoy the moment. Anyhow, I get sad when my partner doesn't really seem bothered by the fact that we will have limited communication, like they're just doing what they always do and like everything will be okay.

Perhaps being sad is the wrong word here but I am confused by it. If I knew they were going somewhere I would want to make sure I'd call them before their flight. We did call last night too so I am probably just waaay overthinking this. I get very nervous when we're away but I am training myself to kinda just... deal with it without reaching out? It's extremely difficult but I know it is important to our relationship that I be able to emotionally regulate on my own better.

Anyways the question I have is, is it normal for someone to not be upset or worried when their partner goes on a trip and won't be able to be in contact? "
575,3,"Hi 👋 I’m just here to get some thoughts out of my head. Lately, my mental health has been the best it’s been in years!! I’m really finally starting to see the therapy and meds paying off. However, it’s tiring. If I don’t constantly have my DBT skills ready to be deployed or if I skip meds for a couple days, everything comes back so fast. 
I’ve not been taking care of myself this week and I’m just seeing how rapid I’m declining. I’m waking up and going to bed stressed, anxious, exhausted… nothing new, it’s just disappointing to know that I’m never going to be able let my guard down relating to mental health. I thought I was getting better with how I view myself and life, but a couple days of ruminating and no meds have sent me back into pure insanity. That is all, thanks for joining "
576,1,"Hi people, I hope your day is going great.  
I'm writing this post in hope for some guidance, I really need help. Anything.  
It's also a bit of a very long vent for anyone who might hear me. I apologize, **there's a TLDR at the end.**

It's all in the title.  
How long before I move on ? Have you ever moved on from an FP ? What did it take ? How did you do ? What happens next ? What must I do ? Can I do it without transferring those feelings on a new FP ? Will I  feel like he made me feel ever again ?

He (21 FtM) was my (24 MtF) first real FP I think. I might have been his in return. Our separation messed me up so hard, and worsened my BPD so deeply that it was then undeniable I had it (+ a suspected side of HPD) when I used to think I only had ADHD.  
For 10 months, we've been an inseparable duo. Always together. The ADHD+ASD besties who's never beating the dating allegations. Co-dependant. I had a seat at his family gatherings as one of their own. He was my first thought in the morning, and the last voice I heard at night. His own sister referred to us as ""Conjoined Twins"".  
We shared laughs, meals, shows, playlists, minecraft worlds, gifts, clothes, secrets, dreams, cuddles, kisses, beds. I took tons of pictures of him each time I was able to.  
We never got to talk about what happened at the end. He ended up blocking me everywhere. He hates me. He moved on and doesn't care. He does not feel guilty nor miss me. He anti-stalks me. He has new friends, his family supports him, he keeps going forward while I'm stuck here.  
I feel like I could have done more, if I controlled my outbursts better after our break-up, if I was more lenient with his. If I was more open, forgiving. If only I knew better, he might still be at my side today.  
It's like no one ever held my soul like he did. With such care, tenderness, love, passion.  
I can't help but think that as long as we're both alive, I still can act and do more about it.  
We met for the first time twice, at the same place, one year apart, and a part of me wants to think it was fate.  
I met him a few weeks after complaining to my boyfriend that I've never had a bestfriend the way it is romanticized in TV shows. Someone who would always be by your side, part of your daily life and household, who would know everything about you.  
He was everything I wished for and more.

Since we left eachother, my life has gotten better tenfold. I have tons of new, healthier friendships, I'm closer to my boyfriend, I kept transitionning, I'm prettier, I'm active in my community, I make better songs and art, I model, I have a chosen family, my brothers love and look up to me. I'm an inspiration to a few friends and mutuals (which I dread tbh).  
I'm kinder, softer, more loving, thoughtful and forgiving than I ever was, toward other people, and toward myself.  
I healed from the traumas he saw me being haunted by on a daily basis.  
And yet. It all seems worthless if I cannot share my achievements with him and make him proud of me.

It has been 426 days since the fight that ended everything.  
I'm still as in love with him, I'm ready to forgive everything he didn't apologize for, I'm ready to beg for forgiveness for what I did and didn't do, put up with his surroundings hating me, just to have him back in my arms for a second.  
I still periodically unblock him to give him a chance to talk, hoping he would magically unblock me at the same time and come back (even tho he never did, repeatedly told me he didn't want to talk to me, actively avoids me in public)  
My friends genuinely hate him, and I try to convince myself I do too by joining their banter on him.  
Nothing works, I don't know what to do.

I'm aware there's no chance we get back together, even as just acquaintances. And even if we do, the whole world would want us appart.  
I'm aware we both changed, that we might not know each other anymore, that we might not be compatible anymore, that maybe there's no room for me anymore in his life.  
I know I'm heavily idealizing him and our past relationship. I know he's not actually as omniscient, charismatic and perfect as I make him to be. That we both still have lots of stuff to work on. That he's not as ""conventionally attractive"" as I think he is, and that I could ""do so much better with someone more mature, confident, and handsome, who won't blame me for the slightest discomfort"".  
None of this matter. It doesn't matter at all. I don't care. I do not fucking care. I want him. No one else.  
I know I'll never get back what we had, but it is not enough to make me stop praying for it.

It is all making me go more insane each day. It hurts so bad. I'm fighting episodes of emptiness and s-word ideations regularly.

Back then, I had to prevent myself from seeing his mom as the supportive mother figure I never got. I desperately wanted us to be like his big sister and her life-long childhood bestfriend (basically a 3rd parent to her kid).  
We were supposed to be friends for at least 10 years. You promised me.  
You said it was a relief to have me in your family because I was the only one to truly see and understand you.

You used gaslight, victim-blaming and lovebomb on me. You kept belittling my feelings and complaints, focusing on yours. Treating me like a kid, never apologizing. Hating every new friend I made, always blaming me for your constant jealousy. Made me feel like a sexdoll. Not giving me time to process anything in my life.  
You drowned me under panicked walls of guilt-tripping texts the day of our fight when I needed time and space to process.  
In return, I drowned you and your close ones under tons of desperate texts 8 months later.

I know I relied too hard on you, that I made you my savior, that I initially used sex with you as a coping mechanism so you wouldn't leave me.  
I know I stalked you online. That I've tried to hurt you by showing off my new relationships and how happy I was without you, it was a facade.  
I couldn't bear the thought of you throwing everything we were down the drain. The mere thought of you made me split. I spoke so negatively of you. I called you an abuser, a little privileged shit, an egotistical waste of time, and worse.  
I publicly threatened to get my justice by calling you out for your emotional abuse and lack of remorse by releasing a PDF online. I almost did. Almost. I never did.  
It made our fight known of all. Maybe this 33 pages long PDF was the point of non-return, because you privately called me out two months later.

You said I used and manipulated you. That I'm dangerous and that I groomed you.  
You used my secrets and regrets against me, stuff I told you I did younger, years before we met, to prove I was the abusive one. You denied me the right to grow and change.  
I lost friends, I got banned from organizing and attending events for our mutual aid collective.  
This collective was like a family to me, a way to fill the hole you left in me, to distract myself from your absence, to give you the possibility to talk to me whenever you were ready, to act for my community, to make the memory of the friend you used to be, proud of me. It was a purpose, and for some reason, you took it away from me.  
I've never wanted to isolate you, but you isolated me. You called a trans woman a predator.  
Do you genuinely believe I'm dangerous ? That I manipulated you ? That I used you ?  
Or are you just trying to escape your own wrongs and guilt by depicting me as a monster ?  
Don't you remember having the upper hand on me ? When I desperately needed you and couldn't say no to anything you said ?  
Don't you remember me being a bit more at ease with our ambiguous bond the day you turned 20 ?  
Don't you realize that by having your family emotional, material and financial support in your daily life, medical transition and neurodivergence, while I had to work minimum wage to not be homeless again, you automatically have a peace of mind I don't have access to ? Why did you blame me for my constant state of dissociation back then ?  
Why do you get to have the ""innocent child"" treatment, while I get the ""sick abusive adult"" when we're only 3 years apart ?

Why did you do this to me  
Why do you still refuse to talk to me  
Why do I still love you, and when will it stop  
How did you move on that easily  
How do I keep living without you

After everything we've been through, how did we end up here, where ""we"" has no meaning anymore  
I wish you knew how much I still love and miss you, and how deeply sorry I am.  
But you do know. You blocked me because I sent you my letters, last December.  
You know and you don't care. You don't care about me anymore. You stopped loving me.  
Have you ever loved me to begin with ? Or was I just a way to validate your attractiveness and boost your ego ?

You were my whole universe, Moonshine.  
I would have rearranged the stars to point at me so you'd never be lost in the dark ever again

***TLDR :*** My bestfriend became my FP during our friendship. We were inseparable, co-dependant and addicted to each other, so much that we began being toxic to each other. We went no contact 14 months ago. We never got to talk about our final fight. We had outbursts, tore each other down. I almost called out his abuse but didn't. He called me a manipulator and an abuser. I lost lots of friends and more because of him. Almost went to a psych yard to save myself.  
I still passionately love him. When does it stop ? When do I move on ? What should I do ?  
Will I ever stop waiting for a talk that's never going to happen, and a man that's never going to come back ?  
Or will it keep consuming me until I cannot bear it anymore ?"
577,2,"I am so proud of myself. I was texting my partner this morning and was beginning to get upset because they weren't ""meeting my expectation"" aka reading my mind. I was venting to them about my roommate not doing his chores, and said that I felt overwhelmed. I wanted them to automatically offer help and didn't want to have to ask. I kept giving ""signals"" that I was upset, but in hindsight those signals were just passive-aggression and my partner probably didn't realize I was angry (especially since this was a text conversation and tone can't be portrayed). I got upset when they didn't offer to help, and starting to spiral.

I cancelled our whole weekend plans at first because I was so upset, which they said they were sad about but understood. Then I felt really bad about that because I was excited to see them, and I was mad at myself for hurting them. Usually when I get to this point in a conflict that I've created, I start to double-down, and take my frustration out on them because it feels like they've caused it. Then I get upset that when they don't automatically realize that somethings wrong, and it loops over and over until I do/say something stupid or hurtful. But! I didn't do that today. I forced myself to take a walk, and when I came back I apologized and told them that I was upset and why (even though I was still upset and felt a little justified about it). I felt really silly explaining why I was so upset, because when I actually thought about it, the whole thing was trivial anyways. We talked things out, and during it I felt less and less justified in my anger, and then the upset feeling just... went away. I'm still a little anxious because my body has yet to realize that the ""conflict"" is over, but I just feel so proud of myself for not letting my emotions get the best of me and I wanted to share with you guys <3 "
578,1,"I keep seeing so many ""bpd femcel egirl"" memes. Yes they are funny RARELY. But this is already a stigmatized disorder and often these memes get more exposure than actually educational content and people reduce bpd to JUST THIS. It's honestly embarrassing to tell people I have bpd because of the stupid stereotypes that circulate online. It grosses me out, especially when i see it turned into some fetish thing. I've seen OF girls build their brand on having bpd, everyone has different opinions on SW but you can't deny at this point its definitely a fetish. Having bpd is not ""aesthetic"" or ""hot"" 🤮"
579,0,"It can certainly be both, because seeing him sad made me feel devastated, I was euphoric whenever I saw how happy he was, i once cried when i saw him smile in reel so I don't believe it was only limerence or just for selfish reasons "
580,3,"Fun fact: Lobotomies were an elective procedure as well as a mandated one. So if you really wanted to, you could just ask for one and hit the reset button.

Hey all, I'm undiagnosed BPD and I'm confident that I have bipolar as well (I studied mental health), my doctor that I've been seeing for years who is amazing also told me she thinks this. I went from an insanely depressive episode and was manic for like a day and now I am crashing the fuuuccckkkk out. And when I do I drink and miss work (I work for myself) and I proper lose it. I'm aware that the crash out is starting so I'm wanting to know if there is a way I can stop it or pull myself up? I try not to keep alcohol in the house so I can't just lose it after work but I just ubered it to my house 🙄 Dr*g use comes with it too and look I need to be financially better at the moment so I just can't afford to go off the rails right now. During the last crash out I put my head through a wall and swallowed everything I had and ended up in hospital and my family had to fly in to collect me and watch me so I'm not particularly keen on reliving that. Any tips or tricks would be greatly appreciated."
581,2,"Hey, does anyone else have extreme anxiety that your Partner will find your reddit and read all you post? 
I don’t write badly about him and he actually knows everything about me. I even told him that I joined reddit as I felt so guilty hidding this secret from him.
Yet, I immediately told him to not look me up as I want this to stay a safe place for me. I don’t know, I think I’m afraid that he will judge me or my feeling even though deep inside of me I know that he would never judge me for my feelings.
Does this makes sense? Does anyone else experience this type of anxiety?"
582,1,"I have been diagnosed with bpd for a long time now. I have never enjoyed DBT. It doesn’t work for me. It feels pointless and dumb. I know that it has been proven to help, and that’s why I’m giving it yet another shot. But there’s just something about DBT that I cannot stand. It almost feels like I’m being spoken to like I’m a child at times, but I know that’s just them breaking down the mindfulness skills. They want me to “observe” and be mindful but that’s my problem. I observe too much. As an adult with bpd who has worked on themselves for years and just now am having a “relapse” in my sever bpd episodes, I am aggressively self aware now. And that lowkey makes it that much worse. I don’t know. I wish I didn’t hate DBT this much. I’m not even sure why I’m posting this. I just got off a second therapy session with a new therapist and it just reminded me of how much I dislike DBT. "
583,1,"I cannot believe it took me this long to realize it. All these years of nobody listening to me. Nobody noticing me. Nobody looking at me. Nobody even acknowledging me when I speak. And I never put it together until now. I mean, sure, I always FELT like I didn't exist. But it never actually clicked. I don't exist. But people interact with my body. I guess my body exists. Theres something here. But whatever this THING is, this disgusting thought thing whatever that is forming sentences right now, does not exist. Maybe it did once, but right now its just hollow, empty, void, nothing. Nothing left. All gone. "
584,3,"(i dont want to trigger anyone by being more specific about the manner of struggle around food — you’ll know if this applies to you if it does…)

have you noticed anything about how eating issues and this disease interact? any patterns around eating (or not eating; or having to manage food intake one way or the other) exacerbates symptoms?

i do not have a diagnosed e d (…that i’m aware of), but i do have the BPD dx (and c-ptsd), along with (treatment-resistant) MDD, & ADHD.

stimulant meds obvs kill appetite, and when i get in my ~flow, my monkey brain / basic survival instinct to eat gets dulled to the point of being silenced. usually a few hours later i’ll look up from whatever i’m doing & realize it’s been x hours since i last ate, but there’s still more work to, or i’m running late for something, or i’m deep in training mode, or whatever reason/excuse i come up with, that keeps me from taking the time to nourish myself. 

if that pattern repeats again, there tends to be an uptick in my reactivity / proneness to perceive insult or harm or project bad intentions onto the people i’m interacting with.

even though i notice the pattern, i can’t break it. 

i’m wondering what the science may be behind it. a blood sugar thing? or just plain ol’ being hangry? 

does this experience feel familiar for anyone? got any insight? "
585,3,"Sorry I don't know if the term neet is offensive or not but I just learned about it a few days ago and it describes me. I'm f23 and I don't work, i don't have a driver's license,  I'm not in college anymore , I do nothing. I'm tired of it, I want to be like other people my age who have jobs and do school and who are already married. I want it but I'm too overwhelmed,  and not motivated enough to try. I stay inside all day. I feel like a kid but I'm not and I don't know how to grow up. I've tried getting my driver's license but it gave me too much anxiety and I lost interest of it just a few months in. I was in online college until it became too hard and I just gave up and failed and dropped out. I don't know what to do with myself. "
586,2,"I read i hate you, don't leave me when my therapist first told me I might have bdp. There was a paragraph that said that our perception of ourselves is not constant but comparitive. 

So you might take an iq test and score really well. And then a couple days later you might fuck up a task and think you're stupid. Or yk feel good about myself or. Minute, see a pretty girl and then feel shitty about yourself. 

It made a lot of sense to me. And I'm just wondering - is this not....sth that everyone goes through? like if a nuerotypical people thinks they're creative, then......they just carry on thinking that, even if they don't do well? 😶😶😶 Like isn't  self-doubt sth that plagues everyone? "
587,1,"Any other women here purposely not put effort into their physical appearances just to keep men away? I used to care about my looks and I attracted men but always got my heartbroken now as a defense mechanism I purposely won’t wear makeup, leave my hair unstyled, won’t shave my legs, wear baggy clothes, and don’t smile or act friendly towards guys. I’m incapable of a healthy relationship due to this disorder so I just want to keep guys away from me at this point. "
588,3,"Me 21F was recently diagnosed with BPD and was referred by my psychiatrist to attend DBT classes this month. Unfortunately I work at a school so my summers are my only personal time so I have it fully booked until the start of the next school year. They told me I need to take care of myself but I feel as if missing out of the plans I had made already would make me feel worse. I’ve managed this long without classes to help manage so I do not see the harm in not going. I can reconsider it this fall but then it may conflict with my work as the classes are 3 hours away from my place of work. It is a 12 week long class, I am unsure how often I am expected to go but I do not see this as even an option anymore. I feel as if I have come a long way on my own. "
589,1,"I had my appendix removed and now I can't handle the post-op recovery phase. I cry almost the entire day because of the pain and how limited I feel. Everyone is telling me it's normal and I'm gonna get through this, but it feels like an endless suffering. I've been much more emotional at literally everything and I feel so weak and a crybaby. I keep imagining that something went wrong with the surgery even though I was discharged from the hospital and everyone is saying it's fine. I get it, it will pass, but right now it feels like the world is ending.The fact that the surgery was on my birthday makes everything worse. My life was already so hard, I don't know why this needed to happen to me. "
590,2,How the hell do people deal with jealousy in relationships? I literally want to cry if he’s even in the same room as another girl. I want him all to myself. I just want him to forget anyone else even exists.

I have a hard time holding down jobs and employers arent very forgiving of my anxiety. Because of this my roomate is now mad at me because I am struggling to pay rent. Ive never had a boyfriend before I feel like I never will. I moved about a year ago and still dont really have any close friends. I dont have any close friends from the past either anymore. I feel broken and in the past I have had to use camming as a form of survival but i dont want to do that (I never did). Now I'm about to lose another job due to ""performance"" and Im afraid sex work is all Im good for and it just makes me feel so useless."
592,2,"Waiting for a text back, waiting in line, waiting at a traffic light, waiting for an appointment, it’s all the same. I get irrationally angry and annoyed and can’t calm myself down. I definitely have road rage and I’m not proud of it. I’m sometimes rude to people simply because I had to wait for them. I don’t want to be like this, how do I chill out and be ok to wait? "
593,0,"i've seen a lot of discourse about how if you have BPD, you can't experience a ""true"" manic episode. from the insight i've gotten from people with bipolar disorder, the mania we experience is apparently different and not technically classified as a ""real"" manic episode. 

in some ways, i think i kinda of understand their point of view? my ""mania"" doesn't ever last too particularly long. like i'm never consistently manic for weeks/months on end.

other than the fact that my manic episodes don't last weeks, i don't really see the difference? is that the sole key difference? i still experience all the other symptoms of mania, but my manic/depressive cycle is just significantly shorter than someone who has bipolar disorder. 

what do you guys think about this? 



"
594,2,"i easily open about my diagnosys to my best friend and parents but im struggling to tell my partners

sometimes i feel the urge to tell him, but sometimes i think i dont have to

even though hes was so supportive about my ex bipolar diagnosys and i already told him that ""maybe"" i have something with personality disorder, not affective

and EVEN THOUGH he has a psychology degree and works as a therapist

and i dont what a should do... ive been switching about this all the goddamn time"
595,3,"Hi everyone. That is my question. Genuinely, how do you get over things? My boyfriend often says I’m upset about something new every other day. That’s not entirely true, but I admit there’s some truth to it. I do get hurt and offended easily. But usually, it’s about things I personally would never do.

For example, I’ve been away for several weeks for a training, and I have a PhD deadline just three days after I return, so I’ll need to work and prepare in those days as soon as I get back, and I’ve been stressed about this for a while. My boyfriend made plans to go out clubbing with our friend on the day I return. I was invited too, but I won’t be able to go because of work. When I brought it up, he said he’d rather go out than just sit next to me while I work.

I know it’s an unfair thing to be upset about, but I still am. If if were me, I’d prefer to stay in with him, especially if we hadn’t seen each other in weeks and I knew he was stressed about a deadline. I understand it’s not fair to expect him to the same, but I can’t help but feel this way when I know I would have acted differently and prioritized him.

If I bring it up and he decides to stay home, it doesn’t feel genuine because I had to ask. And if I say nothing, I’m just quietly upset and I resent him. This is just an example but it applies to many other situations. I realize how difficult and unreasonable I am being, but I can’t help feel that way when I think he’s being inconsiderate. So, please tell me, how do you get over small things like this without dragging it on, but also without resenting people in silence?"
596,3,What do you work or study and what's your age? How do you manage? I feel lost. I'm getting kicked out of uni because of psychosis and now I don't know what to do with my life. I want to see what other people with this disorder have accomplished. Tell me about it
597,1,"(tw for substance abuse, suicidal ideation, self harm, ect) 

I've been diagnosed with BPD and CPTSD since I was 18 and I just feel like on an internal level it's just been getting worse and worse. I'm functional, sure, but on the inside I think I get more and more hopeless everyday. When I was 19, I hit a point where the only thing I can do was accept myself or at least try to. Now I dread everyday coming back home from work because it means I have to deal with myself. The only way I feel better or feel like I can somewhat breathe is when I focus on other people's problems or when I'm indulging in behaviors I shouldn't be. I mean fuck, I got into a bad spot with an ex FP and current FP recently and decided the best way to deal with it was goad another person at a party to burn me with their cigarette to feel better. That's three years of SH free down the drain. 

I'm currently in therapy, but it's too early to decide whether or not it's helping. I just wish I wasn't like this anymore. I've been diagnosed since 18, but I've felt this way for way longer. I'm sick and tired of it and tired of myself. I wish the persona I presented myself as to other people and at work was the person I really am. It all feels like a lie and a bandaid at best. I wish I could cope with things better, or live up to these standards I've put up for myself. It's just exhausting waking up wishing I can die already from morning to night. I hate it and I hate myself but I feel too much obligated to stay alive for people who do care about me. It's more of a burden than anything and right now I'm just sticking to this one plan I've had since 19. Get it together, get a job, get a higher education, make it out the shithole I currently live in, then in another 2-3 years after I've had enough fun and distanced myself from loved ones, kill myself with a gun or something. It genuinely is a relief to know I can kill myself at some point. I'll keep hanging on regardless. Thanks if you read this. "
598,1,"I broke up with my ex of two years about two months ago now. Admittedly he was shitty. Every time things got hard he’d go looking at other girls and there were times I had to beg him to spend any time with me. We talked about working things out but he was on apps trying to meet up with other girls and when I got insecure about it he told me he’s done with me and my back and forth mind games. 

I can’t stop thinking about him though. Every night all my dreams are about him and I have to wake up and remember he’s really gone. Every song, every tik tok, every small conversation with people triggers a memory of him. I can remember so vividly our first kiss, when he asked me to be his girlfriend, I can even physically smell him sometimes. 

I don’t know what to do and I can’t keep living like this. I cry every day the second I wake up. I was forced to take a week off work because of my mental health. I have no interest or joy in any hobbies or other people. I’ve been held in a psych ward because I have suicidal thoughts every day. I’m so tired and nothing is helping, I’m just watching my life fall apart around me "
599,2,"A few years ago I did inpatient. I remember, shortly after I left my dad told me “i don’t know how to talk to you because im worried if im honest or say something wrong, that you will kys”. That is something that I recently realized, had a huge impact on me. I don’t remember the last time U was totally honest with anyone about how I feel. Im afraid of being a burden and that if I am honest about how i feel, whoever I tell will feel like they are walking on eggshells around me. I don’t want people tip toeing around me because I struggle. I feel like im at a dead end where I cant be honest with anyone. "

I drank today for the first time in a few weeks and I got my eye appointment scheduled, I made a call about another important issue, I cleaned, and now I’m making this post lol. That’s a lot for me to do in one day normally so I wanted to see other people feel the same way or not. Idk if I feel a bit manic because I added a shit ton of stuff to like 5 different online shopping carts and tried to do all my finances tonight or what lol. Please tell me I’m not the only one !!"
601,3,"For context, I’m 28, been diagnosed since 22. Been in and out of care with the crisis team my entire adult life, and I’m currently 8 weeks in to IPT. However, IPT is not helping, and only seems to make my symptoms worse because it makes me look for even more reasons to suspect my partner of wrongdoing, and my BPD is ruining my life.

I have asked my doctor 3 times to refer me to DBT. They do, apparently. The first time I waited 6 months only to be contacted by CBT. I did half a session, to which they stated they wouldn’t continue with my therapy because with my derealisation and dissociation episodes, there was nothing they could offer to help with those symptoms. Okay, fine. So I asked for another referral. 8 months later I’m contacted BY A CBT PROFESSIONAL AGAIN to which I told them the situation, and they said to go back to my doctor. Then, I ask for a third referral. I wait a year and 2 months. I’m contacted by my current IPT therapist. I was so worn down at this point that I just accepted IPT as I was desperate for help. But 8 weeks in, it feels more detrimental than helpful.

Anyone in the UK, England specifically, had a similar experience? If so, how did you FINALLY get into DBT? Are there any other avenues I can down instead of my GP? Any advice is welcome."
602,2,"How do I know if my boyfriend is going to break up with me? Are there any signs in his behavior? Or does he have a new fp?

I love my boyfriend, we both have BPD but I don’t think he likes me anymore. Everytime I interact with him he seems annoyed with me. When I call his name he always says “what” in an aggravated tone. I even sang his name once and he very aggressively said “what”. We talked about it before and it’s trauma related.

He’s always on his phone; in the past he admitted that when he needs validation he seeks it elsewhere because he already has it with me. During our separations he’s seen and hooked up with other people. 

We don’t have sex and haven’t in a long time due to his low libido. I got insecure about the other women because they’re not my body type and he also participated in role play with them. Which we have never done or even talked about. 

I’m starting to think I’m in a slow break up, just waiting for him to be ready to leave…







"
603,1,"I’ve been in a long, emotionally intense relationship with someone who has BPD.
Over time, we kept breaking up and getting back together — over and over again. The cycle became familiar, almost expected.

But recently, we broke up again… and this time, it feels different.
They’re completely distant. No contact. No signs of reconnecting.
Part of me still hopes it’s just another episode, but another part is starting to ask:
What if this is really the final goodbye?

How do you know when it’s truly over with someone who has BPD — when it’s not just another push-pull moment, but the actual end?

If anyone’s been through something similar — I’d really appreciate your thoughts."

Can 18+ people only respond please!! (Im 19)

I need clarity because I don’t know what’s wrong with me in a way because I keep thinking it’s either BPD CPTSD or OCD and it’s driving me insane and I just need reassurance 

So I don’t know what it is but I’m heavily attached to this person like insane -> need them to live basically but then when they don’t text me for long periods of time due to them being busy and them telling me that I rarely respond to them and it’s like I don’t need them anymore but then I get upset because I am worried I’ll be left or the other way round and I keep asking them if I am doing anything wrong and I apologise and I’m also worried that this is a automatic response I say to get attention idk and it feels fake but it’s weird I just feel nothing sometimes when this happens and I try and distract 

and I just get worried I’m a fake person and that I keep making things up to seem sick? Idk it’s crazy but I’m worried that I’m fake but I also have other symptoms "
605,1,"I hate when people saying shit like ""you have to love your inner child"", ""you should make peace with it"".

This inner child ruining my life. Because it make me acting childlish in adult life. I am crying because I had too little sleep, I am moody because I am hungry, I am rude and iritated because things don't work in my way. I am blaming world for my mistakes from which I should learn, not repeating them. I want to be hugged after I made argument over nothing. I want to be cheer up after bursting in tears because person I just hurted, told me what I just did. 
Being unable to make decisions like sitting two hours angry and hungry, because I don't know what to eate or I am too lazy to cook.

It also doesn’t help that this past year I’ve been struggling with PTSD from an abusive relationship I got out of last year. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? What do y’all do to take care of yourselves? I’m really worried about myself and how depressed I keep on getting. "
607,3,"CW: mentions of suicide

tl;dr: Last year, I cut off my BPD friend and blocked her multiple times when she needed me. Now that I’m thinking of reaching back out and apologizing, I worry it might be too late or more hurtful than helpful. Should I apologize to her or give her peace and space?

So for context, I used to be friends with a girl with BPD. For reasons related to her boyfriend and mental health issues, she ended up leaving the group and sending us all individual goodbye messages. I found out from her boyfriend that she was suicidal, she had BPD, and that those were suicide messages, and so I drove to her apartment to wait with him for the wellness check cop. He told me she had been emotionally abusive, that this wasn’t the first time she got his attention with suicide threats; all of this was new to me—a complete 180 on the kind of person I thought she was. Later that week, she started texting me on Discord, in the middle of a breakdown, and I found out from her boyfriend that he’d told her to reach out to anyone she could. Regrettably, she had trusted me. I was overwhelmed and avoidant and cowardly, scared to be looped into the same situation her boyfriend was in, and I made the biggest mistake I could have: I apologized to her, and essentially cut her off (didn’t block her).

We didn’t speak for a month until she reached out to me again, explaining her side: how her boyfriend had mistreated her (emotional neglect & getting her hooked on weed), how hurt she was by my actions, how they made her feel, how her suicide threats to her boyfriend were the only way she could get him to take her seriously. I responded back, apologizing and we eventually reconciled. Over the next few months, we slowly stopped talking (mostly my fault; I was growing more and more uncertain over several things—she was hesitant about speaking over call rather than text and called off a couple of in-person hangs, she was resentful about my bf and I knew we’d meet an impasse eventually, I was talking to her bf and found out she’d been talking about my relationship…). Right before the start of the fall semester, I cut her off again; explained my reasoning, apologized, and blocked her on discord. I don’t regret ending our friendship, but I do regret not giving her the space to voice her thoughts on the matter, making the decision for her when I shouldn’t have instead of having an actual, productive, adult conversation.

Not long after that, she sent me a shit ton of texts to my number over the course of a week. Explaining her side and her hurt again, and I was far too focused on the insults to recognize her genuine pain. Then the texts devolved into her telling me to stop talking to her bf, insulting my boyfriend, insulting me, telling me repeatedly how much she wishes she never met me, how she was glad she learned who not to befriend. I was so blinded by her anger and my own defensiveness, I failed to look deeper and see her pain, I failed to be empathetic again. I didn’t respond to her texts and, once again, blocked her number.

I failed to see her desire for apology. It took me months upon months of analyzing her texts, regretting my decisions, thinking and overthinking instead of actually doing. I failed to give her the apology she deserved when it mattered the most, but now, ten months later, I’ve apologized. Kind of. I was worried about how the apology would come off, if it’d be intrusive in case she was in fact moving on, etc., etc., and so I edited my final Discord message to her including a link to my full apology (discord character limit and all that). Sounds silly, but I wanted it to be as uninvasive as possible, since it took me a millennia to do what I should’ve.

Now, I can’t help but wonder if I should have left that apology. What if she’s healing and seeing the apology opens that wound back up? What if it has unintended effects and I’ve blown up the situation again and made it harder for her and her boyfriend? What if me reaching out confuses her with the push and pull dynamics (I keep abandoning her, and now I’m crossing my own boundary to reinsert myself into her life via a possible unwanted apology)? She hasn’t seen it yet, I think, so there’s still a chance to take it back. Or am I overthinking again and should I leave it? What do you guys think?"
608,0,"So I have been officially diagnosed, back when I was 19 and had just gotten out of an abusive relationship with a literal freaking p3dof1le, which really messed me up as you can imagine. I had severe mood swings at the time and constantly suicidal. I was extremely irritable and would lash out at everyone over nothing. I've never quite been normal even before then, ie I've always been a sensitive person, had a messed up childhood and everything, but that relationship really exacerbated all of my issues. 

Well, since then, I'm in a healthy relationship for over a year now. Life has been good. I'm on a mood stabilizer and I don't feel so sad and angry anymore. I'm actually generally content. I don't self harm as much. I don't lash out at my partner (with my ex I lashed out at him literally every day and would literally SCREAM at him, and I have never yelled at my current partner), I don't get irritated, I am really mellow actually, maybe even more so than ""normal"" people. I sometimes wonder if I don't actually have BPD and the way I was acting back when I was diagnosed was just reactive to the abuse I was facing. I actually have not had any special therapy like DBT or CBT or whatever, and I actually am not in any therapy nor have I been in like a year (I just found it unhelpful and I was unable to connect with any therapist no matter how many different ones I tried). This change I've had is all from lifestyle and wonderful Lexapro.

There are some things though that still make me believe I have BPD: I have very unstable self image (ie going from ""I'm hot"" to ""I'm ugly"" in the same day), and I constantly wonder if my partner really loves me and sometimes I will convince myself he doesn't and I will literally make myself cry, even though he didn't do anything, it'll just come out of nowhere). One day I made myself sad and convinced myself nobody cared about me and I ran away while in a different state and I had no idea where I was. I hold grudges. And any little slight, even if perceived, I take VERY SERIOUSLY and it can ruin my whole day. I also am having a hard time choosing what to do for college because I have new hobbies and passions I pick up like every month so I don't know what I want to pursue. I will admit that my mood can heavily depend on my partner, ie in the past he used to have a hard time communicating which would make me really sad and try to break up with him a few times. He has gotten better and we don't have this issue anymore but what I'm saying is that if he were to do this again, I'd probably act the same way (when I'm not happy in a relationship I'm very quick to threaten to give ultimatums and threaten to leave if they don't change. I don't think I actually would though due to my fear of abandonment). Do I just have mild or quiet BPD?"
609,2,"I saw a post on this sub “stopped reaching out for help” my mind went like “wait? when do I have to reach out for help?”. As someone with BPD and anxiety disorder I don’t self harm and my symptoms are not visible let’s say, but I have silent panic attacks and I get depersonalised, having social anxiety I think I have never reached out for help, I don’t even know how to? Like what do I say? I don’t have close friends only my sister knows that I have BPD and anxiety disorder. I mask it in office and everywhere possible. 
This sub Reddit is maybe the only place I express these thoughts, so please tell me how do I ask for help, how do I meet people apart from therapists who could help me in crisis?"

611,1,"i’m not normal.  i know normal is subjective and there’s no specific way to be normal, but i make the people around me uncomfortable or im off putting. i’ve been told this a lot. by friends, family, romantic partners, etc.. i just want to interact with people regularly. i haven’t been diagnosed with autism or anything (which i know can cause people to struggle with socializing, obviously not everyone on the spectrum) so is it the depression/anxiety/bpd? i’ve been told i “say whatever is on my mind” and i “have no filter”. i want to be better. so many people have left me, i just want to be normal. i want to be able to form relationships that i can maintain. i feel like im likable but then people realize who i am and they don’t like it. i’ve been called weird all through elementary/middle/ and high school and adult life. i just want to be able to keep people around. i don’t know what to do? i’m in art therapy, group therapy, and i have a psychiatrist so im on meds. and it’s not enough. i’m tired of being too weird, it’s so exhausting. i just want people to be able to like me longevity and not just for a few months. what am i doing wrong? im just being myself, i am the problem then? i dunno."
612,1,"This is mainly a vent, I pose no actual danger to myself, I have too many responsibilities for that. That said, here goes: 

I’ve had my history with suicidal ideation and planning, but there was always something in the back of my brain, telling me that ending it wasn’t what I really wanted. I don’t have that anymore. I recently applied to a university and my course is starting later this month, I’ve got a girlfriend who thinks she’s planning a future with me. I don’t know how to compute with the fact that I’m struggling to find solid will to live. 

I know I’ve got loved ones that care about me, and need me. And that’s exactly why I’m still alive. Almost everybody in my life depends on me to the point that I’ve lived my entire life being what other people need me to be, that’s why I’m still here. 

But the more therapy I’ve done to find out who I am underneath it all has just made things worse. I dig and I dig and I dig and I dig and there’s nothing under there. I don’t feel like a person, I feel like a shell that’s been smashed and repaired everyday for my entire life. I can’t live like this anymore and it’s almost worse knowing that I WILL. 

I’m too much of a realist to even fantasise about a future I don’t think I can actually attain. Most days I’m able to suppress it and move on, stay numb and pretend. Meds help with that since I don’t have the extreme emotions that I used to. But some nights like tonight it all hits me and I realise I don’t know what the fuck I’m actually doing with my life. I’m miserable and I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to experience anything more than this endless loop. 

I have no actual desire to move on for MYSELF, which is what kept me going for so many years. Deep down I knew I was fighting for me. But the fight is over, and I think I’m just biding my time until the people in my life are at a stage that they don’t need me anymore. Be it 10 or 20 years, I’m waiting for that sweet release. To give up and finally be free. "
613,2,"I asked this a couple of days ago but I think I went on for too long. 

Are there any signs that your partner with BPD is going to break up with you? Or if they have a new FP? 

Like I said previously I’m constantly scared he’s just keeping me around until it’s less painful or something. Because just the sound of my voice seems to irritate him. :( I cook almost every night for him and we don’t have sex (which is due to his low libido). However when we briefly broke up he was having a lot of sex or sex acts. 

For example, whenever I say his name he says “what” in an annoyed tone.  I even sang his name once and it seemed to annoy him. He says it’s trauma related not much I can do there but be patient. But then I’ll ask for a small favour (like a back rub, I have chronic back pain) and it seems like such a burden most of the time I end up saying nvm. 

And we’ve always had drama surrounding our phones, I’ve looked through his and vice versa. Everytime I found stuff, but dated on break ups. Now he’s always on his phone, when we are spending time together with headphones on. 

Which makes me think it has to be me…what do you think? "
614,3,"coming here to rant, months ago i unknowingly isolated myself from everyone i’ve known including best friends, family, etc for my fp. After i split from him (a couple months ago) i realized and now i don’t know how to deal with it. i only talk to like two people on a regular basis and it’s taking a tole on me. i realize my issue is worse than i thought when i see my friends post themselves with so much other people, and i feel nothing but jealousy since i only have them. i don’t know how to talk to new people, but i crave friends so bad. i’m not sure what to do, so i’m coming here for help on how to make friends or i don’t know.. fix myself? i’m an older minor if that helps. just someone please help me before i slip back into the slump i was once in and push everyone away again. "
615,3,"me and my boyfriend (FP) have recently just moved into our first house together and have a baby on the way (i’m 7 months pregnant). 
things have been really rocky recently and i’ve found out that he’s been unfaithful, not cheating as such but broken boundaries that i’ve laid down very very early on in relationship. 
i can’t seem to get over this and although i’ve tried to it keeps coming back and hurting me.
i keep splitting on him and it’s no longer fair for my mental sanity, his mental sanity and it’s not fair for baby either, maternal stress while in womb can cause a lot of complications for him later in life. i know it’s a tough situation especially with a baby on the way but i think i’m going to try take the next couple weeks to pluck up the courage to leave but he’s my FP and every time i think about leaving it physically hurts me. i know it’s going to be so much harder for me than a regular break up due to the fact that i will still have to communicate with him and see him a lot when baby’s here- when he takes baby overnight or comes to see him and messaging him to let him know how baby’s doing and pick up times/days ect. i know i cant just move out and block him on everything to move on. how can i try to detach before the official break up to make it easier on myself? i want to make the process as easy and mature as possible for both of our sake and baby’s sake. "
616,3,"Hey everyone,
I’m really struggling at work today. My motivation is completely gone, and honestly, I just wish I could go home and crawl into bed. Even lunch feels like a challenge. I’m not in the mood to socialize, but the thought of sitting alone and feeling judged isn’t much better either.

I originally wanted to work from home today, but someone needed help with a task, so I came into the office out of kindness. Now I’m here, feeling drained and wondering how to get through the rest of the day.

Does anyone have tips or tricks for surviving days like this, when you’re mentally and emotionally tapped out, but still have to push through?"
617,1,"I’m unsure if there’s a post like this already, but I was thinking a lot about this recently and wanted to bring it up and see if anybody else experiences this too. 

Sometimes it feels like I’m seeing 2 fully different person in the mirror depending on how I look. When I’m not feeling attractive, my hair isn’t working, my makeup is off or I’m not wearing any and happen to feel ugly, & with my body as well sometimes (even though my body type would be considered, in general, societally ideal). Compared to when I am feeling attractive though, its like thats a different person. My brain struggles to identify that thats the same person. My mind is so much more critical of my own face than anyone else’s. 

I’ve had girlfriends in the past and have been able to see them as the same person with and without makeup, or with mess hair, but my brain refuses to process my own face as the same in both. I have to consciously remind myself that those are the same people and I’m capable of looking like that again. 

I’ll definitely bring this up to my therapist soon but was curious if anyone else has this experience or anything similar. "

619,2,"Like I know what kind of woman and what kind of situation are bad for me and I know that I'll easily get sucked into something that ends up doing serious harm, and I also know how to avoid them.


But what are you supposed to do when someone lies about who they are to get close to you? Recently I met someone who seemed fantastic and we got on really well so I asked them out on a date and that's when they said they were in an open relationship already. Getting involved in that kind of dynamic always leads to me getting incredibly ill and I was really close to being attached enough to just go along with it anyway, and her actions after telling me showed me that she would have been happy to push whatever buttons she needed to make it happen.


I was really lucky, I'm having a crappy day today and haven't got any work done, but I was able to say no and only be about 75% weird about it, which is actually a success. 


But this sort of thing keeps happening, idk if there's something about me that attracts these people but like there are so so so many guys out there who would go for it, why can't they find one of those instead. And more importantly, how do I protect myself from this in future?"
620,1,"Do you people ever look at everyone around you and feel like you are disgusted by every single person you see?? No one is interesting, no one is funny, I don't genuinely give a shit about anyone except my therapist and psychiatrist. Everyone else makes me feel sick and isolated. "

I used to assume it's also due to my social anxiety but even now when I do have friends I treat them in a specific way of patterns that I wanna stop. I researched a lot from actual sites and documents for a while and it can still be something else but so many symptoms align with me. I get bad mood swings and hurt myself, one second I think of wanting to not be alive and then a bit later I feel as if everything's fine and I can forever live my life. It happens a lot and I can't control it and it scares me because it's slowly getting worse. I treat people as if they'll abandon me and I get so focused on a specific person until I randomly feel as if they're the most vile person on earth and I hate them just for the next day after I ignored them to feel terrible and as if they could be my savior. I really don't want to feel this way and I don't know how to handle it. This is all off the top of my head so any questions or answers or even if it could be anything else would really help. I read also that a lot aligns with CPTSD but I'm pretty sure I don't have that because I don't have that major trauma from my childhood but I just wanted to clarify that. Any help appreciated I just don't want to feel like this ❤️‍🩹"
624,2,"




I used to have a close friendship with a girl who has Borderline Personality Disorder. Our relationship was full of ups and downs — every time, she would cut me off and then come back, or I would bring her back.

The last time, she sent me a very sweet photo that made me feel like I was important to her. But I didn’t reply for two weeks because I was angry with her and didn’t want to hurt her, so I chose to stay silent instead.

When I finally came back, she had completely changed. I kept pushing her to talk, and eventually, she exploded and said things like:
“You scared me once and I’ll never come back to you,”
“I’m sensitive and you ruined everything,”
“Don’t ever contact me again, and delete everything that belongs to me from your phone.”

Then she cut off all contact.

I tried reaching out for several months, but nothing worked. Then recently, she and her friend called me to ask what I’m doing with her pictures (our relationship was only online). I told them the truth.

After that, they disappeared again.

I really want to reconnect with her, but I have no idea how.
What should I do?
And what is happening from a psychological point of view?

"
625,2,"basically the title, my emotions are so extreme where sometimes it can cause problems. i feel so much for people so easily and fast and I just want to feel normal for them. how do I fix this"
626,1,"People new to the DSM-IV often ask me to describe what “emptiness” feels like. It’s a word they’re often acquainted with through cheesy teen poetry and Linkin Park lyrics…but widely misunderstood both by clinicians and laypeople because it’s fleeting for them and rarely, if ever, as intense. 

The most accurate explanation I can muster is that emptiness is the feeling that something is always missing, or that you’re not “an insider”. Nothing is ever enough. You live with a slow leak, where when people try to fill your bucket with kindness, it just gradually drips out, because when you’re at the peak of an episode, everything seems ulterior.

Winning feels impossible. If you have a good job, it’s the lack of meaningful social relationships that hits like a brick. If you have a ton of friends, your fixation becomes whether or not they actually like you or if they just hang out with you out of pity or because they’re hot for “inclusion” and love to show it by sitting next to the weird kid. If you have nice things, you wonder how long it’ll be before they’re taken away, or how they’re being used as instruments to control you. You’re thankful for others’ kindness- but you never quite feel like you’ve earned it

When you’re passed over for the award, the promotion or the opportunity, you feel worthless and like you’re always last to be picked, no matter how many plaques are on your wall or how much is in your account. On the occasions you “are” chosen, you feel like it’s probably because nobody else auditioned or applied, or because someone with a bleeding heart “let you win”, gave you enough “pity points” to get an A+, or was too afraid to tell you the truth.  

Feeling content, loved, connected, accomplished, attractive, etc are all passing phases- but whereas the “good people” sit comfortably with both their flaws and triumphs, you’re swallowed up by the sensation of listlessness or inadequacy for around 75-80% of your day. 

It’s exhausting. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. I wish I could find someone who could pull me out of it."

It hasn’t been too bad, just off and on. I don’t know how to stop it. But today I was babysitting my sister. I was zoning out or dissociating I guess, with my legs up over the arm of the couch. My little sister sits on one of my legs and bouncing. Then she just keeps asking how my day is (she’s 3) then again she just keeps bouncing asking how my day is. She then stops and looks at me and just smiles and hugs my leg.

I'm not diagnosed with anything to be honest except anxiety. I'm too scared to talk to someone incase I sound insane.
I'm not diagnosed with autism but I'm 90% sure I have it too. I have a lot of the symptoms.

I'm scared to talk to anyone since I lost all my friends due to me being unstable.
Not sure what to do. I would like some help on what I can or could do.

And please I don't want anyone saying ""it's normal"" I want someone to actually listen to me."
631,2,"I've been waiting to get into a DBT group for about three months, and finally have my start date (Monday June 16). I'm concerned and anxious because:

1. I hate groups
2. I don't like people
3. I don't want to tell everyone why I tried to kill myself
4. I'm worried revisiting all my trauma will make me spiral

I guess I am just asking for some advice from people who've been to DBT and if there's anything I can do to prepare myself?

Thanks."
632,3,"I loved this girl. She was everything I wanted in a person: smart , funny, wealthy, organized, willing to be outdoorsy with me, into paddle boarding, affectionate and a freak in the sheets.

Everything was perfect. We both have BPD and we were head of heals for eachother. Today we both unadded/blocked eachother because I was at my limit. She’s wanted us to end our relationship/friendship randomly over nothing. We dated for awhile but she was cheating the whole time so we became fwb. She’s been suicidal since then and I supported her sooo much and then she suddenly just says we’re not good together… like we hungout two days ago and we both had a blast.

Why does she keep wanting to push me away? Our relationship was amazing. We had real chemistry and she threw it away fo help random dudes jerk off. She barely apologized to me and kept doing it until we took a step bsck. I love her still and hope she reaches out to me. I said some things I regret but I was so upset that she would just throw away our friendship/connection over her mood changing. Whag the fuck. Can someone from her side of things weigh in? If you’ve done this before to someone (breaking up then begging for them bsck) why did you do it? How do I get her back.

I just don’t get it. Why sabotage our relationship when everything was going so well… you wanted to marry me while stabbing me in the bsck. Why can’t we just be friends and nothing serious.. I just wanted to have some fun this summer. Hikes, paddle boarding, swimming etc. I’m just so disappointed that she’d cancel all of our plans on a whim. When I tried discussing our relationship 90% of the time she’d shut down. I tried so hard to be the best partner to you Madeline, I can be and I treated her so well. I felt like she was vilifying me and disregardedd how much I cared about her. I felt like everytime we hungout was wiped from her mind because our chemistry is powerful and we always had fun <3. She wouldn't reflect on how cutting me off the nigt prior wouldn't make me talkative, then she acts hurt when discussing throwing away our relationship over nothing when we worked ou what we were and were both happy (non exclusive and taka step back). That’s when I had enough and told her goodbye and that I wish she gets better. I thought she’d be okay because she’s in treatment too, but I have no clue if She takes it seriously.. I asked her if she’s watched any videos about BPD or done research and she said no. I was blown away by this especially since she is doing textbook BPD behavior.

Why does she do this. How do I end it and get her more stable. Missy if you see this, why cut me out when I’ve had your back :( I’ve defended you when people shit talked you. I’ve shown you nothing but kindness and have talked your through so many hard times. Why push me away over and over? That’s the only time we’ve been unhappy. "
633,1,"I'm over 40 years old, and my whole life is have struggled with depression, anxiety, ptsd and I'm the poster child for abandonment issues. That's a lot to deal with especially for other adults who have busy lives and stressful jobs so I wouldn't dream of asking how could this happen? I know damn well how. I got needy because 3 text a day wasn't enough and I couldn't just suck it up. So now 5 years ends with ""fine youre dumped have a nice life"" (direct quote). I wish so much that I could just be a normal person, instead I'm sweet but too much work. I just realized this year that I have no friends and now I've pushed away the only person in my life that still cared. Therapy didnt help today in the slightest, leave me some support or stories or just anything because I'm honestly hanging on by a thread. Thank you"
634,2,"How does it feel for you personally when you're apart from your favorite person? 
I've heard it only told a different way once and honestly sometimes I feel like I'm crazy for feeling as intensely as I do. I'm fine and then he comes around and it's like a bomb of very intense emotions and thoughts going off inside me. 
I feel so...un-normal when this happens, with a little voice in my head telling me I am crazy and I need to stop, but the amount of physical pain it brings me... I don't know. "
635,2,"So my gf has had a crush before on a girl who has asian features and yk like completely different from me. I do not whatsoever look or resemble any of those features, I feel as if its her type and i do not even meet it. When she watches something like a reel or vids where there is a woman with those features i find her that she is being too interested in it. Honestly it makes me feel insecure and i feel like breaking down. She knows i do not like it but i dont think she cares enough to comfort because for her its not a big issue but for me it makes me insecure to the core. What do i even do?"
636,2,"Like i don't have to deal with people when i'm isolated. I don't have to decide if i can trust them or not. I don't have to worry about if they'll like me or not. 

I feel so much safer when i'm away from them. I don't have to worry 24/7 if they'll harm me, leave me or they won't like me. I don't have to overthink their words, actions towards me. 

Yeah, i think i'm ok with being isolated and i'm getting used to it. It's kinda boring but i think this is the only way to protect my peace of mind from bpd tbh"
637,0,"Im at a relatively new therapist that specializes in DBT. We had an intense session yesterday and I could vaguely see the road ahead (in terms of therapy and healing), but that scared me. I told her that it scares me and she asked why.

Me: ""Because I dont know if Im strong enough for that.""

Her: ""You are. I have never seen a Borderliner who isnt strong.""

Wanted to share that with my fellow sufferers ♥️"
638,2,"I have noticed that when I try to come off as nice or friendly it just seems like I’m flirting with people. I don’t mean to give off the wrong idea but the minute they do give me time and attention it just spirals down to this back and forth. 
I also tend to fall for people very hard and fast and it almost feels like I’m love bombing them at times "
639,3,"I’ve had BPD symptoms as far back as my memory goes, but diagnosed a year ago after they spiked hard. I just don’t get it. Brains fully locked on one person that I want to be with and even after months of barely talking at all it’s hitting just as hard as the first time I felt anything. Constant 100% swings in my emotions or nothing at all. Almost jumpscaring myself with my own reflection. Worst of all, having to keep it all to myself because telling the people I trusted really dont like it (had the police called on me because I apparently sounded critically suicidal instead of letting off steam)

Therapy is great but it’s just a moment in between a couple weeks of hell every time, no matter what I take with me. Meds are fantastic but I still can’t stop imagining how the ceiling would look with a red paint job. Being self aware of every tiny interaction with myself and others and even objects is crippling my mental. You’re telling me there are thousands of people that do this? Daily? How the fuck?"
640,1,"Been diagnosed with BPD after a police officer accused me of rape. So since 2023, still dealing with the ramifications of everything, I still get overwhelming feelings of self destructive behavior and depression. Smoking whole packets of cigarettes, attempts at cutting, any distraction activities don’t seem to work. Family have left me, unemployed nearly homeless multiple suicide attempts. I just don’t know how to move on? "
641,3,"I always feel bad about this. I am this person’s favorite person. But it got to a point of unhealthy obsession. It’s me or no one. He’s convinced I’m the only person for him. His soulmate. I tried to make myself love him. To make him happy. But, I couldn’t do it. I felt trapped and suffocated. It wasn’t about me like he said, it was about him trying to keep himself stable. He claimed he loved me but I don’t Think he ever recognized what he was doing to me. He said if I ever left he was going to kill himself. Wanted me to get his name tattooed, make a suicide pact. Anything to make me stay with him forever 

I’m even breaking down talking about it. I cut contact and left him about 6 months ago. Of course, I still care. I never want to hurt anyone, and I never wanted him to hurt or suffer. I don’t wish ill harm on anyone. I secretly lurk his accounts to make sure he’s still alive. If he died I’d feel so guilty. It would be my fault. I see him suffering without me. I hate it. But I can’t go back, I can’t put myself back in this situation 

I have gotten a new partner. Whom I’m happy with. But I can’t shake the guilty feeling. Like I’m doing something wrong. I hate it. He still nips at my conscious

645,3,"Update for this post from two days ago:
https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/s/ppJAbNlzIj

So um, while my FP was texting me he loves me and how he's worried he was telling the camp neighbours that he was leaving on a train and packed up his backpack.

He didn't tell me until 5 hours after when I complained about something again and I was so shocked cuz a few seconds before he said we'd talk later??? And now I have to go home alone, somehow carrying a tent, a table, two chairs, a cooling box and three bags on my own between three different train stations, which was already near impossible with another person helping me when I came. He also owes me 175 that I'm never getting back since he blocked me.

Essentially, when I complained he sent me a pre-prepared paragraph that I later realized he was writing while we were cuddling the other night and while he was comforting me cuz I felt horrible about something unrelated to him. And good lord, that paragraph was the meanest thing I've ever read in my life, Ive been bullied and abused all my life, I've had racists slurs thrown at me and been thrown down stairs and yet none of that is as mean as that text. I would've understood if he had complained about how he can't deal with my BPD and left it at that, which he did indirectly but no. He instead mentioned my body count, my horrible personality, my social incompentence and how my mental disabilities are extremely obvious (he has autism and ADHD as well so it confused me), how he's not surprised I don't get compliments because I was more attractive before testosterone it scares people off (which is something I vented to him the night before), how my breath smells, how I apparently don't care about my mother (full on not true) and pretty much every single other I had ever mentioned to him being insecure about. I got blocked right after.

Why would you do that to someone? Why would you not tell me you're leaving when it's happening? Or right after??? He didn't even mention that he left in the paragraph, I found out 5 hours later from the neighbours. Why would you waste 400+ euros by leaving after less than a day when you're broke. 

By the way, I admit I was wrong, especially because I split at some point, but that was because he wasn't spending any time with me, kept lashing out at me when I even suggested getting to know other people (in a platonic way???), he said ""I don't care"" and ""Why are you whining so much"" when I asked to borrow his charging cable cuz I lost mine on the way here despite me being the person who bought EVERYTHING we haf at the camp and the food, spending 500+ euros total on it, him only eating the expensive fast food despite refusing to get me a coffee because he wants to save money which would also make half the food I bought go bad, him constantly leaving somewhere for two days straight without asking if I wanna come or even telling me he's leaving. I could go on.

I get that he's disabled, so am I, but I don't get how I'm in the wrong for complaining about hypocrisy, being lashed out at or nothing going the way we had planned it to (or rather I, cuz I did everything, all he did was show up and he was supposed to then give me his part of the bus+ train money after). I wish I had just come alone, it ruined my whole time so far and the neighbours hate me cuz he befriended them and they probably don't like me cuz of that. 

I just don't get it, I would never leave someone on a trip like that, no matter how annoyed I was. I would especially not do it while insulting them with every single thing they're insecure about. I feel so betrayed and lied to and I cried for two hours yesterday, for the first time ever since I started testosterone 9 months ago cuz that makes it near impossible to do it. I feel sm more uncomfortable than before, everyone's looking at my hairy legs and my chest tape and armit hair and now after what he told me I feel so much more uncomfortable. He told me he loves me but he had a two page paragraph with insults waiting for me at the first complaint I gave, despite already being on his way home. And then people are surprised why I'm so scared of abandonment."
646,0,"Recently, I've come to the realization that I'm lacking in many crucial roles within my current romantic relationship. She is the the love of my life and I'm absolutely committed to this relationship, so I want pursue growth. I've been struggling being emotionally available and lacking nurturing characteristics, matters that I blame my BPDD and my overall lack of awareness and attention for- does anyone have any books or resources that can combat these issues? If they don't even target these particular issues, are there any books or pieces of literature that have helped resolve or manage BOD symptoms? Thank you!"
647,2,"I dissociate every single day. I wake up, I go to school, I function. But the second I step back into my house? It’s like my soul leaves my body. I don’t shut down physically. I’m still walking around, doing things but mentally, emotionally? Gone. I turn off like a robot in sleep mode.

Then suddenly it’s morning again, and I’m back in my body like, “Oh, right. Time to be a person again.” It’s like I only feel conscious when I’m around people and i have to put on a face. When I’m alone, I vanish. I’m not even numbing I’m just not there.

But here’s the thing.
Sometimes, not every day but just randomly. Consciousness hits me up. Out of nowhere. I’ll be lying in bed in the middle of the night, and then boom. I start having a panic attack. I’m hyperventilating. My chest is in pain. Vision is blurry. I start crying, overwhelmed by all the emotions I didn’t feel. It feels like a video game where your screen starts slowing down and your vision gets blurry when the monster is near you. My suicidal thoughts get really intense during these attacks too. It is just too scary.

648,3,"i lost my job a few weeks ago while i was on leave to do PHP and have had a hell of a time applying for unemployment, disability, and other benefits since then. those are still in progress, and i have about -$300 in my checking account right now with no savings and so, so many bills. 

i've been applying to jobs every day and i know i cant expect the perfect one to fall in my lap but i was so close to being okay while i was in the hospital (and...... oh yeah, Not Working). and now everything feels like it's crashing again and i don't know what to do. i need to work full time to survive because my support system absolutely cannot help out financially. but i think if i end up with another guest-facing full time job i might just walk into traffic.

i started a medication that is helping to get me up and moving a little better, but the mood swings are still so frequent and intense. i'm feeling very lost right now and any advice is appreciated. TIA

649,3,My pwBPD feels hurt because I am really bad at knowing how to reassure her when she’s having an emotional crisis because I don’t know what that reassurance would look or sound like. I tend to shut down and get quiet when I am emotionally overwhelmed and that makes her emotional states worse because I am not able to provide the comfort that she needs in those moments and it makes her feel alone. Can you please give as many tips and pointers as you can on how I can help her through these moments? 
650,1,"I can't take this anymore. I was having a good day all day and just randomly out of the blue, my mood changed and now I'm miserable again. This happens all the time, every single day. I really don't know how much longer I can deal with this. Literally nothing even fucking happened. Why do I feel like the world is ending??? I hate this shit so much. This is without even mentioning my other symptoms. Life is so painful. Sometimes I really do think there's no other way out than ending my life. It never goes away. I genuinely feel so trapped. Trapped in a body with a mind I can't control."
651,1,"(19 F) I fell hard for my fwb of 9 months and the fact that he doesn't like me back that way is simply destroying me and eating me away so painfully. I can't take it. I can't take it at all. I love him so much, but he doesn't love me. when we first started hooking up, he was looking for more of an emotional connection and even had some romantic feelings for me at first, but my fears of committment and heartbreak got the best of me so I told him I only wanted sex. I'd been so hurt in the past but was still a virgin when I met him - I just wanted to engage with and embrace my sexual side more. that's all. I told him to only text me for sex or important things and he just became so detached and avoidant afterwards

he wanted so much more out of me. he cared so much and he still cares for me deeply as a friend, he even said he cares for me more than most people, but does not love me. because it's hard for him to love someone since it's such a strong word and because he has been hurt so much in the past too

I wrote him letters - saying how I feel, made him paintings explaining how I feel and what he means to me. and he holds and cherishes all my feelings, gifts and vulnerabilities so tenderly, respectfully and genuinely, but just does not reciprocate my love. he keeps apologizing for not having these same feelings, keeps comforting me and telling me I can find someone else, someone even better than him and that I have the potential to be, feel and have better in my life. but I don't care. I want HIM. but he's romantically interested in someone else. he says it may not go anywhere with them and they only hung out one time, but that it COULD still go somewhere further just because of the attraction. that's more than me. he doesnt even know this person as well as me and they won 

and I'm just fucking shattered. it's not even that he's this perfect guy, he's flawed like any young man - he's just the best compared to all the other bullshit I've put up with. he was my first time - first person to make me feel safe and respected in my body, after all the severe sexual trauma of BOTH of our childhoods. the first person to hold, see me and cherish me in such a beautiful way. and now it means nothing 

he's known of my feelings for a few weeks. I've tried to be passive and kind of ignore him most of the time, at least until he saw the letter I wrote him. and when he did, he appreciated it and told me he's gonna keep it since it's the most thoughtful and intricate thing anyone's ever written for him :( he's been so worried about me lately - always checking up on me, asking if I'm okay, being extra attentive and gentle. he is so kind and genuine it's hard not to be in love 

he told me even though he likes someone else and not me, that we can still keep hooking up if I want. in my head, I said ""I can't, I can't do it"" and when I went to his house today, I only brought my purse and none of my ""sex stuff"" because I really did intend to just talk. but he basically seduced me that I gave in and had sex with him anyway. before that, he revealed that he's gonna go to community college for a few months and then later this year move out of state to go to a 4 year.  he swears its because he's sick of living with his abusive pos dad. which I understand having had 2 abusive parents myself. but I feel like it's me 

while we were hooking up, I kept telling him that I love him, that Im in love with him and begged him to stay and not leave, just for me. but he told me he can't, he has to go but can just hold me while he's here and I can't fucking take it. I just wanna die. my life is so unstable, unfulfilling, so miserable and empty. nothing feels real or worthwhile. but he makes me feel alive or at least shielded from the chaos. and he wants to leave me, just like everyone else 

I've tried to have sex with other people but it's not the same. I want him. him. him. him. no one else. but he wants to leave me instead. I can't stand this. I already have so much change and instability in my life, I don't wanna lose something good, especially cause it's all my fault. and nothing will fix it

I am gonna try to start therapy again to make sense of this and everything else, but right now I just can't take it and it's tearing me apart. I just wanna die"

653,3,I have always had problems with eating every since I was young. I was diagnosed with bpd last August and I feel like now that there’s a label I’m obsessed with “fitness and health”. I claim to my family and friends that I’m so healthy and I work out so much which is true but I constantly under eat or p#rge. Nothing will ever be small or fit enough for me. And I have never been this way before I was 128 at 5’6 with on and off food issues. Now I’m 117 with the most horrible body issues. I can’t even look at myself with getting sad over my appearance. Is it me getting older and my problems evolving or having a label now? 
654,3,"27F 27M so I'm unemployed disabled so I don't talk to many different people or go out much. My bf isn't willing to do the apartment hunting on his own (lazy) so I'm doing it. Plus I'm home alone to take calls all day. We started 6 days ago, I've been refused by 3 places so far out of 12 I called. Idk if thats normal.

Because of my bad attitude.   


Trying to understand if it's because of my inexperience or disorder or what, and then any advice you can offer, including your meanness.   


She asks for my financial status, I say this exactly:

I'm unemployed, I'll be paying with rent assistance and my bf pays the rest. I don't have my SSN card but I'll tell you it. My credit score is bad because of student loans.   
  
and I'm just coming off weird and unsettling or something? They literally stop answering. I'm literally just being honest. Perfectly good opportunities destroyed.

Sucks because my bf is the talker in our relationship. I just come off bitchy without meaning to.

Maybe I did need to give that information, but she would've liked to hear from an applicant with better finances? But I'm not the one signing off, the apartment isn't in my name. But then why do they even need to know my credit score if it's not my apartment? It said ""Need these questions answered by every tenant."" Is this normal? What the hell? That's what inspired me to be nasty to them."
655,2,"I know its fine, I know it will be fine. My bf went to dinner tonight I guess with coworkers, and I can't help but be like 'oop, it's with another woman that he'll fall in love with and leave me for'. I know its illogical, but damn. He's also not responding very much today. We're somewhat long distance and he's coming in a few weeks to look after me after surgery and I know its a sweet and nice thing for him to do, but I feel like I'm just being a burden and he's decided im a burden and wants to be with someone else. It wasn't necessary for me to be put under but I know I won't tolerate it awake and I don't want to, but I'm scared he and everyone thinks I'm being a wimp. 

This is very much a rant, I dont think I truly believe any of this, but brain isn't listening 🙃"

657,1,"Does anyone else feel like it’s easier to have other BPD friends rather than being friends with those without BPD?  I just feel like if I had a friend who was like me, who understood me, who cared the way i do, all my problems would be solved. I try to explain things to regular people and they just never seem to get it. They offer advice that only works for regular people, or they invalidate, make me feel like i’m crazy. Soooo, if any of you lovely people out there wanna be friends, i’m totally down for that 🩵 "
658,2,"Does anyone else find their symptoms pretty much ONLY exist when they are partnered? Of course I very intensely love my partner but it just overwhelms me so much and I think about and question my relationship all the time. I am constantly seeking reassurance and scared things won’t work (classic bpd). Friendships and family, I feel secure in. I almost never have these feelings of insecurity / possibly abandonment. I have good friends and we all treat each other well, but my romantic relationships have always just been a whole different head space. The only real symptom I experience outside of my relationship that may affect my friendships / family is feeling as if I’ve done something to upset someone else pretty often. Has anyone else felt as if BPD is only prevalent in their romantic relationships only? I also have BP2.

659,3,"Okay so I’m an author and I struggle really badly with rejection. I’ve got multiple books and signed many contracts with publishers. 

Even this week, I signed a contract for my novel. However, all I can think about is that one of short stories was rejected and it makes all the positive things disappear. 

I know I sound like a wanker, but I’m sitting here thinking I’m a failure and nothing matters. It’s where my head goes automatically and I can’t get out of it. 

Does anyone have any advice? I feel like such an idiot. I feel worse for feeling bad about one rejection, and even worse because I know I’m being a complete moron. "
660,1,"I’ve been facing the idea…fact… that I live in idealised detailed fantasy a lot… especially around marriage and family… and once people I love around me break that fantasy I can’t cope… and end up in an episode and psychosis. I’m starting to understand just how fucked up the pedestal - devaluation cycle is. I think I’ve blown up my family and terrorised them. I thought others were abusing me… but no… it’s been me. My ex (separated because you know… blew it all up) has done terrible things but now I’m not sure if it was as bad as I’ve felt it to be. 

I’m trying not to split into the “I’m evil and deserve to die” trope and I’m not quite sure which was is up. Clearly I’m not doing great, and not sure if anyone would understand. Can anyone relate?"
661,1,"Lately I’ve been feeling differently about my partner. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly what changed but something has felt off for a while now. I don’t feel as cared for as I used to. I’ve tried to communicate openly, something they’ve always encouraged even when it’s messy or raw, but lately every time I express something that’s been hurting me it just feels like I’m a burden. They often redirect the conversation to what they’ve been going through instead. And I do understand, they’ve been under a lot of pressure, but it feels like what I say doesn’t really land. Nothing changes.

Still I’ve tried to brush it off, telling myself they need my support more than anything. So I’ve held on to at least the relief of saying things out loud, even if I don’t feel heard.

Our anniversary was last night. At first I thought they’d forgotten, but they texted me saying “Wow I can’t believe it’s our anniversary tomorrow” which gave me a little hope. I reminded myself it wasn’t about gifts or big gestures, as long as they shared how they feel I’d be okay. That’s been our tradition over the years, a message, something meaningful.

I put together a care box and wrote a heartfelt letter for them. They appreciated it and thanked me, but also said they felt bad for not doing anything for me, that they’d just been too busy. And I get that, I do. But I’ve seen them go out of their way to do thoughtful things for others recently. I guess I was still waiting for that one meaningful message that never came.

Lately most of what they talk about is one of their close friends, how tough things have been for that person and how they plan to meet up multiple times this week. I feel guilty for even thinking this way, but it’s hard not to feel like I’m just the leftover space in their life. Like I’m the crumbs they leave behind. Especially knowing that this friend is someone they’ve known for much less time than they’ve known me. It’s hard not to compare how present and emotionally generous they’ve been with that person versus how it’s felt with me.

I don’t think they’ve ever really acknowledged my pain the way they do with that friend. I can’t remember a time they’ve been that patient or that accommodating with me. Maybe I don’t always notice because when I’m in an episode I lose track of how things really are. But even outside of that, it’s never felt like what they have with them.

We’ve been in this on-and-off rhythm for a while now. There are moments that feel like closure, or bonding, or like we’re finding our way back to each other again through texts or small moments. But then it slips away just as quickly. And every time I try to be honest about how I feel, it seems like I push them further without meaning to.

I seriously don’t know what to do with myself."
662,2,"

I started to fall for a friend who also has BPD. I also do, even if she hadn't said anything I could tell by the similarities in our background and the little mind games she would play to try and get my attention instead of just asking for it and telling me she liked me. We never had sex, but we would take baths together and I would spank her. Or sleep naked together every night and massage each other. 

I could tell we had feelings for each other. But instead of tell me she would just start talking about her crushes to try and make me jealous lol. She told her crush about me too and they started following me on instagram. 

She invited me out dancing, and was all over me but as soon as I saw her crush was there I put physical distance between us. It's like she was trying to make us both jealous. After that She would watch me on the dance floor but ignore me like she didn't see me. Which was weird because we were giving each other naked massages that morning lol and I know she's not doing that with her crush. But it didn't matter to me that her crush was there, or that she had one. It just bothered me that she invited me out dancing and only wanted to dance with me if her crush was watching. 

I've been living with her for almost two months. I moved into her parents house due to an emergency on my end. So we spent every night together. She told me she loved me. We haven't kissed because I felt hesitant to spoil my housing situation. 

But she's really been throwing herself sexually at me from the moment I started staying with them. She's absolutely gorgeous, talented, intelligent, kind and tasteful. I do love her and value our relationship so much. 

But she's so hot and cold. The other night I asked her to have a fire with me and she said no because she was busy. And just sat inside in a chair for a few hours scrolling before coming to join me. 

 I invite her to sit on my lap and we're just cuddling each other, putting my hands on her etc. she propositioned me again for sex and I just tried to joke it off. We still hadn't talked about it yet, but I was nervous to in that moment. 

The immediately she starts talking about her ex and how much I remind her of them. 

I just felt annoyed at that point. She clearly wants to be with me. And she's fine telling me about all the people she's interested in, but won't say that same thing to me. And instead tries to make me jealous. I would love to date her, but this isn't making me feel like it would be stable for my housing am. 

After that night, I sent her some voice notes on my position. It was annoying that we hadn't talked about it and were playing all these games. I just told her my concerns and expressed how nice our time has been and that we should continue to build our friendship. I can't tell you how she seems to feel about it. It seems she took it well. Acting like she doesn't care as usual. 

With people that have BPD, they withdraw and act indifferent when they're stewing inside. They'd rather act out to try to get a response from you than tell you how they feel. And both of us were doing that for a month. But at this point I want to be with someone who wants ME and isn't afraid to say that. 

I'm a bit better at managing BPD symptoms than I was years ago. I try not to react to my insecurities impulsively and just let time handle my perspective. 

I think the mutual BPD would be really hard to remedy. "
663,1,"Does anyone else feel they don’t have one thing they like? I only like things because I want to be like someone.For example I read loads of books and wrote for months so people would associate that with me and praise me but I didn’t get any enjoyment out of it. Same with basic stuff like the way I speak, I change my accent based on who I want to be. Every once in awhile I see someone in irl or in a movie and it’s like an epiphany, as if I finally found who I want to be and do everything to become it.Everything I do is performative and I don’t have one thing I enjoy doing, I just convince myself I do so people will see me in the way I want them to.
It’s the same with things like my political viewpoint and morals. I don’t actually have any and I just agree with whatever I hear and who I’m around.
I feel like a shell when I’m on my own because I have no one to perform for and I become so bored

Another thing. I consider myself very empathetic and able to see things from other viewpoints, but I also don’t care? For example: if my friends dad died I would be there for her,so sympathetic and do anything to help. But it’s not because I feel bad it’s only so she knows how good of a friend I am and keeps me around. Even with family members death has felt like either a bother or an opportunity. But when a boyfriend breaks up with me I feel like someone has actually died and I’m way more upset?

Is this normal or am I just a shitty person??"

665,1,"Hey. I know that maybe not many people will see this or possibly even read this but I feel I need to get this off my chest. I'm a 20 year old female. I used to have a fiance and no they weren't a guy. It was a female too. I met her when I needed her most. We met on a dating app. Now I had never been more connected to someone in my entire life then that women haha. But the thing is since I have BPD haha. My brain found excuses to argue with her and push her away. The thing with the relationship she was well. My reason for living. Now I know this sounds toxic. And I now it is but. But let me explain. Sure it's bad I count on her for living. But also. She gave me the motivation to keep living for her to wake up every morning seeing her next to me. To looking forward to a future where maybe perhaps things wouldn't be so bad haha. But I kept arguing and pushing her away screaming at her. I was a mess. Soon she gave up. She ended it. She told me she never wanted to see me, talk to me, interact with me, ever again. I turn 21 soon. I met her when I was 19. It's been about 10 months without her since I've seen her. And I just. Keep replaying those moments. I miss her. I miss her so much that no matter who I've tried to date I could never get as comfortable with them as I was with her. Not only that she was the only person I ever told EVERYTHING about me. And mean everything. Not even my family new thatuch about me. And she left. I just. Miss her so much. Sometimes I have dreams of her and I getting back together. And then I wake up. And when I wake up from those dreams I cry and hope to see her in my dreams again. Just hug her once. Just to hold her and apologize. Or just to hear her voice. Anything. But I know. I know it's over. But it still hurts everyday. How long will this take to get over? How long will I feel so numb about other human interactions?"
666,2,"My wife has filed for legal separation. The past 5 years of my marriage is filled with my controlling behavior driven by anxiety. I often times have best intentions but how it’s executed has caused irreversible damage to her emotionally and our relationship. It just comes out as controlling her and keeping her from doing what she wants due to my own insecurities and anxieties. 

I also struggled with impulsivity, saying harsh things in the moment that I don’t mean. I’ve even told MYSELF that I don’t give a fuck if we divorce. Maybe it’s better that way. And here, she’s been gone for 3 weeks now and I sob everyday hoping she’ll come back. 

Now my marriage is on life support. And finally I met a psychiatrist that suggests I might have BPD. "

I'm not even sure how to connect when all i hear is how pretty and hot i am. It makes me feel i have nothing else to offer and i start to act accordingly.

I got diagnosed with bpd a few yrs ago and i’ve been learnin more about how it shows up in my life day after day. Sometimes i notice stuff i do or feel, and i’m like “ok that’s prob my bpd” But i still don’t always know when i’m actually being affected by it or when i just feelin stuff normally, so i’d love to hear from u :

How do u realize ur bpd is kickin in?

Like are there small daily things or specific reactions where u just know it’s that? Would be really helpful if ppl could share examples.

i know it’s different for everyone but wanna understand how others experience it too.

thx and take care everyone 🪼"
674,1,"I am 26F diagnosed recently. Married for 6 years & I still cannot figure out how to stop the urge to want to sleep with other people.
I’m so tired of this,I just want to be with my wife.

To make a long story short, I will just explain my current situation. My wife & I are usually introverted but recently met another couple that we want to start hanging out with. The problem is.. I am very attracted (physically & mentally)to one of them. I DO NOT want to be, but it seems I can’t help it. It’s unfortunately a crush at this point. This happens SO OFTEN, I HATE IT :(

Ive tried to find flaws to make her unappealing. Tried to picture how a relationship w/ her would likely be not as great as my beautiful marriage. But nothing seems to work. 

I know all the reasons why BPD is a major factor with the attention seeking, idealization 
Etc.. I need a real life success story, some real advice on how to stop doing this, not the medical answer. I really just want to be her friend, we have a lot in common. It’s healthy for us to have friends & I want to be able to succeed w/out making things weird or very bad.

675,2,"I want to get somewhere with myself but I'm not too sure how.

I'm in university but I've never had a job before as it isn't within the pipeline school pushes you towards doing immediately and applying for. I'm good at what I'm told to do but struggle otherwise. 

I want to become more independent for myself but I've been thrown into life-changing events frequently in which every time I settle I become dependent and scared. I used to be more independent for the sake of my survival but I struggle to leave the house alone.

I struggle to take care of myself and eat or get up without a purpose or assistance or a responsibility. I'm scared I will be drained by the job but I'm not in the position in which I need money, rather experience. I enjoy working and I love doing stuff because I feel empty otherwise. 

But I'm too scared. Something's holding me back.  I don't trust myself to try or how people will treat me once I'm out. But I know once I get a job or opportunity I'll be fine with the routine and good. I don't know what scares me so much especially since I have done volunteering and I'm independent within university.

Any advice would be helpful, thank you."
676,3,"Two ish days ago, I had posted about a messy situation with my at-the-time boyfriend. And I was very much out of it and spiraling without a single sensible thought in my head to help and guide me on what to do. I think being ignored is probably one of the only things that genuinely do tick me off and trigger me, and he did just that for 26 hours. After a one-sided conversation I had with him where I was wondering how he was and what he'd been doing, I realized that everyone really was right and that none of this mattered in the long run. It's not worth beating myself up for it. It's not worth all the self blame. It's not worth all the tears and all the bruises and the marks left on me.

Our last words shared so far, which were 23 hours ago, was him saying ""yeah you too"" and I just liked the message without a single word. I didn't cry, I didn't lose my head over it, I didn't spiral on his 'tone feeling off' or if he still loved me anymore. I had never been the one to not text back, yet I did it. I don't know what it is but maybe being ignored for over a full day and being neglected and not cared for, maybe that's what did it for me. The second I liked his message I felt a sense of emptiness and i felt like every single emotion i had ever felt while being with him, disappeared. I feel like I disconnected from him and the world, sorta.

Is it normal to feel this way? I had always been the 'obsessive', clingy, ""who are you with specifically"", wanting to know what their every move was, type of girl. And now I just feel numb to everything, I feel like he never existed. But then it hits me when I'm not distracted with something. Realization hits me like a wave, the fact that I was supposed to despise and hate him, then I get angry at the whole world and everyone around me. Even when no one was to blame but myself for staying and acting like an idiot. 

The fact that there is absolutely zero closure also has me kind of NOT on-edge. Neither of us had spoken about a breakup yet we haven't spoken to each other in a full day. I kind of like this. I feel like if there was closure, if he had talked to me about where we were in this relationship exactly, I'd only hate and blame myself for getting myself to that point. To the point where I fucked up so bad that I lost a connection with the one person I cared about.

 I don't know, honestly. This is so confusing. One second, I'm right and then the other im sprinting towards the left. I forget he ever existed even though I was majorly obsessed with his existence a day ago."
677,1,"Hi everyone! Today is one of the many days when I’m reaching my wit’s end with BPD, as well as other mental health issues that torment me. I’ve been trying my best over the past 5 years, especially during the last one, since I’ve been in my first serious, healthy, committed relationship, but on days like this, I just can’t take it anymore. 

I feel like this curse of a disorder is ruining my relationship and turning me into a toxic, disgusting person. I’m in therapy, my partner insists that I made progress since we met, and I can see that, yet the emotional hell, the breakdowns, the triggers, and the aftermath — numbness and depersonalization — are the bane of my existence. As a typical BPD person, one of my greatest fears is losing my relationship. He knows a lot about BPD and couldn’t be more supportive, patient, and understanding, which is why I sometimes feel like my endeavors and chances to get better are… pretty fruitless and bleak. 

I also have cyclothymia and am on the autism spectrum, I am facing severe gender dysphoria on some days because I am agender, I’m struggling to remain clean and sober (1 year and 7 months of sobriety at the moment, as well as no nicotine or any other mind-altering substance), and there is an endless list of things that can trigger me if they catch me in the wrong moment. I also have a lot of unhealthy learnt beliefs, coping mechanisms, and behaviors. The classic scenario — emotinally absent/distant parents, criticized, only had the material needs covered, a little helicopter-parented by my grandma, who raised me until 12, zero involvement from my parents in my life besides the basic needs…

Some of the unhealthy stuff I was able to unlearn, some of it remains. Not to mention that I feel suicidal weekly, multiple times a week. Thankfully it usually passes fast, but sometimes, the impulsivity (which I can manage way bettet than in my 20s, now being 30) is so unmanageable that I feel unsafe and I have to reach out to my partner, as we agreed. No matter how much reassurement I get on days like this, I keep feeling low, apathetic, doomish, mentally and emotionally tired… I’m doing my best, yet the progress is slow and no one can guarantee that I will be able to live the happy, chill, harmonious life that both my partner and I are dreaming of. 

I am sick of myself because of what BPD does to me, which translates, during the breakdowns, into self-hatred, feeling worthless, useless, disgusting, and unlovable. Sadly, I am self-harming more often now than a month ago, since dysphoria got worse and since some past trauma and nasty memories resurfaced. 

I’m on valproic acid, which at high doses turns me into a zombie, and at low doses doesn’t do much — my cyclothymia messes with my BPD and vice versa. I’ve been taking psych meds since 19, so for about 11 years, and I developed neurological symptoms due to having been overmedicated. I am about to start Brintellix (vortioxetine) next week so I can hopefully get rid of these low moods. 

When the low moods are not triggered by cyclothymia, I remain low after a BPD breakdown. And I can’t function, I can’t even shower and my partner is the only reason I can get out of bed on those days. I’m sick of not being able to function, of having invisible struggles… I have what they call ‘quiet BPD’ so I never lash out or do outrageous things — hell, I can even resist my urges to relapse (with support most of the time) and the worst I do is raise my voice a little from frustration, but never yell, and at some point I was slamming objects and throwing objects in a separate room than where my partner was (I am using all my self-control not to, and since I’ve seen what a toxic environment it creates for my partner, I promised myself I will do my very best to stop). During the 1+ year my partner and I have been together, I full-blown split on him only once, recently, but didn’t act very differently than usual — it was mostly internal and I was very careful to keep expressing my thoughts and feelings in a decent, nice manner.

But this disorder is the curse of my life. Today, the idea that I am a toxic and/or abusive partner got into my head. My partner reassured me that I’m not, and he never bullshits me. I also know that what creates conflict and arguments and misunderstandings between us is my reactions, which are traumatic responses, such as becoming defensive (without being aggressive), overexplaining, becoming overwhelmed and not knowing how to manage my stress, becoming unable to speak in certain situations (the freeze response) etc. Yet I still feel like I am a piece of… work. And shit. And when is this self-work thing going to end? I assume never. I’ve been having BPD symptoms since 12, I’m 30 now and I feel so close to checking out on days like this. Because I feel like I am too much, I feel too much, and I want to stop unintentionally hurting my partnet. 

This was a vent, and your experiences and advice are welcome, but I also want to ask you some things. 

How do you know, or what made you realize if that was your case, that you’re toxic or abusive? 

Does therapy work for you? 

How do you manage your symptoms? 

Are you able to be in a healthy relationship? I have anxious attachment style, my partner has secure attachment style, that’s one of the reasons it’s working for us and hopefully it will keep working in the future. 

For the hopeless or almost-hopeless — do you think you can ever get better and function relatively normally with this cursed disorder? 

For those of you with substance abuse disorder — I’d like to hear your experiences and what helps you stay clean and/or sober if you are. 

Any asexual BPD folks here? Any agender or non-binary BPD folks here? 

Any neurodivergent people? 

What meds do you take if you take something? How do they work for you and what side-effects do you have?

Please feel free to comment whatever you feel like sharing. Thanks for reading."
678,2,"this person groomed me, treated me horribly, emotionally abused and manipulated me. i cannot stand the fact that he is in a “happy” relationship. i don’t know what to do. i need to break them up. is it worth being vindictive and vengeful if it means he won’t get to be happy anymore. i’m blocked on everything and he’s blocked so it would be a bit difficult to do something but possible. i could message his girlfriend but i don’t know what i would say. he would tell her that i’m lying or that i’m crazy. what do i do? i can’t live with myself knowing that karma hasn’t got to him. i know that the best revenge is to live a happy life but i can’t shake the feeling that i need to do something. i don’t know what to do. has anyone been in this sort of situation before?

679,1,"I've been diagnosed just a few weeks ago, but ever since everything just went to shit. At first I was relieved, because it all made sense and I finally had something I could name this dumpster fire of a life I'm living (if you can even call that). But the more time passed, the more I realized what this actually meant. And now my life is ruined. 

I don't have an FP and because of this I feel unbelievably empty. I can't do ANYTHING really do I don't do anything either. I see how everyone has their partner and spend time with them, but not me. I desperately want someone to just care for me, but I know it'll never happen. I'm fat. I'm ugly. And I have BPD. There's no chance in hell anyone would ever be even slightly interested in me. Nobody wants someone ugly with Borderline and if you have Borderline and have a partner - congratulations!! You're fuckin gorgeous!! But that's not me. Nobody looked at me before, so why would anything change now I have this extra baggage (and yes, that's what it is, don't even dare to call it anything else).

I recently declined a place offered to me from my local mental health clinic, because honestly- I don't see why I should go there. Not because I'm in denial that I'm sick, everyone knows that... But because I simply don't have a reason to get better. I'm alone. No one around me knows how I feel and never will. My ""friends"" are too busy with their partners anyways and I don't want to see them because I don't want to be reminded of what I can't have every time I see them. I'll never have someone, so why even bother to get better? For whom? For me? I don't care about myself... Nobody does, so why should I?

Because I try so hard to fix every single thing that is supposedly 'wrong' about me, I ended up hating myself.

For the first time, I saw myself and was able to laugh and enjoy my antics instead of analysing anything negative I did of myself.
My friends are showing me how enjoyable they see me and it really makes me feel so warm and euphoric.

"
687,3,"I posted something on here about my situation but it got removed; I guess it wasn’t clear enough that I feel like this has to do with having BPD.

Long story short I got manipulated into a situationship with my FP and I’ve been stuck in it for six months. He started seeing me three weeks after my 5 year relationship ended (which ended because of cheating, which ultimately led to SH). 

He has been polyamorous in the past and lately he wants to engage in it again. He’s been seeing a couple people and told me he is bound to eventually hook up with one of them. This is hurting me so bad. I also don’t want to lose him because he’s become one of my best friends. In the past six months, I’ve tried to break up with him three times but I gave in two times. But whenever I show hesitation, I have been love bombed and manipulated into staying multiple times. We are both toxic and also have great intimacy (the best chemistry I’ve experienced) so that doesn’t help.

I have no idea what to do. I am preparing to slowly distance myself from him to save myself from the pain of finding out he hooked up with someone. I’m already losing sleep over it, and have lost weight too. I’ve been through so much pain in my life, but I feel like I’m never going to be able to let him go.

My friends are worried for me and everyone is insisting I end it. Complete cold turkey. But no one understands that it literally feels impossible to do that. It feels like my life force will be taken away if I do that. I know I need to go to therapy as it’s helped in the past, but I don’t have the time right now.

I need help from people who understand this obsessive feeling. I need to know how I can smoothly distance myself from him, ending our intimate relationship but preserving our friendship. I’m going insane. I need him more than anything but this is no longer sustainable. We have been texting 12 hours a day for six months, spending large amounts of time together on the weekends, and I always track his location. When one of these things seem off I start losing my mind. So please give me words of advice to help me move through this.

Edit: I hope this doesn’t get removed. I need all the help I can get right now before I resort back to my SH addiction, because I think it is hitting that point. I can’t emphasize enough how bad I feel about this. It’s dictating my life and I think about it even when I sleep. I don’t think it’s a normal reaction at all."
688,2,"For context, I (17 f) have been diagnosed with bpd for two years now, but haven't gotten any form of treatment except antidepressants since then. I tried therapy, but it never worked out for me. Lately I've been feeling like I'm stuck in Limbo. I seek out romantic connections to people and get attached almost immediately once they show me any sign of genuine interest, but as soon as they take a little too long to respond, are being dry, don't immediately respond to me, I start feeling absolutely awful. I get the horrible anxiety of thinking they've lost interest and don't want to talk to me anymore. I have an almost no self confidence, and every time my attachment issues make themselves known it feels like the little bit of confidence I have left is being chipped away at. In those moments all i can think about is when are they going to write back, are they tired of me, do they think im annoying, stuff like that. I need some help, how do I deal with this?.. Is there any way of minimizing my attachment issues? Im losing hope, I feel like I'm stuck in Limbo and it's hell. "
689,2,"hi! i don't really use reddit but i needed opinions and other insight. i've been diagnosed with adhd, mdd and social anxiety a few months ago. that i could have predicted myself, but i am wondering about bpd or at the very least a personality disorder (?). i don't wanna sound like i'm TRYING to get diagnosed with something more, but i feel as though certain behaviors and habits of mine aren't solely my other issues. i've been doing a bit of research on bpd and the certain types of it. i really relate to a lot of experiences and feelings and behaviors people with bpd speak up about. i've been specifically researching quiet bpd, it's something i feel i relate most to. for reference i'm 17, i'll be 18 this year, as i know most psychologists don't want to diagnose someone as it could be linked to puberty and other things. nonetheless i'd just like some insight, suggestions and maybe anything else if other people can understand where i'm coming from. at some point i would like to bring this up to my therapist when i get another one, but for now i just need to know if my concerns are worth bringing up or not. thank you!"
690,1,I am in the train going back home from work and I literally cannot stop crying. The tears just won’t stop. My dad is coming to pick me up and as I’m nearing my stop I am trying too hard to stop myself from crying because it’s just so damn embarrassing. My parents will notice I’ve bawled my eyes out and I don’t have any explanation for it. I feel like nobody and absolutely nobody understands me. Everyday I feel like I’m wasting my life and there’s literally nothing I can do about it. I’m feeling so much and at the same time feeling absolutely NOTHING at all. 
691,3,"i’m 21f and have been diagnosed with bpd for over a year.

yesterday i spent five hours with an old white man to supposedly be tested for autism, but what it turned into was being lectured on my bpd diagnosis like i had no idea what it was. he belittled me and talked to me like a child. i was so close to just walking out of the room. i have never felt so discriminated against for being a woman and having a personality disorder.

almost none of the testing, at least to my eyes im not a doctor, pertained to autism and was just about everything else ive already been diagnosed with for a decade. 

his brain heard the word bpd and shut off to it being anything but my bpd causing me issues. he asked me nothing about my communication style, how i read a room and people, if i mask. he gave me a sheet of 40 questions that are on the raads-r test and asked me nothing else. the rest of the assessment was focused on the other diagnoses i have.

has another woman/female presenting person experienced this? maybe not during an autism assessment, but being talked down to by a doctor/psychologist/therapist for being a woman and having bpd?"
692,2,"1. Saw some stray cats outside while walking dog, wanted to go home and play video games after a longggg day. Walked to my house to get dog food (I don’t have cats) and brought it to them, then walked to my house and back again to get them water. Contacted three local no-kill shelters to try and find them a better place to live than the trash cans of an abandoned elementary school

2. Wanted to contact toxic bff/crush/potential FP? (Working on diagnosis), did not contact him.
 (long story short & sugarcoated, that person is now dating one of my friends and it makes me die inside a little seeing them together)

3. Made plans with some friends to feel better"
693,1,"I think I've fucked up worse than I ever have before in my life. For the last seven months or so I've been aware that I and my best friend were drifting apart from each other, which has been causing me immense distress, especially because I can see very clearly that they're still enjoying life and have a lot of new friends - a massive amount more than they did at the time where we were really close. I've felt and do feel like I'm being replaced, and that I don't matter that much to them anymore, and that they don't want to be around me anymore. I tried to rationalize it to myself for so long, convincing myself that it's all in my head and that I'm just creating associations where there are none, but eventually it got to a breaking point and I ended up confronting them about this and many other related aspects to what I was feeling. As it turned out, it was almost entirely attributable to something I had said to them when they had came out to me about being a trans guy (they identify as non-binary now, although I'm not entirely sure if that's because of me making them feel insecure enough to not fully commit to being themselves). The day they told me was a day I was already feeling extremely dysregulated on, and I was further confused about everything because I was (and am) deeply in love with them, but am a lesbian and at the time hadn't yet realized that I'd still be attracted to them regardless of (and actively because of) them transitioning. I'm also autistic and don't deal with large changes very well, and usually take a while to adjust after one occurs, especially when it concerns something or someone which is a big part of my life, and when I'm in that adjustment period, my reality becomes very unstable and blurred. I, however, was an unfathomably fucking idiotic fucktwat and decided that I should send them a message that night despite the fact that I was very clearly not adjusted yet and if I had waited literally a couple of fucking hours none of this would have ever happened. But it did happen, and I said some things which I can't really ever take back, things that I don't in any universe actually believe or think, and things which gave my friend deep seated insecurities and shame about their identity and expression to the point that they literally just stopped ever coming out to people after me because they were scared of other people responding in the way that I did. I deeply, deeply hurt them, and I can't make it better. I can't take it back. They know why I said what I said, and they know I don't believe any of what I said, and they know I am profoundly sorry beyond words that this ever happened and that I ever said what I said, but that doesn't really change how much it's affected them. How much it *is still* affecting them. It doesn't change the uncomfortableness they feel around me now when we're alone, it doesn't change the lack of trust or vulnerability they have with me now, it doesn't change the fact that we barely talk about anything that isn't just surface level anymore. That our closeness is gone. And will probably never return. That I've just permanently fucked our relationship. I just want to make things okay again. I want to make my friend feel okay again. I want to go back in time and give them the support they needed in that time, the support I've desperately wanted to give them for the last seven months. But I can't. I hate that I let myself do this. And I can't even feel bad about being replaced now without immense guilt because it is entirely justified and entirely my own fault. In any other world this would've hurt me beyond belief. But I just feel... nothing. I can't justify feeling anything other than a deep, immense remorse. I've built so much of my life around preventing this kind of thing from ever happening, from ever even inconveniencing the people I care about, from ever becoming a burden. From ever hurting anyone. And despite that I go ahead and manage to deeply, deeply hurt the one person I care about more than any other person I have ever met in my life. All without even realizing it happened. And now, a month after having this conversation, it's apparent that things probably won't ever go back to how they were. They just don't really want to be around me. Last night I asked them if they wanted to go to this one music event that we'd been going to on Wednesdays and they said they weren't going this week because they were too tired. Two hours later, I see them add a mutual friend of ours to some group chat we use and I started worrying that they had just gone and hung out with people after all and just told me that they were tired so that they wouldn't have to hang out with me. An hour later, that same mutual friend posts a video on their story of them in a music venue (not the one we usually go to admittedly) with a couple other people, including, of course, my friend. It hurts. It really fucking hurts. And it's entirely my fault but that doesn't make it hurt any less. I just want my friend back. I just want to be there for them and make them feel loved and supported and valued and cared about and... everything. I want the world for them. But at the end of the day they have other people who can fill those roles for them now. And I'm happy they do. I just wish I was able to be one of those people."
694,0,"If you're up to speed with season 3... What do you guys think of Maxine and the way Abby, Ginny and Norah treated her? 

In the G&G sub people have their thoughts and opinions but I'd like to know what do we think? 

I felt horrible for Max because she's not a bad person and didn't deserve being treated like that. Yes, she has her issues and is self-centred but she still makes the effort (imo) to be there and be a good friend to ANG.

This is why I never tell anyone about my bpd or my big feelings because I could split on people for being arseholes like ANG..."
695,3,"So my FP is my male best friend. We work together. I have this intense fear of abandonement and he also has another friend who is a girl. He has always reassured me that I'm his bestest friend and most important person in his life in terms of friends. Yet in office, when I ask him to spend time with me, he is mostly busy. I asked him to opt for a desk next to mine, he said that he is comfortable where he is, which is next to this other girl and really far away from mine. He goes for walks after lunch with this girl and another 2 -3 people. I don't because I'm not comfortable being around that other girl and we are not on talking terms. I asked him if he could go on walk with me few days in a month instead of her, he categorically debited saying that this is not a game and you can't divide things like this. I accepted everything. Last Friday he promised me that if I have him space over the weekend by not contacting him, he v would change and try to make things better by giving me more time in office, including me in his activities and not making me feel secondary to her in actions. I complied but he failed to keep up his promise even in the next 7-8 days. Yday I confronted him in office that what the hell aage you doing. . Making me believe all these false and empty words and driving me crazy. He said that I can't force him to do things with me if he doesn't feel like. I was like why did you promise me then and make me believe all that. I cried and cried and it kind of became a scene in office and he became really angry that this behaviour is the reason he wouldn't want to do anything. I was like that since past 10 days I was doing whatever you were asking and still you were not doing what you had promised and now you are using this as excuse. 

I became so frustrated. I reached home and called him and we again fought. I had a glass bottle in front of me full of alcohol. I took it and smashed it on my forehead. With blood everywhere. He immediately hung up. I was all soaked in blood and alcohol. 8 went to the hospital and got stitches. I came back home and he msged that he can no longer be friends with a mad person like me. He has blocked me everywhere. I am feeling so mistake and o feel why did I survive??? It would have been better to die than go through this pain of losing him. I just have him as a friend. And I can't explain what I'm feeling. "
696,0,"I feel like my personality changes with the music I listen too. obviously music can affect anyone's mood, bpd or not. But listening to greatly different genres of music makes me feel like a different person. going from; Drill rap, to Black/Death metal, to maybe something melodic like juice wrld or lil peep, to Midwestern Emo makes me feel like a different person with each genre. it bleeds into other things such as my use of language, feeling like relapsing, and wanting to immediately dress up a certain way for each genre of music. Idk if this is something with my BPD or if it's something else entirely or if it's just normal. "
697,0,"Me and my partner have been talking for a while about getting him an ESA (Emotional Support Animal) to help with his episodes while I'm away at work. Especially since I wanna move to full time.

Initially, with him being poly, I would have been able to spend more time on myself and at work to make some extra money when he had other partners to spend time with while I'm out. But since I'm his only partner rn, even though he's been looking and I've been helping where I can, people just suck. No one takes the time anymore to understand him and his disorder. He has expressed that he feels like I'm the only one who understands his disorder and the only thing other then me that would support him is a pet.

We've been prepping for months to try a ferret, and he said since it's recommended to have a pair, that he wanted the second ferret to be for me aswell since maybe a fluffy cuddle buddy would help with my GAD and ADHD. But still, they'll mostly be for him, especially to keep him company while I'm out, and it would help me feel better about his wellbeing when alone because otherwise he does horrible alone.

What are your thoughts though? Do any of you have ESA's? Have you ever thought about getting one? Those who are supporting someone they know who has BPD, do you think this is a good step?"
698,1,"I was sacked from my job over a month ago because I tried to submit a sick note. 
I’d made a plan to commit suicide and had to be evaluated by emergency services, which is why I was taking time off.

I hate working, it brings out the worst in me and makes me considerably worse. Therefore, I won’t be looking for a new job. 

The first few weeks were fine; I was catching up on self care and enjoying time to myself. 

Another important thing to mention - around a month ago, I quit 45mg mirtazapine cold turkey due to the side effects. I’d been on it for 8 months.

Now, I’m slipping into a dangerous cycle. 

I have no hobbies, no interests - deep down I do, that excitement and passion is still there. 
I’m very into music, played lots of instruments, love going to concerts. 
I also liked drawing and making art, and I enjoy watching anime/reading manga. Just reading in general.

I haven’t actually done those hobbies for enjoyment in about 7 years. 

Everyday is the same: I walk my/a clients dog, I shower, I sit for 5+ hours doing nothing, refuse to eat, then I go to bed and have to desperately fight not to end it all. 

Evening/night is when I get really bad. It hasn’t always been like that, but this cycle in particular is only a few weeks old. 

Trying to do anything, even just read a page of a book, is like pulling teeth. When I’m done, I feel worse. 

My life revolves around seeing the number on the scale go down every day, distracting myself from my emotions, and trying not to make regrettable decisions every night. 

Even sleeping is hard. I hate sleeping bc of how many nightmares and uncomfortable dreams I have, every night without fail. 

Anyone else in this situation/was in, what do you do? How do you get out of it? TIA"
699,3,"How do I stop withholding affection when I’m upset and/or out of touch with my emotions and a particular person 


I can’t stop. How do I tell someone I love them if I don’t in that moment? You do it but it isn’t the same feeling or vibe and it’s apparent. 


How can I show love in any form if I don’t feel it? Then next thing I know I’m love bombing and then the high of love is down — I no longer want to show love 
You did something or said something off. I don’t love you. 


Why am I like this? I know, lack of dialectics/cognitive distortions but f—k it’s overwhelming for me and I can imagine the receiver

700,1,I had plans to go visit my brother in Florida the first week of July and need to back out because my bpd is at an all time low. I’ve lost fp and my fwb all within 6 months and I’m not present. I was hospitalized in October of last year and again in April of this year because of my suicidal ideation. I don’t have the energy to bathe my self right now let alone preparing for a week long trip. I don’t want to go down there and not able to show up the way I need to both mentally and physically. I want to get better before visiting him but he doesn’t understand because the ticket is already booked. His response to me explaining why I can’t make it was “but you’re coming in two weeks?” As if I will miraculously be better two weeks from now. I just need advice on how to make him get it. I know he’s frustrated that I’m backing out but it’s not because I want to. 
701,1,"The pain of losing a FP is something i’ve had to deal with some many times and i’m tired of this. I NEVER WANT TO FEEL THIS EVER AGAIN, it almost feels like they’re dying in ur arms and u don’t know if they died loving u or hating u. This hurts so fkn bad. I know u all have felt this pain so many times….."
702,2,"I'm 19 and FTM (relevant later), I was diagnosed with BPD last year. 

Last week, I went over to my best friend's and she had over this one guy that I know from a while back. 

I moved to where I currently live about 6 years ago but before that I grew up on the other side of the country, about five hours away. That is where I met this guy. We went to primary school and middle school together but we were never exactly close. 

My best friend and him met through me so when she invited me over at her apartment while he was visiting I was happy to be able to see someone I hadn't seen in so long. I spent the afternoon on a Thursday and I had a lot of fun. It was so nice to catch up and talk about old memories. 

Because he was leaving in a few days, she invited me over again, this time, to spend the night. 

That night, we played a drinking game, nothing crazy, simply drinking every time a movie is cringe. We both ended up pretty drunk but I was absolutely wasted. 

My best friend kept me away from him but I apparently kept trying to kiss him and hug him, which he didn't seem to even take notice of because he was also very drunk. I have no memory of any of this and I wouldn't have known if it wasn't for my friend recording it.

Now, the problem is that since then, I have developed a massive crush on him. We have close to nothing in common, I like some of the music he listens to and we both like watching movie. I know nothing about him, if he has a crush and I'm pretty sure he is straight. (he knows I am trans except when we first met he didn't know because we were very young)

But I can't stop thinking about him and every time I post something I pray he will like it and I dream that he will one day react to anything I have posted so we can have a conversation. I would react to what he posts on his stories but it would come off as desperate and needy.

It is extremely debilitating and I don't know what to do.

TLDR; I met a guy I hadn't met in years, got drunk and was really close to him but it didn't count because we were both too drunk. Now I can't stop thinking about him and I have a debilitating crush on him. Is it just me or is it because I have BPD?

704,1,i’ve been in a relationship for almost 2 years and throughout the relationship i have not been a good person towards my partner. my symptoms keep getting worse and i desperately need help but i don’t even have the energy to get out of bed everyday. im a horrible person and i know i should end the relationship because they deserve to be treated kindly and be loved by someone that’s capable. how do i leave? i don’t know how to leave and i don’t know how to be alone and i don’t know what i would do if it was over. i only want to do what’s good for them and i don’t know if staying in the relationship is the right thing to do. i don’t want it to be over but i don’t want to hurt them anymore.
705,3,"We started talking at the start of the year and he quickly became my fp. We have mutual romantic feelings for eachother however we don't have a established relationship due to long distance.

Even tho he makes me so happy and my life better, my way of loving him it's ruining my life
I'm so attached to him and it feels like he's oxygen to me,it's so unhealthy because in my free time and even on not free time I want to be with him.
For example atm I have nacional exams and I barely studied because I'm always either texting him or on call w him, I only leave my house to to go to the gym (bc its the only thing I like that doesn't include him) and work at the weekends, I don't wanna hangout with my friends bc they cannot compare to him.

Ofc our situation has not been easy I've split on him multiple times, some examples: once or twice was because he told me abt his last relationships and the way he talked abt one got me really triggered, sometimes it's just a certain phrase he says,or when his tone changes.
The last one was bc I asked him to stay on call a bit more w me and he denied and I immediately started spiraling and then got to a point we argued and I told him he doesnt prioritise me and loves me like I do to him,besides so many other hurtful things.

It's so hard for my mind to understand that him loving me in a  healthy way doesnt mean he loves me less or anything like that"
706,1,"Every time I’m (24 F) around my boyfriend (29 m), I feel so small. I’m always saying the wrong thing or doing the wrong thing. We both have BPD, but we are very different.

In the past, I know I wasn’t a good partner, but now I feel like I’m being punished. I wonder if he’s just waiting to get over me so he can leave when it won’t be as painful. I’m his best friend, and he’s far from home.

For a while, I expressed my feelings too much over small things. He said my reactions didn’t match the situations and that I need to learn empathy and pick my battles. I’ve been trying. I try to regulate myself when I’m triggered by going silent. I don’t feel like I’m giving him the silent treatment, but he tells me that I am. When I go quiet, it’s usually because I’m trying to process my emotions or regulate my reactions. I worry that my silence is misinterpreted as me being upset or punishing him, but that’s not my intention at all. I genuinely want to communicate better, but it’s tough to find the right balance. 

Lately, I’ve been trying not to react. Every time I say his name, he responds with “What?” almost like he’s irritated that I’m talking to him. We also don’t have sex and haven’t for a while. We’re both on heavy medication, so I’ve tried to be understanding. However, I’ve felt insecure at times because, during the periods when we were broken up, he hooked up with a couple of people. This makes me feel insecure, especially because they had different body types than mine.

I’ve been working out almost every day, trying to be more attractive.

I feel like it’s just a matter of time. I often ask myself why he is with me because I feel like such an awful partner. He says he loves me and that we both have trauma we need to work on. I try, but I never seem to do it right. If I bring something up, either I’m overreacting or not showing enough grace or empathy.

I say I don’t know how to talk to him, and then I’m told I don’t listen because he’s mentioned many times what he needs. Maybe he did say it, but I’ll ask for a reminder because I guess I wasn’t listening, and I’m sorry. No matter what I do, I feel like I’m doing it wrong.

We’ve even argued about facts in previous discussions, and we usually go with his version because he told me I have distortions. This makes me even more confused, and I start to question what I’m doing and how I’m acting.

Why can’t I seem to remember things the same way? I don’t want to be a gaslighter, but sometimes he’ll bring up something I said that I don’t recall. If I say I didn’t say that, I’m gaslighting him, but if I accept that I said something I don’t think I said, I feel even worse. Even now, writing this, I’m worried I may have misspoken and it should be obvious what I’m doing wrong. He knows more about BPD than I do; I only recognized my symptoms last year, which is why I feel like I deserve this for being such a terrible partner in the past.

Anyway, all this to say: do you think he’s just tolerating me and will dump me when something better comes along? I don’t know how to communicate with him without saying the wrong thing, but he walks on eggshells around me. This makes me more confused because I feel like I hold a lot in out of fear of starting an argument.

I guess I’m also just waiting for him to break up with me. I wish he’d do it already because I don’t know what else I can change. :("
707,1,"I hate myself and I hate my body. I am tired anymore. I don't want to change or get better. I have absolutely no motivation for any self improvement. I am so mentally unwell anymore that I just can't cope. I am constantly getting into arguments with people in my life because i'm on edge 24/7, like there's a blinding spotlight on me, someone always watching, waiting to tell me i'm a fuck up. I was betrayed and hurt pretty badly by my favorite person 7 months ago and everything has just been shit since. I want everyone to admit that they don't care about me and just leave me alone for once. It's what they keep showing me but no one wants to say it. I've been spiraling for months. I'll have a few good days and a whole week or 2 of destruction. Although i do not cut anymore, self harm rituals are at an all time high... punching/bruising, scratching, and my inner critic is surfaced more often than not. I keep finding myself defaulting back to push everyone away and off yourself. 


I want everyone to tell me the truth I've convinced myself of, and it's that no one likes me and the very few people i have don't give a shit and stay for convenience... i really don't see a future for myself anymore.... i'm honestly so lost right now. My favorite person keeps trying so hard to fix their mistake and help me feel better but i cannot be vulnerable with them now..... i'm constantly masking and on high alert around them. I do not communicate with them anymore. They ask me whats wrong and i shut down, then an argument ensues and i'm pushed to the point of blowing up. 

 I've isolated myself away from all of ""my friends""(i always reached out first anyway) and what little family i do have are very manipulative and are not a support system. Honestly, i have 0 support system right now and its been like that for about 2 years. I don't know how much more i can take, honestly. "

We’ve been together for 2+ years and I’m yet to find a way to manage splitting, because he does nothing wrong and it’s taking a toll on both of us. I live in an area where DBT isn’t available so I have basically no idea how to manage with bpd even though I’ve been diagnosed for 3 years now.

When he’s not here I struggle with feelings of jealousy towards other couples, I think I love him but if I only love him when he’s here is it even real? I know I care about him because I’m terrified of hurting him when I’m in this headspace of not knowing what I’m feeling. How do I know? Is there anyway to make the doubts and jealousy go away?"
710,3,"To this day I have problem to deal with phisycal and verbal abuse experienced from my partner. 
I slaped him first, after he repeatidetly yell in to my face that I am worse than my (abusive, controlling, making herself a victim of everything) mother.
In next argument he took advantage of his size (he is like twice of me) and strenght - pinned me to the floor, spitting on me, slapping on face, pulling hair. This was just a start of more than 2 years of he responding to my words, actions (or lack of them) with violence. I threatend him with police, called his mom twice, runs away. But it always ended novere- I come back and just hoping he will just stop, that this punch/kick will be the last one. Afted more than year I had suicide attempt. When I come home after month in hospital, he was careing, warm, helpful. For 3 days, until I had break down, told him hurtful things which he respodned by choking me (becuse I didn't shut up)... I was then in secret contact with girl from the hospital, and one day, when I was home alone, after another beating, I called her in tears. I suggested her that she could call the police ""just to check on me, because she met me after overdose and when I get home, conact was cut off"". To scared him, show him that others care that if I am alive and he should too. And just scared by police officers... But she reported home abuse.
I don't have it in me to describe whole process, but in the end I made him not guilty without trial. By this time I was living in doorms, we were keeping our relationship and contact on secret, met, call etd. After case was closed I moved back home, but his behaviour didn't changed.
Change happened when I tried couple months later move out without telling him until I was making final steps with documents. We were in that moment messeging and he lost it, he took two diffrent **my** medications (that can't be mixed!) and begged me to not finalised. I didn't, I rushed home to help him. I had to help him breathe, beacuse he was panicking and because of mixed meds. But he throw up everything so I didn't called ambulans (he begged to not close him up). After that he didn't put his hands on me for half of year. But eventually break down and hurted me again. After 3 months from return of violence, I run away when he wasn't home. This devastated him deeply, for 8 days he was begging me to come back, appologising, he was in so bad shape that ended in psyhiatric ER (got consult, meds and got back home to our two cats). I got back home after 10 days. This happened year ago. He didn't touched me since that. He went back to yelling, threatening me by throwing me out, sending me to the hospital or jail, calling me the worst names...but without using force.
For the whole time, since 2021 when my break-down point was, he saying that he knows, that he did bad things, said awful things, but he is in the final (in the face of truth, not law) victim. Because I am the mental abuser, I did harm to him years before he responded me.
And what am I should think? How should I function on daily basics when I am constantly listening about how awful monster I am, and what *I made him did*...
And before someone suggest - talks are over, he closed it and now ""I have to deal with it, accept the blame and fulfil to him for harm I did"". And I can't move out/leave/break-up - I don't have financial stability (or emotional), I am dependent form him (and attached).
And we have two cats."

I’ve told her multiple times that it’s a deal breaker for me and she keeps saying she will work on it. It’s mainly so she can be present in our relationship when we have conflict.

I just don’t know what to do. I asked for space, and that I need her to at least try something, as she is starting to become dismissive when we fight when she didn’t used to, so I’m extremely uneasy and asked for 2 days of space because I’m fearful of trusting her. I assured her I’m not leaving, but I need her to get help or work on herself in come capacity. Am I handling this okay?"
712,1,"Since this morning, I’ve had an extremely painful episode of BPD. I just feel pure emptiness and hopeless about myself, I’m struggling to tell anyone because I just feel like I’m a hassle, no one wants to deal with me. I tried going to sleep for an extended time (Which usually helps), but that didn’t help either. I just feel like I’m drowning emotionally. I’m starting to think checking myself in to the psych ward might be the best option for me right now. I’m just afraid of having to pay a hefty bill for an ambulance to pick me up or if there’s other fees. Also, I’m worried if my Mom will freak out and/or if I get kicked out because of this. 

Opinions? I’m really going through it right now 😢 "
713,1,"I am sure I am not the only one who feels it that way , but right now my heart hurts , because I have been through so many things , my mind is dissociated in a type of dissociation of switching language, that I am only available to speak english , even that I can say more things in native language,  just little words then I feel nauseous or vomiting. 
It hurts my heart so much that I am living all these.  
I have adopted a kitten and I think she is my only grounded , and also medicines helps but not as much as I would like to . Because I don't want to feel that physically pain in my heart, like my heart would be broken. I can't describe with words the pain inside my heart.  And medicines helps me with my mood , but how long it would take me to get better . Honestly I feel that the only thing that has kept me alive has been medicines , and now my kitten. 
Life feels so painful. I have been in speaking English already for 2.5 months.  
I have to depends on others, In my country people don't speak English or most of them don't do it . 
It is difficult to find a bilingual therapist.
Also I have been through difficulties during my dissociation , and I am still struggling with some things. 
I wish that life gets better soon for me . 
I honestly feel so much pain in my heart , who I thought was my best friend used her knowledge to make me feel bad , and activated me more. 
And more things in my life that has been happening.
I believe in God and I have prayed many times ( please don't judge my beliefs ) and there have been good days , but bad days feels so so bad that I feel almost I wanted to just sleep and don't wake up . Because I feel that I went back to the beginning of my process . And it is hard to feel that you are failing even that I know I have done progress.  When you fall down feels hard . 
I just come to say here that today is one of those days that my heart hurts so much that it is physically painful . 
And also in my BPD that includes depression and anxiety , i think I have get into a phase of depression . "
714,0,Hey guys I had a few questions about being a favorite person and what it’s like on the other side What makes a fp? how do you know when you are no longer the fp? In situations do you change fp when things a harder with other fps? Do you keep other fp around when you already have one ?
715,3,"I'm out of the clinic for 2 Weeks now and the Therapists there told me, that i will have to deal with my BPD for a long time... i am new in DBT but it works well for me more or less. Phases are getting more intense lately with some pushbacks. 
Finding a DBT Therapist in Germany is a huge challenge and i just moved into a new room with new room mates.

I just wanted to share with all of you wonderful people, that i know how hard it is to stay strong and focused. How far away the good mindstates can seem, when we switch into the darker states.

As someone with intense depression and comorbidity, i am afraid so much to fall back. 

But there is always hope. Stick to your DBT Skill routines. Search for therapy. Please, if you cannot do it for yourself, do it for me! Nobody needs to suffer, we all deserve help. 

"
716,0,"I've recently learned about BPD remission and decided to start doing research on it. I'm curious...I know it's not the same for everyone, but if you are currently working towards remission or are in remission, how does that look for you? 

Are you happier? Less depressed or anxious or angry? Do you still have really hard days or is it mostly good days? Etc etc. I'm wondering if the reason behind my more often happy days recently is part of being closer to remission since doing TMS, DBT and EMDR and finding a supportive partner?

Maybe it's not and my brain is just playing games with me 😆 thoughts?"
717,2,"Recently, I've been getting the silent treatment for the smallest of things, the most recent being that my mom was making arrangements for Father's Day.

Initially it was booked on the Monday and my girlfriend was able to attend, but they ended up changing it a week before to the Sunday where she unfortunately had to work, so she couldn't make it but we agreed I should still go.

So I told my mom the situation that evening before i left to work but I found out the next morning that she had mentioned that she was in fact able to go, just before i left for work the previous evening but by then i had already told my mom that she couldn't attend and I unfortunately just didn't pick it up that she had mentioned it. 

By the way, I do have ADHD and I tend to overlook things like this sometimes and she is very aware of this. 

So when we spoke about it the next morning, after I had initially told my mom she couldn't make it and she mentioned that she could. To me it was like, ""oh, okay, cool, I'll just let my mom know, not a problem there's plenty of time, It's not embarrassing to anybody"" but she immediately got upset and just dropped the silent treatment on me... I tried to ask what upset her so much that I deserved this to which she said ""don't be a dick and go educate yourself about my disorder""

Now, I understand that it's a slight inconvenience but I don't understand why I got such a harsh reaction for something so simple. I understand that folks with BPD need time to process emotions and such, but this, to me, doesn't seem like anything that needs to be processed. It's menial things like this that she keeps giving me these silent treatments for, and I'm so tired of it. It's so alienating. I really don't feel like I deserve to be treated like this and it's almost as if she's using the disorder as an excuse to make sure it's never her and that I'm always the problem in our relationship. It's slowly breaking me... 

are my feelings valid?

"
718,2,"So today in the morning I started to get upset over thoughts that aren’t real. For example my partner met a woman who said she supposedly got pregnant by him 4 years ago and it wasn’t true. She said it was a joke and last year I made him call her to verify that. She said “I thought it would be funny to play that joke” Anywho I started to remember that and imagined them having a baby and I thought  he was hiding that secret from me so I got mad. I wanted to break it off with him. Instead I went to my doctors appointment, went to grab a cupcake to reward myself for getting through the MRI, walked around the mall with my family and got some clothes, solved some packaging issues, and I grabbed some food with my family. I felt like raging on my partner but I remained calm and now I took my medication waiting for my partner to finish bathing so we can watch a movie. It is one of those days my brain plays sick fake scenarios and I have to fight it. It pisses me off and I want to smash things and break up with him. Btw 75mg of Zoloft(doctor makes me cut it since 100 gives me migraines)gives me that high feeling. It’s breezy where I’m at and I’m trying to get thru today without making it a bad day. It sucks that I feel I met mess it up and it’s 7:43pm already. I hope I make it without snapping lol. "
719,0,"This would be my first time taking any mental health medication so it’s a whole new world for me, I got prescribed 20mg of Fluoxetine and 100mg of Lamictal to which I should reach gradually by starting at 25mg. 
There’s been so much on my mind and I wanted to ask if anyone here has had any experience with either of these medications? "
720,1,"My partner of two years ended things via text then blocked me and refuses to explain why or what the next step is, we share the same social circle and live very close to each other. Trying my best to not freak out or show up at there house we’ve already ran into each other 3 times since and they refuse to acknowledge me. Any tips ? I feel so broken "
721,1,"I should have never married. I did not want to and that was a good decision. Yet I changed my decision because of everyone pressuring me. I am so angry right now at everyone and myself. I ruined my life and there is no going back. I am hurting so much and I don’t know how to make it stop.
This world is an awful place. I don’t know if bpd is responsible for it or these things are actually happening but people always take advantage of this."
722,2,"I’m not feeling any symptoms I’m not complaining but I’m just worried? Why is it that I don’t? 

Does the fact that I close my self off to society have a role in this? I don’t leave my house. I don’t interact with people as much as I can. 

I truly feel all my symptoms when I have an FP and haven’t for some years. But even after that, I would still experience some symptoms. 

The only thing I feel is depression. 

It makes me think that I don’t have BPD that I have lied to myself and there’s nothing wrong with me. 

I’m just curious to know why this happens? What to do? How to feel like this always if possible? "
723,3,"This is my alt account that I use only for mental health stuff. I'm active in many subs on my regular account. Someone in a political sub just used something I posted nearly two weeks ago in a snark sub against me AND used my comment completely out of context.

I wish we could make our histories private on Reddit."
724,0,"How soon into talking to someone new do yall mention your bpd? Do you ever mention it? Should it be known before yall even go on a second date? 

When I talk to someone new I want them to know as early as possible so I don’t waste my time but it’s also hard to say out loud because I am kind of embarrassed.

I’d love to hear your thoughts. "
725,3,"I’m not trying to sound like a gifted kid burnout cliché. But I know I’m highly intelligent. I know I have academic potential. I thrive by learning. I’ll get obsessed with some niche topic for no reason and spend hours learning it inside out. But when it comes to something I need to study like an exam tomorrow? My brain and body just shut down.

Like. Literally. My brain’s like “nope.” It’s not even procrastination at this point, it’s pure self sabotage. And I know I’m doing it. That’s the most infuriating part. I know that if I just sat down and studied, I would pass. I’m smart enough. I understand things fast. But I still don’t do it.

Not “lazy,” not “unmotivated” I literally cannot bring myself to do it. My body freezes. I want to do it, but I don’t. And the worst part? I know I could. I’m trapped in this cycle of knowing I’m capable and still doing nothing about it. It’s torture.

The self sabotage part of my BPD is next level. It’s not lazy. It’s not a discipline issue. It’s like I’m allergic to doing things that could actually improve my life. And it’s driving me insane

Sometimes I think… maybe if I hadn’t been this way, I could’ve had a completely different life. I could’ve achieved so much. I could’ve actually become something. And instead, I’ve sabotaged myself so badly that even I don’t recognize who I am anymore.

726,0,"I’m a 40-year-old woman who found so much clarity in a “feelings wheel” made for toddlers. 

I’ve expressed the sentiment of not being able to identify my feelings to a therapist in the past who didn’t really make much of it or work on it with me. 

Is this a BPD thing or just a “me“ thing."
727,2,"Im having surgery in less than 2 weeks (top surgery) in another country. It was my birthday yesterday and for the last few weeks i have felt SO obsessive about things (trying to find a replica of a stuffed animal my boyfriend had to name one) and im finding i want to spend loads of money. 
I have never really had issues with overspending before (little bit here and there but nothing major) and now i feel like its becoming an issue. 
Any advice to help with the spending as well as preperation for a life changing surgery would be great"
728,2,"as the title says, i’m bothered by the recent thoughts of how this might affect my personal life and my relationship to her.

disclaimer: this text might contain nsfw and sh mentions.

we met two summers ago as my plug introduced me to her and our friendgroup. i was then married and was having a long distance relationship for almost three years.
at first, me and her were cautious of eachother. nonetheless, became best friends. we really connect, and both of us had similar past experiences. we both dress similar, we have similar haircuts and we sort of developed a shared wardrobe as we unintentially started buying the same clothes. 
N moved in the same building this spring, one floor above me, and we spend most of the free time together.
i consider her opinion/advice very strongly with anything in my life. most of the time my thought process might be more of a ”what would N think like/act like in a situation like this?”
i kind of started to even dress and act like a person that i think she would adore.
often when i say something (it could be just something very normal and usual) and her reaction seemed annoyed/disgusted, i immideately imagine a “friendship meter” go down and blame myself. i also feel sometimes nervous around her, because of the fear about friendship meter going down. i get jealous when she is spending more time with other people than me.
i can’t imagine my life (atleast right now) if she wouldn’t be in it. or, i can, but it doesn’t seem so nice. 
we have had previous conflicts, especially when she moved in with her “now ex partner” last autumn. back then was our longest period of not talking due to a conflict, which lasted 3 months (it felt like forever). at that period of time i was self harming a lot, and went to therapy and went to psych ward for the first time. 
she was in a toxic relationship and that probably could have affected her behavior and distancing, that’s what she says.
nonetheless, i feel like our bond grew stronger after this, but i still have an inner fear of this situation happening again, where she finds a new love interest and leaves me.
and recently a worry in my mind appeared. i cannot connect with a romantic interest as easily anymore as before. i’ve been single ever since i broke up with my ex husband last summer. i just don’t find anyone as exciting anymore. 
i mean, i still have situationships and sex, but most of them just feel annoying or that they are trying to cross too many boundaries and connect too fast. 
will this ever end? at the same time, i feel so important and great when i am around N that i wouldn’t really want this to end, but i just have this worry that this is not fair to her because i might in some cases feel like she could be acting and doesn’t really care for me, but wants to gain something from me.
i also think this fear could be caused by my first experience with first friend as a kid, where that girl would only play/spend time with me if i gifted her a toy of mine which she chose. but still, i can’t know for sure which one is the truth.
how to tell a relationship like this and love apart? however, i don’t think i feel sexually attracted to her. we once had sex separately on the same bed, but both felt uncomfortable of each other’s presence in that setting.

731,3,"Hi. I've recently been diagnosed with BPD, and I'm trying to learn how to live with it. It's probably been the hardest diagnosis I've had so far.
So I was in this friend group, and we had a band. They helped me through a lot of stuff, and for a whole year they have been the sole reason I'm still alive. The thing is, a few shits happened, and since I'm extremely unstable, they decided to temporarily kick me out of the band, once again because I'm too unstable. Plus, they're going to make their first concert without me.
This band is such a big part of me, and I can't see myself without it. I'm extremely attached to the members in the band. I've recently been in the hospital too. I told them I was okay with it because it's for the better, but the thing is it litterally tears me appart so bad and it hurts.
So I was wondering how I can deal with it ? Im not gonna be here when the band performs, I had other things to do (they didnt tell me they were performing btw) so I can't come to the concert.
How can I survive without the only thing that kept me alive for a year ? Am I in a place where I can blame myself ? Should I punish myself, be angry, sad, whatever ? "
732,2,"I’m really struggling with understanding if this is my BPD talking or a reasonable boundary of mine.

My partner is going to law school soon and originally we had agreed that he would see his family (who lives out of state) for a week during thanksgiving and a week during christmas. Additionally, he would travel to see them once a week every few months.

Now he’s rolling back that agreement. He’ll be seeing them for around a month over the next two months, then a week for Thanksgiving and 3 weeks for Christmas. I really struggle with long time apart so this feels like a lot for me.

When he brought this up, he said he “wouldn’t like me” if I didn’t let him see his friends/family as often as he wanted, and that he didn’t want to not like me. I am feeling a bit manipulated? But I’m not sure if this is just my BPD and needing to learn to be apart or if this is a valid concern.

I don’t want to isolate him from his family, and I’m of course happy for him to go see them. But this is a lot of time apart that I didn’t know was going to happen, especially when he’s in 1L (which I’m sure will put a lot of strain on our relationship). If I say anything about it, or ask for extra time for us, I feel like he’ll just not like me anymore. I’m so confused on how to handle this."
733,1,"Edit: Mod instantly locked my thread so I can't talk to anyone about it. Gee, thanks guys!

Seriously, there are some fucking cruel people lurking around here. I just had a person add me acting all friendly, saying I could talk to them and they were open to having another friend. Acted understanding about me being depressed and insecure about how I looked. Then say they need a picture of me for ""safety reasons"" and when I eventually sent one they started shit talking my appearance and then they blocked me. It's so hard for me to build up the confidence to open up to people and shit like this always happens. Considering killing myself right now, please don't be as gullible as me. They are probably still here."
734,1,"I have a complicated situation where I feel extremely lost and confused. While therapy can help, I was told if I need to break down this goal into attainable steps. ""How do you think you should start loving something that isn't someone else?"" With BPD, I have for years only thought of a favorite person and this undying need to be around others in order to be happy. My past few relationships have made me come to realize that my history of failed relationships came from the fact I don't know the first thing about how to love myself or something that isn't a favorite person.

I need help with figuring out steps that I can take to start liking something that is not a single person. While ideally I should learn my own self worth, I need help breaking this pattern of loving others before anything else. What do I do?"
735,1,I have been working hard in therapy and I have such a healthy stable partner now but I still managed to get them to the “worn out” point (“I’m worn out by having to talk about you being sad” was specifically what they said - we’ve been together two years almost). I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong. I won’t bore y’all with the deets but yeah just curious how you guys navigate that balance of seeking support from those closest to you without burning them out :/
736,2,"Okay, hear me out. I'm 26 and got diagnosed recently. We don't live together yet (me and my partner) so I usually travel twice a week to his house to sleep and spend time with him (and I mean travel! It's a 2:30h train ride) I'm not allowed to have people over in my current living situation so I always come over. Lately it's been HARD. I'm about to have some major life changes and my current job is draining me, so I feel like I'm >way< more ""attention seeking"" than I usually am (which is an effing lot already btw). Everything feels empty right now, so I love coming over, but I also feel like I'm way more ""needy"" sex-wise. I don't feel like the frequency of our sex changed, but I feel like it's way more constant for me now, which used to be the opposite until a while ago. He's really supportive of me and he's been the real one when it comes to dealing with my abandonment issues and all my constant still-learning crisis, so I'm pretty sure it's nothing with him, it's just me who's a bit more relying on sex, maybe, to feel something inside, so when we go out for dinner and we come back home too full to do anything it's frustrating for me. I feel like I want it every day (especially because I'm here only like 3 nights and 2 days a week) but I'm also afraid of bringing it up. We keep talking about it (about how I don't want to ask for it all the time because I don't want him to think that I only see him for sex), but I don't want to ""blame"" my BPD over it, and I also can't masturbate (anymore) with or without him for some reason.
Our communication is great, I swear, and after years of friendship and almost 2 years of relationship I >know< I can ask him things no problem, and he always asks me what he wants, but I don't know how to ask him for more, or even for him to please me (if he's not into sex altogether) I don't wanna ask for that and feel like a burden, you know? But at the same time I feel like him ""not having sex with me 2 to 3 times a day"" is sort of him walking away (which is the BPD talking, I know) and also if I don't ask and he doesn't do what I say I get sad and distant so I can protect myself from future disappointments. I can't sleep due to anxiety because I'm holding this conversation inside of me and it's just such a weird situation to be in, especially knowing that I can fix it if I only talked to him. 
I have therapy soon but haven't had a chance to talk to my therapist about it (not again)

(Yes, I can use vibrators. Yes, we have one but it doesn't feel the same tbh) So I'm not quite sure what to do. Do you guys have high sex drive episodes like this where you just wanna do it way too many times? How do you manage that? And how do you manage if your partner doesn't want it as often as you do?"
737,1,"I’ve been having a bad day today. Lots of crying over real things. My boyfriend has been there for me. At the end of the day, the last stupid thing that happened was that I accidentally dumped an entire bottle of expensive product. I let out a frustrated noise. I could hear the sound of my boyfriend being like “what is it now” and reluctantly walking over, taking his sweet time. I would have rather been completely ignored in this moment than have him judge it “like it was another thing”, and this frustrated me more. I said something immature like “You don’t even care”. He started doing passive aggressive things around the house, and when I confronted him he started cursing at me and screaming at me to apologize…I understand that he has feelings, but why do I not have permission to fall a part a little without severe consequences? Do I have to apologize? I feel like his kindness meant nothing because now i “owe” him something. I think it’s worth mentioning that I’ve never in the 4 years we’ve been dating screamed or cursed at him, but every time I have a bad day, he starts out being super supportive and then in the end I’ve somehow wronged him so badly I need to make amends and he yells at me. "
738,1,This is just to vent. I was already not in the best mood this morning but then I read the end of a text (the preview you can see) of someone I’m kind of attached to and I assumed it was about something negative and I felt way more depressed where I felt physically ill at work and then I finally read the whole text later and it was actually sweet and I got myself worked up over nothing. Being like this is exhausting. 
739,3,"When I became a teenager, I quickly figured out that people would really like me and be friends with me if I copied their interests and personalities. But it didn't just end on copying. So every time I had to introduce myself to a new company of people, I had prepared in advance a completely new personality. It wasn't just about same interests, I would make up my age, my name and parts of my backstory. It was all very believable, so nobody guessed that the person they were talking to wasn't actually the real person. I would make up fake social media and post fake things there. My fake personalities lasted for years and nobody suspected a thing. 
At first I told myself that it would be fine, because I had friends who knew the ""real"" me and I would be able to remember who I really am. But with time those friends would get disappointed in me and leave me or other things would happen. So one day I just became a bunch of masks, none of which even resembled the person that once I was. 
Now that I've grown up and an adult, I feel so tired. I just want to go back and try to rediscover the remainder of the actual me but every time I try to be who I am and stop putting on a show, people don't really like me. And I get that, I'm on the autism spectrum and people like me are difficult to be dealt with. But it's just so exhausting to have people consider you a close friend when in reality they don't actually know you. Most of the times I'm not even sure whether my interests are actually something I like or just a copy of the interests of my so-called friends. 
I just want all of this to stop. "
740,0,"Hey, 

So I wonder if those of you who do have BPD have any podcasts/books/social accounts/ etc... which you feel help you explain your big feelings to others when you're struggling to verbalise or communicate. 

And for those loving/living with a BPD person, how do you facilitate communication, especially on the hard days when they can't tell you how they're feeling? 

Thank you 😊 "
741,2,"i canttttt oh my god i really can’t handle this in a rational way. if you’re taking that long to reply to me then i literally just cannot believe that you value me as a friend. AND IT IS FINE. you have your own communication style bs going on and i genuinely cannot handle it emotionally so we cannot be close anymore and im accepting that. it is not compatible with my wellbeing and i’ve tried but i can’t. you’re a great person and i’ll always be grateful but this shit literally pisses me off to such an insane level and i’m accepting that i am just not emotionally capable of staying close with someone like this. 

it’s not that i need or want to be texting someone all day everyday either, but someone i would consider a close friend is NOT someone who is this unreliable. if you make me feel like im your fan instead of a friend with the way you treat me like a last option then i am no longer putting in any effort to talk to you"
742,2,"Hey all my last x told me this frequently and I'm trying to objectively process what it truly means.


I hear this all the time from other people who have experienced bpd relationships and I've even heard it from previous xes.


So like my last relationship only lasted a month total before crashing and burning horribly.

And they said this to me on multiple occasions. They specifically said it in conjuction with that they wanted an open relationship. Which feels contradictory as we specifically had no boundaries, so there was no reason to see/feel this way?? The thing I'm confused about is I was seeing multiple people when the relationship started and we started as an open relationship with no real boundaries, and they still said this to me.


So like I'm wondering what your guys experience is with this? Because I usually try to be incredibly chill about communication and boundaries in relationships to avoid this feeling, for anyone.


Thoughts on how to avoid this in the future? Obviously with serious relationships I'm a lot more clear on boundaries."
743,1,"I don’t know how to spend time by myself, I end up feeling really lonely, empty and extremely bored. Nothing seems to interest me and all I want is to be with someone else.

No worries, I'll sort it all out, gonna have a less mobile part of the holiday but I'll get my car back and everything will be fine.

I know him well and it was clear that this was not something said during a split, it was something he really meant

This felt so out of nowhere and really hurt me- I'm autistic and I have a lot of abandonment trauma with my friends getting tired of me/my autistic traits getting on their nerves eventually. 

I don't want to just hide the fact that he hurt me because we have to talk more about this. but in the past whenever he's hurt one of his friends he goes into a huge depressive spiral and shuts off/becomes utterly convinced that he's a terrible person. i know he can't control that but i also know for us to continue having a healthy friendship i need to be able to tell him when he hurts my feelings. any advice on how to communicate without triggering a spiral?

746,1,"I don't mean anything criminal by this, I mean drinking, lying, smoking, etc. It genuinely makes me feel alive, when otherwise I feel so empty. I am addicted to the feeling and it makes my life difficult, because I can't settle for ""healthy""."
747,2,"I constantly lose it whenever I go out with people be it family or acquaintances, I just can't control it I don't lash out that much but I'm very passive aggressive and I hate it,

I wish I could do better but no matter how many deep breaths I take It doesn't calm me down"
748,2,"Hey Guys!
I came up to the conclusion that I really enjoy time by myself however when I am alone I tend do overthink and get really anxious and my mood swings can get very dramatic sometimes like S thoughts or big anxiety. Whereas when I am with others I get overstimulated easily, irritated by their routines, or when they talk to me when I am tired (I also have adhd).
Do you also feel it like this? "
749,3,"I'm getting so tired as a hopeless romantic of every single time I feel like I'm finally getting better and I'm being stable in a new situation and am genuinely liked for who I am to then have to eventually cut it off or ruin it for myself by that person turning into an FP. I've been single for 1,5 years and despite that I still end up in the exact same situations I was in when I was in relationships. It's happening again and I'm ruining everything after finally finding someone who wants something serious. We're at a festival together right now, something which in theory should be a great bonding moment and is something I look forward to every year even when I'm there alone, but instead we've been fighting since yesterday cuz he had some bad stuff happen recently and I take every single act of distance or even small things that are fully normal as an act of abandonment no matter how much I get told I'm loved and get shown it. I'm so sick of it, I'm in therapy and 90% of my problems have either fully gone away or are barely noticeable now, but the impulsion, mood swings and obsession comes back no matter how well I think I'm doing. I even split on him earlier which was horrible cuz it was the first time and ge doesn't fully know my issues (or understand them, we're both autistic) and I snapped out of it in the middle of it and it has now ruined my entire night. I came back after a while to calm down and we were fine with each other again despite what I did but then I had to ruin it within a minute because of a harmless question that I immediately took personally. 
I'm getting so tired of it, but I also can't get myself to stop dating until I'm healed or my symptoms are more mild at least. Every single time I get reminded of the advice people give to people with BPD and delete everything and take a few months of a dating break but always come back to it. I don't know what to do anymore and I don't have access to  proper therapy again until fall so I'm fully on my own right now unless you count all of the people I vent to constantly."

btw sorry for my english "
751,1,"I wish I had known about this community earlier so I could understand more about BPD. I’ve been in a relationship for over a year with my girlfriend — I’m female, and she is too. When we first started dating, I knew she had some mental health issues, but I didn’t ask specifically what they were. I felt it was better to wait until she was ready to share with me. Eventually, she did open up and told me that she has been living with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) for over eight years and had gone through therapy.

Our relationship was beautiful in the beginning. I truly believed she was my soulmate, and I felt so lucky to have found her. I love her deeply. But throughout the relationship, there were many arguments, tears, and emotional struggles. Sometimes her emotions became overwhelming, and I didn’t know how to comfort her. Things got so intense that she once slapped me. She apologized and broke up with me afterward, only to get back together later.

I also have some bad habits that upset her. A few times, I crossed boundaries she had clearly set. I try to improve and learn from my mistakes, but sometimes I still repeat them and I feel terrible about it.

Since the beginning of this year, things have changed drastically. She told me I was being too controlling and that I needed more personal space. While those are things that she and I do every day. She stopped replying to my messages regularly, sometimes going days without responding. She limited our meetings to once a week or even less, hid her stories from me on social media, and lied to me several times. She often prioritized meeting her friends even when we had plans. None of her friends knew that we had gotten back together after our last breakup. I was no longer acknowledged as her partner publicly.

She told me that even if I stayed, things would never go back to the way they were. She said she still loves me, but I shouldn’t expect anything from her, she can no longer love me the way she used to because of the pain I’ve caused her.

She admitted that the things she’s done were attempts to avoid the love I was giving her. Since then, I’ve been feeling devastated. My emotions have been low, I cry a lot alone, and I’ve felt lost and broken since the start of this year.

But I don’t blame her. I’ve read enough to understand how much BPD has caused her to suffer and how hard it must be for her emotionally. Still, it hurts deeply. I love her very much, and I don’t know what to do.

Can anyone give me advice? "
752,2,"Hi, so the girl I like 27f (I 28m) I have wanted to started it to be more than friends and she is worried that she isn't going to be good with me as she doesn't want to hurt my feelings or make me hate her even though I am not that type of person. I had wanted to ask as I am not a person to argue or I'd like to think I am a calm person.  as she says she can cause arguments out of anything. If the pwbpd is dating someone like me and they've not really been with someone who is more stable, loving, understanding and caring person can that be a bit different for them at first. As I had assumed if they unfortunately had bad relationships in the past no fault of their own I had just wondered if that may be weird for them and if overtime it would be a good thing to be around someone who does see the amazing person for who they are. Thanks"

754,3,I can’t keep freaking out over going to work. I can’t keep spiraling and having anxiety when people get mad at me or when I’m overwhelmed. I can’t keep doing any of this.

755,1,"So, me and my partner both work at the same place, about five minutes away from our apartment. We work different schedules, so they leave for work at 2:30pm and I get home around 3:30pm. They have an hour break usually around 4 or 5pm, and then I don't see them again until 9am, when I'm taking my hour break. I'm struggling with barely seeing them during the work week and it causes me to start spiraling as soon as they go back to work. I don't know how to distract myself or stay in a positive mindset when I just want my person next to me. I don't necessarily feel abandoned, just really depressed that I'm not going to see them again until tomorrow. Does anybody have advice?? I feel nuts"
756,2,"I (23F) and my boyfriend (24M) are very much in love. He knows I have BPD and instead of running away he goes out of his way to try to understand and help me.

He always says wonderful things to me, like I am beautiful and smart and he feels lucky to be dating me but for some reason my brain just screams at me that he is lying and will somehow use my trust to hurt me. I also feel really sad because there is some mental block that doesn’t let me say the same things back to him. It is like there is a brick wall in my brain not letting me express my emotions and feelings. 

The other night I was in his arms and visibly upset about it. He asked if it was a trust thing and for the first time I had some type of clarity about it and realized it was a trust thing.

I don’t really know how to let myself trust him so I can talk to him about my feelings, whether they are good or bad or I just want to tell him how special he makes me feel. When I try my face feels weird and I go non verbal, I don’t know how to fix this. "
757,0,"Hey all. I’m a second time attendee of an IOP program (intensive outpatient) for DBT. It’s very time consuming but all in all, I do know that logically- I need to do this. I have a history of sort of “going through the motions” in most programs I’ve been in (inpatient and outpatient,) just for the sake of getting out. But given where I am in life, I know that I have a lot riding on this. 
I’ve paid my expenses out a few months to make sure that I don’t have to stress about work hours *and* my treatment. 
This program is really centered on disordered eating and body image/self image. Most of my turmoil as of the last few years does come from those sorts of issues. 
I want to make sure I get the most out of this, so I don’t get out of the program and regret not taking advantage of it when the opportunity was there. 
What advice would you have for me? "
758,1,"I feel stupid writing this but I have no where else to go.
I've lost most of my acquaintances, I work a job that I dread going to because my coworkers are all friends and isolate me every time we have shifts together on top of trying to get me to quit, and little to no support system currently and it's making my bpd so much worse. On top of the worst introduction to this fuck ass disorder and at this point, I just give up.

I just don't have any more fight in me. I had to *beg* my mom to tell me it would be okay, but because it was clearly insincere it just made everything worse. Now I just fantasize about sitting at the bottom of the lake so I won't feel this overpowering emptiness inside. I'm trying to get back into therapy but I just am suffering from loneliness and being a huge waste of space. I just want to get out of my head because all it does is fight me and I'm defeated. I'm 33 years old with no friends, a shitty family situation, and no real accomplishments in my life. My depression took everything from me and just left a stupid husk that gets overwhelmed at the drop of a hat and I'm angry and sad and disappointed. I don't have the tools or the support to fix myself at this point and I just want to give up, but I can't because I have people and pets that rely on me to keep going. So I'm just stuck. I genuinely feel like I'm in fucking purgatory because it's the same shit every day and nothing gets better and I'm tired of praying and crying and hoping for change to come. I can't do it anymore, I'm so burnt out and I hate myself for it."
759,0,"Just now I decided to stop ghosting my friend and tell him how I feel. I was ghosting him for 7 days.

I haven't gotten a text back yet but I feel a weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I feel lighter."
760,1,"So I guess I’m just seeking advice and conversation from anyone who would like to reply! I always thought I had bpd, my primary care said it was bipolar, now I’m seeing a mental health professional who’s told me it’s most likely bpd as well as pmdd being the biggest things causing me trouble. I feel like the last 15 years of my life has been a search for why I’m screwed up and how to fix it. I have just been searching for a doctor to validate it and help me with recovery which has not been easy. I’ve mostly come across doctors who wanna push me to the side and tell me I’m just depressed or anxious and to basically deal with it. 
I’m on a medication that makes most of my life bearable now! I am building a life with my partner whom I appreciate and love so much. There are extremely hard times usually right before my period where I have extreme ideation and sh urges, as well as crying for hours till my eyes are swollen and I have a migraine. This will happen at work and I have to do my best to conceal it. I hoping my doctor can prescribe me a medication to help these episodes but the only one that had worked was Ativan. Every doctor I’ve seen has refused it, so I’m not very hopeful. It would really be a use 1-3 times a month max type of deal. My boss is kind of a horrible person to be honest and I can’t ever disclose my mental health to her with out fear of gossip or it turning into me being a burden. Despite that I do very good at my job, haven’t called out once. I lost my last job due to it, it was a lot more common and worse back then. If I didn’t have such a bright future and life due to my partner and his family’s support as well as my cat, I probably wouldn’t even be here. I am just praying that I can turn a new leaf someday and this can go into remission and I can function, and even thrive as the person I am meant to be. "

762,1,"I remember free months ago I created a post here about my favourite person being in a relationship and how that made me feel. I was definitely jealous that I was no longer that person's priority and that they wouldn't do same sacrifices as I would do for them, but now that I don't talk with them anymore life been peaceful and boring at the times.

when I was still friends with her my time schedule was remotely around her, texting her during the day and then at the evening, even if it ment not hanging out with my mates from university or trying to get out from the house and enjoy alone time. but when I confronted my ex best friend/ fave person, my life been peaceful. I'm on summer vacation right now and I been trying to do things for myself such as drawing or taking it easy. but I also been reconnecting with a guy I haven't seen in years and that's been nice. 

still there are time that I miss her and I wish we would still talk simply because I was used to it. I wasn't too bored and we'd make jokes together. but then I remember how the last few weeks of our friendship felt like and all of the suddent I don't miss her much. I don't miss the version of her I saw the last time, but the version of her when we first met and became friends."

764,0,"I'm not sure if this is more a med post or a success post, but it feels successful to me :) I just needed to share with some people who might understand the relief I'm experiencing. For some reason it's taken me forever to get to a psychiatrist, and I've been getting my medications through my PCP. However, last week I saw a psychiatrist and she prescribed me a mood stabilizer and oh my god. Lamotrigine is by far the most effective medication I've ever taken. I read a couple of posts from other subreddits (mostly ones about bipolar, which is what it's mainly used for) and although some of the comments made me hesitant I'm so glad that I decided to try it out anyways. She prescribed it for my bipolar, but told me that it is also very effective in patients with BPD, and she was so right.

My doctor gave me the instant-release version and told me that I'd be able to feel the effects within 2-3 days, if not the day I started them. I started feeling the effects after two days, and this is the only time that I've taken a medication and have actually been able to tell that it's helping. It's like for the first time in my life, everything is so... quiet. The fire in my brain feels like it has finally been put out and it's so fucking refreshing. My frustration tolerance has been way higher; things that would normally send me into an hours-long spiral have been annoyances at worst. My mood stays relatively the same all day, I'm much less neurotic/anxious about my loved ones leaving me, the list goes on.

I know I still have plenty of things to work through, but now getting through my issues doesn't seem so daunting. I feel like I can actually handle processing my things without becoming a shell of myself. This medication has finally given me some inner-stability, and it is so *so* nice. "
765,2,"I think my patterns of limerence (involving super intense crushes on emotionally or generally unavailable men) is repetition compulsion. I was bullied a lot in school, although the limerent episodes predate the bullying and often led to the bullying. I was seen as the class sl*t, constantly in intense love with someone. Sometimes more than one person. 

I was also bullied for being ugly and was never “chosen” by my crushes. I think I am repeating these patterns in the hopes of being chosen by someone I admire or is “out of my league”. Although this gives me much needed clarity, I don’t know the way out. 

I will abstain from contacting these people but I would prefer to not feel the urge to contact them at all. I hope it comes with time."

769,1,"My bf (30) and I (24F) have been together for 7 months and it’s been the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in.

Due to some things in my past I was never really sexually informed or knowledgeable. I’ve always been a hole rather than a participant. 

My boyfriend has been getting me to be more sexual and explore kinks and today I finally opened up and he said it was a turn off and said it hurt his ego. 

I won’t get into it but it consisted of me talking to online friends during me doing something and he didn’t like that. Which I understand. Cool. But he just kept going on and on and on about how I hurt his ego and how it turned him off. 

I said I won’t do it and he just kept going on about it. I had apologized already saying I didn’t mean it to come off as insensitive and shit but he literally does that shit with me so I thought it would be fine. 

Now I’m just emotionally detached. I’m to the point where I’m probably shut down again and no longer want to be a participant but rather just a hole again because the one time I finally tell someone about a kink they tell me it turns them off and hurts their ego. "
770,2,"Hi there,

I was diagnosed a couple years ago with C-PTSD and just yesterday was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. This has been a lot for me to process. I just want to find myself and stop being so emotionally charged all of the time (0-100 over the smallest things), worrying so much about if people like me or not, what career I want to have, or constantly feeling like I need more from my life by moving or buying things. It’s too much, I’m too much and I just want to feel quiet and calm for once. 

I know everyone is different and what works for some, might not work for everyone, but what medication seems to help you?

My psychiatrist and I are in the process of trialling a medication focusing on anxiety. It’s called Pregabalin. I’ve only been on it for one day so nothing to really report but I was curious about what others take for BPD.

Thank you 🩷"
771,3,"No matter how much I plan, check or prepare, I always do something wrong. Recently I went on a holiday with my dad. He asked me to plan it. I have experience with planning and although I had bad situation they were more like bad luck than failing on my part. But this time it was a mix of both. The holiday is a complete disaster because I can’t pay ANY attention even when I am trying hard to focus. I blew insane amount of money because of my mistakes on this trip.

First I left my bag with ID, wallet and other valuables on the plane and they couldn’t bring it to me even thought I went right to the lost and found after I passed the outside security. The guy said they will call me IF it is found despite mě knowing for sure where it was. I almost lost my mind. Moments after we decided to leave the airport the jacket I was holding suddenly “disappeared” — I lost another item. 

After we arrived to our first destination, I found out I booked a place in Mainland Portugal instead of Madeira where we were because the town was called the same. I didn’t know there were two towns with the same name in the country and the booking site skipped to that one despite mě typing in Madeira. We were stranded in a small village without access to a bus and I was under so much stress I had to book an emergency accommodation for 600 EUR which was half of our budget for the whole trip (it was for 3 nights, basically the longest stay we were suppsed to have). I didn’t get anything back from the previous reservation I booked by mistake of course. We still had 7 days before flying back. 

The next accommodation I booked had great reviews, said it was an apartment with views of the mountains. Close to a bus stop, we had no car. We arrived to a damp, moldy basement full of mosquitos and other people stayed in those nice apartments I thought I booked, the host never said there’s a basement room as well. You couldn’t tell from the picture it was not a part of the apartments. The smell of mold and humidity was intolerable and it was hard to breathe, we couldn’t open that only window because mosquitos would eat us alive. I texted the host saying I will be rebooking and want a refund for such insane conditions for the price of 80 EUR per night for a friking moldy basement. At least I got a refund (only for one night tho) for that but the booking site is not taking my calls and not answering messages so it will take a while.

Later we finally got some rest ať an okay accommodation, but found out the bus we wanted to take didn’t run because it was public holidays and I had no idea there will not be a single bus serving that day. We ended up paying 50 EUR for a taxi to another place. We are from a country with much lower wages than US so this amount of money is a lot for us. 

We arrived, the room was not cleaned and smelled bad. Another plead to get refund because I literally had to ask the staff for disinfectant, gloves and cloth because it was absolutely filthy. Not even the bed was made and this place had high ratings once again. I asked for refund of the cleaning fee, got ignored. At this point I am completely drained and just want to go home.

My dad speak no English and can’t use a phone so I am left to do everything. I am very poor and now I have no job. I blew so much money and even tho it was my dads money I feel like I want to unalive myself for what I’ve done.

I really tried to do it right, but I can’t. I am such a fuck up. I try so hard to pay attention, to prevent disasters but every time I avoid one thing another completely unexpected thing happens. I am so tired and I want to go home to my man and cry. But it’s not over.

I mistakenly booked a bus ticket from an airport and found out it was for the day before our arrival, so I wanted to rebook but the site asked for 30 EUR cancellation fee which I didn’t know existed as I usually use a different bus company where you can cancel for a full refund up to 15 min before the trip. So another ticket + cancellation fee. My dad promised some money for me organizing this trip and I spent it all + 800 EUR over his budget. All on my fuck ups. This trip was suppsed to be around 1100 EUr, it ended up being over 2k which is financially devastating. We have insurance, but because all of this was my fault, we won’t get anything out of it. 

Another guy punch was when my dad said this is not a destination for swimming because the sea is cold, and I asked him why he picked it, he answered “he was only giving examples”. He suggested we go there and I had no mental energy to research it because I was overwhelmed with work and my anxiety regarding other things.

If it was one mistake, but I fucked up EVERETHING! I recovered my bag in the end, but before that lost my favourite towel when we were rushing for a bus from that awful basement because it only ran once a day and every timetable on the internet said a different time so we felt like we had to be there asap. We’re flying home tomorrow, and I am starting to worry of we’ll get home safely. I am cursed. I am incompetent. How could I do this? Anyone going through something similar? "

I've talked to my therapist and my psych today and my fears/anxieties. Neither of them really gave me anything to feel better, except ""do what you can safely do"" which, great. I am. 

How are others in the community dealing with this constant threat against our families? Checking the facts makes things worse. I am having an IMPOSSIBLE time radically accepting reality right now. Constantly feel like crying. I'm on edge, overbearing with my parents' safety, million emotions and thoughts.

774,2,"I don't really know what I'm seeking by posting here, I don't know if it's advice I want or just somewhere to have this be written and seen by others.
I'm afraid of myself. I'm in a committed relationship with a wonderful person who also struggles with BPD, and somehow, despite all the stigma about BPD, we somehow turned two negatives into a positive with one another. It's the most positive relationship I've been in by far, I love them with every bit of my being, but I worry that it's too much, even for them. I get into my own head when I don't hear from them, that they'll find someone better than me, that I'm just a phase they'll grow out of or a I'm a means to an end. I hate these thoughts. I thought I matured past this point, worked on myself enough to not think these things but I still do, it's this vicious cycle of lack of response, thoughts race, get response, calm back down. We both have lives, have different friend groups we hang out with, and yet that hardly does a thing to make the thoughts stop, it's such a disgusting cycle that I just want to end, I want to feel normal inside so that I'm not constantly swapping between angry and hurt at my own overthinking so that I don't worry or overbear on my partner. I feel disgusting. The racing thoughts alone are enough to prompt ideas of doing something harmful to myself.
 We talk about making more friends together, to have a group we hang out with TOGETHER, and all I can think in the back of my mind is, ""you'll find someone else when we do that. You'll find someone better, and replace me."" And that thinking just rips me apart inside. I just want to be healthy and be their safe place, but I don't even make myself feel safe. As deplorable, selfish and cringe as this is, I don't know if I'll survive if this relationship doesn't.
I can't confide any of this to my partner. These thoughts alone disgust me, and the idea of putting that baggage on them? The idea alone makes me feel physically sick. So I just want to vent and have somewhere to be somewhat understood. If you have any advice, questions, criticism... whatever, feel free to interact. Don't worry about leaving harshness out, please just be completely honest and as brutal as you want.

I had a terrible relationship with my family growing up, partly because my father is an absolute patriarchial misogynist shithead who abused me, my brother and my mother growing up. My mother never came out of the marriage because she was totally financially dependent upon him and also in a stockholm syndrome sort of a Situation. I belong to a part of india where women are married off early and are not encouraged to study so much and basically there job is to take care of the man and birth babies. I ofcourse don't want that. I was the first women in my family to go out of my state and study. Although my father sponsored that. He feels he is entitled of my choices and freedom. For 2 years i lived outside my house completed my postgraduation, took care of my mental heath, took up therapy and it sort of worked, though there were ups and downs but it was manageable. The job market sucks Right now and i couldn't get a decent job so i had to shift back home to my family. And it feels so hard living here. I was sexually, physically, emotionally abused as a child in this home and when i left it it felt like this will be the last time i'll be here. Now that i am here, my father is surveillancing me. I have no fucking privacy. I have to look at my shoulder at all times. And now he's forcing me to marry. Ofcourse it will be arranged like how he wants. And i don't want to. I AM FUCKING 22!!!!
I honestly feel so lost and i am tired. It feels like my entire life i have been fighting and i can't even say that to anyone because people say i just victimise myself, i should think ""positive"" things. I can't talk to anyone for it not being too much for them
 
I need to run away somewhere quiet and peaceful. Somewhere where no one knows me. 

I am scared for myself. 
I don't know what to do
 "
776,2,"This title sounds bizarre, so let me give a brief backstory so you can understand where I'm coming from.

My partner of 2.5 years, who I've been engaged to, ended things in April. She began having an emotional affair with someone beforehand, or so I believe, and continues to see this man in a fwb situation. We still live together and a few weeks ago, we also rekindled things.  So now, she has herself stuck in what is essentially a love triangle, and it's not sustainable. Do I like this situation? No. Is it healthy? No. But that's not what this post is about. 

I believe that she is having a full-blown identity crisis. I've never seen it this bad in her before. She was hypomanic for a while, smoking weed 24/7 and avoiding the house, etc. Now things are calmer, I believe because she doesn't have to ""worry"" about her losing her living situation. She is desperate for autonomy and self-discovery, she is questioning everything about her identity and her life, and seems to genuinely not want to lose me... But also cannot in any way shape or form commit because, as she puts it, ""I'm a different person every day"". She doesn't want to make promises she can't keep but wants every single part of a relationship with me except accountability and monogamy. Again, do I love it? No. But right now we're at a ""best friends with benefits"" limbo that I've made clear is not permanent.

So, here is where I'm at. 

We have a lot of time together this month coming up and have already went on several trips, outings, dates, etc. We have a wedding to go to she says we can ""be a couple"" at, and her birthday is in a few days. This is the most time we've been able to have together in years, so I've decided to show up as grounded, stable, and loving as I can this month... And then offer her a choice at the end. Essentially, choose me or lose me. Choose our life, your healing, stability, and a partner who is prepared to walk with you every step of the way... Or someone you've known for two months, who has already cheated on you, who is not emotionally available, etc. The result is, if she cannot choose me in any way, even if that way is uncertain or scared, I need to protect myself and my boundaries and step back. This may destabilize her living situation. She was extremely, EXTREMELY upset when she saw a dating app notification after we broke up and has expressed that she doesn't want anyone to replace her or for me to be touched by anyone else... And I've respected that because I don't want her to feel the way I feel. It's pathetic, but it's true. 

I don't want this to be the place I'm at, but it is. This is killing me. I feel like I'm being half-chosen and I know that she's struggling, but for my own health I can't sit here and wait. She's my best friend in all the best ways most of the time, but I can't just be her friend and be able to heal. 


So, my question is ... How the hell do I approach this kind of talk? It feels like if I do it in person, she shuts down. If I do it over text, she doesn't respond or says she can't respond. If I write a letter, I won't get anything back. All I'm left with is a phone call, which I've debated as I have a family reunion to drive to, but...then I don't know what to do. What to say. 

I don't want to trigger her, I don't *want* to upset her. I love her, deeply, at her core and I am prepared to love her through everything. I like to think a part of her recognizes that and she has admitted that deep down she knows she's not angry at me. She's told me she still has feelings for me and does still love me so much. I know she's going through it. But I also need to be firm in my boundaries and what I need, and I don't think it's unfair to say: if you want access to me like we're in a relationship and you don't want to lose me, if you've told me there is no competition between me and him, then... I need you to back that up, or I need to let you go. 

Help. "
777,2,"My brother has ADHD, unsure if he has other disorders. I have BPD amongst other things.

He also has extreme anger issues, he's constantly picking up fights with my parents, a couple of times he made them cry because of how self centred he is.

He also has picked up fights with me, it got physical way too many times for me to count, he threw me against a door, he broke a door, he broke my leg, he broke my arm, he has done lots of things at different times.

This time he very explicitly called me the F slur, I am not out to anyone, but it is obvious that I am gay. He threatened me with lots of things, and I knew there were threats but I don't know what he said exactly. The fact that he knew how to sign the F slur, and try to threaten me afterwards because I didn't want him to upset my dad who was literally crying like a child because my brother upset him with whatever he was saying to him.

I got a panic attack, and it isn't the first time I have those because of my brother. I am scared and I am upset, I don't know what to do, and I don't know why my brother is this way. Is anger issues part of having ADHD, or is there something extremely wrong with my brother?"
778,3,"I was diagnosed with BPD at 17, a year and a half ago, and am currently in the rocky phase of a relationship. I don't know what to do. I made a mistake that's now caused him to be cold and distant towards me, and I just feel like shit about it. I didn't cheat on him but it was obviously a very fucked up thing to do on my end, but I took accountability for what I did and tried to fix things but it just isn't working. With the relationship being long-distance, it's just infinitely harder on me to stay stable and not lose my shit. We didn't talk for 26 hours and i stayed up counting each and every one, wondering when he'll text me. I had an episode in the middle of the night and ended up crying while texting him frantically, asking if he still loved me and still wanted to be with me. He dodged the first time i asked if he still loved me, and the second time he answered with ""I do"" only. Whereas the second question, all he responded with was ""I'll think"". I'm losing my mind because of this. I did everything I could possibly do to prove that I actually did change. I fixed my mistakes, I wrote him paragraphs explaining what happened and how guilt-ridden I felt, I made sure to be the first to text and see if he was holding up well after he didn't bother to type out a message for days. I don't know what to do. I just feel suic1dal about all of it. I even tried to break up with him but he called me mentally challenged and said, ""For the love of God don't mention my name to anyone else. You're so mentally challenged and weird it's insane. Don't bring me up when you actually do decide on ending your life (which i hope you do) because i want nothing to do with you anymore. You did this to yourself."" I'm so conflicted on what to do. I don't know if i should take his words to heart or not because every time we've argued in the past, he's said some hurtful stuff which caused me to take it personally but he always ended up apologizing and telling me he loved me, explaining how he said stuff he didn't mean in arguments because he's heated. I don't know if he means those words this time or not. I feel like I'm spiraling. I don't know how to act or what to do. I feel like I'm doubting myself and whether I can change or not. He called me annoying when I tried to call him out for not talking to me, telling me I should stop acting like a victim and that it's annoying."
779,1,"You know what? I hate that I miss you. I hate that I still check my phone like you might actually remember how it felt when we couldn’t go one day without talking.

You act like this shift is nothing, like it’s just life, like I’m supposed to just understand. And maybe I do, maybe I am understanding. But just because I get it doesn’t mean it doesn’t fucking hurt. I’m not a robot. I’m not some placeholder you pick up and put down when it’s convenient.

I told myself I wouldn’t care this much.
And yet, here I am. Caring.
Hating that I care.
Resenting you for making me feel safe enough to open up in the first place.

I wish I could go back and un-feel all of it.
Un-send every message.
Un-hear every voice note.
Un-smile at every stupid little moment you gave me hope.

But I can’t.
So now I’m stuck with this, with missing you, while you… what? Go about your day like I didn’t matter? Like I was just a little internet spark that fizzled out?

God, I wish I didn’t feel so replaceable.
I wish you had to sit in this silence like I do. Refreshing, wondering, spiraling.
I wish you’d say something. Anything.
But most of all?
I wish I didn’t want you to.

I won’t send this.
Because I know how it sounds.
But if you ever wonder what silence does to someone who loved a little too loud.
It sounds like this.

780,0,"Hey yall! I want to know what your career is ! I sell cars, I wonder what other people with bpd do! Let's make something positive out of it. 
It doesnt always have to be negative. But the positives of having it in your work or job you chose to do."
781,0,"Are there good audiobooks focused on managing BPD?

The context is that I’ve tried so much therapy - CBT, DBT, talk therapy, etc - and it doesn’t help. Talk therapy specifically just makes me worse. Not that I’m giving up on therapy, but I need to try something else."
782,1,"I'm fresh out of it, so my perception of it being ""perfect"" of course is going to be wildly skewed for the next month.

It was the classic ""let's both take it slowly because we're both highly aware of the fact that we have BPD and we can both communicate well because we are both emotionally intelligent"" type relationship. And we both were emotionally intelligent and we did communicate well. But regardless, we blindly ignored the ""let's take it slow"" part and we both dove straight into sleepovers, long cuddle sessions, making out, intense sexual intimacy, all while still claiming to be ""just friends who were also exclusive.""

Somehow placing the wrong label on something that was very clearly a romantic relationship made it feel okay, until eventually it wasn't.

They started seeing traits come out about themselves they that were confident they'd healed after spending 3 years not being in a relationship. But they mistook ""healing"" for ""avoiding being triggered.""

I mentioned that this might be one of those things you can only heal by practicing good habits within a healthy relationship, and I told them I'd work with them any way I could to make sure they stay grounded. But no matter what I said, they insisted that they needed to go no contact with me, and it felt like a perfectly healthy dynamic was thrown away because of something we both could control.

This exact pattern has happened in every relationship I've been in, and I'm so tired of it."
783,2,"I am always thinking 24/7, especially about my parents and i get caught in big thought loops about psychoanalysing their whole life and from their childhood to adulthood. 
i try and explain every action to how they treated me as a child and link it to their learnt behaviours from their own shitty childhood and even go back to when i was younger and in times of abuse try and climb inside their minds to know what they were thinking. i do it about my older brother aswell. it’s like i need to know what everyone is thinking all the time to explain their actions thoroughly and it becomes obsessive and it gets triggered in conversations with my mum and then i just dissociate while imagining my parents life and then my mum snaps her fingers to get me out of it. i feel like no one will truly know how often i think or the real me because only i hear just my constant ranting and analysing and just about day to day stuff or friends and it takes over my ability to be present in the moment sometimes and it drives me insane.
does anyone else get this?"
784,1,So another shitty day i was like why not post online to get some compliments and a dopamine boost and a reminder that maybe i am a desirably worthy person and that people find me attractive. I thought wrong LMAO i got almost 0 likes compliments or attention😭 just pity compliments from my friends and the embarrassment the shame that i even did that in the first place triggered me and i deleted everything snd cried myself to sleep for the first time in a good few months. I hate when i attention seek because i feel so ashamed when i NEVER get it. Idk why i'm not ugly or a bad person i guess i just rarely put myself out there and im an introvert but still i've gone my whole life i dont get any external validation from men which is fine bur having this stupid disorder means i want it and i need it to feel like a human being but how the fuck am i STILL craving something i've never even recieved? My whole life Nobodys ever been attracted to me or had a crush on me or seen me as beautiful so idk what that feels like to be pursued and desired everytime i put myself our there i get ignored or straight up rejected like im an ugly bitch well maybe i am since im not recievinf any evidence that im not and i feel embarrassed and inferior to my friends who talk about this guy this and that guy that well idk what the fuck they talk about half the time because no guy would even pour water on me if i got set on fire and i feel like less of a human being for it and i feel so unloveable and im struggling to conceptualise i might have to be alone for the rest of my life simply because nobody wants me like the shame the embarassment the frustration got me triggered so bad i cried so much i had like a mini split on everyone lol 
785,2,My BPD makes me so vulnerable in relationships so i  completely closed myself to dating until i fully learn how to manage and deal with my bpd. Dating feels like walking on a minefield unarmed. Anything could trigger and sent me into a spiral and i could be taken advantage of so easily 
786,2,"Hello , 

To start off , I do not have BPD however my friend does . I didn’t know that I was their FP for most of our friendship up to this point . I’ve gotten used to being this stability for him . As of 5 days ago I’ve apparently stopped being his FP . He’s been distant and relatively unwilling to talk or spend time with me whereas a few days ago I’ve been incredibly used to him constantly wanting my attention . I guess I’m feeling lost ? 

What am I supposed to do now ? Is this upset I’m feeling normal ? I feel like I’ve done something one way or another (either not enough or too much or nothing at all) to cause this , like I’ve done something wrong . Admittedly idk much about BPD . 

I want to support him , but I don’t know how . I’m not used to this empty feeling of him not being around and I miss it , which may be wrong . I’m realising I’ve never NOT been his FP up until this point since like- knowing him . I’m realising I’m not sure how to have a normal (?) friendship with him . 

I’m here , asking people with BPD for their thoughts on this . I’ve asked him (and am waiting a response) but I really don’t know what the difference between a FP and regular (is non-FP a better term?) person’s dynamic with someone with BPD is and what it means for me ; for him . 

Thank you in advance ! "
787,3,"so my (18M) best friend (18F) (1 of 3 i’d say) is my FP. A month or so ago I blew up at her really significantly, and decided to try not to see her like that anymore for the benefit of our relationship.

my jealousy and insecurity is still rly active. thanks to new meds, i can handle being triggered when i’m alone or it’s just the two of us. but yet again today, i ended up crying in a group of 4 people because i felt she was being less friendly to me and got upset she didn’t sit with me. later on i spoke to her about it in a way that was calm (progress for me) but still rly unreasonable and she abruptly left. 

i sent her a message apologising and saying i’ll give her space but idk what to do. we both love each other and i miss how our friendship was before she became my FP. what can i do to start to handle group situations?  i’m tired of leaving and crying and embarrassing myself every time. and i want to save our friendship bc i know i’m the problem and i want so badly to be better but idk how.

it doesn’t help that because of exams we haven’t really been able to hang out.

i don’t think this specific situation is serious enough to end the friendship but i’m terrified bc she would be justified in doing so based on how often this happens. i don’t want to lose her and i know it means no longer viewing her as my FP (i don’t even call her that, i’m just using it so the post makes sense) but how do i do that?

for context i am on zoloft 50mg seroquel 25mg propranolol 10g and as needed. i am in CBT therapy bc i can’t afford anything else rn."
788,1,"She is to tired to deal with my jealousy and insecurity, I understand where she coming from but we made a therapy appt and she said she would stay by my side but she left. A day prior I was telling her how much I love her and want to marry her one day, she agreed. I don’t understand, I think I’m not meant to be in a relationship, she was my everything and now I’m lost. I’m alone.

I have all these feelings but I don’t know how to convey them or explain myself efficiently, it’s like being a prisoner with the keys dangling right outside the bars. No one will ever understand me as I will never truly understand anyone else. I know I’m looking at this from a biased perspective and im probably selfish, but I wish she had the strength to fight. She doesn’t, she’s done, exhausted as she puts it. I don’t blame her and I understand she’s probably better off without me, it just kinda sucks for me you know. Almost four years gone, I was her first real boyfriend, we met each other when we were 13, were each there’s firsts at 14. We split for a while then found our way back to each other, she’s the love of my life. But I think she’s at a point now where she wants to explore her other options, and “live life”. I guess instead of fixing what we have she would rather view me as an unfixable lesson, and maybes she’s right honestly. But I told her I would go to therapy like she wanted me too and I understood I do need it, even if I’m put off by it. 


 She left me right on June 1st and went to Mexico a week later. I asked to see her for a while to clear things up before she left, she told me she would wait for me and that she would always be my girl, but that we need to break up so I can work on myself, I think this is selfish. Because she’s not my girl, she doesn’t want me,  and she’s not going to wait for me, she says it’s so I can work on myself but I feel there’s more reasons then that. Obviously that would hurt to hear but I wish she would just be real and tell me the truth. You say you’re going to wait for me, within like 2 days of that convo she deleted my name out her gram bio, unarchived posts, following goin up, then her snap score going up when we both deleted snap years ago. I kno I shouldn’t be checking but I wouldn’t if she didn’t tell me all this shit, being selfish holding onto the attachment leading me on when she doesn’t want me anymore. 

And I tell myself I won’t check her pages no more but I kno I will, I just got to leave her alone, I got to learn to be alone, I don’t another and I don’t like causal sex, I won’t be with anyone else. But I don’t think I can be with her even if she did come back. My heart will always belong to her, but I can’t help but feel a little jaded at the whole situation. She was my last line of trust as slim as it was, now it’s gone.  I wish she believed in me.

790,1,"my dad was really upsetting me and gaslighting me over a situation that had happened, and him basically telling me that i’m “paranoid” when i know some guys made fun of me. his reasoning was “i was there, so i would’ve heard” but he was wearing headphones and is 64 years old and pretty much going deaf. him denying everything i was saying drove me to the point of feeling like i was losing control. i was getting really really dark thoughts about going to the gun range (we were on holiday and it’s legal there) and doing something, so i basically shouted at him “if we go to the gun range tomorrow, we’re both going to die” and yeah. i then went to bed and just cried wanting to commit s*icide or run off into the desert, and do something stupid. i then felt bad for saying what i said, but at the moment, i was very much considering it. luckily with BPD, these mood swings change quickly back to “normal”, so the next day i was still suicidal, but not too much. i started getting thoughts that he wants me dead, because he was still saying “wanna go to the gun range?” “let’s get up early so we can go to the gun range” LIKE DOES HE WANT ME TO KMS? even after what i said?? i feel like he doesn’t believe me, because i make these kind of threats so often when i’m in a crisis. i started just going silent and decided not to go to the gun range, because if handed the gun, i would’ve hurt myself.

I just don't know what to do, because I did not lose any immediate family member. There was a school shooting in my town yesterday. It's probably easy to figure out which one. This thing does not happen where I live. I used to tutor a lot of kids from that school. It's not my right to know if they were victims but I can't stop thinking about this tragedy. About the families. About the kids. I am glad that I didn't lose anyone but I can't turn my head off. I am checking the news 24/7. I wait for names to see if one of my students died. I keep on thinking about hearing the helicopters at work yesterday. I cannot focus. I just stare off into space and I was not even affected. I got some information about what happened inside the school and it makes me want to straight up kill myself because it's just so inhumane. So many lives were taken and I am so distanced from it but I can't stop thinking about it? It's so horribly selfish of me to even think about it or feel pain but this world is so horrible. I hope that one day the families will heal but it all happened so close to me and I can't cope at all. I don't want to contact my therapist over this because the families and kids are more deserving of help and I should not feel anything about it, but I can't stop thinking about it.

796,3,"All names are fake.

My friend Cora has been dating this guy Liam for roughly nine months. Me and her other friend, Dolly, only found out about the relationship after they’d been dating for a few months, because she didn’t feel comfortable really talking about it. 

Initially, me and Dolly were supportive of Liam, and his and Cora’s relationship, because she said that he made her happy and that is all we want for her, but very quickly, red flags started cropping up. 

First off, they’re doing long distance. Liam lives in a different country. This was concerning because Cora has an anxious attachment style (me and Dolly are people she’s said she’s not worried about leaving, because we’ve been here for her during past self-isolating episodes [if that’s the wrong term I apologize, please feel free to correct me] and such), and she can be really insecure in relationships, platonic or otherwise. 

She also became a lot more distant since they started dating. We later found out this was because he’d been cheated on and “set boundaries” about her friendships and stuff like that, i.e she couldn’t have male friends, he made her cut out a bunch of people in her life, was weird about what she wore and who saw her in certain outfits etc etc, that all just kind of made Dolly and me skeptical about how good this relationship actually was for her. He said it was weird for her mom to see her in revealing clothes, ffs. 

Anyway, this kind of all came to a head during a visit we had sometime last year where she broke down because we’d taken joking pictures where we pretended to kiss each other (hugging each other with kiss-faces aimed at cheeks and such) and she accidentally sent him pictures and he freaked out and she literally could not do anything but cry for the rest of the night and was really anxious about it into the next day. 

Me and Dolly have tried to get her to understand that she’s become unhealthily attached to this guy, but she’s not hearing it. And now, Liam found this other girl he’s been hanging out with and it’s set her on a downward spiral health-wise (physical and mental), and I think he realized how bad this was getting because he tried to break up with her but she’s kind of refused it and convinced him to reconsider. 

No matter what we say, it’s not getting through to her, and she’s completely unwilling to let Liam go despite the fact that she knows and has agreed with me and Dolly that this isn’t a healthy relationship. 

I still love her, and I want to be there for her through whatever happens, but I’m trying not to push her away by being to straightforward or stubborn about how I feel about what is ultimately _her_ relationship. It just makes me sick to see her health decline over a boy, and the fact that by not pushing harder to get her to leave him, it feels like I’m condoning it. 

Idk. I don’t know what to do other than be there for her, and offer my sympathies where I can, but it’s hard knowing she’d be so much better off if they broke up and she gave herself the time to heal and work herself up after. 

Idk. Sorry this is so long 🫠

Also, if there’s anyone who can give advice on coping mechanisms for anxious attachment, I’d greatly appreciate them."
797,3,"My husband (60) of 30 years is literally wearing me down. I think his BPD episodes are getting worse and lasting longer. Recently, I (52) calmly mentioned to him I was concerned about his alcohol consumption. He has a Hx of substance abuse and his ENTIRE family are all either former alcoholics or died from their alcoholism.  And, just for further clarification, a week ago he told me he realized he was drinking too much and intended to quit.

Fast forward one week and he’s working in the yard and I can tell he’s drunk. I asked him and he denied having more than a couple. I said it’s pretty obvious he isn’t being honest with himself. That turns into the “you hate me! Why can’t you just love me for who I am? Am I not doing enough?” I can tell he’s about to flip, so I try to walk away quietly and that sends him into full blown “why are you abandoning me?!?!” All I want to do is get the hell away so I feel more comfortable and so I can comfort our daughter (20) who is Autistic and intellectually disabled. Our daughter is witnessing this and screaming “Daddy stop!” He literally can’t stop. That was Sunday. This morning, before marriage counseling (which he initiated) he starts getting heated, again and screaming. Calls me a bitch so I leave the house. Now he’s texting telling me he’s sorry and he’s having a breakdown. The ONLY reason I return home is to make sure my daughter is safe. She’s safe but she is trying to comfort him which makes me so angry. Anyway, relay this to the therapist and allow him to use his over the top adjectives about how I berate him and demean him. Therapist suggested he quit drinking for 30 days and use those 30 days to allow me to walk away when I feel like I need to. Husband is butt hurt by these suggestions! The last request he made as we were leaving the office was, “please don’t be mad at me.”

JFC!  A someone here explain why I’m never allowed to be mad at him? If I am, he’s in a puddle of rage and tears “begging “ me to not be mad. I have pleaded with him to sit with an emotion and let it pass but he can’t. He doesn’t believe I can love him and be mad at the same time.

This has gotten so bad he’s run off our 19 year old son. Our son is living in a different state with my parents and refuses contact with either of us. Can’t say I really blame him!"

From my perspective, it seems like we fight a LOT, but it's really only a big blowup every few days. I don't punch myself after the fights anymore (out of spite, to prove him wrong) but I still walk around with this pit in my stomach. It doesn't help that our opposing schedules means we barely see each other- and when we do, we fight. We almost never have sex, mainly due to my non-existent libido post-cancer treatment. Also I'm not attracted to a man who acts like a child fighting with his sibling. We've been together almost a decade so I really need to figure out what's going on here. He's so fucking sassy for no good reason, and I'm much more fragile than I let on. His family tends to ""fight dirty"" so his attacks on me are such obvious logical fallacies. It's infuriatingly frustrating. So what do I do? I work to accept and work with his neurodivergence and history, why can't he do the same for me?

Also, he's a psychotherapist. I really don't understand why he doesn't treat me with compassion and context like he does with his patients. He told me he speaks to his patients like this as well, but I have a feeling he's bluffing. I feel like my brain is melting and I'm going insane. But I can't tell if the issue is me or him. "
799,0,"being put on a mood stabilizer with my antidepressant is life changing tight now. it's only been a couple days and im already seeing a difference in my mood. i'm not having as many swings and besides the side effect i had yesterday (emotional lability), my depressive symptoms aren't as bad. i seem more alive. 

bpd is already a little easier for me to deal with when I dont have an fp/in a relationship, so it makes me wonder what would happen if I did attach to another person. would i continue to see an improvement in symptoms due to the meds? I'm sure my symptoms would still flare, but would it be easier to cope with? i'm questioning so much right now. "
800,1," I’ve noticed that i am very clingy and needy. even when someone needs me more than i need them, it’s almost like i can’t do that, that’s how it feels. 

 i’ve been told that i give all of myself to people and it’s hard to see what others see in me and hard to understand what they see in me. my ex is going through a tremendously hard time in life right now and he treated me like shit and i tried really hard to stay soft and gentle with him because i truly loved him and i still do, but i said nasty things to him when i realized he wasn’t who he was saying he was. 

 my brain is trying to understand if he is actually like that, or if because of this difficult time, he is doing introspective work on himself and he’s changing and this relationship helped him catapult him into something for the better rather than for the worse. i want him to be happy and i hear the things i say to myself. i don’t eat, i force myself to not eat and overwork myself in hopes that i will be ok. it’s so backwards. i miss him, but even with what’s going on with his life, i feel like i couldn’t be there for him and i tried and last time i got my heart broke i was different. 

 i was discarded and my last bf promised he wouldn’t leave and he left and i can deal with him lying to me, but can he just tell me he lied? why do i have to catch him? i don’t fish and i don’t hunt. i’m not built like this. i’m very shy and reserved until comfortable and even then, i can’t let people in like that and if i do and they ghost me i literally will never forget. 

 people aren’t loyal and that hurts me so bad because i am and i know i am. i’m a loyal family member, friend, girlfriend, employee.. like idk the list goes on and im filled with love, but so much anger and idk if anger means hate because i feel so guilty whenever i get angry because it feels like hate and id rather be lovely than hateful, even tho i know im a hater, i have a big heart. i need friends lol "
801,2,"This became a problem because I genuinely caught onto my extreme splits. It only takes one thing to tick me off now. I am afraid of losing my partner but I have conflicting feelings that I am not sure are real or caused by my numbness/anger splits, I recently experienced a manic episode that immediately affected me. It made me realize I can/am in love them, I can let them love me. But ever since the manic episode left me it's given me clarity and I desire that manic episode again, so I was focusing on the fact I felt no pain, was so comfortable, in the moment. Everything was amazing, I feel deep Down I love him but my split self seems to hate them. What do I do? "
802,3,"I was talking to my psychiatrist today about how I felt like, with the BPD, came a book of pure reason/morality. I told him how I felt so guilty at first because yeah it was in my brain, but it wasn’t ME, and I was constantly going against it with my impulsivity and bad habits. I’ve been talking to him for about 3-4 years now and when I put it like that it finally clicked. When he read off the OCPD symptoms my jaw was on the floor. I’ve told people in my life so many times how I value logic, reason, and morality so much it’s damn near unhealthy. How yes, the BPD diagnosis makes sense, but I was still missing a puzzle piece. This is it. I finally found it, and it’s another chronic personality disorder. One that is the complete opposite of the other. Can’t even explain the disappointment I felt when I read “cannot be cured” for the second time. I’ve been getting better, and I’m glad I know now, but man am I so tired. Im not really sure where to go with this because yes I have BPD, but I don’t necessarily relate to all of the BPD stuff, and it’s a little different. Can anyone else here relate ?"
803,2,"The title basically says it all. I use this account mainly for this subreddit, and some of the venting posts I've put out are not something I want anyone in my real life to read. I don't feel as though I've done anything *wrong* but I don't like the idea of the people I care about reading my venting posts because I know some of the things I put there are mean/scary/etc. I tell everyone who's close to me, who knows I have a reddit account, to stay off of it because this is my safe place to go when I just need to get things out. (I should probably get a journal, but idk the community support is nice when I'm spiraling).

A few days (maybe two weeks?) ago I was having a pretty bad splitting episode, and was texting my partner during it. Apparently they got worried, and went looking for my account to see if I had posted anything because I was saying things that scared worried them. I think they thought maybe I'd have posted something here, and maybe thought it would help them understand my mind set better? In any case, I guess they didn't find anything, and that night I did just end up going to bed and sleeping it off.

I saw them in person yesterday, and this is when they told me (in a light-hearted way) that they checked my account during my last splitting episode because they were worried. I was immediately mortified. I will say that this moment was a personal win because I didn't get angry with them!! Instead, I just excused myself to the bathroom to cool down, and when I came back I calmly told them that I was upset that they had done that, and that if they wanted to talk about anything they had seen we could. They told me they didn't see anything that would change their feelings about me, and we wanted to leave it at that.

The thing is, I can't shake the ""violated"" feeling this has given me. I know for a fact I told them to not look at this account, and it's quite upsetting that they did, even if it was with good intentions. My ex did this before as well, always saying it was because he wanted to make sure I was safe, but it always just felt like snooping to me. I have horrible trust issues, and this has just made the little bit of trust I did have in them vanish. I know that might sound silly, but really that's all it takes for me to feel as though I can't trust someone with my secrets anymore. I also know that they saw at least a couple venting posts that are about them/our relationship, and I am so incredibly worried that they are just waiting for the right time to leave me over them. They have apologized for looking and promised never to do it again, but I don't know how I can trust that anymore. I know this probably seems benign to some issues people have going on, but does anyone have any advice on this?

ETA: I'm not sure where people are getting confused, but I'm not asking for advice on how to deal with the publicity of my reddit account. I am well aware that anyone can see what I post here, I don't care if strangers on the internet know I have BPD. I'm upset because I set a clear boundary (don't look at my reddit account) and my partner crossed that, whether it was in good faith or not. I'm asking for advice on how to deal with the betrayal feelings, because I don't want to have this be an issue I experience for weeks/months. Your opinions on how I use my reddit account aren't helpful. /nm"
804,1,"When I was younger and my symptoms were a lot more severe I'd always get way too attached/paranoid/clingy and it would push everyone away.

Since then I've done a lot of work on myself, I thought I'd gotten a lot better. Finding validation from within instead of searching for other people to fill that need. I thought I was finally feeling like a normal functioning person

I was recently seeing someone casually, and they ended it over text on a random Tuesday. They said that it felt too intense too quickly, and that if things carried on I'd just be more affectionate so better to end things now.

This really blindsided me. We communicated (I thought) quite well. I said I'd need aftercare after we sleep together. They said they were a very physically affectione person. Wanted to cuddle for longer after, in the morning, do stuff in the day. I thought doing that stuff would be okay because they were the one who suggested it. I thought I was doing everything right. I didn't reply right away, I'd give it a few hours, sometimes even open the messages and not reply for a while. I didn't instigate much cuddling apart from imminently after sex. They wanted to get to know me and learn about each other/each other's lives. I opened up a bit but tried to keep my messages mostly sex related. We did check in because I got the vibe they wanted more and I said I might be open to it in the future but for now I want to go over at night, hook up, leave in the morning. They kept suggesting having me over on weekends and spending time together in the morning/being affectionate in the morning. Again I agreed and thought that was okay because they were the one that suggested it.

I really thought I was doing everything right and was being healthy. But hearing that they thought there was too much affection, and things felt too intense has made me doubt myself in everything. I thought I'd have gotten better. They didn't even tell me they were upset with me. I thought if their wants/needs changed we'd talk about it. But no, text on a random Tuesday. 

I don't know where I went wrong and what I can do to stop this from happening. Most people I see/speak to I'm the one either ghosting or ending things. The only time it's the other persona that does that say it's for the exact same reason, every time

How tf can I break this cycle and stop this from happening again?"
805,0,"The general consensus from the “experts” is that most individuals with BPD have an early history of poor bonding, abuse, childhood trauma, parental distance, or something that led to the personality challenges.  In contrast, I’ve heard from many with BPD that they came from healthy, supportive homes and that it’s more complex than what the “experts” claim.  Some feel the “experts” are trying to wrap it up with a tidy bow by suggesting it’s always trauma. Interested in exploring what others here feel is true for them. Interested in hearing from parents as well. "
806,2,"Hi guys! So I did it again, met someone new and became obsessed with them... It's so overwhelming! I'm struggling hard to not bombard them with messages, have intrusive thoughts, my daily activities are affected. Thriving attention. Feels awful and exciting at the same time... And I don't want to mess things up, despite my fixation, I believe we could be nice friends. Fighting hard to not hope for more.

There's no point in breaking off the relationship, as I KNOW someone else will take their place quickly.

Anyways, I manage. Try to focus on myself, distance myself and so on, but it hurts physically so much, that I needed to vent here a little :(

If any of you is also struggling right now, feel free to share! "
807,3,"Me and my bf are coming up on our one year anniversary next month and we've been having a lot of random arguments and hurt feelings over very small things. We would spend almost every day together and talk every free chance we can get and text all day and love each other's company, he was my best friend and I was his. Except this last month...his has been really bad. This has been a bit of a slow build up and we've been trying to address it and find solutions to why we keep getting our feelings hurt by eachother and not having fun anymore and just getting mentally and emotionally burnt out from eachother. The sex has stopped, the flirting has stopped, and its just been (bad) tension and constant hurt feelings. My bf says he needs a break and to have space to himself for a week or so to decompress. Normally this would really hurt me but honestly at this point I agree. Is relationship burnout normal? Or is this really bad"
808,1,"hi guys, i am diagnosed bpd and i am honestly not sure what is going on with me but i just need to vent i think. im freaking out lately because i am seeing something completely different in the mirror now. for the past few years i have been obsessively taking pictures of myself to see how im being perceived at all angles, i have been constantly looking at myself to make sure nothing is wrong, and i have genuinely hated every part of myself more than anything. within the last few months it has literally consumed me and my appearance and self image is all i can think about at all times. and the pictures/looking at myself are so much worse. i hate looking at myself, every time i do look i am so upset and disappointed. well recently i realized i can invert all my pictures, and i heard thats how other people see you so i have been doing that ever since. and i am seeing so many new flaws and such and now my face looks completely different to me. i do not see anything even close to what i usually see in the mirror. my face is more narrow, lopsided, my eye droops a little bit, etc. i have never noticed these things before. and yes, i am just used to my point of view and maybe other people do see me in the same way i see myself usually. but doesn't that mean thats what i could look like to somebody? what if that is what i look like to everyone? but the worst part is, every picture i look different. sometimes i look like a different person, sometimes i look normal, sometimes im in between. im so confused, and this only makes my feelings towards myself even worse. because honestly, if i really do look like the pictures im seeing, i think i am even uglier than i originally thought. and there is really nothing i could do about it but accept it."
809,2,"I have an offer to study a teaching degree (grades 1-10). I really want to get out of admin. I am bored out of my mind at work. I want a role that is active, creative, requires problem solving (stimulating) and where I can be myself - I’m a bit of a nerd/hyperactive dork. I like a little chaos in my day, but not to the point of overwhelm. I’ve been told I’m good with kids and I genuinely do like interacting with them. 

I have recently found out that I have BPD, and I’m a little nervous about it. Are there any teachers here that have found a way to manage their condition in this role? "
810,3,"20f here. over the past year i've developed the habit of hooking up with my male friends (i say friends because i can't have sex with someone who i don't know; so far it has been men that i initially consider good friends). once we hookup, i catch feelings, become obsessed with them and want to do it on a regular basis between us only. all of the men i've decided to do this with have eventually done it with another girl and every single time i find this out, the same feeling comes back. I get this really intense icky feeling within my whole body, i lash out on them for wanting to get with someone else, i can't help but to picture the pleasure that they got from a body that wasn't mine, and i feel EXTREMELY gross and ugly (i can't look at myself in the mirror sometimes), i want to rip the skin off of my body and melt away- it's debilitating yet i find myself in the same spot regardless of how much it hurts. I want to be the only one they're thinking of sexually. it ruins my male friendships because not only do i want to sleep with them but when i do(because so far this has been the case) i want them to be fully immersed in me sexually. the thought of another woman being in my spot makes me physically sick. does anyone else experience this icky feeling? if so, what do you do to calm yourself down? i hate that i put myself in these positions but it's addicting."
811,0,"So I’ve noticed some recent discussion and etiological theories on BPD being a biogenetic/neurodevelopmental disorder, and while I’m yet to dissect it, I can’t help but be a bit concerned about where this is going. We have decades of research evidencing a clear and indisputable traumatogenic component with the vast majority of patients with borderline personality disorder having a history of early relational/complex/cumulative trauma, neglect, and unresolved attachment. I don’t think it’s irrational to be skeptical of those who claim that the role of trauma in personality development and psychopathology is insignificant. We know that it is.

In a recently published article which I won’t reference, it’s clear that the authors have a very limited understanding of the pathology and no clinical experience with psychiatric patient populations. Despite a plethora of research and heavy literature spanning decades, it befuddles me that someone in their position could be so abysmally informed. The authors allude to trauma being self-generated through impulsivity and risk-taking, with no acknowledgment of the significance of early life trauma and high rates of *revictimization* in the life course of people with BPD [(https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260520986270)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260520986270). It’s unclear what they mean by trauma, whether traumatic events or post-traumatic stress disorder, but it comes across as quietly repackaged victim-blaming.

There seems to be a lot of confusion and lack of consensus around the core psychopathology, with some regarding it as affective instability/emotional lability, signifying a mood disorder of biogenetic origin, with others (the significant majority) asserting the role of distorted schemata and maladaptive self and interpersonal functioning, signifying a complex relational disorder with dissociative phenomena and a relatively unexplored relationship with dissociative disorders. This obviously hinders any meaningful progress in research.

Anyway, I just wanted to put that out there. Let me know what you guys think because it’d be good to hear your perspectives and help us work towards a more solid collective understanding of BPD."
812,2,"Sorry if this has been asked before, but I checked the sub’s search and didn’t see anything that quite matched within the past several months, even years.

I’m not talking about struggling to remember someone’s name or where you put your keys — though I do that as well, and it’s a bit worrying. What really scares me are experiences that are just totally gone from my mind. I don’t remember most of college, or huge swaths of my childhood. My boyfriend was reminding me about a plot twist in a game we played together a few months ago and I had absolutely zero memory of it; it’s like I wasn’t there.

I joke that you can tell me stories over and over because they’ll always be brand new to me, but it’s honestly starting to scare me. I have autism as well, but that’s typically characterized as having a great memory. But nothing sticks in my mind anymore; I feel so adrift all the time, without even the things I’ve experienced to lean on.

Does anyone else feel like this? Do you know why? 

ETA: thank you all so much for the responses! I don’t have the energy to reply to everyone, but I’m reading and appreciating all your comments! "
813,1,"hi, title post is pretty self explanatory. i just can’t figure out how i feel about things sometimes, or my opinion on things. there are some obvious matters where i have pretty solid opinions, mostly about matters of what’s right, what’s wrong, where i stand morally, politically, etc. but when it comes to other matters, sometimes my brain gets so cloudy that i can’t form a concrete feeling or opinion about it. for example, i saw a post online saying “if you can relate to these statements, blah blah” and i read the whole post and i genuinely couldn’t figure out how i felt about the statements, if i related or not, or how i felt about them. and there are other times where i feel less cloudy where i’m sure i could. but today i just couldn’t. i just have a lot of trouble with hypotheticals in general lately. whenever i create a hypothetical scenario to help me figure something out (my sexuality, how i would handle emotional events, etc) i can’t figure it out. i just can’t. like my emotions and sense of self are so deregulated that i can’t figure out what i would do/how i would respond in a hypothetical situation. and it’s making it REALLY hard to figure things out, i WANT to, but i CAN’T. and i don’t always feel this way, but right now my mind just feels very cloudy. does anyone else with BPD feel this way or is it just me?"
814,1,"Two weeks ago my sister finally ended up taking her life after 4 attempts in the last 2 years.  She has been on a rollercoaster her whole life and things were especially bad towards the end to the point I was checking on her before work every morning to make sure she was alive.  It took a huge physical and emotional toll on me and my family.  I am trying to find solace in her having the peace she has been longing for, but I miss her so much.  I pray her children grow up strong and know how much their mom loved them."
815,1,😐i buy things to get a quick dopamine hit and then once they come im no longer interested and feel nothing but regret😭😭😭😭😭its always something absolutely useless too idk i was just wondering if anyone also copes this way 
816,3,Anyone have experience with having BPD AND PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder)? I find that before my period my BPD symptoms are extremely worsened by the pre-menstrual stuff. BPD is enough already to handle and having PMDD going along with it makes things even worse. Any advice on how to cope/deal with both of them together?
817,2,"I feel like I am going crazy. I am really trying my best to help myself. I have full control one moment, then I blink and all of my progress is ruined. I keep seeing the quote ""the only way out is through,"" but I'm not sure how much longer I can persevere. Has anyone actually found their way out? It could be in regards to anything (drug abuse, eating habbits, toxic relationships, self destruction, ect,.)!"
818,0,"i won't give too many details, but my boyfriend (and fp) of 3 years and i are on a break. he said he doesn't want to be gone forever and that he does believe we can be healthy together again, but he doesn't know when he'll be back. from the info ive seen so far and from the way im recovering, i think itll be safe to message him on his birthday (in less than two days). i already have what i wanted to say written down, i made sure its nothing too heavy, just wishing him hbd and that im thinking of him, and its been reviewed multiple times by many different people (therapist friend, other friend, my actual therapist, lol).
anyway, the point is, i think that this whole situation really opened my eyes. he was the only thing i had in my life. everything i knew was connected to him. i was completely dependent on him. and the break put that thought in me: ""you already know that if he leaves you have nothing. this is your sign that it's a very real possibility. you have to learn to live without him. DO SOMETHING.""
ever since then, i've been putting myself out there more, discovering more about myself, making important steps to my independence, self improvement, etc. i just hope all goes well when i send the message. im using my cope ahead dbt skills, dont worry lol. "

And feel like a horrible, mean person, that people will hate me etc. "
820,1,"I am almost 30 and my mom still tells me how I should just change my ways after I was diagnosed with BPD a few years ago. She tells me ''just think positive'', ''just change'', ''it's all up to you''. As if I am suffering on purpose. Even tells me ''your therapist sent you to a psychiatrist because she saw you don't want to change''. How not to get into full BPD rage over this? Please tell me."
821,1,"How do you do it? I (23F) have been doing well for so long and suddenly it just hit me. This overwhelming sadness and just like, not caring. Everything was just too much. I sobbed for days, was an emotional wreck, quit my job, and now it's a week later, i'm still empty and just stressed about bills. 

I feel so stupid. My job was 20 minutes away and I made good money, now I have to drive an hour for less money and I'm still depressed and see no point in it. 

And I feel so terrible for my (22F) girlfriend. She's been so patient and supportive but I just feel like i'm too much for her and she shouldn't have to deal with me. 

Idk. Everything is just too much and I have no idea what to do. I was doing good for so long, stable serving job, an apartment, a girlfriend, some savings and now I completely fucked myself.

Any advice? Anyone else quit their job and just had to deal with a worse one? How do you handle it?

I'm trying to be productive, making a plan to go to trade school so I can leave the serving industry cause that's burning me out and going to interviews in the meantime to pay the bills but it all seems useless. And im trying so hard to not overwhelm my poor gf with everything and make her pull away especially since she's my fp. I am just so lost and feel like it's not worth it and nothing even triggered the episode i just couldn't do it anymore. "
822,3,"For context, this exact split has happened about two full years ago, I was a little less in tune with her BPD, there were situations I could have handled better, but this time around, im nowhere near perfect, but I understand her more than I did before, and she’s trying to better herself, even tried therapy, she said she was told that she may be undergoing remission! But anyway, I’ll state specifically what caused the split, we’ve been growing alot since that last split, it made us stop talking for half of a year, it was depressing, but it made us look inward. We were a bit of an obsessive, toxic dynamic, some things had to change, especially my lack of my own voice and individuality, as she was completely vulnerable and I wasn’t.

Another detail is that we are slightly long distance, about 3 Cities away. I state this because we’ve been starting to actually see each other for a year and a half, and trying to figure out how I will see her often while keeping my finances in check, it was subject to a lot of change, change has been an awful thing for her, especially when not subtle, and this whole year has been a lot of that. But the biggest one right now is me going to school online with three classes, working full time and trying to incorporate things like working out, so the less time has been really upsetting for her, she says that she can’t handle it. And im incorporating more workload because I thought it would be for the best. Recently, she’s been talking a lot of being provided for, especially with her work friends trying to get at her on our relationship and the fact that she pays half on her thing, buying her food is my job, I shouldn’t get applauded for that, much other provider jargon. And I barely make 20 an hour, no skills for a safe career as I’m in customer service, not to mention, she’s been discussing trying to get an apartment together, rent is high where we live.. all these factors into play, I want to get a degree or some certifications to mitigate all of this, so she would not be so sad that I have to go back home, and not want for anything. I’ve been trying to do this for a year now but wanting to spend time with her, but that provider bit really made me want to get in gear. 

but the moment I proposed that Im doing this, she didn’t favor it, she wants things back to before that, and I completely understand, I feel like it was a lot to ask from her to understand that big change, so Ive been trying to mitigate it, cut some things off like my gym, maybe until I can take off those 3 classes. She told her family, and they think it is suspicious For me to “suddenly change” and that She should get out of a situation where the amount of love is not being reciprocated. And all that hurts me a lot, because her family treated me very nicely, I like all of them, and at that point, I felt like a full on villain. I don’t feel that way now, I know that she just wanted to be seen, not feel so one sided.. and she was truly trying to understand as hard as she could. but her telling me those other opinions and saying she’s trying not to believe them.. idk, I feel like I was being cornered, and I ended up telling her “I feel like youre not trying to look at what I’m doing from my perspective” and she split, exploded, and I’m blocked on almost everything, she canceled her birthday trip and theme park tickets we got, and I feel worse than I did during the first split, I haven’t gotten a full nights rest in two days, my heart is very heavy, and i Just can’t even fully breathe. I don’t know what to do, I want to be in her life and do right by her, how am I supposed to navigate a split like this? I probably can’t think straight, but I need people to talk to.."
823,2,"I currently don’t have an FP and it feels so heavy to sit with this emptiness, I keep trying to learn a skill do something to fill the void but all I want is to have that intensity. I am socially anxious so I don’t even have any friends apart from those at work and we don’t talk much. I stay silent for prolonged periods and it sometimes feels so hard. I am on medication for my coexisting PTSD due to my previous FP so thinking about him triggers me and I just can’t (specifically after medication Whenever I try to soothe myself day dreaming about him I feel nauseous now). I am a workaholic and I keep reading books which burns me out these days.
It just makes me wanna oversleep.
"
824,1,"I left my ex 2.5 years ago. He was abusive in every way. I now have CPTSD now - along with BPD. It's made like difficult. Before my ex, I was so codependent. He destroyed me so much I enjoy being alone more than offering my energy enough to get hurt anymore.

After leaving. I have turned down everyone who has tried. Accept, one. He is amazing. He is talented. Reassuring. Patient. Honest. Intelligent. He is like my missing puzzle piece. Like, God made him for me. I love him, who he is, how unique he is, how devoted & loyal he is. He would give me the same amount of love I would. 

He is able to give me what I have always wanted. Yet, I can't now. My whole life has known trauma. I finally left my ex and found self-love. Apparently, it is so much that I enjoy being alone. Maybe it's fear? I'm unsure. 

Needless to say, I was an idiot. I pushed him away. He kept trying, and trying, I would not even look at the messages or answer calls. I dont even know why. I do have a lot going on in my life (with packing, moving, unpacking, deep cleaning, selling the house, divorce, custody battle, and so much more) which - has sent me into this frantic emotional state. Way easily stressed & reactive. 

Literally, he did nothing wrong. If I felt hurt by something, he validated, apologized, and changed the behavior. Like?? How does someone like this exist? I never go for green flags. I have always been a bull chasing red flags. That's why I haven't dated. Naturally, with me distancing. He did the same today he didnt read anything I sent the entire day. I felt upset that he did the same thing I did - except. It was the first day he did this.  Every day before that, he's shown he wants this... so what do I do?? I deleted him off snap! 🥺 WHYYY? I tried to talk myself out of it before I did. I tried to talk sense into myself that he is only doing the same thing you've done the past 3-4 weeks (each week I got more distant). I got the feeling in my stomach & I couldn't talk myself out of it.  

Now I feel like an idiot for pushing the green flag away. The one man who got my attention did everything right. He is so talented, and OMG, he is so attractive... here I am unsure how to take it back.. I know I screwed up & now maybe I lost him forever.

Maybe it's for the best. He deserves more than the push pull of my BPD. He deserves more than having to deal with the trauma I hold with my past relationship & life experiences. He deserves more than who I become in a relationship. I get reserved. Feel trapped. Scared. Jealous. Depressed. Needy. Insecure. When he pulls away & I run back. I want him, the future it would be with him. Yet - my brain, heart, and body feel like they never align.. 

Idk how to explain it to him. I want him, but he is better off without what being with me entails. I'm too damaged now. I just dont know how to explain this & know I can't apologize & promise that I won't do it again. Because I can say I won't & will aim to never do it. But, my self sabotaging would take over at one point & break the promise. 

I dont want to hurt. I dont want anyone to hurt. I especially do not want to hurt him. "
825,1,"i really need to vent.


i genuinely have been spending my life just lying and lying to the point where its automatic even in trivial situations (like someone asking me how my day was) and its horrible i cant stop. i feel like none of my relationships are real because they dont know the real me because ive literally MADE EVERYTHING UP

i look at myself in the mirror and i cant even identify myself with who im looking at. i feel like me and her are two different people in the same body. i cant look at her and attribute my actions to her.

i just ruined a perfectly good relationship because of this. i got caught lying and its all my fault and the relationship was fucking perfect for 3 years but i decided to ruin it. i couldnt sleep anymore at night with all the lies i kept and lied one last time for all just to get myself out of it. the other person didnt deserve a lying bitch like me.
no admitting what ive done. no apologizing for the lies. 
just hurting myself a good last time so they can go. 
i feel horrible. like i dont deserve any help ever. i dont know why i lie so much. i hurt them for no reason just because all i think about is myself


i want to work on this. i genuinely want to stop. now that ive lost everything, i ironically have a clean slate to start back on without all the lies. 

Please, does it ever get any better?"
826,3,"I own him my life, in every meaning. He supported me since day we had deeper talk and I told him about some of my problems with abusive parents and my SH. He showed me that ""my friends"" of that time were harming and using me. He multiple times stopped me from SH. He helped me start eating normally again and stop drinking energetic drinks (instead of meals). He convinced me to move, excercise a little bit to felt better in my skin. He took me on bike rides, we were walking home instead of takin bus. He rescued me after overdose. He tried support me in my fight with BPD, finding right therapy, copying with trauma. He took so much blame and consequences on him to make it easier to me...

We were just friends from school. After couple months, we fell in love. Instantly, I tried to reject him, told him that ""I know that is something wrong with me, maybe I am evil. But normal person don't do SH, aren't suicidal, don't explode with anger and agression just to calm down and cry in 15min period"". But he told me he will accept everything, that I will be better when we move in together (= when I will cut off my abusers), he will help me get better and we will make things work. That we will have wonderfull life *together*.
Now, we are close to 9th anniversary of first ""i love you"". We are close to 5th anniversary of starting **our life** > only we in his apartment and our newly adopted two lovely little beans (kittens).


And now day after day guilt is eating me alive. We could have amazing life and I sabotaged it since our firts months. Destroyes everything bit by bit. And made a life that we having now, that we hate, full of grief and sadness.


I am not allowed to have dreams. To want things for me. I can of course fulfill basic human needs, but there is nothing more like eating sweets, taking relaxing baths, having me-time, buying for myself things that aren't essential. Why? Because this are rules of his house, rules that I should follow to still live with him even our ""relationship status"" is for him ""roommates with shared past"". He is painful honest - he don't love me anymore, feeling hate toward me and will never forgive me harm I did to him. Importamt is that he tried to help me nad fix us, fix me even when I run away home multiple times. In may 2024, I disapeared for 10 days, tried cut off him, but all this time he was trying breake to me that this can be another BPD rage episode and fear pushing me to running away all problems we had builded from years. I january 2025 I had 2days rage-split.
Well, backing up to the rules of his house - they are made in our agreement years ago. They was of course modify many times, in respond for occuring stituations. But thay was to protect him from my abusive behaviours (those unpurposeful too) and me from my maladaptive responds. But I hate rules - my abusive parents gived me them instead of care, love and giving some shit about me, my health etc. For me, not my younger brother, were only rules and punishment if I broken some.
I can't just accept that I am adult and I can't eat/buy/do whatever I want. That I can't make decisions about my apperance.
But because I treated him not well,  unfair, with time even abusive, I had to accept that if I am not good, there is no to pleasing me. Simple exchange, but I failed it.
When he is busy and I am in other room to give him needed space and calm, I am sick of guilt. Because I am crying for life I can't have,  that I didn't deserve as abusive person, cheater, lier.
I am crying to thoughts about leaving him, our cats, our home to live alone in ""closet"" in doorms with shearing kitchen and bathroom. To leave all of I had left to...eat sweets, season fruits and ice creams, to watch shows and movies, to read books, to go on walks and make photos of flowers, ducks and squirells. To sleep 15h if I need it. To go to work even on night shifts when I want/need more money. To change how I look, to wear anything what and how I want. I am wishing to somehow redeem myself, to BE myself in ways I chose, I like, I want.
I am crying every day because I want throw out almost decade of life, of trying, of love, happiness, hope, pain, suffering, fighting...just to end safe life with problems, to escape discomforts, erase blames...
Really? Are financial stability, comfortable 2-person living in big apartment, living with adorable, cute, the most loved, *our* cats are worth of rejection? For other hair color, PrimeVideo nights, strawberrys and chocolate?"
827,0,"Recently I was talking to a friend who also has bpd about our sexualities / labels and how they always either seem to be constantly changeing or super niche we had to google eachothers. Eventually we were like wait do you think this might be due to bpd?

Essentially, we both have dated men, women, nonbinary people, ect but neither of us would call ourselves bi because it just dosen't seem right. She ( cis f, straight? / niche label I kinda sorta forgot the name of... ) is currently dating a cis male but her past 2 ( long term ) relationships have both been with women and she strongly belived she was lesbian however now she thinks shes straight because she couldn't see herself being as fuffiled with a woman ( but also another man ).

For me ( ftm, niche labels I lowkey might get dragged for so we'll say bi? )  my last long term I recently ended was with a nonbinary masc leaning person and I was ""sure"" I was gay but that was mostly bc I physically even if I tried to force myself could not have even the tiniest slightest romantic or otherwise attraction to anyone esle ( my partner was my fp and had be for a while before we dated for context ) now that we had a messy break up and are no contact my sexuality feels all over the place. I thought I was straight bc even tho I've dated others my most ""serious"" were with women or afab people however I also feel like I'd never date a woman but also if it was the ""right person"" I probably would bc I have before but in theory I wouldn't blahblah ect. 99% of the time I just only have eyes for my fp even if not necessarily romantic and my sexuality reflects that but it DOES feel right in that moment and my friend say she feels the same. There is also a bit more that comes into this about how I feel romantic attraction ( or technically to what extent ) and how that affects dating ( I physically can't bring myself to dat if it isn't my fp but I also haven't always dated all / past fps ) but this is already a long enough ramble so I can say if anyone acc cares to know / is intrested.

TLDR; My ( and another friend with bpd's ) sexuality never feels right unless we have a partner / fp it reflects ( e.g. im a man dating a man = gay ) because we physically even if we try to force ourselves have absolutly 0 intrest in any other relationship, romantic or further. 

Do any other queer people with bpd feel like this?

( Gonna reply super late if theres any qs or anything of the sort cuz its almsot 5am for me and I'm going to sleep anyway I'm so curious about this now so go nuts in the comments )"

Getting discharged from the Navy soon and I tried posting about it on the Navy subreddit since I was talking about how I want to feel like a veteran because I did everything I could to continue being in service I just wanted some therapy because I didn't know I had this crap before I was diagnosed. 

I still to this day am regretting ever going to begin with since it ruined my entire life plan as you can't have any personality disorder and be enlisted so I went down a dark path for a bit being unable to see myself as anything other than a failure and a disgrace to my time in service. I only served two years and I hate myself for not just shutting up and getting through it since I know my life would've been ten times better had I kept quiet but now I'm at risk for losing everything. (I had to enlist to try and get away from my abusive household and I had no other way to pay for college otherwise).

I hate this disorder. I hate it so much because I have this, Anxiety and Depression, PTSD, ADHD I'm gay a Christian and a vet who couldn't even do his full time in service. It's just one more thing to get shit on for and I hate so much of just this running around crap and I swear to fucking God if I hear one comment on ""Well yeah everyone gets marginalized that's life"" IT SHOULDN'T BE! I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE OR WHAT YOU'VE GONE THROUGH IS IT SO INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO JUST BE NICE FOR FIVE SECONDS OR EVEN NOT SAY ANYTHING AT ALL?!?! Instead of saying basic shit like ""You sound like a bitch"" for being upset I'm seeing people get called weak for seeking mental help or being upset that people accuse every homeless person or SA victim of being at fault?

Is it genuinely so hard to give one single shit?

In the original post I made I was literally only asking for people's advice on how to get over this feeling of thinking I'm a failure for being thrown out for something I didn't want to do or have happen and almost every single comment was just ""Stop being a bitch""/ ""Don't call yourself a vet because you aren't one and should be ashamed."" 

I don't care who thinks I'm clout chasing or Reddit farming gold or whatever the actual piss I genuinely don't care I just wanted to get that off my chest. Take care bros"
833,2,"Hoping this is allowed. I am not diagnosed with BPD and am not trying to self-diagnose, just trying to see if anyone can relate to these same feelings?

I've been doing a lot of self-reflection lately, especially as it relates to my dating history, and I think I may have been splitting during some arguments. For me, the only way I can think to describe it is as if someone who doesn't care about the relationship has hijacked the conversation. I suddenly don't care if that person leaves or not; in fact, sometimes I wish they would. It's as if I forget every good moment with that person and am hyper-fixated on that one thing they did wrong in the moment. I have been told ""you seem like a different person right now"" and honestly, I feel like a different person when it happens.

"
834,1,"He left me. He always used to tell me he'll love me always and now he has left me. I thought I would spend the rest if my life with him. 

I made a stupid bad joke on what's app, which he missunderstood and blocked me. He has a fearful avoidant attachment style, so he's very sensitive and often assumes the worst. We often trigger each other on what's app. In real life things are usually fine. 

Anyway him blocking me triggered me, big time. I did something bad, to get him to unblock me. He then unblocked me to tell me he's breaking up with me and he'll never forgive me. I then totally snapped, like went absolutely nuts. This happened yesterday. I cried all day yesterday, had this horrible pain in my chest and my body all day, all last night. Then cried all day today. Just kept thinking how I wanted to die for 2 days straight. We kept texting because I didn't leave him alone. Then his last message made me realise we are never getting back together and he just doesn't love me the way I love him and I have to let him go. 

I then stopped texting him and stopped crying. I feel absolutely nothing. The sadness and depression is gone. My chest is not hurting anymore. 

I know this is my body protecting me. I don't ever want my feelings to come back and just hope I'll stay numb forever. 


Any idea how long the emotional shutdown will last? 

"
835,1,"for things i didnt even fucking know i did (for the most part except for the last thing which was a stupid thing to get fired for anyway). i hated that job and wanted to quit every day because it made me want to eat bullets every shift because everyone was so mean and obviously hated me. but i was torn because it pays fairly well and i need the money to survive. so i guess its not so bad that they made the decision for me. but the part that stings is that they are “notoriously nice” employers and ive never heard of anyone getting fired from that job (its a job at my university) and idk about you but my bpd makes me extra super sensitive to people hating me, and whenever i feel like someone hates me, people always tell me its my illness exaggerating it and im like fine. and last year, when i thought they were mad at me, i told people and they said i was making it up. but it was TRUE. so it just makes me paranoid yk, that every single time ive had the feeling that someone hates me or thinks im a bad employee its true. anyway this sucks because now whenever i see my employers or coworkers around campus its gonna be like the most humiliating thing ever. god i just wanna kill myself. this sucks. if you made it to the end thanks for listening to my rant. idk. anyone have nice words to say? i could use them."
836,2,"My jealousy and insecurity issues are insane and it always leads me to wanting so badly to just ask him unnecessary or inappropriate questions about him and his ex, which makes him uncomfortable because he doesn’t want to think about his ex. I can’t help myself though, it’s like temporary relief when i ask. It never helps me in the long term though. I just feel bad for my boyfriend because he doesn’t deserve to be bombarded by these stupid stressful questions. And sometimes lash out and say i wanna break up etc etc. It’s been hard lately with just his mental health blowing up at me and mine too. I tried really hard holding in my questions and insecurities etc and i did succeed. It was so hard though.

Does anyone else struggle with this and do you have any solutions or advice? "
837,1,"I have been so sad recently to the point to where it's getting in the way of my productivity. When I'm sad the tears won't stop and I feel as if I have to hide away so that nobody sees me crying because that makes other people uncomfortable. I got tired of laying there and decided to get up. I took a shower, got ready, and went to the gym (ALL WHILE CRYING NONSTOP). Sure, others were looking at me like I was a weirdo, but I really couldn't help it. "
838,2,"Hey. I feel like I’m going a little insane here. 

Does anyone else experience a continuous scream / cry in their head? it is so persistent that even when I’m having a conversation or thinking to myself I can still hear it like it’s on the other train of thought. 

It often sounds like an “inner child” that is making the complaint, so IFS therapy is an interest but.. help? I just need some encouragement. "
839,1,"I don't know why I'm making this post other than to just vent to people who can understand and maybe get some perspective. I have been with my wife for coming up on 8 years (married for 2½). I love her more than I have ever loved anyone in my life. I was engaged to someone else before and it ended up not working out (she cheated on me as most do) and when that ended it was nothing like this. My current relationship has had it's ups and downs as most do. The ups are amazing.  
  
When we first got together it was like magic. I couldn't believe how incredible it was. In fact when we met we had both sworn off relationships altogether at that point and were just looking for some fun. After dating for a couple months we realized that we had something special. The first couple years were something else. Eventually though issues started to pop up. At this point I had never even heard of BPD so I thought I just had depression. I had been in a mental health facility for a little while years earlier but they wrote it off as major depression and medicated me accordingly.  
 
Fast forward to my current relationship and stuff started to pop up that didn't make sense to me. My girlfriend was getting really hurt by some of the stuff I was saying and the way I was treating her. I thought it was mostly my depression and her cptsd that was causing it. If she could just stop this or that then we'd be okay. I would treat her in a way that hurt her deeply and I wouldn't understand why or how to fix it. When I tried to fix it she would get more angry. I realize now that it was because I grew up in an invalidating environment so I didn't have the tools to help. I wasn't trying to understand her pain, I was trying to convince her that what she was hurt about wasn't reality. That she was just looking at things wrong or misunderstood how I felt or was overreacting about something. This usually ended with her more upset and me disassociating because I didn't know how to fix it.  
Then there were the other times when she would go out with friends and I would have these crazy thoughts about what she was doing and why. I would lose my shit and start texting her in these barrages to get her to respond which would only make her feel unsafe and not want to come home. This would trigger me because now she's disappeared off the map and I'm flipping the fuck out. I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't. These instances caused her a lot of anxiety just in general about our relationship. She would feel like she had to walk on eggshells all the time because she didn't know what was going to trigger me. I didn't know what was going to trigger me.  
  
There were instances of self harm that would freak her out. There were mood swings out of nowhere. All the classics brought to you by untreated BPD. Until one day I happened across a video about BPD and I could swear the guy was talking about me specifically. Everything he said was so accurate to my life it was almost like a biography. I then talked to my therapist about it and she said it sounds like this might have be what I have however she didn't want to do a formal diagnosis because I was thinking of trying to get custody of my kid from my previous partner and it might look bad. That was about a year or so ago.  
When I first found out about this diagnosis I didn't know what the fuck to think. I was confused and kind of angry that on top of all the other bullshit I've had to go through in life, now I have this horrible disorder. It felt almost like a death sentence in a way. It took me maybe six months to really process it. All the while my mental health was deteriorating.  
  
I work from home so I'm isolated all day. I stopped drinking so I lost most of my friends. My band broke up so no musical outlet anymore. Things were getting worse and worse between my (now) wife and I. It got to a point where it wasn't sustainable anymore and I needed to make a change. So I started reading more and more about BPD. As I did this I started having all these realizations about how and why I feel the way I feel and where it's coming from. I started to figure out how to climb out of this hole and start making changes.  
  
Well this was a couple months ago and in mid May my wife and I had an argument and I said some really hurtful shit and she stormed off. After that she started treating me differently. I could feel the love drying up and withering away. I didn't know why at the time, I just knew something was really wrong. I asked her if she still loved me and she said yes. This went on for weeks. A couple weeks ago it got to the point where it was so painful to be without this love that I sat in the basement alone crying for a couple hours. I came upstairs and laid in bed just crying to myself because I knew something was really really wrong and I could feel the love missing. My wife comes in and gets angry with me because I was ignoring everyone in the house. I told her I don't think she loves me anymore and she starts listing off reasons why she's upset with me. This hurt a lot and I got defensive. Things got heated and she said she wants a divorce. I was crushed. I told her to reconsider but she said her mind was made up.  
  
I spent the next couple days pretty much incapacitated with grief. I didn't work or shower or eat, pretty much just laid in bed crying like a little girl. She wanted me out of the house so I flew out of state to stay with my parents for a few days. While I was away I did a lot of reflecting and realized how awful I had been to her. I went back through old text conversations and was horrified by how I had treated her. I started to see things in a whole new light. I was the villain. I hurt her so much that it finally broke her capacity to love me back. When she eventually started to speak to me again I told her how I realized that she was right all this time and how sorry I am for what I've done to her. Over the last couple weeks we have had many conversations about issues in the past and I have taken responsibility for my actions but she doesn't trust me now. She thinks that I'm just saying this to keep her from leaving. And then she said that even if I have had this realization that it's only because I stand to lose something and that I didn't really care until then. I came to the conclusion that I have always cared but I just never knew how to help her in her time of need because I didn't know how. When I failed to help I felt powerless and she would get upset because of my invalidating behavior so I would disassociate and usually go to sleep while she stayed up crying by herself.  
  
I really fucked up and I don't know if it can be fixed. What really gets me is how much I have hurt her and made her feel like I never really loved her and that she is unlovable due to something about her. I'm trying to sit with her in these feelings now and understand her better. She is just having a hard time believing that I really feel this way and I'm not just saying what she wants to hear and I understand why she feels that way.  
  
We're in this weird situation now where we're technically separated but still living together and sleeping in the same bed but she has this wound that I don't know if it can be healed. We are kind of stuck in routine and she still says I love you and hugs me before she goes to work but there is an odd energy and a frequent anger from her. 
  
God I feel so horrible for what I did to her. I feel like a monster for hurting the person I vowed to protect and cherish forever so damn much. This is the worst pain and hardest thing I've ever had to do. I have started on a path to treatment but it might be too little too late. It feels like vacuuming the carpet in a house that's burning down. If she's gone I don't know how I'm going to continue on in life. After knowing the love and closeness of my wife and best friend I don't know how I can ever go home to an empty apartment. I don't know how I can let go of the thought of living our lives together and getting old together. Not having her as an adventure partner around the world. Not watching her do all the little endearing things I watch her do every day like braid her hair on the edge of the bed before we go to sleep or hearing her sing through the house. Missing the smell of her perfume or just her smell in general. Or the warmth and weight of her next to me in bed.  
  
Fuck. I really fucked this one up bad and I don't know how to fix it. I've been on the crisis hotline several times this last week because she takes off all night because she needs to be away from me and I don't know how to deal with it. I wish I could take all the horrible things I said back. I wish I could show myself back then the damage I was doing. I regret this more than anything I have ever done. Most of all I regret causing her so much pain. I can see it on her face. I can see where the love is missing and how I made her feel broken. I don't know if either of us will ever be the same and it's all my fault..."
840,1,"I hate the fact that I can never feel purely happy for others. I always have conflicting feelings when someone else is having something nice but I’m not and it makes me feel like such a shitty person. 
It can be the simplest thing, I am having a bad day where I feel depressed so now I am annoyed and bothered because it’s a beautiful day out and the birds are chirping. Same thing is someone post beautiful pictures of their trip I always have a nagging though that is deprecating to the person that is enjoying said vacation. Worst thing is I feel guilty about being such a hater. I would rather people be happy instead of miserable like myself but I can never stop myself from having hateful ass thoughts and it is so exhausting. For once I’d like to just be happy for others without any extra steps. 

Has anyone found a way to curb such thoughts? I am so tired of feeling like a bad person that is constantly jealous of not being included in happiness or enjoyment :("

i’m sorry if this is a mess i just genuinely have nobody anymore and i don’t wanna reach out to the half friends i have because why traumatise someone with my own problems. "
842,2,"After going to the ER for cutting last week, I finally met with a therapist today. That said, I found it somewhat confusing. I didn't fully get what she knew but understood she had context, so I decided to tell her about something which happened yesterday which was a very clear example of me being hella suicidal, cutting, splitting, cutting people off, dissociating, and explaining that I felt generally scared for myself. 

It happens that I now, hours later, after days of dissociating followed by about a day of feeling absolutely horrible am in a great mood and decided to hang out with my friends who I had ""dropped"" yesterday when we'd all been together in a group setting and I'd consciously and obviously not engaged with them, having not spoken with them in days. 

At the end of telling this whole story in greater detail, she kind of was like alr see ya. And I guess I just don't feel so fulfilled? which I understand would be reasonable but like I asked her what her purpose was and she said something along the lines of ""to listen"" which feels like a waste of time. But I feel like as she was the person connected to me by the psychiatric ER, she should be competent? 

I just feel having gone to a couple of other mental health professionals at this point and explaining things to everyone it just feels really draining and annoying. I kind of came out of that feeling horrible and like I almost wanted to go back to the ER just because I'd left there feeling like I was on a path forward. I also just imagine that I need to be on medication like really and I'm pretty sure this girl can't do that, so like idk I just think I need some sort of advice and help. I'm trying not to be hopeless."
843,3,"I've struggled with BPD for years. My highs are so overwhelming and consuming, and my lows bring me to suicidal ideation.

I've specifically strugged with FPs and obsession. I can get so unbelievably into someone. They become a part of me. Every second they're gone is unbearable. Every time I see them, I can't breathe, I get dizzy, I feel like I want to faint. They become my oxygen and my everything. I think of them 24/7, I can't concentrate on anything else. I've felt so good from love that I've previously gone through routes of self harm when I was younger (I have stopped doing that and now journal). I become reliant on them for my happiness, for my health, for my everything.

It's unhealthy. It brings us both down. I hate that part of me. I'm trying to fix it so I can love in a healthy, non-reliant way.

But at the same time, I do love the fact that I give my all to people. I love how good it feels to be around them. I genuinely love how addicted I feel to them.

Today, I talked to my psychiatrist about all of this. I've been on antidepressants for a good while now off and on, but she ultimately decided to put me on mood stabilizers because of how intense everything is for me.

I'm really hoping this, alongside therapy, helps me to overcome these thoughts and overwhelming feelings, but I'm also a little scared. I don't think I know what love feels like outside of that intense rush through my body and heart, outside of those consuming thoughts in my brain. Does anyone else have experience with this and can maybe offer their perspective?"
844,1,"I feel so sad, I'm not sure what triggered it. Im blurry eyed tears still falling. I hate it. But it's like I've to cry it out theres no other way. There's literally some weird ache inside my chest like it actually hurts so much. I just think of one thing then another then another and the tears keep coming. I feel so hopeless. I feel like everything good in my life is going to turn bad. Like it always has. 



Nothing stays good for long right and I already see signs of it turning so so bad. Maybe it's a self fulfilling prophecy. So I don't wanna talk about it anymore. I want to sleep I'm so tired I didn't sleep all day yesterday but still I can't sleep right now. I missed my meds again. I feel so worthless. It's like I'm just self sabotaging my entire life for some reason. I have no ambition if I've to be honest. If I've to a hundred percent honest I don't have ambition and I really want to die. But I tell myself everyday that I don't and there's something worth working towards. I mean sure there might be but I'm not capable. I feel like such a failure.




Everyone looks at me like a burden. Im ugly and not useful. Im so fucking lazy, I've trouble even brushing my teeth evryday nowadays it's so so bad and it's just getting worse. I have skipped two weeks appts with my therapist and psych dw I didn't have to pay but still I'm just not willing to change anymore I think. I Think I'm done. I don't want to continue anymore. Like really, Im never going to be what I envision myself. Some of it is just impossible and I don't want to be anything else. Im just a disappointment to everyone. "
845,2,"I am about to move in with my partner, for the last few years we’ve been separated and focused on school, I’ve had intense episodes but being separated and staying as busy as possible has made those episodes rare. Since school is out for the summer I’ve been spending more time with my partner and have noticed multiple episodes happening in just a couple weeks, one was so intense I was a danger to myself. I know the trigger is abandonment/rejection that is perceived but idk how to stop myself from spiraling once it’s triggered. We’re about to move in together and i want to know if I will be experiencing more intense/frequent episodes and how can we work this out together? My partner is extremely patient and the most green flag there could ever be, I try to be better but then these episodes happen and I lose control and almost end up taking myself out. I hate making my partner’s anxiety worse and of course the more it happens the more terrified I am that my partner will think of me as too much and leave. I just want to know if it becomes more frequent and if any of you have tips for the both of us. Thanks!"
846,2,"Me and M worked at the same shitty pet store where we both adored the same parrot. And we got to talking outside of work. And then it became more. I developed for the first time, feelings for a person. And I thought I would never feel comfortable doing that ever. I was obsessed with being near her 24/7. 

She had to go away for a whole year because she needed help. I wanted to help her so bad but I knew her illness was more then just her being skinny. Well, while at treatment. She met a girl named ""grace"" and she started putting grace above talking to me. Above being around me. Hell, she's even moving to this shitty state far away from me for this girl named grace. When just before that. She admitted she had loved me too. I texted her everyday even if she didn't respond. I never sent bombarding things. It was always ""good morning, hope you have a wonderful day"" and a good night text just the same. And now I'm being replaced by a wannabe. She said she loves me and wants me to see her in her new state but how can I willingly see her when she left me all alone? I was stuck in hell, in high school while she was free to get away. 

I get grace is older then me and I was there before grace. 

I feel thrown away. 

I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense. I've been awake for three days upset about this and i think I am loosing my mind. "
847,3,"*additional cw for mentions of self harm. 

i feel so tired if i sit with emotions like anger or general discomfort instead of either acting/lashing out or hurting myself with cutting to cope with either. i am trying again to recover both physically and mentally from an eating disorder as well so it comes with extremely difficult emotions and acting against the urge to restrict. 

it's a good sign to me because it means that i sat with the emotion and i am very capable of it even with the fact that the emotional symptoms of BPD are the hardest for me to cope and live with. it makes me absolutely exhausted though, to the point where i could easily fall asleep afterwards if i tried to. 

does this happen to anyone else here, especially when you don't react maladaptively to these emotions?"
848,2,"do you ever feel like you finally know what you think you want to do in life and get all excited but then suddenly you start to feel down and get like anxious and feeling bad, like never mind… i don’t think i’m made for this… 
then start all over again finding something new, like almost a hyperfixation or an obsession but not really idk 
i hope i’m not the only one

849,2,My last post didn't go through so I'm just going to be very vague since this is my first post here. But after experiencing trauma from my past first relationship I've lost trust in people and gained a lot of insecurity to the point I'm not sure if I can trust someone again and I'd just like any support or advice to getting over a past abusive fp (ex boyfriend) and how to allow romance again in my life without feeling lesser of myself due to what I've been through physically and mentally. 
850,3,"Is there a better way to go about getting a sense of self? Normally I jump from one personality to another. Sometimes I mimic/take on the persona of celebrities, TV show characters, and even family members. This is super frustrating as my wardrobe keeps changing and constantly changing my demeanor has made me even more confused. Lately, I have been utilizing Pinterest. I have a board dedicated to 1 identity and I have been trying my best not to sway away from mimicking the persona that I created. I really hope I am making sense. 

Anyways, is there a better way to go about keeping 1 identity?"
851,2,"for context, my friend told me his best friend thought i was really attractive and i started following him, we started talking everyday. Thing is, i think im starting to really like him but i cannot tell if its limerence or a genuine crush, plus i actually wanna take things slow because hes a really sweet guy and i see a future and i really wanna be with him.
Thing is im just really confused, do i like
him? do i just seek approval? is it attachement? i cannot stop thinking about him"
852,1,"i feel so stuck rn, living w someone and i feel like i can’t leave and do my own thing. i have been in a long episode for a few weeks now and i HAVE to crash out or else i feel like i have to kill myself if i dont. this has been a pattern for my whole life and i cant find any info on it "
853,3,"partner (fp) video called me after a 19 hour shift. I ended up crying on call after seeing their face because god they looked really exhausted and i felt bad looking at the state they were in and also because i really missed them and it was nice to see their face. partner got triggered and thought i started crying after they said goodbye on call and that i was crying because i wanted to talk more. they ended up ranting for a very long time about how no matter what they do it's never enough for me, how hard they're job is, I'm ungrateful, they should never open their mouth, they regret even talking, everything is a symptom (of my bpd) etc. 

I explained why I was crying but they things they had said by that time really needed to be addressed and so I did but again they ended up ranting for most of it and said they will not call me again, will not ""rant"" anymore and all this ended up in a 2 hour fight where they kept saying it's been a year and I'm still doing this with you, i haven't slept in a year (because of merchant navy degree/training and now on ship) why don't you ever let go of things. I said because i don't like when I'm misunderstood and things are left unsaid, i didn't like what you said to me when you were triggered. They said i should've still just let them go to sleep and discussed this tomorrow because i knew they just had such a long shift. But they barely gat any time during their day so i didn't even know it was possible. I just thought I'd express how i felt bad in 2 minutes and sleep. But no it dragged on for 2 hours. 

I feel so bad. I'm not just my bpd. I'm also a human with normal feelings. My partner has always thought i never let go of things and just drag them on. Even asked why am I even with them anymore because we don't ""work out"" I'm scared they're going to get tired and leave me like they did the last 6 times because of our fights. 

I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore. I'm scared to express anything to them because they get triggered so quickly because of their past experiences with our fights (before i knew I had bpd and had some tricks to control myself) 

Ps. Don't say bad things about my partner we are both mentally ill individuals that are suffering. Don't suggest a break up either. We are giving it a chance. Maybe some tips or advice would be helpful. "
854,1,"hi.. i haven’t posted on this sub in a while i just really needed to rant. i am genuinely just so disappointed in myself :(. i’ve been officially in remission for around 6 months. i’m def improving but not perfect and moments like this are just so FRUSTRATING. ive been clean from self harm for 7 months and almost relapsed tonight because of perceived rejection from a guy i like. so stupid. it’s just so hard sometimes and it makes me feel like im not really in remission and ive just manipulated my therapists into thinking that. anyways, back to reality, so it took me a few years after being diagnosed to truly get my symptoms under control. my family has been super supportive of getting me help the last 8 years or so. it was a pretty rough 5 years BUT i ended up graduating college recently and since then i got accepted to graduate school for an MSW program. masters in social work. i want to be a therapist but i feel like my bpd puts me in no place to be getting an msw. i know i can do it i have the drive and the grades and the passion but i just feel like having bpd sets me back. i also got a very large scholarship which is helping me feel like i belong and im wanted but its just really hard lately to feel like i should be doing this. i know how unstable we are with careers and jobs and i just feel so sick over this lately :( am i qualified to be a therapist if i myself struggle deeply? am i gonna ruin someone’s life? i want to do it so bad im just ugh idk sorry just ranting i don’t have anyone to talk to and  this probably makes no sense lmao "
855,3,"Is my BPD getting worse? Im F23 and I can recall dissociation being something that would take place from extreme overwhelm only during an episode. Now I feel a constant sensation of not being part of my own life, like its entirely alien, not feeling any attachment to the image i see in the mirror, zero connection to my family or acquaintances, zero connection to what im doing at uni or for work, time passing by so incredibly fast at a zooming speed and me feeling left behind, like i havent done anything, zero progress or movement forward... Is it the goddamn phone absorbing us and frying our brains? Does BPD add to it? I feel like something is constantly expected of me and I can't catch a break.... I havent processed 2020 properly... my brain and time stopped there.

Can anyone relate? "
856,3,"This may not be allowed but I'll try it. So a little backstory. Very rough childhood. Had 2 siblings raised by a single alcoholic father. Was treated like trash most of the time as a child. Fast forward to my early 20s I'm 36 btw. Was in a serious relationship with a woman for 4 years. Her mental health steadily declined and she ended up shooting herself in front of me, i believe this messed me up and never got therapy for it. This was in 2012. 2015 I met another woman we ended up getting married in 2018. She cheated on me atleast twice and I still stayed with her in fear of being abandoned. My emptiness and erratic emotions ended up destroying her too she says. She says she had a mental breakdown. We did a hurry up divorce July last year, lied on the papers to end it. I agreed. Even after the divorce we continued to see each other. She has her own problems diagnosed bipolar. Goes ok until March this year. She says she cant take it anymore, said she is seeing other people but decided she can't block me out for good because me and her stepson are so close. Said we could be friends. That didn't last ended up having sex when we saw each other again. Couple weeks ago I found out she is still seeing other people. I completely lost it and texted her I don't know how many times. Mixed emotions from anger to love to self hate. I have to get this under control or it's going to destroy me. "
857,1,"I hate this disorder. I hate the people who caused me enough suffering to develop it. I hate knowing my boyfriend would have never chosen me if his ex hadn't passed away. I hate that I look nothing like them. I hate that I'm not super skinny like them. I hate that they are loved. I hate that I have jaw issues I can't afford to fix which makes me look disgusting. I hate how I speak. I hate every single thing about me. I hate the vicious self loathing. I hate the unbearable, ceaseless emptiness, anxiety, and PAIN this disorder brings me every. Single. Day. And last but not least, I hate that I have absolutely no one in this world that wouldn't move on in a few days if I died. I am the loneliest person I have ever met. When people say they don't have friends, they still speak or text occasionally. I literally don't have a single person except my partner, but I already mentioned why that's a bust. I hate myself and my existence to the point I feel my heart wanting to just explode with pain. "
858,0,"So basically, me and my boyfriend have been with each other for a while and I have told him about my personality disorder early in the relationship, he actually doesn’t mind at all but the problem is he interprets it as if I’m like 2 people for some reason. I’m definitely happy he doesn’t have a negative opinion about bpd so I would love to explain to him that bpd isn’t about being 2 people lol 💔"
859,3,"I was in remission for 6 years. 6 years, I had very few symptoms, and only when specifically triggered. I had strong support systems and routines that kept me grounded. I was only on anxiety meds and generally proud of where I was going in life. 

Well, due to some health issues getting out of control, I ended up severely malnourished, dealing with brain fog and reduced cognition for the last couple years. It became harder and harder to maintain my symptoms via routine, as it was constantly being disrupted by my health. 

I didn't even notice I had lost control until it was too late. I moved across the country, away from my support system, uprooting my entire life. 

I'm back on medication now, but I'm still completely unstable. I can't get a grip. I regret so many of my actions the last year or so. I know it's not square one but I feel like that's where I am and to top it all off I'm broke"
860,2,"I’ve just discovered that something people with bpd struggle with is Rumination. It’s sitting there thinking about traumatic events, or negative thoughts and feelings and not attempting to pull yourself out or solve the problem. 

Now, something I was told by previous abusers was that I fed into my emotions, and it was toxic, but my emotions are all physical first, so in order for them to be any kind of consistent for me to process, I have to consciously focus on it. So where’s the line between focusing on it to process, and ruminating on it?

Is it simply the act of not trying to fix the feeling? Like if I feel guilty and I just feed into the resulting depression instead of trying to fix whatever I feel guilty about? Or like if I recognize I’m anxious or disassociating or angry and I continue to let myself feel like that instead of trying to self soothe?"
861,2,"
Hi, i would like to ask if anyone have this weird feeling when you’re making luv or after that, it is normal to have anxiety or a little pain in your chest? Cause a few times I feel like that, obviously when we’re doing that It's consensual and I'm comfortable about it.
But idk why i feel like this sometimes 
sorry if this sound crazy or weird but sometimes i feel like my inner child is broken or unprotected (??? Not always but idk why i feel this way,, I’m 22 years old :( 
Sorry for my bad English"
862,0,"Hi, I'm 28F and have dealt with suicidal ideation and mental breakdowns my whole life. I know it's very hard but just wanted to say that I'm finally on my healing journey, and some things that are helping me are traumatic release exercises (TRE) with a practitioner, tapping and nervous system regulation, vagus nerve exercises, hypnotherapy, and getting energy healing from a reiki and qigong practitioner. Along with journaling and a workbook on adverse childhood experiences. There are also guides for nervous system regulation that can be found online! If anyone needs help, plz DM and I can also give some direction. :) 

It's only because of all these that I'm finally starting to feel less miserable. Wishing you all the best, hope is out there, just have to reach for it. "
863,2,"I love socializing. But I really struggle socializing at work. I feel like I'm forced to bond with people when I don't want to. 

The thought of work gives me anxiety. I've worked for already over 3 years. I beared working because I needed to keep working, but it was such a sad experience for me that I'd cry out most days. 

But I'm think whether I'm just being too dramatic or if I'm letting my emotions take over me. When I worked, I felt like all I did is work, get ready for work, and sleep. On days when Im emotionally drained, I'd still need to work because that isnt a valid reason to not go to work. 

I feel like everybody else handles this pressure well and I'm just making everything a big deal. I remember having a kind girl coworker would help ease the anxiety I feel. She'd always say hi to me and it makes me feel good... for a while then Ill go back to being sad at my job.

I don't know I know I have to work soon but it just scares me to be in a situation again where I have to be unhappy everyday:-("
864,1,"
It doesn’t matter whats going on and how horribly I feel, all they see it’s the BPD diagnosis and don’t care to bother anymore. 
My mother is treating me like all thats left of me is a pathology. I feel I am nobody’s child anymore, I am just a huge problem. 

The stigma is real. The social exclusion is real. 
The unwillingness to treat BPD patients is real. 

I hate everything about my diagnosis and I genuinely wish I never gotten any kind of help, that I never had to spoke about it. 

There’s no way out of this. 
There’s never a single thing in my life that doesn’t prove my statement’s right. 
My statement that suicide is the only way out. 

It’s still kinda ‘hilarious’ that I could’ve lived a normal life if people didn’t fuck me up my entire childhood. "
865,2,"Usually we talk every day, but the last couple for weeks we've been arguing a lot about us accidentally hurting eachother with how we process emotions and express them. He's very much an introverted/avoidant and im very much an extroverted/anxious. He has told me that when he gets overwhelmed he needs time to reajust himself and feel normal and this can usually take days. The other night on my birthday we had a bad miscommunication again and we both were very hurt and he left without hugging me, usually when he does this he says its because he feels like he would be intruding on my space since im mad at him. He also says thats why he doesn’t reach out after an argument because he thinks he's bothering me. Its been a couple of days since then and he hasn't said a single word to me. Im starting to feel anxious and i dont know if i should continue giving him space even though he never explicitly asked for it this time, or if i should try to reach out. But im always the one to reach out. I dont if hes just done with me or if this is him getting readjusted again. "

870,3,"I just realized one of the last arguments I had with him was over the dumbest possible topic. He had admitted to me he  tried to avoid porn because he had  been exposed to it at the age of 10. And it took him years to get over his addiction to it.

.....And I mocked him for it, because I figured he was just being overly religious about it. And now I realize, I literally used that as a reason to justify breaking up with him.

871,0,"hi everyone!! I'm looking for more advice on how to journal effectively. I've found my journal thoughts have been spilling more into out loud thoughts and that means I gotta revisit.

I like prompt work I guess? and it seems I've run out of some with my brain that encourages me to vent enough. I'm curious if anyone happens to be more creative in that light,  it seems like I'm always using the same prompt in my head ""what's bothering you/myself?"" and i think I need to switch it up. Other ones I used before that I've found are starting to become ineffective are ""How am I feeling?"" ""What are things out of my control that I must talk about?""

I'm working very heavily on impulsivity,  not being a Debbie downer and other things that I've found Journaling such a help with but I'm in such a rut my usual prompts just aren't working."
872,1,"Honestly I think this subreddit is the only place where I am not going to be judged. 

Not quite sure whether it's a bpd thing or not, I still want to share my story. 

First I'd like to describe myself a little bit. I am sort of a loner. Not like I am either shy or scared of meeting people, I am simply not interested in them. I never wanted to constantly make new friends or join any social communities. I enjoy being with myself.

The only thing I wished is having a lover, a guy whom I'd love and who would also be my soulmate and a close friend. That's it. No one else is needed.   
The problem begins when I fall in love with someone. You see, the majority of people are the normal ones who simply want hanging out with others, they are open to meeting new people. So, whenever a boy I liked had a female friend I was extremely jealous. Sometimes they were not even close friends, just played a game occasionally via steam, I still was jealous.  
One guy I used to like was a streamer, he sometimes had conversations with other female streamers. There was no flirting at all but again I felt jealousy.   
  
I didn't want my favorite person to have fun with some other girl. I didn't want him to be surrounded by other women, I wanted him to be mine. These girls probably had a bunch of other guys around them, some of them even had boyfriends or husbands. Yet they still invited a guy I like to play some dumb game, they still messaged him for some reason. I didn't understand that and I didn't want to.  
  
So, as you might guess, the whole jealousy and possessiveness led to several problems which then led to break-ups. Oh how many words I have been called by: ""selfish"", ""controlling"", ""stalker"", etc. And I just wanted to be loved, but I guess my actions were extreme. 

I am kind of tired. I am already 27. Now I think I should continue having my loner lifestyle but excluding any attempts of making a relationship with someone."
873,1,"What are some things you do for yourself and for yourself only? That don’t include being medicated or using substances or looking for external validation?

What do you do just for yourself that brings you joy? "
874,3,"I dont really know if this is the best place for a post like this. I recently have been having concerns over how my relationship with my gf is slowly turning into a fp (favorite person) relationship.

Its all been culminating in me feeling abandoned when she leaves for work or talks with somebody and im not directly involved in the conversation. Weve been planning a trip to a music festival that's in a few days and when talking abt some stuff she mentioned how i need to know that she wont be able to constantly be with me because she wants to have her fun with friends. I dont know if im reading it wrong or something but i feel like im being excluded from her having fun at a festival to which im only going to keep her company (im not very much into any of the bands that are there). That kind of blew up in my face and we had a severe fight over me ""forcing her to be around me all the time"" and that im ""closing her in a cage"".

Its been 2 days since and im still absolutely destroyed and feel guilty. My stomach i so tightened i cant even eat and been surviving of cigs and water. Am i going insane over nothing? Or do i really need to rethink how im treating the only person i have in my meaningless life?"
875,2,"I keep getting these random gut feelings that my friends hate me. I have no proof or no reason to think this, but it feels so strong. She’s not answering me because she’s asleep and so I feel like I can’t get the reassurance I need. 

I have this deep fear that she will leave me. We’ve had a rocky past in our friendship where I have had BPD splits in front of her and it’s scared her or upset her. 

I’m so scared she’ll leave me so I get this feeling that she’s mad with me even though there’s no current issues, just the past. 

Any recommendations on what I can do?"
876,3,"The split is so drastic and it's so hard to handle. When I'm not splitting I kind of like who I am but when I feel that sinking feeling in my chest, that warning sign, I know that's all over.

She’s breaking down quite frequently at the moment and keeps bringing up my past relationship and asking for all the details, although I feel that when I tell her it just fuels her even more. I’m struggling with how to reassure her as she says everything I say is generic and that it means nothing to her, but I don’t know what she will resonate with. Loving this girl is not the issue I want to be with her for the rest of my life through the ups and downs. 

Any advice on how to help her get through this is welcome and on what I’m doing wrong

882,1,"my (21F) fp is my ex (23M), we dated in 2022, been on and off since then, we were supposed to get back together after his graduation. last time we were in contact was january, he ghosted me and now he’s in a relationship. i was okay about it for a bit, i hated him and didn’t want anything to do with him, but the feelings came back super hard about a month or so ago and i had this false sense of hope that we’d follow through with our plans, but knowing he has a girlfriend now and i can tell he really loves her, it feels like im dying. i know that we could possibly still end up together but i don’t wanna be delusional. there’s a good chance he stays with her and im left with this feeling forever. i don’t know how to cope or get over it or deal with it, it’s been almost 3 years since we initially broke up and it still hurts just as much. i don’t know what to do with myself i really need some advice or some hope that it’ll maybe feel better in the future. i was so so sure he was my person. i even dated other people and genuinely tried to move on but it’s not the same. i can’t do it.

883,2,"Why do I always get angry or upset with my girlfriend when she goes somewhere? I feel abandoned. I can stay mad at her the whole time, even if she doesn’t end up going - just because she thought about it. I also get upset when she travels to another city, or decides to hang out with friends.  although I don’t feel this way about all of her friends. Even when she goes somewhere with her family, I still feel this mix of anger and unfairness. It hurts especially because I don’t have the same freedom to go home myself. But I know this isn’t normal.

Has anyone else experienced this? Has anyone managed to overcome it?"
884,1,I can either take my shitty meds and be a robot or not take them and be a self-destructive hurricane. I don't even want to talk to anyone anymore. I want to push everyone away and get worse. I'm so tired of not being able to get help. my country hates me and refuses to give me therapy. I'm so tired of this. I always keep going even tho my legs are tired and hurt. I just want to feel something. I want to run away from my head and leave it behind. why do people not see what a fucking torture existing like this is 
885,2,"Hey guys, 

Ever since I got with my partner, who quickly turned into my FP, I really struggle being my own person. I will skip things I had planned on doing prior or move things around on my calendar (and not just going out partying or seeing friends I literally mean I will move doctor’s appointments and skip the gym and other things that are good for me) to ensure I can spend the most amount of time possible with him and I will get EXTREMELY anxious and agitated when I’m stuck somewhere that’s not with him. We both work full time so we really don’t see each other much as it is and maybe that’s why I’m extra sensitive to it but it really does put a hindrance on my daily life and personal goals and I can’t seem to shake it or even understand why I do this. My therapist said it really comes down to exposure therapy and pushing myself to do these things and teaching myself that I can be gone or not engaging with him every minute and nothing will happen to our relationship but I’d still rather just see him with the limited amount of free time we do have together even if it’s detrimental to me. Just looking for some advice or tips maybe!

886,3,"Content warning: overdose and substance abuse (I hope I'm doing this right).

Good day. 

My friend is diagnosed with BPD, and they often overdose on medication, as well as often drinking alcohol/energy drinks. They're 18, and live with abusive parents, who refuse to help them. They don't have any friends nearby who could help.

This is probably futile, but I'll still ask: is there any way a person can resist the impulse to hurt themselves?"
887,2,"Using a throwaway account since they've seen my account before. 

A couple days ago, I was visiting my brother (who knows about my disorder), and we were discussing some controversial subjects. My brother and I have always had similar outlooks and beliefs, and still do, and I said something in agreement with him. However, for some reason he completely misinterpreted what I said and thought I was disagreeing with him and he instantly over-reacted and started arguing against what he thought I said. 

I get a little flustered when people get heated during a conversation and sometimes stammer a bit so I tried to say ""Wait, that's, that's not-- what I'm trying to say""

Before I could finish he starts doing this incredibly over-the-top performative act:  
""W-what? You're not making sense. u/antique\_good, are... are you feeling well? A-are you okay? Do you need to call your Doctor?"" 

He was feigning concern in the most patronizing, performative way possible and I've seen him use a similar tactic with our mom in the past. I was flabbergasted and barely managed to say, ""Wow. Please don't use my disorder to invalidate what I'm saying. That's so disgusting."" (Keep in mind, this is over something I wasn't even disagreeing with him over.)

He doubled-down on it and sarcastically said ""Huh? Huh? What? I'm what? Wow, I'm really worried now, do I need to call you an ambulance?"" 

At this point I just stood up, and said ""Okay, I'm going home until we can have a talk in good faith. I'm going to order an Uber outside.""   
  
Again he doubled-down, ""I don't think that's safe, u/antique-good, I really think I should call you an ambulance, I'm worried about you."" (Again, he's saying this all in a very patronizing and performative way while making incredibly exaggerated faces.) 

I said goodbye and left. Now I really don't know how to proceed cause that was such a low-blow over something I wasn't even disagreeing with and I really don't know what to do. It's been a couple days and haven't heard anything yet. I also want to add that he's previously been rather unsupportive of my mental health journey, when I told him about it originally and that I was in therapy and taking medication, he tried to convince me to do yoga instead because he had a negative experience with a therapist in the past."
888,1,"i’ve been with my current boyfriend for a good long while now, and i just can’t handle it anymore. i can’t handle myself in this relationship. i constantly need reassurance and the jealousy is horrible. i get so jealous over everything, i could envy the bugs he says hi to on his walks. i want to be as unruly as possible so he has a reason to leave and won’t be the bad guy. i feel like i keep holding him to standards he’ll never meet, i keep comparing him to people he’ll never meet. and the presumption of abandonment is terrible, i don’t know how to trust that he will stay. i don’t think i want him to, not with me."
889,2,"hi guys! i’m looking for advice on how to stop feeling the need to obsess over my boyfriends snapscore. i’ve seen his best friends list and he doesn’t snapchat enough people to fill up the list, and i know he only snaps his family and bestfriend and me. i know it’s so immature and i’ve really been working on trying to heal my anxious attachment style and move more maturely in this relationship. my last relationship was 4 years long and it ended with me getting cheated on, so my trust issues are definitely a factor. does anybody have any advice/tips on how to work towards fixing this toxic behavior of mine? i’m so afraid of being cheated on again i just can’t stop the obsessive behavior "
890,1,"Anyone else feel like they have quiet BPD lite? Not explosive, but still constantly stuck on one person/ has romantic obsessions, painfully self-aware, deeply sensitive, intense self-blame, masking everything? Would love to connect with others who experience this more internally."
891,3,"My FP met a guy and they started hanging out (I was usually there because the guy would come to our place). I got major ick vibes from this guy, for many reasons, but I was trying to be supportive, even after the guy latched onto me in an intense and damaging emotional way. 2 weeks go by and I snapped. I got drunk (I know that’s not wise) and screamed at my FP about this guy and why he needed to go. I especially saw red when I heard they’d had sex (combo of disliking the guy, and maybe jealousy to a degree). I didn’t give my friend the chance to speak about his own experience, and just bowled over him with my own feelings. A shitty part is I don’t even remember what I was saying. I felt horrible, and still majorly do. My FP broke things off with the guy, saying it was his choice, but I feel like I bullied him into it and can’t bring myself to trust FP’s words. I keep apologizing even though it’s been 4 weeks and I know I need to stop. I don’t know what damage I did to my friend or our relationship because he doesn’t talk about his feelings, so I’ve been destroying myself internally over this. I hate this disorder and how much it affects my ability to make and keep friends. I also don’t like having an FP because I know it’s exhausting for them and that’s so unfair. Sometimes I feel like I should just isolate and let people live happier lives because I can’t imagine I contribute to that."
892,3,"whenever i get hurt and things blow out of proportion, it's almost always because i just am not in charge of my words or actions. i know what's right, i know what i should say to make it right, i know i should take a step back, but i can't.   
it's almost as if this happens automatically, like someone else is doing all this while i KNOW what i'm doing or saying is wrong. it's exhausting because i know it's me who has to deal with the consequences later, it's me who'll feel disgusted and ashamed and yet i can't stop. i don't know why and i don't know how to stop.   
i know, taking time off, going out for a walk and things like these help. but i physically cannot do anything else which sounds extreme and i so wish it wasn't."
893,1,"I have BPD, but I am more on the quiet side of it and very self-aware. I know that I get super emotional and overthink and it causes me to become paranoid a when I’m really struggling. I also deal with other mental health disorders too. My boyfriend doesn’t pay attention to me. 💔 We just hit our year-anniversary last May. I know it’s not considered a long time to some people. In a relationship, if your man is always playing games and on his phone and mainly shows negative attention is that normal? People with BPD, atleast in my case, often try to give people the benefit of the doubt because I know how it feels to be abandoned, hurt, alone and ignored. But what about when it feels like even when we do our best to manage our symptoms and it’s still not enough? When I feel that I’m going to split I try to get as far away from my partner as I can so I don’t say anything that could potentially make things worse. I feel worthless, hopeless, and unworthy of love because I don’t know if it’s me being an unlovable person or what. Every relationship I’ve been in I’ve gotten hurt and left alone to pick up my own broken heart. Does anybody else have any similar struggles? How did you get through it? Are we cursed and can’t find true love even when we stick around and put up with damn near almost everything but can’t seem to get the same support and love back ? 😭💔🥀"
894,1,"It's starting to not even hurt anymore. It was one simple argument that of course spiraled into a massive blow out, and its like I watched myself ruin something great. I'm not upset at them for anything they said or did, I'm just angry and disappointed in myself."
895,3,"To be honest, it’s more complicated than just that. He doesn’t think we’re over, but I said we were in my 20 messages he didn’t even take time to read and only replied with 6 vague, cold, uncaring messages. I feel like I’m on the verge of going insane: I can’t cry, but I feel like my hearts being ripped apart at the seams every minute of the day. I go to bed feeling horrible and anxious, I wake up feeling worse. It feels like the only time I’m at peace is if I’m unconscious. I can’t take it anymore. My heart, as typing this, is racing with anxiety. I blocked him everywhere except on my iPad, mainly because of the fact I didn’t know I had to also manually block him on different devices of mine. Reading his messages to me and realizing how much he didn’t care, especially in drastic circumstances, made me feel horrid. As if I’m not worthy of love or attention, that I was never worth anything in the first place. He wrote me “I think we might have to break up, I’m going to be busy all summer.” And yet, there’s activity in his socials. He can’t even take the time out of his day to read my messages, ever. Or make time for me and at least say good morning or goodnight, or at least say I love you and check in on me. He hasn’t said I love you since last week, and even when I declared that we’re over, I feel worse than I ever did actually being in the relationship. I’m thinking of texting him “I’m sorry,” and saying that I’ll wait for him. Wait for him until he loves me again or wants to give me attention. I feel like I’m rotting away slowly but surely, and there’s only heartache to feel with no reassurance of tears. I feel nothing but I feel everything simultaneously. I can’t even cry this out, it’s eating me alive. I don’t know what to do. To take him back and apologize - being understanding, or to break it off officially and be what feels more miserable for months or even years. I miss him so much that it physically hurts me. I just don’t want to be alone, all I want to feel is loved. Unconditionally loved like he used to love me. "
896,3,"Hi. I am new to this and have been recently diagnosed. I am at the beginning of my healing journey of learning how to cope and manage my emotions. I am feeling extremely overwhelmed and hopeless because I want to get better. 

I am starting DBT therapy in a month because I got waitlisted and have started with a therapist once a week. I don’t have all the traits but do have extreme BPD rage and splitting on my partner. I feel constantly on edge and agitated over nothing most of the time. I have extreme fear of abandonment and have been suicidal. 
My partner is patient loving, and calm with me but if he does something wrong sometimes (most times than not) I black out and turn vile and later on have no clue what came out of my mouth. I feel fucking awful and want to change more than anything in the world but it feels like it’s not going to happen fast enough and I don’t want to damage my relationship. He’s definitely my “favorite person” because it only happens with him, not my friends or family and not my workspace. I am still trying to understand it.

Again, I just started therapy and waitlisted on my DBT training for a few weeks. 

Can somebody offer me insight on how to prevent splitting or being so destructive? Anything?

And please, can someone please share some hopeful comments on this post? I am at the end of my rope and want to be a functional human but I feel so alone. Thank for reading. "
897,1,"i started lamictal last night combined with lexapro. i'm on the starting dose (25mg) and while my symptoms last night weren't that bad (just a little nausea) today my mood has been way off. i had some dreams last night and one caused me to wake up and start crying. then i was fine for a while. 

but like 20-30 minutes ago i suddenly got depressed over the dream and now i can't stop crying. i don't usually cry this much. it just won't stop. has anyone had this as a side effect, especially when first starting lamictal/mood stabilizers?? 

it's debilitating me. "
898,2,"Hey guys, I need some advice. Lately, I’ve been dealing with rejection after rejection—not outright rejections, but those vague, gray situations where people leave you hanging, neither fully in nor completely out. One after another, and my BPD is making it worse every day. I’m spiraling back into crises I haven’t had in a long time, constantly seeking validation elsewhere. The moment I get shut down, I immediately reach out to someone else—as in literally minutes after saying goodbye to the person in question. I feel desperate. I had improved so much, and now I feel like I’m back at square one, as if the only solution is to shut down my emotions when it comes to love. I feel like I’m losing my mind again (I’m in therapy and on medication).

Has anyone else been through this? How do you deal with it...."
899,2,"I'm fucking lost. I opened up to him and he tried to help but couldn't do much, so we ended the conversation. He told me he wished he could do more to help me. He told me he cared. But now he's distant. He's left me on delivered for over a day on messages and the only other replies I'm getting on Instagram are short and dry.

What happened to our conversations? What happened to calling and doing random shit for fun? What happened to those fast replies and witty ass responses?

When we call or hang out he's fine! Better, even! He's fucking socializing like an extrovert starved for attention and I love it because I get to talk to him. But the second it goes to text, he's dry as fuck.

I don't get it. I don't understand what's wrong. I don't know if I did something wrong. I'm waiting for him to come to me first but I'm terrified that he won't. I love him."
900,3,"Im having a very bad breakdown and idk what to do. I just feel alone and im trying to make new friends and i found a bpd server but i want my irl friends to support me, i dont want internet friends. And sometimes feel like my friends are purposely singling me out because theyre always there for their partners or other friends but when i really need someone to just be a friend and support me, they seem irritated or dismissive. Forget abt family, their hardcore ""mental health isnt a problem"" conservatives. My mom isnt but she just shrugs when i tell her i want to end it. Its making my episodes worse because all i can do is spiral. It makes my anger worse and im starting to get physcial urges like destruction of my stuff. My boyfriend (who i suspect also has bpd) is currently trying to figure out his own mental health so i cant really go to him for anything serious, and right now i kind of shut him out completely and i havent talked to him in 4 days because i just feel too panicked and i feel like he and everyone hates me. I dont understand why i should try in my relationships. They all clearly are sick individuals. I hate them. They act like i know whatim supposed to do when i only just got diagnosed. I barely started meds. Im also in my lates teens nearing my early 20s, so its at its worse. They literally get annoyed when i exhibit any behaviors that isnt ""normal me"" i told my friend, for the first time in years, that i was feeling suicidal. I havent told anyone when i was feeling that way since i was 14 due to extreme abuse from the people around me and she knows that but She gets mad at me. Tells me im not her therapist friend. And hasnt even checked on me. Ive given up"
901,0,Asking in general because there are some things I can’t do after much struggle and some of it is like vaping smoking or anything like that or even dating because I get TOO attached to things that make me feel good and stuff. What are some things that u can’t do? 
902,2,"I wasn't even sure how to flair this because I'm feeling so torn up and awful about everything right now. I did post a few days ago about this but it has got worse so love that for me. 

I've very unfortunately developed a new FP who isn't a big texter and doesn't reply very quickly to me or seem interested in me at all, we've literally only been talking for a week but I'm already obsessed with him and it has massively triggered me. Like I haven't been this bad with my BPD for a few years now. 

Every time he does text me I feel high, super excited, as if everything is falling into place in my life. But then he ignores me, and I think my life is over and that no one will ever love me and that I'm not worthy of love and so on. I've also realised that I can't think of one single man in my life who has ever actually had feelings for me which makes me feel even worse. I've been single for six years so the BPD stereotype of being in and out of relationships all the time isn't for me lol, I just get obsessive crushes that literally crush me. 

I want to sort myself out so I've self-referred to a therapist and I'm trying to cut down on weed too, because right now I don't trust my own thoughts. I'm debating telling him that I have BPD and that I'm messed up over him but he will just leave so I think I should leave first. But he's a friend of a friend so I'll lose those friends as well. And I don't want to talk to our mutual friends about it because they'll tell me to stop talking to him if it's making me this delusional but the thing is it's not him personally it would be anyone I talk to, so I'm just supposed to be single forever? Like, will anyone ever actually love me even though I've got BPD? It doesn't feel like it. 

Part of me thinks I'm self-sabotaging if I tell him now that I've got BPD and us talking is triggering me because it's going to end in us going separate ways. I really don't want that to happen because he's so lovely but also maybe wrong for me if he can't even text me back. But I also feel like he's my last chance at happiness and I thought it was gonna be a sure thing since my friend set us up. But it's literally just shit and I hate myself and I want to say I hate him but I don't think that's true.

you're all going to tell me to stop talking to him i know it and that really sucks because I want to be with him I'm just splitting I think? I honestly don't know which thoughts are rational and which aren't right now so. yeah. okay that's all i think please don't tell me to stop talking to him I know it's prob the right thing to do but i can't bring myself to do it. "
903,2,"Hey all, my partner has pointed out that I tend to struggle with hearing anything difficult about myself or our relationship even when it’s small. This could turn very unhealthy if I don’t nip it in the bud because I don’t want him to start keeping his feelings and opinions from me as that stunts relationship growth. I just thought I’d post here to see if anyone has any tips on hearing difficult things without feeling like a failure, a bad person, or that I ruined the whole relationship. "
904,1,"Hey, it might seem like a silly question, but I mainly just want to relate to some people. I feel so alone being suicidal. 

I was diagnosed with BPD last month but I've clearly been suffering with it for a long time. The last year has been awful for me, I believe I've emotionally traumatised my girlfriend by being suicidal. I mean it's so understandable, I can't imagine the emotional turmoil she's been in, and some of the states she has seen me in. My mother has been helping her out but I don't think she's been as emotionally affected, or doesn't take it as serious, as caring as she is. I just can't handle how this feels. I'm so suicidal and I wish I wasn't, but I'm so so tired. 

How the hell do I live with this? I feel so fucking guilty, I wish my girlfriend didn't have to feel like I'm not telling her the truth, I hate that she feels scared when I leave the house alone, she asks me so many times before I leave if I'm okay and to let her know if I need her. I just feel so terrible, does anyone else? I feel like I can't live with it, and I can't speak to anyone in my life about it. How do I genuinely speak to my loved ones about the fact I still want to kill myself after everything they've done for me this year? I can't do this anymore, I have no one to tell that I want to die. 

I feel like I'm just keeping myself alive, there's a suicide prevention cafe in my area but it's only open 6pm-1am and it's hard for me to ever leave the house so suddenly without concerning my girlfriend."
905,3,"My boyfriend is my favorite person and yesterday he made me split really badly because he did something which triggered me and i thought he was going to replace and abandon me. We had a conversation about it afterwards and he re-assured me really well that he still loves me. Today i still feel really unstable and i feel a lot of weird emotions which i cant describe (a sort of disgust) towards him when he shows me affection or even when we talk. I dont want to feel like this, i really love him and i wouldnt trade him for the world. I feel terrible about it and i dont want to stop loving him. I hate feeling like this and i just want things to go back to normal. Im stressing out over this. Is there any way to stop the feelings of disgust and love him again or will i have to wait?"
906,1,"How do I even stop thinking about him? I know he doesn't think about me as much as i think about him. 

I feel like I'll never have a romantic partner in life, when all I've ever wanted is to take care of someone and have a family. It feels so out of reach, nevermind even having BPD, people find it really hard to commit these days to one person, or at least to me. 

I just wonder what it is about me. What if I come across as boring because I'm shy? What if I'm too intense? Did I do something or say something? What DO I say or do? 

It's so ass and my therapist says I have an obsession. It's so pathetic because I don't want it to be. I always wonder what I can do to be enough during these moments, but at the same time want to just not care. There is no in between and I hate BPD because for me personally my emotions are very black or white, no grey. 

It makes me so sick, not want to do anything, talk to anyone, hear from anyone, eat, be present or awake, when I don't hear from him. He calls me his princess but doesn't treat me like one. Maybe I overthink. It just really destroys me because I mentally check out and cannot focus due to trying to reflect on whether I did something or not. 

I wish I can just be one of those people who don't worry, who have a ""it is what it is,"" mentality, and literally just don't let it affect them. I don't understand and I want that so bad, to just not make a big stink about things but I can't help it. It hurts so bad. All I've ever wanted is for someone to love me. I truly don't know if I'll ever be loved"
907,0,"Tagging this for rule 5 since topic is focusing on fence sitting between regulation and abuse.

I've been using weed for a long time to try and regulate my attitudes and emotions. It has been the only consistent way that has managed to bring me down and help calm me from manic episodes and being extremely keyed up my entire life - from before I had ever even been diagnosed with depression in highschool let alone BPD as an adult. I'm at a point in life where I'm really uncertain what aspects of my symptoms are related to BPD or to other things at this point because I kinda just feel like a bit meddley mixing pot of problems these days that I can never really... identify anything anymore.

i want to spend more time with you, i want to actually feel prioritised like i used to!!!! but i hate you at the same time because it feels like you hate me and your words and actions don't line up. i would be worse off without you but at the same time being with you is breaking me i hate it i hate everything. why can't we just go back to how things were last year? i hate you but i love you but right now i hate you too much to even think about loving you you don't deserve this i am sorry for being like this but can't you just love me more than saying you do. i promised to give you space but it's tearing me apart to do so but i also think if i broke the promise i would lose you forever. i had been doing so well this past week but now i just can't do anything anymore i hate this"

911,1,"Hi, I (23F) was diagnosed last year with quiet bpd & bipolar 2. I was with my boyfriend (33M) for a little over a year, and he stuck through that diagnosis. A little over a week ago, he broke up with me. I’m devastated. I didn’t know what to do, how to feel, how to breathe. I couldn’t get out of bed for days. I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t think. He blocked me on everything. He said he wasn’t happy. I wrote up a letter today to “send” to him as a way to cope.

I kept thinking about what I said and I feel really bad. I went through old texts of ours today and I saw it. The hell I put you through. You did love me. You tried to, at least. We both were just so insecure and didn’t feel like we were enough. I drained you. I get why you left. I should have let you walk away in November. I shouldn’t have kept you in my storm. I shouldn’t have kept you in my emotional spin cycle. I just loved you so much and didn’t want to lose you. You are enough. I’m so sorry I didn’t see it or show it well. I’m so sorry. I was so hard to be with. I wish I could have given you an easy love. I loved you the best way I knew how. You are going to find someone someday that can give you the love that you deserve. You stayed with me far longer than you should have. I wore you out. I drained the life out of you. I see it now. I was so much. I’m so sorry. I’m so, so sorry. I hurt you, a lot. You didn’t deserve that. You gave me more chances than I deserved. Thank you for staying as long as you did. Thank you for loving me, as hard as it was. I know you’re going to find someone that is so special one day. You’ll be so glad you left me and found her. She will be able to bring you happiness. I’m sorry. I really am. I’m toxic and hard to be with. I just can’t accept that other people can love this. No one ever will be able to. I’m going to try to heal, but I can’t do this to someone again. You’re the loss of my life. I’m sorry I broke us. I do struggle with boundaries. I always have. I’m just an overthinker and I think I’ll fix things by talking more or pushing more. I’m sorry. If I could go back in time I never would’ve made you start dating this. I wouldn’t have let you. I’m so sorry. I can’t say that enough. Please know how special you are. I’m sorry I took your light and made you think you weren’t enough. I’ll always wish you the best. I miss you so much.

I love you.

I am feeling a lot of feelings. Guilt, self-hatred, pain and so unlovable. I wanted him so badly, but I was too much. I pushed him away too much. Also as a note, I never yelled or called him mean things or anything like that during my splits. It was just a lot of extreme sadness and thinking we should breakup because he can do better and deserves better. I miss him so much. Does this ever get better? I feel lost. Why is this a thing and why does it exist? It isn’t fair. It doesn’t feel fair at all 💔"
912,3,"hiya, i feel like im losing it. i’m in a quite prestigious master’s programme in the social sciences, and have never been good at statistics. i’ve been falling behind in some courses due to chronic illness and intense therapy (mbt + systems therapy). 

i have a letter from faculty counselors that confirms my need for deadline postponement sometimes, which i was granted last week for today’s deadline. but not before the professor was being invasive about how i’m doing in my studies in general, and shoving all sorts of advice and demotivating crap down my throat. i didn’t dare to counter her because i was scared that she wouldn’t push back my deadline anymore.

today, i have ran into some trouble in my assignment. later than other people, and right on the day of the deadline, but everyone said that this was allowed. yes, i have not made use of the consultation hours, but no, i wasn’t fucking able to!!

i’ve seen this woman answer classmates’ questions on the lecture recordings with all the patience and kindness in the world, yet the emails i receive in response to my troubles are very short and very cryptic, almost as if this is on purpose because i’m late. 

she’s jumping around answering my questions as if to foster a sort of independent problem solving approach on my end, but clearly i’m not fucking able to!! i’m lost! she is the teacher and it’s her job to answer questons when i have them, and pose them to her politely.

i’ve been trying to sit with my emotions for a good while now, but all of those things about ‘riding the wave’ and ‘emotions only last x amount of seconds’ doesn’t feel true. my entire body feels in distress, i feel disappointment in her and in myself, i worry i can’t complete my studies, and i’m raging fucking mad. 


what on earth are people talking about when they say to ‘ride the wave’, i will literally be here all day sulking dude"
913,2,"Hi there! I have a male friend (to me at least), who is a pwBPD and has assumed a kind of protective or nurturing role in relation to me (I can not disclose more than that), for no apparent reason. As usual, he keeps me at an arms lenght, although it is obvious I get to be a part of his life and know him in a way the rest of the social group doesn't. I have accepted his help and his treatment is in no way inappropriate, however I do not understand why he resorts to this, when he could just say he wants to be friends and spend more time together. Since, you know, we kinda are. Maybe I am imagining things, but I have the impression he is using the opportunity to get close to me without actually having to take risks of any sorts. I can not make sence of his actions, since it takes a lot of effort on his side and he demands nothing in return. He is very considerate, careful and attentive towards me. And has failed to provide me with an explanation why he is willing to do all this just for me. He has been flirty with me in the past. "
914,3,"My(24F) FP(31M) is my ex(shocker), he just called me last night after trying to reach out for over a week(I initially called him, but he missed the call, so I took that as a sign), and I finally answered. We talked for almost 12 hours straight, it instantly felt like old times...at least the good parts, it felt natural. We ended things pretty badly almost a year ago, we had our streak of being nasty to each other though. We even reconciled, and he apologized for how he treated me at the end. Things felt different now, we both admitted our year has felt empty without each other and that we can't connect with anyone and never have as much as we have with each other. The issue is, we can't get back to how things were, he doesn't wanna be with me due to how complicated things were between us, and with my attachment issues, he thinks it best we not get close, and stay in a limbo of acquaintances and friends..no label. I want to throw up, this is the only person I have, and I can't be close to him. How do I manage this? I need the closeness, this will be the end of me, but all options feel wrong...after almost a year of no contact, we never felt right. Help."
915,1,"Having a favorite person is so exhausting and creates unnecessary pressure and demand on both sides of the relationship. Trying to dip my toes in the water after self-isolating for so long makes me scared that the moment I connect with somebody, I’ll latch onto them because I care but then become overbearing in the process.

I’ve hid away for so long trying to figure myself out, but I ducked out when people needed me most. At this point, I’ve exhausted my ability to apologize because I can’t explain this fear in a normal context. I create my own loneliness, and I tell myself it’ll always be this way because I bathe in it. I just want to escape this loop, but my existence is weight on others around me. I wish I had the ability to be loved, more than anything "
916,2,"So I recently started dating a wonderful person, I was not looking for a relationship because my ex destroyed me, and i decided to isolate myself bu i unexpectedly feel for someone i met on social media, we began video calling and messaging and i realise very quickly that i had feelings for them, the problem is it is a long distance relationship which i had decided i wouldnt do again as the last time i did long distance it destroyed me. Still, I truly felt like this would be worth it. And it has been going well, and they plan to visit me soon. However, I recently discovered they have become my FP. I always wanted to avoid a romantic partner being my FP, because it usually always destroys the relationship, but it was unexpected, and I fear it may already be too much for them to deal with. i just need advice because i already find myself becoming overly obessive and poessive and jealous over the smallest things and i dont want to lose them because they have truly treated me so well and they make me so happy. I just don't want my BPD destroying something else good in my life.  "
917,1,"For some reason the fact that my mum used to regularly bring me (31M) bread and squash is generally considered to be proof that she must love me. When she was emotionally neglectful my entire childhood then when I went to uni popped up out of nowhere for the first time showing interest in me and I'm all who the fuck are you 
 
I was always totally isolated and my perspective was always overwritten. My mum used to turn the people closest to me against me, favourite teachers and closest friends etc. and when I experienced trauma (like almost drowning among other things) she always just denied that it happened. I first became properly depressed when I was 10 but from her point of view I ""randomly went insane"" while I was at uni because she was paying so little attention to me that on and off for 8 years I was having major depressive episodes under her roof 
 
She continues to try to control me and blame me for everything (""you should have told me you were depressed"" - bitch please it was totally visible also I was 10 and it was 2003 I didn't really know what depression was even though I was experiencing it) and I grew up with her telling me how selfish and evil and overdramatic and lazy and obstinate I was. 
 
Why is my trauma always considered invalid. My experience doesn't count for anything it is only other people's perceptions and judgements that are relevant. Even if my experience and perception of events is real in that it exists in a metaphysical sense and even if it is actually accurate, this does not matter as no-one ever takes it seriously, with regards to my mother or other things, all that matters is how other people see it. I have to obliterate my own perspective to be accepted. 
 
Even in recovery settings where there are trauma informed practices these do not apply to me. I am considered to not be genuinely mentally ill because my trauma is not considered valid, I am considered to just be dramatic, self centred, entitled, and divorced from reality. When other people had shit parents they are met with compassion and the assumption that what they say is true, but I am dismissed and told that I should have more empathy for the parents that completely failed me because they didn't receive an instruction booklet on how to be parents. Even though in my invalid opinion if you are ignoring your 6 year old's near death experiences and screaming that he wants to kill himself that probably shouldn't require a manual to work out that like maybe talk to him for starters "
918,1,"Have you had trouble with this? My wife ended things around Christmas and I’ve been spinning out hard since. It started on the apps, but I recently missed a flight connection and ended up stuck overnight in part of Europe - and shamefully paid escorts too. Since January, I’ve slept with 17 people, several that I had to pay for.

I feel like I desperately want something but I can’t put a label on it. As soon as the sex is over, I don’t want to see the person again. Yet I feel so utterly lonely and like I need to fill some void, but somehow it’s never the right person. 

Any advice available? What’s going on in my subconscious?"
919,3,"hi all, im an ex partner/situationship of someone who has BPD and Bipolar diagnosed, and a cluster of other mental health problems. currently 14 weeks pregnant with a girl :’) and have a medical abortion scheduled in a few days. 

i have known this person for a decade. he’s the sweetest boy and caring and compassionate human. and the. he turns ice cold and ruthless towards me. he’s now claiming i gave him PTSD this time around, that i groomed him, that i am the issue and he never has liked me. that he only stayed with me because it was the right thing to do. 

he’s been screaming for space away from me/no contact but could never give me an explanation as to why. i wanted to know if he needed to work out his own mentality before trying to come back to me or if he needed to just cut me out entirely. i was met with “i don’t knows” and “i don’t like you but i don’t want to lose you”

he has shown no compassion towards me with this pregnancy. i found out three weeks ago and he can’t even emotionally be there for me. i do not know why this is happening and i feel very lost and alone. im aborting mostly for his mental health and well being. there’s no way he could handle any of this going forward with a child. 

he has become brazen, brash, and stone cold to me. he is blase and just doesn’t care. 

im feeling hurt. this isn’t the bot i know. he wants nothing to do with me and wants me to leave him alone, yet wont block me or leave. says he would rather kill himself than leave me. he hates the way he treats me. but continues to say i gave him PTSD. 

i just need comfort. help. guidance. 

i love him dearly. i see he’s sick. but i don’t know how to help or fix or build"
920,3,i can't name a close friend i had that i didn't hate at some point. one day they're everything to me and the best friend i could ever ask for and then they do the most little thing that annoys me and i have to spend 2 weeks trying to hide that they are annoying me and i feel like i need a break from them or ill collapse JESUS how can i stop being like this (i bet its theraphy but ARE THERE ANY TIPS!!!! IM ALR ON THERAPHY!!!!!!!)
921,2,"I have seen the mention that many people avoid weed due to their bpd and that is complete news to me. 
Personally I have experience some more auditory hallucinations while high and I can get a little more anxious or emotional at times but nothing to extreme that would make me avoid it all together more so just consume it in moderations. 
Very curious to know the experience of others so pls share "
922,1,"I need some inspiration 😣 I’m not doing so great lately, I think my body is stuck in survival mode and I just can’t relax or feel anything positive honestly. What do you guys do to get through this? I’m trying to get help and I don’t really know what to do.

Medication wise, I was finally told to stay away from typical antidepressants after trying several. I was stuck on a really addictive one (Effexor) because my previous psych left me for relapsing and it took me three months to find a new provider and I had to ween myself off and it was hell. I’m currently on Wellbutrin, Latuda, Minipress, supposed to be on a mood stabilizer but I’ve been non-compliant and trying to find a different one. 

My current provider theorizes that I’ve been stuck in a depressive state for like a year because Mood stabilizers have probably been suppressing any mania/hypomania (suspected bipolar) but unable to pick me back up from depression. I’ve had zero energy or will for a full year 😭 and the last six months especially have been really brutal I almost didn’t make it. Sometimes I think of just completely detoxing, bc I also struggle with substances, but I’m changing meds all the time and my provider doesn’t want to risk too quick a change 😔 Is there any medicine combo that y’all find particularly helpful?

I haven’t had the time for therapy being a full-time student working my ass off, but now that summer’s here I have the time to look into different therapies and alternative treatments, Im so hopeless trying to find the right meds. Is there anything anyone has done that’s changed their life or really made a big difference? I’ve been in IOP and trying to get back in. My dad is recommending a psychotherapist, I’ve been recommended EMDR but trauma-wise I don’t think I’m ready for that. I think my body and my nervous system is just so exhausted from everything everyday, I need a real breakthrough/reset and I don’t think I can do it by myself.

So I’m curious what type of treatment has really worked for you guys, or honestly anything you’ve experienced that’s really changed things up. I need something real bad thanks guys for any thoughts or ideas 😭"
923,1,"I’ve (29F) been seeing a guy (27) since October. It ended up being nothing but casual. I told myself I was ok with the arrangement. Well, he randomly popped up with a girlfriend with no prior conversation or warning. He’s cut me off, and I’ve been left high and dry. I tried the logical approach of telling myself we never owed each other anything, but I still became obsessed with the situation. I became obsessed with finding out who she was. We live in the same neighborhood so I became obsessed with always looking over at his street to see if her car was there. I’ve become obsessed and have started spiraling over everything they must be doing together. The sex he’s having with her and how much better it must be. 

I’ve lost control mentally and I feel really low, and I currently don’t have a therapist so I’m really trying to pull myself out before I get too depressed. I’ve already stopped eating, but I’m still forcing myself to try and find hobbies and see other people (not specifically sexually, just in general). 

My last therapist had to move on to another clinic and I had reached a point that was good and self aware she told me I didn’t need to be seen anymore anyway because I was doing so good. 

But right now I can’t remember anything we went over, I can’t remember how I grounded myself to reach that point. 

I made this person my favorite person and being ghosted has taken such a toll on my mental health. 

I need someone to walk me back to the light. I’m beating myself up for letting myself get to this point again. "
924,3,"For example, say you’re hanging out with a group of friends. And they bring friends which is okay until it’s not. You start feeling left out in a weird way even though you’re not being left out. You feel out of place like you’re not part of the crowd, and eventually you get so overwhelmed by it that you end up just wanting to leave. "
925,0,"Hi hi

I'm just wondering, when you got your diagnosis, how it was delivered to you?

Did your psych/Dr just lay it all down?

Did they warn you of the stigma?

How long were they reviewing your symptoms before they diagnosed you?

Did they offer much of an explanation or send just name the disorder and send you on your way?
Were they kind about it?

Did they give their reasoning for why you got this particular diagnosis?

Did they misdiagnosed you previously, and if so did they say ""we were wrong"" or just left you hanging over whether the previous dx was accurate?
_____

For me, my psych mentioned BPD as a possibility in my first appointment but I saw so much of myself in it the thought that so much of me could fall under a disorder terrified me. So I done everything in my power to steer him away from a BPD dx. I got a bipolar diagnosis, but eventually I brought up BPD again and admitted I'd been trying NOT to get that diagnosis.

This was after being referred to a second psychiatrist specifically for my bipolar (the initial psychiatrist is more for my addiction) who mentioned I heavily have BPD traits in our first ever appointment, despite me still trying to escape that dx. Upon bringing up BPD again, my psych initially said he felt I couldn't have both bipolar and BPD.

I felt dismissed and never brought up BPD again until one day I went in for an appointment and he said ""I'm treating two parts of you, the biological which is bipolar and the trauma-induced which is BPD"". I was like erm... what now? I thought you said I couldn't have both. He told me after reviewing me, reading over my notes, conferring with my other psych and thinking about what I'd been saying over the past few months he felt confident I had BPD.

So turned out I had the dx, I just didn't know.

He has never once mentioned the stigma of BPD, nor does he seem to hold any stigmatising views about it. It took him about 2 years from my initial appointment to diagnose me, but it was only like 3 months from the time I brought it up again until the dx. He has offered little explanation of the disorder but does work with me on aspects that affect me when I bring them up.

He has been very kind and understanding and I'm planning to ask about his reasoning about why he has diagnosed me with BPD."
926,3,"I don’t know a better word than pushed and I don’t want to come across blaming the other party for my poor emotional regulation skills. But does anyone else just often feel in arguments they just eventually snap into the worst reaction like raising your voice or something (yes I know it’s abusive, it really sucks and I’ve been on the receiving end from my partner before). 

Like it happened today when I admitted wrongdoing and apologised and and acknowledged poor wording and it felt like the issue kept being bought up until I just snapped and felt like nothing I said was even being heard and nothing I did was enough. I absolutely shouldn’t have raised my voice (I apologised for this as well, doesn’t and never makes it okay) but the level of frustration got so bad I ended up crying a ton and slamming my head on my desk to calm myself down (I don’t recommend this).

The scariest part is I never used to be like this. In my prior relationship I never reacted to this level and we did not argue at all to this level (a couple of them but it was very infrequent) but this relationship it feels so frequent. My partner has improved but he used to be quite abusive towards me and now I feel like I’ve become abusive myself and just constantly react in the worst ways? I don’t know I just feel so lost and want to know what others do to try and mitigate this and manage. 

I’m sorry if I come across like condoning any of my behaviours, they’re very not okay and I want to stop them very very much. "
927,1,"How do you guys come to terms with the fact you have no real aspirations or goals for your life? Every job is just doing something to do something. Most of my hobbies come and go, and nothing really gives me fulfillment, and it's exhausting. I hate the idea of living like this forever. I would find fulfillment in relationships (shocker), but I've come to realize it's better for myself and others if I don't get in them, as honestly, I act like how people stereotype people with BPD, and I don't want to do that anymore. I've been through therapy and the self-discovery stuff, but nothing ever clicks... How have you guys found that *it* factor? Am I doomed to live a life of nothingness? "
928,2,"im 15 and im scared if its hormones or it’s normal to obsess over my bsf I used to be jealous since she got attention of people in class although I’m more liked/more attention  like the tiniest attention she gets I would flip and get mad I would start plotting on her downfall which I regret making her cry 5 times however my obsession for her which lasted 7 months stopped after I started seeking validation from boys my age to fill the void of my absent npd father who often only gave conditional love and abandoned many times. 
"
929,2,"idk if its a thing in bpd, or just depression which often co-occurs with bpd, generalized anxiety, or because i am a massive perfectionist and have obsessive-compulsive tendencies, but im wondering if others have anxiety and uncertainty around the most simple decisions like what to eat, wear, or do day-to-day out of being overwhelmed and trying to maximize everything. i have rearranged my room 3 times now in the year and still haven't decided on anything because it feels like i never know what i desire, being overwhelmed by options and trying to always pick the ""right"" decision instead of what i feel. i'm always looking for someone/something else to tell me what is the ""right"" way to go. it kinda feels like part of unstable identity, like i'm confused about my own wants and opinions and just take from somewhere else instead.

anyone else have the same issue?"
930,1,"As the title states, I stopped talking to a match I met on Bumble. We hit it off really well and I fell in love right away. Despite being states away, we would video call almost each night he wasn’t busy and it seemed like the feelings were mutual. But after asking what he thought of me, he stated he goes on dates with people to decide if he likes them, which we obviously couldn’t do despite trying to plan to meet up by the end of the month. I feel heartbroken. I removed him from snapchat because I knew it wasn’t going to work out. I hate my BPD so much. I essentially self-sabotaged when I asked this question. We were going to talk it out on Thursday too. I’m just so heartbroken because I’ve never had a guy like me back before."
931,1,Hi I just need to rant because I have no friends and I feel really alone and vulnerable right now.. I went off on my mom just now. This is the second day in a row and both days I said really really hurtful things. Yesterday she called me overly sensitive because I get mad and sad easy and I called her sensitive for being mad at my dad for cheating on her (he watches x rated stuff) and then she called me sensitive for not being able to get comfortable enough with my ex to get intimate. And then today was her and dad's anniversary and in two days is the one year anniversary of my grandma dying. She decided to randomly go on a trip and stay at her friend's house today and won't be back until the anniversary of when my grandma died. Both of those things just made me go ballistic. I went off saying she's selfish she doesn't love us and that I hate her. She said she's just protecting herself but I can't handle the relationship abuse between her and my dad anymore. I'm mentally like 7 but age 22 by the way. My mental level ranges depending on the situation. I just feel so alone right now. So stuck and sad and I don't know what to do. I want to do reckless things and I just wish I could disappear. I miss my grandma. She was the only person who ever showed her love for me and who treated me like an equal and it's so hard without her. I wish my mom would show me the love I crave so badly. That's the end of my rant thanks. I need a hug 
932,1,"(19 F). that's all I guess I can say. I just feel so bored, empty, and nothing feels real. there's like this deep dark hole inside of me that feels unfixable. I just wish life was better. I wish I had a car so I could go off and go to the movies, or hook up with someone and get high or just run away and leave whenever I can. without having to take a lyft or the bus. but I don't even know how to drive. I just have to stay stuck in this unstable, boring, miserable, unfulfilling young adult life because that's all being an adult feels like so far. I dont have enough money yet (just started a new job) to have my own apartment, or even for insurance. friendships are shaky, family sucks, can't even bother dating - the person I love just sees me as fwb and likes someone else. and truthfully speaking, who am I to date someone in this state? broke as shit, mental and physical health on the constant decline. all I have going for me now is this cashier job and this other art project I'm working on for someone. Im just soooo bored and so so empty. just a deep, dark pit of emptiness and nothingness. I wish life always felt as good as the intense impulsive escapist moments I have but it doesnt :("
933,0,"I’m (18M) and I just wanted to know if this was normal, I have been diagnosed with BPD and a bunch of other diagnosis that may connect to this, but I have a really hard time feeling empathy for others sometimes. Like I could lie, cheat, or steal and not feel bad about it. (Which I just wanna say that I don’t because my dad raised me better than that.) but it’s just the fact that I could and not feel bad. But there’s also other times where I feel too much empathy. Like if i my past a homeless man up and not give him money, I might go home and feel depressed about it all day feeling like I could’ve done something. Like I used to feel genuinely guilty because one time I yelled at a kid on a game just because I was having a bad day. And when I explained it to one of my friends at the time, they looked at me like it wasn’t that big of a deal, like they understood that I felt bad, but thought I was feeling too bad??  
I just want to know that I’m not completely crazy lol "
934,2,"I'm on the waiting list for treatment. But really my relationships are good now, things tend to flare up every few years, but I have good friendships and a relationship with a great guy who is really supportive and consistent. I've had to work really hard with a lot of opposite action, but it's mostly ok. I will cry to my partner that I'm not coping but won't yell or blame him. My last fp relationship with a friend seems to have settled to something calmer end of last year with a lot of opposite action so I didn't lose him and then radical acceptance that he couldn't show up consistently. 

But the inside of my head is painful most of the time with loud loud thoughts, SI but no plans, and emotional dysregulation. 

Instead of feeling proud of getting to this point I just feel guilty like I cheated and don't deserve support because I don't meet the criteria and worry I played up my problems to get on the list. But also worried if I don't get support I might never feel ok. 

Does anyone else get this? Is it just self invalidation? Or something else? "
935,1,"We have been messaging everyday for 3 months now and I havent heard from her for over 3 days. It has been a rough 3 days. I skipped work yesterday and spent the whole day in bed crying and thinking about her. I've had pretty dark thoughts but have managed to stay clean from sh for over a year now.

  
I miss her so bad my heart hurts, the voices in my head have calmed down. Please come back ..."
936,2,"My bf was gone to another city for 2 days and didn't talk to me at all, late replies, dry texts and what not. It was utter hell for me, I kept telling myself he must be busy, he is not obliged to text me. Last night I was so sad that I finally told him how sad him being distant is making me, and he was back to being like how he was before, told me things that I wanted to hear and what not. I still don't feel good, why did I have to make myself so miserable to get a little attention, had he told me he was busy and I am still on his mind, I wouldn't be like this. Of course I told him to do that next time. I just don't know how to make myself feel good again. How to accept the fact that he ignored me while I was dying for some attention. This isn't the first time this has happened, I thought being aware of myself would change things but it didn't. The worst part is losing a sense of reality, is it just my mind overreacting or was he actually cold and distant. How do you tell the two apart."
937,1,"once again I'm alone and cutting myself and being unable to eat properly and the medication seems useless (even though I keep taking it regularly). I'm tired of people saying stuff like ""I have mixed feelings"" and ""I care about you but we can't be together"". fucking everyone has mixed feelings, I don't choose to abandon my partners because of it. I commit. I love people. I hate being alone. how's that not universal? isn't this just how everyone feels? why would you abandon someone you love, even though you KNOW you still love them? all I want is someone who understands me, who loves me and stays with me despite everything. I'm fucked up and I know being close to me when I split can be stressful but I don't want to be alone. I've had stable relationships before, I know I'm not that ugly or that stupid or that boring. it's simply not possible that so many people love me AND choose to abandon me. I feel like trash. I feel like people like me and then get disillusioned when they see I'm trash. fuck this. I'm tired of being abandoned and I even consider isolating myself completely and trying to avoid all people and just live the rest of my life alone. but I can't even do that because of this fucking disease and my NEED for external approval and acceptance. I can't live without someone who cares about me and takes care and lets me take care of them. I just wanted to be reborn as literally anything else. a fucking cat or a tree or just nothing. anything that can't have BPD and can't feel the deception of other people"
938,1,"It kinda feels the same as splitting on other people.
If i do something wrong suddenly im disgusting, stupid, ugly. If i were to date myself id def throw a huge ""i never loved you"" argument whenever this happened. Its like splitting but internalised.

XD "
939,2,"Context: I have BPD
I also have Severe PTSD

DO NOT JUDGE ME IMMEDIATELY FOR HAVING BPD PLEASE READ I KNOW THERES A STIGMA BEHIND IT!

I am pretty normal and very self aware. I don’t have extreme emotional outbursts, I don’t manipulate via guilt tripping prior, I quit self harming for 2 years (expect once when my mom got diagnosed with cancer last may and I caused strain in my relationship since I promised not to self harming but did it anyway) I am terrified of abandonment 
(I’m a person why is considered “high functioning” to most people unless if they really know what’s behind the scenes)

Prior to the breakup I was getting suicidal after feeling “stuck” in life, sexual abuse related PTSD flare ups, and contempt in our relationship (I was targeted by contempt) and contempt by my mom I was also visibly deteriorating from the outside appearance 

I lash out at my girlfriend at the time

She starts to pull away without any explanation I’m EXTREMELY scared of abandonment so I ask her “do you still want me in your life” to no response she waited 4 days with no explanation to breakup with me 

Initially I take the breakup very well I don’t beg, I don’t threaten suicide, I feel “calm” even “relief” temporarily that I got a response 

We’re on “good terms” initially and there’s “hope” suddenly I’m ghosted without any explanation then I’m smeared and mocked by her and her friends and I am extremely confused 
I was already suicidal and this didn’t help
So I start posting suicidal TikToks on my feed (I’m in psychosis I didn’t sleep in 3 days due to shock of what happened)

She is extremely scared she has a dream I kill myself and asks my friend to check up on me 

(When I attempted suicide  I was completely quiet I nuked all my social media, I lied to my parents saying I was “ok” so they can leave me alone, but I had a mental breakdown in school I get sent home lie again saying “I’m ok” then I pick up a gun and try to shoot myself home alone)

She suspects I tried to kill myself
 I tell the truth 10 days later I say “this is not your fault” “I’m too mentally unstable for a relationship” and details how I did it (as she asked to know if I was genuine or not)
The next day I initiated  no contact so both of us can heal 

I spiral extremely heavily and become suicidal again off the shame of my attempt and the trauma it caused on both of us 

She learned a month later I was diagnosed with BPD and PTSD by a friend 

Still to this very day 4 months later I wake up with nightmares of my attempt and guilt of what happened 

(Btw the reason why i didn’t go to the ER, is that I do NOT trust my parents at all with my mental health and they weaponized it saying “if you get admitted you’ll never become a doctor”)"
940,3,"I put the flair as a success story because so far I have always done everything in my power to stay in relationships no matter how toxic they were or how abusive they got. My fear of abandonment never let me leave no matter how bad it got. This time I broke it up. I tried to write this post yesterday but it was too fresh, so I'm writing it now. He wasn't abusive, he was (what I thought at the time) the perfect one. He wasn't my FP, he was my boyfriend who cared a lot about me. 

Turns out, he's financially irresponsible and wanted me to take care of his debts. Even though I'm suffering from several mental disorders and have just found a job that I work part-time. He still owes me money. Also, he is 40 years old and in debt, yet he spends all his money on coffees and take-outs. He lives above his means and then complains how he's broke. I didn't know about all of this until we had a fight over me wanting to buy some makeup, and he revealed his true colors and everything beneath. 

I'm still grieving. I'm still shattered. But for the first time ever, I broke away from someone who was starting to get abusive (he wanted to control my finances). It's a small success coupled with so, so much devastating pain... Thank you for reading."
941,1,how do i stop suicidal ideation i literally cannot stop seeing it as the only way out every single time i get triggered i relapse its not even funny anymore i literally don’t know what to do i have so many stuff to better myself at but those paranoid thoughts don’t let me function properly i’m very sick physically too because of it.
942,2,"Hi everyone,
I (F22) have been living with my husband (M22) for about three months now, though we’ve been together for longer. When I first moved in, he gave me a silver bracelet as a gift. It was sweet and meaningful at the time. About three weeks ago, he randomly handed me the receipt for it. I didn’t pay much attention to it at first—just said thank you and moved on.

But one evening, I looked at the receipt again more closely. That’s when I noticed that the client name on it wasn’t his—it was a woman’s name. I brushed it off initially, thinking maybe it was just the store employee’s name. But then I realized I had seen that name before… on his phone.

When I asked him about it, his reaction immediately set off alarms. He looked visibly stressed and tried to lie, telling me he found a fake receipt on Google and printed it so I’d believe the bracelet was real silver. (??) I told him I didn’t care about whether it was real silver or not—I cared about honesty. Eventually, after I pushed, he admitted the truth:

She’s a secretary at his company. She offered to pick something up from the mall for him, and he gave her the money to buy the bracelet. He never told me about this, never mentioned her before, and had previously claimed that all the women at his workplace were ""old ladies."" That obviously wasn’t true.

I asked him to text her and ask why her name was on the receipt, not his or mine. She responded that she didn’t think it was a ""big deal"" and just used her name to collect points on her store account. (It was a €25 item—barely any points to gain.) She never called him to ask for my name, even though it would have taken two seconds.

I ended up texting her myself. I told her how unprofessional and disrespectful it was, and that she should have at least clarified the name with my husband. She gave me a long message saying she’s been married 11 years, has 3 kids, and trusts her husband. She claimed it was just a small thing and didn’t mean to cause trouble. Then she said she didn’t know either my first or last name… which confused and offended me, since I share the same last name as my husband.

After that, she stopped responding to me completely.
My husband did nothing. He didn’t follow up with her, didn’t hold her accountable, didn’t stand up for me.

Fast forward to yesterday: I checked his phone and found out he had deleted some photos from the company WhatsApp group. Photos she had posted of herself at the beach—with colleagues around—wearing a bikini and clearly showing her breasts. I had to re-download them to even see what was deleted.

He claimed he deleted them because he ""didn’t care"" and that he didn’t want to see them. But the lying and hiding is what broke me again. He had told me she was ""old"" and made it sound like no one young worked there—another lie. I’ve now learned there’s at least one more young female colleague he never mentioned.

When I brought all of this up again, he said he talked to her about the receipt incident, but then said he “doesn’t remember” what she said back. Later he changed his story and said she replied, but he forgot what it was. I don’t believe any of it.

I’m heartbroken and confused. I feel like I keep trying to trust him, and he keeps feeding me lies. I know nothing “huge” may have happened between them, but all the secrecy, downplaying, and disrespect are starting to feel like death by a thousand cuts.
Since I have bpd i struggle to process my feelings quickly and move on... I raged and crushed down in front of him he laughed and said I'm OVERREACTING and I need meds cause he can't help me anymore.
I don’t know what to do anymore. Am I overreacting? Is this a red flag or just a stupid misunderstanding? How do I rebuild trust when the foundation feels this shaky?

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you for reading"
