7,0,"I have something to share, after having debilitating pain for more than a year and having misdiagnosis to what was causing it, I finally got a correct diagnosis. I have had so many tests done that I have this folder just full of medical test results. 
My hidascan results showed 80% and I was told that was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù by the doctor who ordered the test said he doesn‚Äôt do surgery until 85% and the report even said normal. 
Keep in mind, I have been in 24/7 pain. It was so bad at first that I never got out of bed and my hair would Matt to my head and I‚Äôd end up in the ER being given morphine, multiple times because I could take it anymore. I gained a bunch of weight too. It was thought to be ulcers, and I do have ulcers and even have pics of them in this folder from a camera they shoved down my throat, but they weren‚Äôt bad enough to cause the amount of pain I was in.  When I got put on an IBS med and anti acids and changed my diet the pain went down significantly so I could function and move and brush my hair. but I was still in pain and fat and miserable. 
I went back to the doctor who referred me to the GI doc to get all these tests done and he asked me what my hidascan results said and I told him ‚Äú80% but he said they don‚Äôt do surgery until 85%‚Äù the doctor said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs absurd, I‚Äôm sending you to a surgeon with your hidascan results.‚Äù I got my gallbladder out yesterday, and besides the fact that my incisions itch like hell, the pain that‚Äôs obviously from the surgery itself.. i am literally euphoric because that pain is GONE. The constant aching that shot deep into my back, it‚Äôs GONE and I‚Äôm crying! I cannot believe that even when I got a correct diagnosis of an overactive gallbladder that I was told it was normal WTF! I‚Äôm gonna go find that report and show it to y‚Äôall too. 
The only good things that came out of this was that I found out I had a few other health issues, something‚Äôs wrong with my liver and that was the first thing I was told that was causing my pain, it‚Äôs not. and then they found ulcers. that‚Äôs clearly not the pain either. The entire time it was that PIECE OF CRAP GALLBLADDER!! now that it‚Äôs gone my life can go back to normal!"

My mom went to school with this girl, who was in a grade lower and every day during lunch she and her friends would always see this girl crying under a tree so one day decided to talk to her and offer her some of their food because she never came to school with anything to eat eventually they did this everyday. But my mom and her friends were still curious about why she never had food or why she was always crying and after the girl felt comfortable she began to tell them what was happening 

She said her mom died a few months ago and her dad married a woman who had two daughters already and her dad took away her inheritance and gave it to her step mom who shared it with her kids not giving her anything, they took away her room and stuffs and made her sleep outside everyday with no blanket or warm clothes, if she complained her step mom would accuse her of something and her dad would beat her, she had no say and they barely gave her anything to eat

My mom felt bad but she knew she couldn‚Äôt do anything because they were in elementary school so she told her mom and her parents decided to double my mom‚Äôs lunch so she could give the girl 

More than 40years Later and they are still best friends. That poor girl who was treated badly grew up to became a multi-millionaire and her step mom and dad and step siblings are now begging her for help, they aren‚Äôt rich anymore they thought they would he rich forever and my mom‚Äôs friend has the purest heart when she was poor, any money she got she shared it with people, she would cook and share it to the homeless kids around, she barely had enough for herself but she was always willing to share no matter how little she had. No one imagined she would become this rich because she didn‚Äôt even finish highschool so people thought she would remain poor forever 

When she got rich she built a huge farm and a primary and secondary school. Where everything grown in that farm is shared out for free she doesn‚Äôt make money off of it and the school she built is also free and every year she pays for Atleast 2 people to travel outside the country for hajj . Last time we went for hajj, she paid for 10 people including herself and gave everyone extra money for spending $500 dollars each. She said now that I have more I can give more. Money didn‚Äôt change her. I guess money doesn‚Äôt change people, people choose to change because of money 

But recently my mom said she doesn‚Äôt give as much not because she is changing but because she has had so many people cheat and use her over the years that she is now feels like everyone that comes with a sub story is lying to her. Her farm and school are still free and she still sends people for hajj but as for giving money to anyone who comes with a sub story has reduced. Now she has to make  sure you aren‚Äôt lying. 

She and my mom stayed friends this long because they both have similar personalities even though my mom isn‚Äôt as rich as her, my mom is always willing to help others and she helps my mom alot because she said when she was struggling and everyone was treating her badly my mom was always there for her and she feels like she can never repay my mom but to thank her for always supporting her since they were kids. She told my mom that even when your husband told you to avoid me that I was evil, you choose to go against him for me even though you knew it might cost you your marriage, when everyone called me a witch you defended me and was the only one that stayed by my side and you were the first person that every gave me a gift in my life. My mom said she Cried when she said all this because she didn‚Äôt know it meant so much to her she just thought it was the right thing to do. And she told my mom even though I have money now, you still buy gifts for me and my kids all the time, no one else does because everybody thinks I have everything so I don‚Äôt need gifts or my kids don‚Äôt need gifts.

Oh and irony of things is my dad that Accused her of being evil. Now collects money from her and asks her for help lol "

20,0,One time in highschool i found a kid's wallet. I was walking in thr hall with my friend Amanda and noticed a marvel wallet on the ground and I picked it up. It had the kid's school id and like 40$ cash in it. My friend said I should take the money and turn in the wallet. I didn't I worked a lot in high school and middle school (i come from a poor family) so I learned to appreciate my money and someone else's and turned in the wallet with the cash. A few days later i was in a class where I had beef with the teacher cause he was pretty much a egotistical jerk. One of the assistant principals came in and asked if i was in the class. The jerk teacher smiled thinking i was in trouble and said yeah he's right here. The AP came over to me and handy me a note and said I wanted to thank you personally and so did the student who's wallet you found. He wrote you this note and just wanted to say thank you for not only turning in the wallet but the cash and everything else that was in there. Most people would have taken the cash but that shows you have really good character as a person. I said thank you and it was no biggie. The teacher'ss smile quickly went to a scornful look as he realizedIi was being praised instead of Reprimanded for something bad. All in all it felt nice to do something good and get to burn that teacher a little.
21,0,"A little background. My sister decided to relocate to where I live and is staying with me temporarily. On her trip home on the Greyhound Busline, she was told by her driver not to transfer her bags because she was rebording the same bus. Well she wasn't. These Baggs had momentos from her deceased mother. Irreplaceable items. We thought they were lost forever. 

I know there are so many stories about Greyhound and people never receiving lost luggage. Today, our lost luggage was found and returned to us after 12 days. I feel like it's a Miracle. But I want people to know it does happen. 

We did all the appropriate actions. We filled out the form online. Called all the stations that could be involved. I truly believe it was the Angels who work at our local station that made this happen. 

It may not happen often. But the luggage that got left behind, and not transferred correctly. Safely made it home!"
22,0,"My daughter (16) told me that she wanted to have kids when she was older even though she‚Äôs always told me she doesn‚Äôt like children all that much. (For some background- she struggled a lot with self love, anxiety, and depression in the past, but she has worked on herself and made herself better and told me that she loves herself more than anything now, which I love.) So back to the story, I asked her why she would have kids if she doesn‚Äôt like them, and her answer made me so proud. She said, ‚Äúbecause this world needs more people like me.‚Äù I had never been so proud to hear that from her. She is a great kid and so genuine and down to earth, and I am so happy to be her mom."

I went and got him a huge backpack and filled it. Underwear, socks, shoes (cause he didn‚Äôt have socks or shoes), new sweatpants, tshirts, a jacket, all the essentials you‚Äôd need. And a sleeping bag. 
Then I couldn‚Äôt find him for 3 days. 3 days of searching up and down my city to find him and then tonight I found him. At a red light I saw him sleeping on the sidewalk in his usual spot. I ran and gave him everything. Not even a 10 second interaction.

After many of you mentioned some of the anxiety symptoms can be hard to differentiate from coronavirus related symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations are just 3 examples), we realized intense anxiety can, in some cases, cause similar symptoms to COVID-19, creating confusion, often leading to even more anxiety.

31,0,"Growing up I was always a hopeless romantic - as a little girl I crushed on all the guys and believed in true love like you see in the movies. I am now in a place where I've found someone I genuinely appreciate, love, and enjoy spending time with, and I'm lucky enough that he feels the same way. We have a 10 year age difference, him being older than I, and he had previously been engaged - so he's winning the experience game! We have been dating for 9 months, and there is a lot of pressure from his family since all his siblings are married and have kids of their own.

With that background, I am thinking through a lot of those 'next steps,' and feel in my naivety I thought that when I found the ""one"" I'd just know, that there would be this beam of light and an overwhelming feeling of YES! While I've had lots of quiet little moments of 'yes', it hasn't been the screaming, butterfly inducing, backflips, taking my Pinterest wedding boards out kind of yes. 

Tell me a little bit about how you found your YES!, or how you knew that was or was not your person. 
This hopeless romantic needs to know if that big YES is still out there..."

And I‚Äôm just gonna get the the point. One day I was eating ice cream minding my business and I felt blood pouring in my mouth so I ran to the kitchen sink, blood was pouring out my mouth for like 7 minutes straight. And when I say pouring, i mean POURING. Like it was a waterfall of blood coming out my mouth. And I just wanna know, has ANYONE had this happen?"
37,0,"They were dropping like hail into nearly every yard and house in my neighborhood of track homes, except for ours.   You might wonder why not ours? At the time, I was only nine years old, but I knew ALL the answers. WHY, HOW, WHAT, AND WHEN!  I knew where they came from and where they originated.  I even knew the culprit.  It went on for over a month.   But then, the constant slamming on roofs and spooking of pets ended as abruptly as it had begun.  There was no mention of this strange phenomena in the newspapers or on television.  No one was injured.  There were no police reports.  Nowhere else in the world was it happening.  No one ever spoke about it.  I doubt that even Area 51 knew about this occurrence.  It was the early 1950's, and there had been many so-called alien sightings, but there were no flying saucers insight.  So, how was I so privy to these happenings? 

&#x200B;

The year was 1951.  The locale was sunny Southern California, 30+ miles east of Los Angeles.  It was spring and there hadn't been a single drop of rain for months.  So, there was no hail in sight, but something was dropping onto the near-by yards.  No one could see it coming because it was random.  I was responsible, but this was 68 years ago, so don't hold me to the  ""dropping like hail"" comment.  My mind was often a hodgepodge of thoughts---Mickey Mantle, Pee Wee Reese, Jackie Robinson, Stan Musical, Ted Williams.  I was throwing an old tennis ball, that no respectable dog would chase, against the garage door and fielding the bounces. 

&#x200B;

 My neighbors were super and never complained as I did this for up to an hour at a time.  Then, it happened!  Mom and Dad came outside and said, ""We are going to Woolworth's.  Do you want to go?""  And there you have it,  Woolworth was the culprit.  Without Woolworth, none of this would have happened.  It was that five and dime's fault.  I just had a small part.  I was young and innocent.   They knew I had an active imagination and would quickly put it to use.  Keep in mind that I had no evil intentions and was unaware of what could have happened. 

 

Woolworth was the 99 cent store of the 1950s.  It was before Pick-and-Save, but only better.  It was affordable and fun.  Average Americans could buy all types of things: underwear, socks, yo-yos, locks,  nail polish, pet supplies, car wax; you name it! There was an aisle that had many trinkets for kids---Mexican jumping beans, puzzles, cards, magic tricks, and board games, etc. This is where I would spend most of my time.   And there was even a lunch counter where you could order burgers, fries, ""real"" malts, and ice cream sodas.  Some waitresses might even call you ""hun.""  

&#x200B;

Dad came over and found me looking for yo-yo string.  Grabbing my arm, he guided me to the end of another aisle where there was a large keg with metal straps around it.  It couldn't be filled with beer, could it? Naw, not in Woolworths.  I could see a sign stuck to it that said, ""One handful for one cent"".  Dad gave me a dime and sent me on ahead to discover the ""hail"".  In a few seconds, Woolworth would have my eyes bulging,  mouth agape, and wishing I had bigger hands.   Paper lunch type bags were on a stand next to the barrel.  The barrel was filled to the top.  I asked my Dad if he would use his hand but he pointed to a sign that said for 10 year-olds and under.  I'd have to come back another time and make it soon before others find out about the barrel of marbles.  

&#x200B;

 I would fill my pockets every morning with them and rush to school where my friends and I would play marble games for ""keepsies"", such as ""Poison"".  We would lag them to see who could get closest to a line, and we would draw circles in the dirt playground, ante a few, and try to shoot them out.  But, when summer came, there weren't enough kids to play these marble games.  Alone, and with a stockpile of marbles, my imagination went to work. 

&#x200B;

A saw, a piece of sandpaper, an old mop, some black electrical tape, and three large Quaker Oats containers filled with Woolworth's marbles, and it was nearly game time.   I sawed off the end of the mop to the approximate length of a baseball bat, used the sticky black tape for the grip, sanded the tip of the mop to make it smooth, and got the baseballs ready.   My backyard was Dodger Stadium, and fans were filling the imaginary seats.  Vin Scully, myself, of course,  would be the announcer.   Kids always called the game they were playing--baseball and basketball alike.  

&#x200B;

Last year there was one of the best television commercials that was ever written.  It was about a ten-year-old boy who was carrying a bat, a bucket of baseballs, and his glove onto an empty baseball field where he was about to let his imagination go wild.  He could have been me 70 years ago.  Perhaps, the writers were in the stadium that my mind had built in my backyard seven decades ago.  Maybe I should get residuals--just kidding!  Great writers,  terrific kid actor! The commercial was titled ""Optimism.""

&#x200B;

Standing at home plate, he announces that he was, ""the greatest hitter in the world.""  Tossing the ball up, he swung and missed it as it dropped.  Not discouraged, he said, ""strike one!""  A second toss and miss, and as the umpire might yell, he proclaimed, ""strike two!""  He spat in his hands, rubbed them together, and waited for the third pitch.  Taking a mighty swing he missed again, and dropping his head declared, ""STRIKE THREE!""  But then, his eyes lit up, his head raised, and he loudly announced that he was ""the greatest pitcher in the world!""  He had what we all need--OPTIMISM.   I was optimistic as well but in a different way.  I guess I won't be getting residuals now.

&#x200B;

Where did I get the idea that I could throw a marble up and hit it with a mop handle?  I played my game.  Strike one, strike two, strike three!  A small marble, a super-thin baseball bat, and a lot of optimism led me to try again.  Strike one, strike two, strike three--Strike one, strike two, strike three.  Again and again, I struck out.  Who was this pitcher on the mound?  He was going to throw a no-hitter, and he did!.  The way I was going, I would need only one marble.   Was I going to be traded, or sent down to the minors?  I will just have to try tomorrow.  Strike one, strike two, strike three.  I had better be a terrific fielder because I was not going to make it as a hitter.  

&#x200B;

And then, it happened.  After striking out hundreds of times, I got a piece of the marble.  It had to be a foul ball or a ground out.  I began to make contact more often than I missed.  Soon, I was calling the shots.  This one is going over center field, that one is being pulled to left field, and right field was easy.  I was hitting marbles over our house, over the garages north and south of me.  Hail was falling everywhere!  I made contact maybe 90% of the time.  I imagined myself as Babe Ruth when he stepped to the plate and pointed to center field.  He was saying that he was going to hit the ball over the center-field fence and out of Yankee stadium.  He was doing this for a boy in the hospital.   And he proceeded to do so.  I was now calling my shots.  I never thought about where the hail ""might"" land.  Three oatmeal boxes were now empty and summer was over.  I had to have been an optimist too, for I never thought about quitting. 

&#x200B;

The boy in the commercial became a great pitcher, but I became a great hitter.  I could have made money betting with other kids and adults that I could hit a marble with a mop handle."

42,0,"""What!?"", my 20-year-old grandson said without looking up, but I had already closed the door to the computer/music room.  I was baiting him.  He had heard me but wasn't really listening.  He would only get part of what I had said.  Like so many of the young, he was totally absorbed in an online game.  I could have said that the sky was falling or I'm having a heart attack, and he would have grunted something like ""I'll check it out in a few minutes.""  What is the old saying?--Curiosity killed the Cat!  I had just opened the door for two seconds, made a startling statement, and left.  He barely had time to say ""What!"" as he continued to stare at the screen in deep concentration.  Still, I had him.  I had won!  He just didn't know it yet!

&#x200B;

He must be having a difficult time staying focused on his game because his brain cells had to be running amuck. They had to be circling the wagon train.  Soon they would be scattering as the cavalry was about to attack again.  I was the cavalry and a few minutes had now passed.  He will not be able to concentrate on his game.  

&#x200B;

Opening the door just a few inches, I said, ""Did you know that your 'great Uncle' was a gun runner?""  What? Who? Wait? WHAT?  The second attack was perfect.  It was quick and painless.  He will have to surrender now!  Victory was mine, and it felt good! 

&#x200B;

""Grandpa!"" he yelled.  But I was now in another room pretending not to hear him.  I waited to savor the moment when he would round the family room corner on hands and knees to beg me to explain my unusual comment.  I waited, but he did not come.  Where was he?  I crept down the hallway and opened his door about an inch.  He was playing his game again.  I had not won, YET!  I was going to have to go to the ""Big Guns.""  That game of his was powerful, all-consuming.  I DIDN'T want to do this!  I was going to have to tell him a family secret, a secret that would not be found in a search into Ancestry.  The third invasion begins now!

&#x200B;

This time I burst through the door and announced that his great uncle had once told me that he had been in almost every jail, detention center, and prison in Iowa.  My grandson turned and looked at me.  His eyes were glazed, and he seemed unresponsive.  Finally, I had won... or had the game done this to him because he slowly turned back to the screen and, without blinking, picked up the controller, murmured ""runner"" and ""jail"", and began to shoot at monsters again.  Had I lost him to technology or can he still be saved?  I wanted to have a conversation with him.  I wanted him to ask questions about my life and about the lives of other family members before we were no longer here.  Kids need to talk to the elderly.  There are many stories that will go lost if they don't.  The elderly are living history books.  Just find out how to open them up, and they will entertain you with their past adventures.   It will be a win-win!  Must regroup. Can't quit now!

&#x200B;

Did I just see him blink?  His head was beginning to jerk.  ""Did you say something about my great uncle and a gun?""  It's alive!  No holding back now, attack, attack, attack.  Take no prisoners!  It was the moment of reckoning.  Full speed ahead.

&#x200B;

 I continued.  ""A  crime had been committed and your great uncle was the prime suspect.   Empty cartridges were found at the scene.  Two boxes that held the bullets were lying on the ground near the scene, and on the bottom of the boxes was his full name in his own handwriting.  Talk about stupid criminals!  The officer immediately knew who it was and where he lived.  When Uncle E.  answered the door, the officer said that he had a few questions for him.  Your great uncle had been taking flying lessons at the small local airport and wondered if he had enough to fly solo.  He would never find out"".

&#x200B;

""What!  No! I don't believe it!  How could that have happened?  Was he handcuffed?  How long was he in jail?  Did he plead guilty?  Was it in the newspaper?  Did he escape?  How old was he?  Why did he do it?  Did anyone get hurt?  Was he planning on flying to an exotic island?  NO, No, Nooo!!""  ""What"", I said.  ""I have to go to the grocery store and get some ice cream.""  ""Grandpa, please,"" he moaned.  I won, I won, I won!  Age beats youth again!  I had his attention.  The cavalry was victorious.  And as the late Paul Harvey would say; Now for the rest of the story!

&#x200B;

1.  Uncle E.(he did not want me to use his name) was just a teenager and had bought a small hunting rifle for $5  from an old farmer and used it to shoot at tin cans.  A boy in town offered $10 for the rifle.  It was a 100% profit in a week.  This was a lot of money to a boy at that time.  So, he bought a couple more rifles and doubled his money as well.  This was the extent of his gun running.  But, now I had my grandson's attention.  Uncle E. told me he has had one gun for 35 years and has never shot it once--Not much of a gun runner.  But, I was winning.

&#x200B;

2.  He was in many jails in the state, but not as a prisoner.  After he had retired,  he would ride along with a marshal friend of his when a prisoner had to be transported to an upcoming trial or to another lock-up.  The trip might take 2-3 hours each way.  These prisoners were never the violent type, and he was just asked to go with his marshal friend to keep him company.  Because Uncle E. was talkative and friendly,  the prisoners would often talk about their lives in crime.   E. would meet interesting people and have many great stories to tell.  He could fascinate anyone for hours with these stories.  He was a storyteller par excellence.   His great-grandson needed to know about his great uncle's life.  I had him now!  I was winning.  ""But grandpa, what about the empty cartridge box with his name written on the bottom found at the crime scene?  Wasn't he arrested?""  Now I had him!

  

3.  Yes, his full name was on the bottom of the two boxes.  He had a few boxes at his house with ammo for his twenty-two.  In the 1940s, people seldom locked their houses at night in small towns.  Someone had entered his house and took a box of bullets more than once, so E. wrote his name on the bottom of all his boxes hoping to find the kid that took them.  The crime was that someone had shot out some windows and had left the empty boxes at the scene.  The police in the small town knew your uncle very well and knew he would not have done it.  And why would you incriminate yourself by leaving your name there?  They asked a couple of questions, smiled, and left.  End of story.  ""But, Grandpa, why did he need flying lessons?""

&#x200B;

4.  ""He just wanted to learn to fly, not to escape to a far off island.""Thanks for asking about him!""  

&#x200B;

Encourage the young to talk to grandpas and grandmas, aunts and uncles, people in rest homes, older neighbors.  Ask questions!  Not every day, but occasionally.  Learn how others lived--their adventures, sorrows, happiest memories.  Most everyone loves to tell stories.  Their lives can be enriched knowing the young are interested in them.  And, by talking to the elderly, your life will be too.  Remember, you will be elderly someday.  You will have stories about your life.  Get them a cup of coffee and a sandwich.  Play checkers or a card game with them.  It will be a history lesson not found in books.

&#x200B;

Opening the computer/music room door again, I quickly say, ""Oh yeah,  your great uncle also delivered SPERM.""  And just as quickly, I closed it... only to heard him say, ""WHAT?""

&#x200B;

What is that old saying about opposites attract? When I was a child, I had two small toy magnets. Each had a positive end and a negative end. If both positive or both negative ends were placed together, they would repel each other. If one positive was pointed toward a negative, they would attract each other. Is this how ""all"" relationships among people react as well? Could it be that our relationships are based on how magnets behave? Is this all it takes to be with someone, an opposite? I am pretty confident that this saying is just a saying, no more, no less. I think it is just a toss of a coin, a fifty-fifty chance. Perhaps relationships are haphazard and are due to fate! Perhaps opposites do always attract!

My wife and I have been married since 1965, and we are pretty much as opposite as it gets. I like to watch and play sports. She doesn't care for sports and only puts up with them because she always wants to support me. Her family life was difficult with very little parental guidance and with her having to care for her step-siblings, whereas mine was filled with no stress, both parents, grandparents, cousins, aunts, and uncles close by. She has a temper and low blood pressure. I can't remember ever losing my temper throughout the duration of our relationship, and I take medication just to keep my blood pressure in the high normal range. Still, there are many things that we both like. We must have had at least a few things in common to be married for 53 years! ""Opposites"" may attract and ""likes"" may attract; so, how does this explain Kenny and Jimmy?

They were the best of friends and the worst of friends, they were the wisest and the most foolish...that is, in relation to their classmates. Wait! Am I getting confused? Charles Dickens must be on my mind tonight. Ok! Ok! They were the best and the worst! I know this because they were both in my eighth-grade classroom. They were best friends without knowing it.

Neither of them had much in the way of social skills, few friends, were ""C"" students, non-athletic, seldom spoke and had desks that looked like a hand grenade had been tossed into them. They were both on the small side. Their clothes were always a mess. Both of them were artistic. The girls never gave them a look. They seldom spoke to anyone, not even each other. But they were both aware of the other. Jimmy had to work hard just to get his C's whereas Kenny had to sluff-off to get his. But, they had their differences.

There was a time when all the students were given I.Q. tests. Their scores were put in teacher files and passed on to each new teacher. I think that this practice was stopped 20-30 years ago unless a student was being tested for advanced placement or for remedial classes. Scores between 80 and 89 were considered low normal. Scores of 90 to 110 were considered to be in the normal range. Scores of 111-129 were at a high level, and 130 and up were considered gifted. Here is where the boys were opposites. Jimmy's I.Q was around 85, and Kenny's was well above 150. So, how were they best friends and, at the same time, best enemies without even knowing it? It came down to their artistic creativity.

In their spare time, both boys would sketch pictures. Kenny would draw elaborate forts or castles with drawbridges, soldiers, and weapons. Jimmy would draw jets firing at each other or at targets on the ground. Neither was paying any attention to the other. At lunchtime, after eating, most of the boys would run to the playground to ""tag up"" for a game of workup for at least a half an hour. But Kenny and Jimmy would run to the sand pit that was for exercising. Kenny would be at one end making an elaborate fort. Just like a sand castle at the beach; he had water in a pail to make the sand wet, and then use the pail to mold the corners. It was amazing what he could do in 25-30 minutes. He had to know that those coming in from the field would run through the sand and crush his elaborate design. Jimmy would be at the opposite side of the pit collecting rocks. When the bell rang to go to class, Kenny was finished and would wait. It was as if he knew that Jimmy was coming. Jimmy would make airplane noises with his arms stretched out as he headed for the target. Kenny would sit to the side, knowing Jimmy would drop his bombs (rocks) on the fort. Whatever was left, he would make explosion sounds and stomp on the fort crushing the rest. The two of them would look at each other, not say a word, but, somehow, acknowledge that they had both completed their mission. They would not walk together to class but would be somewhat close. Kenny was not upset as he expected the raid. This would happen two to three times a week.

They were best friends and best enemies. Best enemies in the sandbox and best friends in their love for art. So in tune with one another, they never needed to speak to each other. Did they get along because of this shared silence, or their shared creative process? Were they opposites because of differing I.Q.'s or were they similar because they both enjoyed the same activity which drew them together? If they were both positive shouldn't they have been repelled? Opposites did attract in the case of Kenny and Jimmy; they complimented each other seamlessly and without any effort. Are relationships just haphazard? Are Kenny and Jimmy friends because they were opposites, or are they friends because they were alike? Never-the-less, they were friends.

I wonder if they knew they were friends. I would like to think they did. So, do opposites attract? Do likes attract? Who knows! Look at Jimmy and Kenny."
44,0,"It was Christmas Eve and very cold, or, as cold as it could be in Southern California at 8 P.M. How many would show up? My wife had no idea that her loving husband would do something like this. How will they be dressed? I hope they hurry up because I am freezing in this snow-less expanse where temperatures can get as low as ""65"" degrees. I can almost see my breath. They need to hurry up because I know that they will definitely warm me up. If the police come before we get inside and want to know what is going on, I will tell the officers that I am just making a *donation* for a good cause. Actually, I did pay top dollar and expect each and every one of them to give me my money's worth, even if I cannot sustain myself.

This must be them. A car, a second car, and a third were approaching with headlights turned off just as I told them to do. No one can know what was about to go down. They parked at the top of the hill where they could not be seen. When they got out, I noticed that they were all wearing the same outfit. It would have been more exciting had they opt to have different themes. Even the colors were the same. There were tassels, knee-high boots, and colorful frills. Some had hats that also had tassels, but some did not. There were around 15 to 20 of them. They all were carrying an oddly shaped object. A guy with a large stick and a whistle in his mouth led them toward me. Was he in charge of this group? I had expected three, maybe four girls, cheerleader types with pompoms. Will they come into the house as well? I told them to wait at the top of the street and let me sneak back into the house before someone saw me. I had to keep this a **secret**. But just as I arrived at the base of the hill, I heard two beeps of the whistle and...

Waking up the whole neighborhood, possibly the next city and most likely any deaf person within 25 miles, the band, in single file, loudly pounded out ""76 Trombones"" as they marched down the middle of the street with houses on both sides until they were at the bottom stopping right in front of my sister's home. Little did she know that her Christmas party for the neighbors and their children would be invaded by this marching band! I hustled into the house before they arrived. The Drum Major rapped loudly on the door. All of the guests were in the backyard around a fire pit where my brother-in-law was cooking a pot of hot chili; it most certainly would be delicious. The neighbors had all brought dishes for the potluck get-together. The kids were running and playing. There was some Christmas music on a record player and lots of chit-chatting. I managed to send my sister inside to get something, and she heard a loud knock on the door. The band was silent until she opened the door, and then the drum-major struck his staff on the ground, gave two quick tweets on his whistle, and the band began to play ""76 Trombones"". And without being invited in, marched straight into the house. Drums and cymbals clanging, trumpets tooting, flutes playing, and trombones trumpeting!

The High School Band proceeded to follow the Drum Major through every room in the house, bedrooms, even bathrooms, and through the kitchen and finally into the backyard. My sister was awe-struck. She quickly looked at me, and I knew she had already apprehended the culprit of this charade. Why would she suspect me? It was out of character for a shy school teacher. The neighbors gasped, then applauded. The children stopped in their tracks. The band proceeded to play a number of classic Christmas tunes, and parents and kids sang along. The members of the marching band and their leader were fed chili, potluck, and given warm hot chocolate. Then they played tunes just for the children--Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer, etc.

Then they left just as they came, horns a blaring. But this time, they asked if the children would like to accompany them when they took their final march throughout the rest of the neighborhood. Many parents said that they would follow to make sure that none of the kids wandered off, but I think that it was more the parents that wanted to continue with the excitement. The band stayed at my sister's nearly an hour and a half and then marched in the neighborhood for another hour. A great time was had by all. I got more than my money's worth, and much MUCH more. The band members came from my own high school, the very one I had attended from 1955 to 1959, and they made me proud to be an Arroyo Knight. In the future, I was lucky enough to teach at my Alma mater for nearly 20 years.

Oh yeah, I almost forgot! There was even a gentleman visiting from Europe for the Christmas season who commented that we really know how to throw a party in the USA! My sister and her Christmas Party were the talk of the neighborhood until well after New Years.

The year was either 1973 or 1974. The band was trying to earn money for either new uniforms or somewhere they wanted to go. I was going to *donate* anyway, but for a little more, they did this for me. I want to thank those band members for creating such a wonderful memory, for myself and everyone there that evening. What a great night!

**MERRY CHRISTMAS!**"
45,0,"What is it that they say; one size fits all? This cannot be true! Would you use a gunny sack for one potato? What would an extra-large Hummer's tires look like on a Mini-Cooper? If my sweatpants fit my waist, then why are they are too long for my legs? There are just too many sizes and shapes. One size never fits all. And this brings me to my topic--TESTS!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tests do not fit all! My wife will test my patience. True, but off-topic. Must get back and make my point. I have always been around tests, either taking them, writing them or administering them. I have given tests in mathematics, English, science, history, physical education, ballet, choir, art, and hopscotch! Well, maybe not the last four. But, I have seen all manners of tests. In a sense, I was like a utility player on a sport's team playing whatever position the coach needed. Just as I would have to know each position, I would have to understand each type of test. I know I am being wordy, but there is a motive to my madness, and it is personal! So, let's talk about testing and anxiety; the rise in blood pressure, the possible fainting, the near heart attacks, the loss of weight from not eating, and of course the sweating.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was to be my first ever oral exam. He was the United States history professor, and my appointment was at 3:30 that afternoon in his office. It would be just the two of us. I was told that it would take about 15 minutes. How many questions could he ask in such a short time? Furthermore, he was blind and wouldn't notice me sweating, shaking, and slumping in my solo chair as he interrogated me. I was told to leave all books outside. He didn't say anything about notes, so I had a few 3x5 cards in my shirt pocket. He'd never know! To my surprise, there were no other desks in the room, and the walls were absent of pictures. I looked around for any of those two-way mirrors that the police use during interrogations--None! I was home free until he summoned his snarling, teeth showing guide-dog from under his desk. It was a German Shepherd the size of a woolly mammoth or so it seemed. I had seen him before, but he didn't seem as threatening. He sat beside the professor like a statue. ""Do not move during the test,"" the professor said. ""If you have an itch, don't scratch."" I reached for my cards and Cujo snarled and showed his teeth. Without moving, I answered the questions as best I could. The test was a pass or fail type. I passed, but cannot remember any of the questions. I could only imagine how much fun that blind professor had every semester when he gave his oral exams.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When I taught math, I would announce a pending test to be given the next day. Students would always ask, ""Is it hard?"", to which I would usually give my standard reply, ""not for me!"" Then they would want to know how many questions. If I told them there would be around 100 problems, they would often whine and say that it was too many and not ""fair"". I would tell them that it is in their best interests. Of course, I had to explain why. With 100 questions, each one is only worth 1% of the test, thus they could miss 10 and still get 90 %!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I would tell them to always be leery of a test with just a few questions as each of them will often be loaded with unnecessary data and confusing wording. If there are 4 questions, each will be worth 25% of the test, so missing just one of them lowers your score to 75%. It is possible that a test of 100 questions could be just 100 times tables, so fewer questions often make for a more difficult test. However, beware of the devious Psychology instructors. They are always running experiments. On this day, my midterm day, my psychology professor announced that our test would not be ""open-book"" where you could use your book or notes to find answers. Rather it was ""closed-book"" and to further cause us stress, it was to be graded on a curve. Only the top score would get an A. This also means that someone must get an F. There might be a few B's or D's, but most of the students would be in the C range.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The pressure was enormous as everyone in the class was capable of a top score. The psychology professor passed out the tests with a slight smirk on his face because he wasn't finished with his continual experimenting by any means. Evil things were going to happen soon, very soon.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was a short-answer test and had a time limit of one hour. The professor was seated at his desk, drinking a cup of coffee, legs propped up on another chair and was gazing out the window. Students were deep in thought. And then, AND THEN, he did the unthinkable. He stood up, walked toward the door, announced he had to get some more coffee, and disappeared. If I had been paying attention, maybe I would have noticed that the cup of coffee on his desk was still steaming, but I only watched him. He was truly trusting us. But, he was about to be betrayed as one student near the door immediately reached under his desk and took out his psychology book as soon as the door closed behind the teacher. OMG (I think the grand-kids are spending too much time here), that student was very intent on getting the A. This wasn't going to be a fair fight! AND, AND, a second student in a near-by seat reached for his book, and then a third! How long will it take him to get more coffee? More were now reaching for their books. What should I do? I wasn't going to be a squealer, and I didn't want to be a cheater. Still, everyone wanted the top grade and, more to the point, no one wanted the lowest.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fortunately, I did not have to plunge into the murky water because of the professor reentering the room the next moment. The slamming of the books told the whole story. ""Aha!"", he said a smirk. ""Phew,"" I thought. Would I have gone through with the betrayal? I would like to say, never, nope, nine! I could hear my mother's reply when I would say, as we all have, ""but, Mom, EVERYONE is doing it, why can't I?"" Of course, she would say something like, ""Well, if everyone was jumping off of the Empire State Building, would you?"" My wife used to refer to me as a ""goody-two-shoes"".

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This had been a set-up from the get-go. Our instructor had deliberately left the room, coffee on the desk still steaming. The first three perpetrators were in on the rouse. The devious teacher was doing research on the Lemming Effect in education and we were his lemmings. No one got in any real trouble, but many would have to live with what they had done. Not me! I WAS CLEAN, INNOCENT, with a great big HALO over my head. I took so long to make the decision, I lucked out. I had morals! I was a good guy!!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some students have trouble with certain tests and others with different tests. Have you ever taken a scantron test and put your answer for #3 in the spot for #4? This would cause you to have every answer in the wrong place for the rest of the test creating a sure failure. I preferred essay tests because I could usually do no worse than a ""C"" even when I knew very little. But I knew how to write a solid opening paragraph with just limited knowledge of the material and a closing paragraph that just restated the opening one. All in-between sections would be made vague, but look good. One size does not fit all, neither does one type of test. Almost there! Must tell you about one more test.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Do you believe in yourself? Are you self-assured? It's kind of like talking to someone who says, ""Don't turn around! You won't believe who just walked into the room."" You were told not to, but you can't help yourself, and you turn around anyway. This next test produced this type of reaction. Again, I told you to beware of the infamous psychology professors. It happened to me around 55-56 years ago.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was an important test, but I was well-prepared for it. It was T-F. The questions ranged from one sentence to a paragraph in size. There were just 20 questions. A general rule on a T-F test is that the ""longer the question"", the greater the chance it ""could"" be false. Remember only one thing needs to be false to make the whole question false. Short one sentence statements are usually true, but not always.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We were told to put our name at the top of the test. ""Put a capital F for false,"" he orders, ""and if your answer is true, leave it alone"". Do not put T for true. These were also the only directions on the test, and as you have already reasoned out--ALL of the questions were...TRUE!! Of course, this was a psychology teacher's test. So, would you turn to see who just came through the door? Can you control yourself enough to turn an important test in with only your name written on it, even if that is what it takes to score 100%, to get an A? Do you have the will-power not to turn to see who walked in? Do you have the moxie and self-confidence to hand in a blank test and walk out the door, or will you have to put a few F's because it would be insane to turn in a blank test? I didn't think I could do it--Something must be false! I would have turned to see who entered the room. BEWARE the psychology professors and their tests. Sorry, I don't remember how many questions got an ""F"" from me. Now, to my point! It is personal!!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At 76 years of age, a letter just arrived. I am required to go to the DVM and take a written driver's test in a couple of months. How can this be? I haven't had a ticket since I was a teenager. Have traffic laws changed that much since I last took the test? The DMV usually sends me a test in the mail with a few easy questions that I can look up. How many questions will there be? Are they hard? Why can't I take the ""essay"" version? Maybe my old psychology professor is behind this letter! Shouldn't I be taking the actual driving test not a written one?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I have to take a TEST! This is personal!! I HAVE TO TAKE A TEST!!!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Meeeeee... Not Fair!!"
46,0,"I had an interview on Friday to be a research assistant in a lab at my university and at the end of the interview, I got offered the spot. I'm really excited because I'm in the honors program at my university so I'll actually be funded (the lab director said possibly funded entirely) to go on trips and present my articles, findings, etc. I also finally have my class schedule set in stone for next semester and it turns out the last class I was waitlisted for is actually taught by the lab director so she was able to override me into the course. I had the worst semester and I was so depressed and really dug myself into a hole but I'm finally feeling like a good student again and I couldn't be happier! "
47,0," What am I going to do with them? *Display them on a shelf*? Frame them? Put them in a safety deposit box? Sell them for a profit? Keep them as lucky charms? Use them as a conversation opener with someone I might want to meet? Form a club?. Make a living?! I had no clue. What worldwide event may have inspired me; was it something I inherited from my parents who lived through the depression? What motivated me to do such a thing? What was I thinking? I have questions that need to be answered. Maybe **I WAS CRAZY**, but getting better, because I was beginning to acknowledge that what I had been doing... was insane! I soon realized that everyone does it at some time in their life.

It is 1947, and I am five and in the first grade. Our school is at the top of a small hill. It is called ""the Old Brick Schoolhouse"", and it is still there in 2018, only now, it is a library. It is a two-story structure all brick and looks like a child's block in design. It is very small with only four classrooms, grades 1-4. Two rooms are above the two at the ground level. I don't even remember seeing a principal's office, just the classrooms and two sets of stairs. There was no kindergarten for children. We all started in first grade at the age of five. There was a large grassy play area with a slide, a teeter-totter, and a large spinning apparatus that nearly all the children could ride on at once. Grades 5-12 all go to the high school, which actually had a gym, just a couple of miles away.

Mrs. Wilson, our teacher, tells us to settle down and take out our reader. We will go around the room row by row with each student reading a paragraph. She would read to us so that we could catch the rhythm and flow of the written words. It was an interesting time just a couple of years after the end of World War II, and there was happiness and friendships, but not a lot of extra money around. A nickel would buy two loaves of bread and most residents owned a sewing machine, often one called a Singer. They made a lot of their own clothes. Thus, we kids didn't have too many toys. Some had bicycles and many had homemade wagons. We took to collecting a variety of things.

There's a red, another red, a blue, 4 blacks, another red, a green. How many red today? My hands are smeared, must wash them. A bell rings. ""Everyone, sit down!"" comes a sweet, soft voice. It had only been a few minutes, but I was doing well. Must get up from the dirty floor. ""Please, take your seat, *now*!"" comes the command, not as sweet this time. It seems as if everyone is looking at me as I return to my desk with my finds. All of the desks are the same; they are old with obsolete holes for inkwells near the front, wooden with a seat that doesn't swivel, and a top that opens up for books and other supplies. No one says anything to me. They are my friends--all 17 of them. They probably hunt for treasures of their own. Most of them will do it when they are outside or walking home. They may collect unusual rocks or colorful leaves. Every day I search for my personal cache knowing that I am the only one in the room with this unusual collection. I fill my treasure chest, a small box I use for pencils and erasers, with my prizes.

I collect the lead tips from broken pencils. **Yes**, broken pencil tips. I would easily find them on desks, the floor and around the pencil sharpener. Besides pencils, most of us had a combination pencil which may be still made today. It was a red pencil on one end and the other half was blue. Some kids had colored pencils with green, yellow, and other colors that they used for drawing when we did art. Those were my favorites as they were hard to find. To this day, I don't know why I did this, or whatever happened to the lead. It was just something to do to have some fun.

I also had a second collection because my dad worked at one of the two filling stations in town. A bottle of pop at the station was five cents, but I was allowed to take one for free because my Dad worked there.

Soda pop was the source. There was no soda machine, just sodas in a large ice cooler. They were bottles kept in ice water that had a large block of ice in the middle. A bottle opener was attached, and it was where everyone opened them. I collected the soda caps out of the catcher and took them home; The Dad's Root Beer cap was my favorite along with Hires Root Beer and Cream Soda, and 7-up and any type of Nesbitt-- Orange, Grape, and Strawberry. Not only could they be kept in a small box, but they could be used as war metals when playing or a badge for a sheriff in a cowboy game; just take the cork from inside the cap and put it inside of your t-shirt and push the cap back onto it from the other side. I kept only the ones that were hardly bent. It was always fun to find ones that I did not already have.

Larry, my neighbor, collected something else that cost no money. He strung string in an *""x""* fashion across the ceiling of his bedroom. He collected matchbook covers and would open up the ""books"" and drape them over the string. Nearly every store in town had free matchbooks with their store names on them: taverns, hardware stores, banks, filling stations, etc. A great percentage of people smoked at this time, so these matchbooks could easily be found. And, as there were many nearby towns, many were available.

When I was a pre-teen I collected marbles. We had pockets filled with pretty marbles. Some were unique and were used as shooters when we played games at grade school. We would draw a large circle, ante a few marbles and take turns knocking them out. You kept whatever you could blast out of the circle using your shooter. You shot until you missed. Should your shooter not knock a marble out, and was unfortunate enough to remain in the circle, it could be knocked out and kept by another player. It was a big loss to lose your *lucky shooter*. We played other games such as poison, a game like croquet. Sometimes we would ""lag"" them, toss for a line and closest would win all the marbles from those that were in the game. I guess we were gambling on school grounds, but no one ever said a word.

When I was around 13, I began to collect baseball cards. A pack of them cost around a nickel. There were around 10 cards and a large piece of bubble gum in the pack. They were major league players throwing or hitting or pitching. All of their statistics were on the back side. We all wanted the big stars such as Willie Mays, Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford, and Bob Feller. The stars were in the packs, but few and far between. Instead, lesser players' cards abounded. It was fun trading the cards. Sometimes you could get ten for one if it was one that another collector didn't have. I never knew a kid that ever assembled a complete set. The ""Topps"" company was smarter than the average kid.

As an adult, I have collected around 1,000-1,500 wood tennis racquets, many new! I have displayed them, sold them on eBay, traded a few, and managed to get a few actual tennis legends to sign them--Jack Kramer, Rod Laver, etc. A movie studio called a collector friend of mine and wanted around 25 early 1900-1930 racquets to be used in a movie, and he came to me because he needed a few more. So, I have had some of my collection in a movie!

I know what I did with the wood tennis racquets, with the baseball cards, with the marbles, and with the bottle caps, but for the life of me don't understand what happened to the pencil lead. Still, I guess everyone from time to time will collect something for one reason or another. ***Everyone does it***!"

No, No, No! I must have overslept! I can smell bacon and eggs. Mom and Dad have been up for hours. Why didn't they wake me as usual? It must be nearly 7:30! Yes, it was 7:35. I will stay in my pajamas, quickly brush my teeth, rush to the kitchen and ask for some slop; it was quick to make as I had to hurry, and I *loved* slop. Oh, yeah! Slop is just a glass of milk with torn pieces of white bread dropped into it. You would eat it with a spoon. The bread would absorb the milk and was especially tasty with very cold milk. Mom would make my real breakfast after I was finished. I had to be ready by 8:00. It was Sunday, and I only had ten minutes before the Katzenjammer kids would again cause trouble; before Mary Worth could finish solving her latest mystery; before something exciting might happen in the town of Dogpatch or on Sadie Hopkin's Day or to the shmoos! I was six years old, and the year was 1948. I laid on the floor and waited for that unknown voice to begin. ""Good morning children. It is Sunday! Do you have your newspaper? Find the comics! We will start in two minutes."" His was a familiar voice. We had to be ready as there was no pause or rewind button on a radio.

The *voice* would tell us which comic strip he was about to read and would give us time to find it. He would read with emotion, tempo, inflection, and with necessary accents. He would use male, female, old and young voices; he would use different voices for each hero and for each villain. He even made animal sounds. I would read along with him--sometimes out loud and sometimes silently. I was becoming a better reader. He was never monotone; he was entertaining and teaching at the same time. He probably would have been a great actor if he wasn't already. I never knew his name, but I should have as he was like a third parent that only shows up on the weekend. I must look him up on the internet someday.

When you are looking up **slop**, the Shmoo, and the Katzenjammer Kids, and you know you will, look up old comic strips from the 1940s and 1950s. Find out why shmoos ""loved"" to be eaten. Who is Al Capp? Check all of them out on Wikipedia. There is also memorabilia of shmoos.

The comics were in the morning but in the evenings were the radio comedies, mysteries, and horror programs. I listened to all of them. There were certain things in each show that I knew would happen.

I listened to a detective show called *The Shadow*. The show would begin with the announcer saying, ""Who knows what lurks in the hearts of men? **The Shadow** knows!"" I could visualize the shadow in a semi-lit room, blending in with the walls, and being able to *slither* under closed doors in order to overhear evil plots. I listened to Dagwood and Blondie because Dagwood was always getting into trouble, and Blondie would always get him out of it. He was known for his famous ""Dagwood sandwiches"", stacked high with layer after layer of deli meats. To me, it seemed that the sandwiches had to be a foot high!

There was Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Boys, a show about summer camp on a dude ranch. I could envision Superman and all his superpowers. Fibber McGee opening a closet that was always stuffed with ""things"" that would then loudly tumble out and completely cover him. I could see him squashed under the pile with just his legs sticking out. Then there was Inner Sanctum, a horror show, that always began with a scary sounding creaking door which set the stage for terror and screaming during the rest of the show. I had to have all of the lights in the house on when it aired; my mind would go wild, and I had to get a pillow to protect me. I loved it.

When I saw many of these same shows on television, later on, I was often disappointed because **The Shadow** was not a real a shadow, but a man in a dark room with a black mask, black hat and black cape which he wrapped around himself when he didn't want to be seen; he couldn't slide under doors as I had seen him do in my imagination. Superman's flying, bullet catching and aversion to kryptonite weren't as I had pictured them. Dagwood's sandwiches were not a **mile** high. My imagination had died a bit with my introduction to television. I did love the new medium of entertainment, but I was surrendering my vivid imagination to the future time.

The year was 1950 and Dad had relocated us from Iowa to Pasadena, California. I had still never seen a television. Only when we rented a house a couple of blocks from where Dad worked as a mechanic, did I see a television in the window of a store as I passed by. It was on, and I saw my very first television show-- Howdy Doody with Buffalo Bob and Clarabell the Clown. I was about to become a television addict. Television had robbed me of something valuable--creativity! I hadn't realized it, but I was hooked, and I left the comfort of radio--and blanket and pillows. My mind was becoming paralyzed.

Luckily, I could create many stories and games with a deck of cards. My Mom and I still played double deck canasta. I could make up baseball, football, and basketball games with the cards. I would form leagues, professional and college, keep stats and win-loss standings. With my mind, I could entertain myself. I could shoot the cards from a distance with rubber bands. So, my imagination was not completely squandered!

With new school friends, I played numerous running games such as freeze tag. We played various games in the street--moving only when a car would come along. We played baseball with a tree being first base, a glove for second, a car for third, and an old shoe for home plate. A tennis racquet and tennis ball would be our bat and ball. No glove was needed. We were outside, creating games, discussing rules, out-of-bounds areas and having a good time. We were communicating and still using our imagination.

After I had been teaching for a while, I was given a computer for my classes. It kept and calculated students' grades continually. It was great. It did take away a little more of my imagination. Everything was right there for me. I wondered if my ability to create still existed. Maybe, this is why I am enjoying writing again?

Children today are using cell phones that can search, play these so-called ""*games*"" my grandson is obsessed with; one he calls, what is it...Call of Duty and the other a Fortnite? Whatever they are! He tries to explain them to me but I can't for the life of me get the hang of them. But enough of that, where was I? Oh yes, cell phones! Kids can make calls, and it can help them to read too! I wonder if the new generation will lose some of its creativity, but then I see how smart they are and realize that they must still be using their imagination. The technology today is unbelievable--3-D printers, space probes, and electronics abound. My grandkids are even better at Jeopardy than I am--at least their minds are quicker. I may have to stop watching Alex Trebek with them.

I am happy that I grew up when I did. Things were slower and more simple. Imagination was king. For me, the best day of the week was---Sunday!"
49,0," 

He came out of the elevator and walked toward me. ""Are you Mr. S?"", he said. I had been waiting for him for what seemed like hours. My knees were weak. I was sweating, and my hands were shaking. ""Your wife is on the 4th floor. We had to run a few tests on the second floor and we have her resting now."" ""What is wrong with her?! She's only 21 years old?!"", I feebly asked, my hands trembling. With a stern look on his face, lips pursed tightly together, he whispered that she had FLKs. That was all I needed to hear, FLKs, and before he could elaborate, my mind went into overdrive. ""Oh My God is she on her deathbed? She is going to die from FLKs! **Wait**!! ***What***! What are **FLKs**? Did the doctor already tell me because my mind was racing? Is she dying of Cancer or some rare disease? FLK=Failing Lung Kapacity? No, capacity begins with a ""C"", not a ""K"". FLK=Funky Lumbar Kranium nope starts with a ""C"" again. What medical word begins with a *""K""*?

I didn't even know the doctor's name. It was stitched on his white coat, but with my eyes full of tears, I couldn't even begin to read it. FLK, FLK, FLKs! An ""s"" would mean plural so were the FLKs running throughout her body? Wait, What? I think he said, ""funny or maybe sunny"". All of these thoughts were taking place in seconds. Calm down, **calm down**, I need to resolve this. With just the slightest quiver in my voice, I asked this stranger to repeat his message. ""FLKs,"" he said smiling this time. Once again, my mind shifted into high gear. I didn't hear the ""K"" word. My mind was reverting to earlier in the day when she initially started to feel ill.

We had just moved into our first home, 1300 sq. ft. inside, with a redwood picket fence around the front. The house itself had a redwood front. We were on a cul-de-sac street in a nice neighborhood. I had a good job teaching. She loved to garden. Things were perfect until she began to throw-up. She said that she just felt awful and may throw-up again. She had a slight temperature, and I put her to bed to rest and placed a wastebasket beside her. But, every time I checked her, she was getting hotter and ached all over, especially her lower back. This all started around noon and now it was close to 6 P.M. Our doctor's office was closed, and I didn't know the area very well. I found the closest hospital by looking in the phone book. It was around ten miles away. I should have asked a neighbor, but I didn't know any yet, and I was a bit panicky. It was a Saturday night and was raining which made things a bit more difficult.

We made it to the hospital without her again throwing up. With the heavy rain, she couldn't get out of the car. She could have put her head out the window, or she could throw-up in the car. I forgot to take a paper bag or wastebasket for that problem. She did not throw up, so I guessed my worst fear was over. But...

""*Was* ***this*** *the hospital*?"" I wondered. It looked more like a scene from an old horror movie. You know an ""it was a dark and stormy night"" type of hospital. A young couple had car trouble and had to walk to the nearest building for help kinda thing. It was pretty much a large dilapidated ""mansion"". There was a parking lot with just three cars in it. As the rain drenched us, there would be thunder followed by lightning which would light the entire facility for a brief second. Would Bella Lugosi or Boris Karloff be answering the door and asking, ""may I help you?"" But, the door ""mysteriously"" swung open on its own. No one greeted us. There was a large waiting room yet no one waiting. The Bride of Frankenstein was seated at the only desk in the room. She looked at us and knew we needed help. ""We are not set up as an emergency room, and we have a limited staff tonight, but in this situation, I think we CAN help you,"" she said sweetly, maybe a little too sweetly. An orderly with a hunched back came out and escorted her to an examination room. There was more thunder and the lights flickered. Did I just see a *bat*?! Was a radio playing, or was that howling? It was as if my mind's wiring was shorting out. Then my wife was gone!

They took her to the back and left me to fill out papers. At this point, I could barely write or think. I stayed in the waiting room, but after about a half-hour, I asked the front desk what was wrong with her. I was told that she was moved to the second floor, and I was allowed to go check on her. Then, I was told she was moved to the fourth floor. This is when Doctor Frankenstein came out of the elevator.

He looked at me, asked if I was Mr. S, and told me that my wife had FLKs. I was close to passing out when he gave me the diagnosis. I asked him to repeat it for the third time. He knew that I was nervous and softly told me again. Your wife has a kidney infection. We will give you a prescription which will quickly take care of it. We have had her on some fluids to help her. With the IV and some of the medication, she will be fine in a few days. There was nothing seriously wrong. ""But, what about the FLKs?,"" I questioned.

""You mean the *Funny-Looking Kidneys*?"", he said with that smirk. She has one normal kidney on one side and on the other, she has two pigmy-sized kidneys, one on top of the other. They were not the cause of the infection and may never become a problem in the future. The doctor had a sense of humor which I generally admire. I was so relieved that I just thanked them quickly at the hospital and took her home.

She was much better the next morning. In a couple of days, she was back to her old self. I tried to show her where I had taken her but must have turned on the wrong street that night when it was raining so hard. Every time afterward, I always ended up at a vacant lot! Never could find the creepy desolate hospital, again.

*FLK=FUNNY-LOOKING KIDNEYS*! **Who knew**?!"
50,0," 

Vivian took my hand and said that I was an ""old soul"". She had been hired by various police departments to help find missing people and had a reputation for achieving great results. Now, she worked at the high school in the attendance office where I taught. She often ""freaked out"" students. Vivian was the one who the absent students had to present their written excuses for missing a day of school. ""You expect me to believe this note?"", she might say. ""I sense that you were not sick at all"". Most of the time she would simply accept the note without questioning, but she had a reputation that preceded her, and students with notes, honest or not, would be nervous when she looked them in the eye. ""*Will she know the truth*?"" they probably wondered. They would keep their distance from her and hurriedly leave when she approved their excuse. They had heard rumors about her ability and did not want to be challenged or let her touch their hand so she could feel their *vibes*. They were always relieved when they got out of the office.

Vivian never claimed to be psychic and, as far as I know, never took any money for it. I'd like to think she meant ""*old soul*"" in a good way--that I had lived before and had learned from it--easy going, no temper, staying out of trouble, a truly giving person. Perhaps, I was more of a rouge in previous lives: drinking, gambling, using drugs, unfaithful to my wife, and with each new life, I was to learn something new and valuable. I was continually being shown a better way of living! Wasn't it the Buddhist religion that said if you had led a good life that you would be born again to a higher life, or status? And, these reincarnations would continue until finally you would be seated next to Buddha and be one with him in Nirvana? Maybe, I will need to examine reincarnation a bit more!

Many years ago, I read a book trilogy called ""Clan of the Cave Bear"". It was over 1,000 pages long. It had me hooked as I usually read more magazines and newspapers than books, lest ones with 1,000 pages. In general, it dealt with the evolution of early man and how the various groups would eventually migrate, finding other developing groups. They would learn from each other new techniques for dealing with hunting, farming, fishing, basket making, boat building, irrigation systems and so on.

The newborn would retain these new methods at birth. They would use past knowledge to advance current methods. They would retain knowledge of learned medicine from the past and their ancestors' fears as well. Much of their knowledge was inherited. They would not know why they would use a certain plant for medicine or know to eat or not eat a certain plant, but they instinctively knew. This might explain why some of us are afraid of drowning, heights, certain animals, and so on. We were just born with a knowledge of what our ancestors' had learned.

For example, my wife and I took a mountain tram near Palm Springs, California. It ascended upward at about a 45-degree angle but seemed like 90-degrees and moved at about five miles per hour. As it got higher, it would sway back and forth on this thick cable. My wife pointed out some tiny people climbing up the side of the sheer mountain off to the front right. I could barely manage a nod. I was sweating, we were in the desert, and thinking I should have updated my will as she had asked last week. The tram was full, maybe 10 or 20 or 1000 potential victims. My mind was in total **chaos**. I was a mess. There were many children running back and forth to see both sides of the cage we were ""locked"" in. The wind and the children were making this trip even more terrifying. They and their parents seemed oblivious to the pending danger, except for this one gentleman who was staring at me in the same way that I was staring at him. At that moment, we were connected. His fear was the same as mine. Could we have come from the same tribe? Neither of us moved for the 20-minute ride. If we moved our eyes, the *jail* would collapse. We both knew this may not end well. How did I agree to this?

This might explain how it is the same for animals. They inherently know which animals they should prey upon and which they should avoid. It could explain how over time they develop color schemes to scare predators away, or perhaps to hide. There are harmless snakes, which scare me anyway, that have markings like poisonous ones to scare away predators. There is the chameleon that changes color in order to blend in with its surroundings so that it can hide from predators. My color was changing to pale as I dangled inside the tomb. At the top, parents would allow their children to go within a few feet of the sheer drop even with the hurricane swirling. I could not get closer than fifty yards because the rope that tied me to the tree might snap. Did I inherit these fears over the centuries? I could be an **old soul**!

Now I am thinking of child prodigies. Could they be old souls? How can some three-year-old play classical piano or read music? How can a four-year-old sing opera or recite long poems? How is it possible for a five-year-old to compete at a championship level in chess? Tiger Woods was on the Johnny Carson television show at 5 or 6 years old showing off his golf prowess, but I believe his dad taught him to play, and he took to it like a duckling to water. Did prodigies learn from something in their DNA, or could they have been a reincarnated famous artist? I was five and playing double-deck canasta with my mother and was the scorekeeper. We played for blood. The difference was that she taught me how to play and math was a game we did together. Pretty good! But, these other prodigies just started their skills, like in the Clan of the Cave Bear, without being taught. This brings me to Birdey Murphy.

The year was 1956 and I was 14. Mom and I were glued to the television when this live spectacle would come on. During this time, television was showing ***live*** heart operations. People were fascinated, scared for the patient, and ratings went skyward. But, then the idea of past lives and reincarnation raised its head. It brought goosebumps, awe, suspicion, and questions to the viewers, and again ratings began to rise quickly. Viewers were glued to their television sets. Could it really be true? Or was it merely a staged deception?

There was an amateur hypnotist center stage with a lady, Birdey Murphy, on a couch being put under, into a deep trance. He had originally started hypnotizing her to find out what in her past was causing her great fear of water or something like that. I can't remember the problem. He would take her slowly back to different times in her life, regression, looking for the answer. He would talk to her while she was under. Finally, he went so far that he took her to her time in the womb. And then, he went further. She described where she was: a country in Europe, the year, what she was doing, her husband, his name, when she was born, which ended up being in the early 1800's, people she knew, stores and backgrounds, when she died around 1870, how she died, potentially a drowning, and then began to **speak in another language** ***fluently.*** She only had spoken English in her lifetime and had no accent. I remember more, but not enough space to discuss. Movies were made about this. Find an old movie, get some popcorn, find a blanket, start a fire in the fireplace, and snuggle up with a loved one and prepare for goosebumps to begin! Go to YouTube and look for it.

Skeptics tried to prove it was a fake, yet, many things and places that she spoke about were proven to exist, but not all. Check things out for yourself. Read up on it and then watch the movie that was released in 1956. Was it real? I saw it as it was happening!

Are the very young with unbelievable abilities reincarnated? Am I really an ""**OLD SOUL**"" as Vivian had stated? I lean toward yes! Never-the-less, have some fun! Believe it or Not!!"
51,0,"To succeed in most any venture, one must have an ego, if not a super-ego;  I know there is an id, but can't remember much about it.  I am sure it would make me feel good if I could remember. To make it to the top in professional sports you must believe that you can shoot a basketball better than Kobe Bryant,  hit a baseball with more power than Mickey Mantle,  slice through football defenses like the famous Jim Brown, or run as fast as Usain Bolt.    At 5'7"" I had to believe I could defeat anyone and everyone.  Each player or team I was to face had to have a weakness but not me!  I never even thought about my size because I had an ego; although there were hints that I could be wrong.  But how could I be wrong? OF COURSE, NOT ME!  But there were subtle hints...

In grade school,  the eighth-grade physical education teacher always selected four of his best athletes to be the captains that picked the teams;  I was most likely to be one of them. But this time, when it was time to select the four captains for track and field, he told all of the P.E. class to line-up where the blacktop meets the grass field.  We were to race to a fence, touch it and race back to the blacktop.  It would be about 100 yards to the fence and of course, another 100 back.  The first four back would be the captains. The whistle blew, and I was quick to the front.  I knew I had this because I was fast.  Touching the fence in second place, I knew I would be a captain again.  But with about 40 yards to go, my ego began to unwind quickly as I dropped into the fourth position.  Then, before I knew it, a body flew past me, and then another, and another.  There must have been quicksand on the grass.  I was slowing up and sinking.  My feet were moving but my body seemed to be in neutral. Could I have lost a shoe? Were they on a sugar boost?  I came in tenth.  At 5'7"" a runner must take a lot of strides to cover a lot of ground.  The boys that passed me were taller with long lumbering strides.  THEY were fast;  I was just QUICK.  Maybe I had an allergy as I was out of breath.  I would never be a cross country runner. My ego was losing ground!  I had to acknowledge that I was not the best at every activity.

There were many ventures that made me reevaluate my prowess.  Water skiing almost killed me.  I had to struggle just to get up when I first tried it.  Seeing these 10 to 12-year-old kids skiing effortlessly on ONE SKI, my ego said, ""if they can do it, so can I!  I am older and more coordinated!""  I went about 15 yards when my solo ski began to slide back and forth from left to right rapidly, and I was thrown up upon the lake like a rock that was skipped along the top of the water.  I bounced maybe 3 to 5 times and needed to be rescued.  I damaged one ear in this incident which rings to this day!

I am a poor golfer.  If there was a lake, a water puddle, or a cup of water anywhere near the hole, my shot undoubtedly sniffed it out and jump in.  I found all sand traps.  Golf was not supporting my ego very well...

Ice skating was a bust immediately.  I would not even come close to the Olympics, much less survive long enough to leave the ice rink.  I would have to stick with roller skating--a sport where I could stand up, skate forward, but never backward unless bumped, would have no brakes and had to crash against a wall to stop.  At least I could survive the roller rink!

I knew I would never try snow skiing, bungee jumping, or scuba diving.  Maybe, my dwindling ego was trying to keep me alive.  Maybe I need my ego but should also know when it is the right time to use it.  I was able to explain the ego phenomena when I taught algebra in high school.

All students had to pass algebra to graduate from high school.  There were many whose egos were being overwhelmed by the class.  Some of them had failed more than once.  However, everyone needed to know that they were good at something; they had egos in other fields, even if they didn't know the meaning of ego.   We would talk about these other skills.  Some of the struggling students could sing, dance, and play musical instruments--I couldn't hum lest sing, was stiff with no rhythm, but could effortlessly field a ground ball in a baseball game, and at best, might blow through a comb wrapped with wax paper as a substitute for a musical instrument.

Some of them were extremely mechanical.  They could tear a motorcycle apart in less than 60 minutes, but so could I.  Yet, they could fix and reassemble it just as quickly.   I could try for the rest of the year and never be able to do it. But, my ego would not let me quit trying to fix the motorcycle, and their ego should not let them give up on equations.  Their talents might be in cooking, art, shop, or some other area.  They needed to know that they, too, had talents.  We need to have egos, and we need to know we are good at some things that others are not.  For me, fixing something that is mechanical has a tendency to deflate my ego, just as math may for them.  Their talent might not be in math, but it exists somewhere, and they will find it when they need it.  Right now I will have to see that their egos are just temporarily sprained.

I have a neighbor that will not let me fix anything at my house if I need to use an electrical tool.  He and I play softball together, and jokingly he insists on checking that I have all of my fingers and toes.  Power tools do tend to deflate my ego.  Still,  I know I need this ego to succeed!  Even when it gets sprained from time to time, I know it is never totally gone.

When I was a college freshman, I found that there was a  student union, a large recreational room with a jukebox, pool table, food, and a ping pong table.  When I was 12, I was, for one year, my small town's ping-pong champion for my age group.  My ego was peaking and now it was racing when I saw the ping pong table.  There was a long line waiting to play the winner who stayed at the table as long as he won.  I was able to win for a while, but shortly the pros began to trickle in.  They had personalized racquets with covers and kept them inside of custom boxes.  They could slam any shot.  They were scary!  I realized that I was skipping too many classes and sadly had to leave this ego boosting event behind; I needed to get to class!  I THINK I WAS ABOUT TO SPRAIN MY EGO AGAIN!"
52,0,"The song ""Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer"" entered my head last night during a dream. Usually, I am awake when I hear a song that will stay with me all day.  But, this one came in a dream.  Like most dreams, there are the usual bits and pieces one remembers.  It was just a silly Christmas song.  I remember seeing images of The Cisco Kid and Gorgeous George.

Why would the two of them have anything do with any grandma, least of all mine?  Why were they in the same dream?  Were they riding horses in an old western movie, or maybe wrestling for the world championship?  I seem to remember confetti everywhere.  Could I have been at a wedding?  Did the Yankees win another World Series?  I saw my blue-haired grandmother's face stuck to a small glass window.     Maybe my grandmother was in a wrestling match with Gorgeous George, or perhaps a shoot-out with The Cisco Kid; it could have been the other way around.

Everything was like a puzzle with some pieces missing.  How would she, from a small town in Iowa, know television stars found in Hollywood.  She never owned a boob-tube as it was to sometimes be called: Western movie hero, television wrestling champion, Santa Clause, reindeer, small pieces of colorful graffiti, blue-haired grandma, face pushed against a window.  I think there were arms waving.  It's driving me bananas.  I have work to do, so just let it go.  But,  ""Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer"" won't stop playing in my head, over and *over* and ***over***!

I had heard of selective memory.  Could it be that my mind had been weaving various memories together to make a dream that might entertain me while I slept--all to relax me?  Was it pulling information from the many file cabinets that resided in the back of my mind? Were the file cabinets that I had filled over my lifetime with memories near empty?  It must be trying to put a story together-- splicing old film and stapling various segments to create a new story, and perhaps, it could not open all relevant files as some were padlocked.  Where do I begin?  When did I last see Grandma?   I must begin somewhere;  ""Grandma Got Run Over...""  **Stop it**! Can't think!

Nearly 99.9% of my dreams are enjoyable.  I am often playing a sport.  When I dream of basketball, I might be 10 years old on a playground running up and down on an asphalt court playing with my school friends having a good time.  Sometimes, I am playing with a mixture of professional players, and, at the same time, some of my childhood friends, in a beautiful gym.   I have games where I can't miss, and others where I never make a basket. I often cannot remember more than a few seconds of the storyline.  If I can remember just a part of it, I can sometimes work backward and retrieve more information. My dreams are mostly nice, and I am thankful for it.

I have had some unpleasant dreams, but very few.  I have had the same dream more than once.  I was never in the military or in any European country. I was born in the USA during World War II.  So, why am I moving from rooftop to rooftop with a rifle in hand? I've never even owned any kind of gun.  Now, I find myself in what appears to be a French town as part of a resistance.  Did I have a past life and this older memory was left in my file accidentally when I started my new life and new memories?  This could be the reason so many dreams make no sense--""...By A Reindeer""  **Again** and **again**, it plays!

I had dreams that I was a student who couldn't find the class I was taking, and if I did, wouldn't have my school work done, and was sitting there not even knowing the name of the class:  science, math, shop?   Occasionally, I was teaching a class without knowing the subject.  Yet, these things never happened.

It is like being tortured; water drops keep falling on my forehead;  a faucet annoying me with a constant drip; nails are being ripped from my fingers; I am being brainwashed!  Must solve the puzzle so I can get some work done today.  I like mysteries so I can do this.  Find a connection!  At least start!  Grandma!  She must be the centerpiece of the puzzle.  ""Grandma Got...""

**I know!  I know!**

My dad's mother and father watched over me while both my parents worked in downtown What Cheer.  Dad worked at the local filling station and made close to $9 a week.  Mom made around $11 a week as a beautician.  Grandma and Grandpa lived in the house next door so it was easy to take care of me.  We lived at the edge of town where the paved roads ended and the country would begin. Every household had a garden. Dad moved our family to California in 1950 as he had a job waiting.  Dad was around 38, Mom was 28, I was 8 and my sister was 2.  Grandpa died a few years later, and Grandma was brought out to live with us for a number of years.  Here is where I  become Sherlock Holmes.  The constant ""hammering, hammering"" will soon cease!   Yes, Grandma is the *""X""* in x marks the spot where I need to start digging.

Grandma was around 4'10'', overweight, had white hair with a blue tint, bad eyesight, caring, sweet, and mild-mannered.  She quickly became attached to our new 12"" television.  She and my dad loved westerns.  She was hooked on professional wrestling; actually, it was just fake, but to her, as real as it gets.  There were some really well-known wrestlers, and she knew them all, especially her favorite, ""Gorgeous George.""  He was handsome, with long dyed blond hair, and was always portraited as the ""*hero*"".  He was supposed to win every time but was scripted to lose on occasion.  Grandma did not understand that it was staged.  When my parents, my sister, and I went to bed, Grandma would pull a chair up extremely close to the TV and yell at the referee that the villain was biting or pinching or eye gouging or hitting George in the kidneys, all illegal.  When George had pinned his opponent, the referee would often do a slow count saving the villain.  She would put her nose within an inch or two of the screen as she waved her arms, fogging up the glass with her breathe as she screamed words unbecoming of such a sweet mild-mannered grandma.  I saw all of this because my bedroom was right next to the family room.  She had no idea that I was watching.   It was entertainment at its best.  Gorgeous George and the Cisco Kid had been spliced together in my dream.    The melody in my head was beginning to ebb.  Will it finally leave when I solve the Lone Ranger connection?

Dad was a good businessman and mechanic.  He bought the garage where he had worked and became very successful.  The garage, Earl's Auto Service,  was on Walnut Street which crossed Colorado Blvd in Pasadena.  Colorado Blvd is the ""Home of the Rose Parade"" on New Year's Day.  There was always a Grand Marshall, someone of importance.  There were bands from colleges, high schools, charities(i.e. The Red Cross), lots and lots of beautiful floats with Rose Queens, television stars, movie stars, athletes, congressmen, the mayor of Pasadena, floats from other countries, novelty groups, mounted police, clowns, circus performers, cowboy stars with their horses, and floats made by each school going to play in the Rose Bowl later in the day.

Dad would park visitor's cars at his garage and make some extra money.  Because he would get there early, he could always find an empty curb on Colorado for his family.  Puzzle nearly solved!  Grandma had a folding chair, a blanket, and a thermos.  She was ready.  Her location was at about the half-way mark of the parade.

She was in her element.  Many equestrians had passed already and as people from the floats would toss candy into the crowd, so would the horseback riders.  And there he was with his horse Diablo, his bejeweled cowboy clothes sparkling in the sunshine, pistol in his holster, mask on his face.  Beside him was his sidekick, Poncho, with his horse Loco.  They always rode together, and Poncho was as well-known as The Cisco Kid himself.  Cisco and Poncho split up with each one going to one side of the street to get closer to their fans.  They would toss some candy to children.  My grandmother was a bit sad that it was not The Cisco Kid, but Poncho, moving toward her.  Poncho was tossing some candy from a bag and talking to the children.  But, he must have seen a big child in Grandma and rode over and looked down at her. As she waved her arms he smiled, tipped his hat to her, reached into his apparent bag of candy and, with no hesitation, tossed a huge handful of... colorful graffiti into this startled fan's blue hair.   He looked her in the eye, winked and rode on.  Grandma left that confetti in her hair until it was time to go to bed that night. It may have been there for a few days.  She was a ""star"" at the parade.  Everyone clapped for her.  If everyone is to have 15 minutes of fame, this was hers.  Mom took pictures. The parade ended with Santa and his reindeers.  Grandma was in seventh heaven!

This all happened in the mid-1950's.  Grandma passed in 1959.  Is it possible this memory was her work?  The song is fading.

It now says ""Grandma Got Confettied By Poncho,"" and loved it!

Puzzle solved!  A doubleheader dream.  First feature ''**Grandma and Gorgeous George**"" followed by the main feature ""**Grandma and The Cisco Kid with his sidekick, PONCHO**""!"
53,0,"I began to think about it when I stepped on the side of his face as he lay on the ground.  I had to get through the hole as quickly as I could, and he was just collateral damage.  He also was a close friend of mine and played the same position as I did, but he didn't have the same success when it was his turn to rush through the opening.  The gap would close as quickly as it had opened.  My friend would also try to enter and exit the hole from time to time, but he seldom got through.  He was second-string while I was on the first team.  When I was running the play, he was playing defense.  It was his job to stop me, but I had more firepower in front of me opening up my path.  He would often be knocked to the ground before I even entered the hole.  I usually missed him, but not today!  Thankfully, he was not hurt, but it set me to thinking.

We were both second-year high school students on the same sophomore football team.  We practiced together and played the same position.  We both knew how to run play #23.  The 2 was code for a certain running back to carry the ball on a running play. We both ran through the 3 hole but at different times.  Each gap between the offensive linemen was a number.  So, the second number, the 3, was the path that the 2 running back was to take.  In the huddle, the quarterback would say 23 or 35, and all players knew who would get the ball, where to go, and how to block. This was practice.  The only difference between my buddy and me was that I was first-string, and he was second-string.  I had all the first-string linemen in front of me, whereas he had the second-string in front of him.  I was protected--he, not so much.  We took turns on offense and defense.  On defense, he would try to plug the hole but often was knocked down by the swift first-string offensive players.  He, like the other second-teamers, took a beating but never complained.  They were even told that to *letter* they would have to play in at least two-quarters of every game.  This seemed very, very wrong to me.  They had to work harder than any first-string player!

They made the team, did not get cut, endured beatings each and every day, didn't get much praise, and didn't complain.  Without them, how could the first-stringers ever practice game situations?   The starters would get school paper write-ups, and most students wouldn't even know who the second team players were.   Could I have accepted being second-string?  How were they able to do it--self-pride, self-worth, spunk, hope, masochism?  Did they just like the pain?

I had always been on the first team in any sport.  In grade school, I was a year younger than the rest of my class because I started school at five years old in the first grade.  I often played on night-time teams with the boys in the grade above me.  I know it sounds like bragging, but it is just to make my point--the idea of being on the second team was foreign to me!  The only thing I was missing was size, but I was quick, elusive,  coordinated, had great hands and was always protected by the bigger players.  I was seldom hurt.  How would I have handled being second-string? It never occurred to me; I would find out in my junior year!

I was promoted to the varsity basketball and baseball teams in my junior year.  I was told that I would be playing on the junior varsity football team. However, I declined the football advancement.  Not that I thought I should have gone up to the varsity--good gosh, ***NO***!   I may have been able to compete.  And I may have been second string. I did love football;  but, at 125 pounds, and looking at the size and weight of the junior varsity players, I decided that I wanted to live to fight another day.  If I had wanted to play varsity basketball and baseball, I would've had to do it from my *grave*!

I was the seventh man on the basketball team in my junior year.  I was a ball handler, a point guard, someone that could break a press.  I played in every quarter and even scored a few points.  Varsity baseball was where I first discovered the hardships of being on the second team.

I had been the MVP on the junior varsity baseball team and, next year,  expected to start right away on the varsity.  It turned out that in my junior year  I was to be a base coach for every game.  I only got in late in the game for defensive purposes because I had a good glove, or as a pinch-runner because of my quickness.  I would only get seven official ""at-bats"" during league.  It was to be a real eye-opener.  I worked just as hard, maybe harder, and still was not given as many swings in practice as the first stringers.  I was put in at a time when the game often was on the line and a mistake was unthinkable.  I had to worry about striking out because I only was given a few chances to prove myself.  *I WAS SECOND STRING* and **did not** like it.  But, I stayed!  Next year will be mine.  I had hope and desire!  These must be the feelings that others experienced in other activities and professions.  Where else are there second-stringers, I wondered?  I imagined that they too, might have only a few chances to prove themselves and would have to be ready and at the top of their game in a moments notice.

A few people come to mind:  the understudy for a stage performance;  the movie stand-in for the star doing a dangerous stunt or for the actress who insists on a body-double,  the second fiddle in an orchestra, the 2nd banana to the top banana in a vaudeville skit--each one of them waiting to have a chance to shine.   We have to remember how hard they have had to work to be ready for that magical moment.

When I finally managed to start on my college varsity baseball team, it was the second half of my second season.  I had worked hard and only when the starting center fielder flunked a class, making him ineligible for the rest of season, did I get to start with the first string.  I had known then what it was like to sit on the bench.  *But, what about Chuck?*

Chuck was our 3rd string catcher.  Not only that, but he was *OLD*.  Most of us were 19-21 years of age.  Chuck was 26, 3rd string, and in his final year to play.  He knew that there was a chance that he would never get in a game, but he showed up to practice each and every day and often was the first one in the clubhouse.  Chuck was a really nice guy-- a great teammate,  always in a good mood,  always smiling, did everything the coach asked him to do.  He was happy!  He was like the older brother that I never had. I would warm up with him before practice and games.  Finally, I had to ask him the question.  ""What keeps you going?""  His reply surprised me!

Chuck said that the story began in high school.  He said that he loved baseball and probably could have been the starting varsity catcher for at least two years.  He said that he liked to smoke and drink beer and skip classes.  By the time that he was a junior, he was so far behind in his classes and out of shape, that he couldn't compete anymore.  He barely finished school and had no idea what to do.  He decided to join the Army.  He learned discipline and the will to succeed.  When he left the military, he decided to go back to school, college.  He worked hard and had a 3.0 grade average and, as he did in the Army, missed being on a team.  He had to see if he could make the college baseball team, to find out what he had missed.  Chuck was thrilled just to be on the field.  Something inside of him told him that this what he needed to move on!!

There are many reasons to accept not being a starter.  So, I say to the hard working Second and Third Stringers,  Thank you!  **Thank you**!!  ***THANK YOU!***!!"
54,0,"My life was about to change.  It just missed me, but not my new freshly painted, 10-year-old 1950 Studebaker coupe. It was around 7 A.M and was my first day of junior college.  I was nervous because I had no idea as to what to expect.   I had just parked and got out of the car when a baseball bat came whirling over the car parked next to mine just barely missing me.  Why would someone throw a baseball bat at me?  Did I take a reserved parking spot?  Was I in the teachers' parking lot?  What did I do?  Is this how new students were greeted?  I picked it up looking for an attached note such as when a brick is thrown through a window as a warning for someone to get ""out of town.""  No note. I didn't see anyone.  Why me?  I needed to get to class, but then the answer came out of nowhere!   I first heard the voice, ""Sorry!"", it said.  My life was about to change--for the better.

A blond head peered around the corner of the next car. ""Sorry"" , it said with a quiver.  Next came the rest of a tall skinny body.  He was maybe six feet tall but I was only 5'7"".  The average height at that time was 5'10"".  His eyes, forehead, pursed lips, and overall demeanor showed that he was concerned and under some stress.  ""Is anyone hurt?  Did the bat do any damage?,"" he asked. I told him that no one was hit, but my car let out a yip.  He was a real car buff.  He introduced himself to me, and the two of us proceeded to check out the side of my new $29.95 custom Earl Scheib paint job.  He offered to pay any damages.  We could only find a very small paint chip and less of a dent.  The Studebaker was fine.  He picked up the errant bat and said that he had to get to class.  I remembered that I did too.  We exchanged names and phone numbers.  As he left, he turned and said, ""I'll always be around, see you later.""  Always around, he was.  For nearly 60 years, he was my best friend, my best buddy!  Yes, my life was about to change--for the better.

Al had been talking to a couple of friends in the parking lot.  He was swinging a wooden bat which had no tape on the handle, and it accidentally slipped out of his hand and up and over two cars and into mine.   How was it possible that it had done no damage? I ducked but heard it hit.  In fact, it was just the opposite!  A baseball bat had been our introduction.  It was, as if by fate,  meant to happen, that it was scripted, that GOD had a hand in it.  Never-the-less, he was to become my BEST friend for life.

Some people believe that the relationships you have in this life, you have also had some time in your previous lives.  It was as if the universe had to find a way for us to meet again.  And, a baseball bat seemed like a novel way to do it.  At a school with thousands of students, it was .. his bat that sliced through the morning sky to say, ""Hi, I want you to meet an old friend.""

Later that day, we found ourselves in the same physical education class, a tennis class.  I had never played before but was very good at most sports.  Al had come to the warm Californian climate from Chicago because of all the allergies that he had.  He could not have dairy products or eat things with eggs in the mixture.  I was fast, he was slow.  Neither of us had had any tennis lessons and both developed unorthodox tennis strokes.  We played for 50 years, and I seldom beat him, if ever.  We were told we were going to partner up in the tennis class.  The teacher randomly selected the partners.  There were around 40 novice tennis players in the class.  She would point to any two players and say ""you are partners.""  Al and I were unaware we were both in this class, but, that's right, she pointed to me and then to Al.  It was as if everything had, once again, been preordained just like the bat hitting my car.  I wondered if he felt the same way.  Neither of us ever mentioned it.

As slow as Al was, he seemed to sense where the ball would be before it crossed the net.  I relied on quickness whereas he relied on extra-sensory perception.  He was lethal when he was at the net.  We played in numerous tournaments and did reasonably well each time.  I ended up coaching high school tennis, and he became one of the best tennis players at a very nice country club.

In our 20's and 30's, we played in some full court and half court basketball leagues.  I had played high school varsity basketball for two years.  We had won many tournaments, had a 21-5 record one year, and had beaten many very good teams.  Al had played no high school basketball mostly because he was sickly in his youth.  But could he shoot!  He had the ""touch"".  He had no jump shot but an unbelievable set-shot.  He could make a basket from almost anywhere.   He had a running hook shot ala Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, only better..*.yes, better*!   He could hit it15 feet out from the basket(imagine a 15-foot arc) while on the dead run, right or left handed!!  His hook could never match the beauty of Kareem's sky hook since Al's was more of a line-drive.  Kareem would carefully set up his move, but not Al.

He would shoot on the dead run at any time from anywhere.  Players on opposing teams would, at first, just let the skinny awkward looking guy shoot ""at will"" until they found out that he seldom missed this running 15-foot hook.  They began to put their best defensive player on him only to find that Al needed to be ""double-teamed"".  They would talk ""dirt"" to him.  They needed to rough him up or triple-team him, but this would leave the rest of us wide open.  Soon they stopped the rough stuff as they respected him throughout the various leagues.  A new strategy was needed---don't let anyone throw the ball to him!  I already knew that because when the ball was thrown to him, it would never come back.  I don't think he knew what the word *pass* meant.  He always shot the ball.  We had a lot of fun playing in night basketball leagues in an old gym at a nearby college.

I believe the baseball bat was never meant to hit me, rather it was an introduction to a life-long best friend.   I have many stories about Al that I intend to write in the future, so don't be surprised to see the recurrence of his name.

Al passed away quietly three years ago this December watching a football game at an inn at a local mountain resort while on vacation with his wife.   I still miss him.  He would call my wife Trish instead of Pat.  He would add ""*ish*"" to many other words like ""let's meet at eightish"".  *Gallivant* was his word for doing something.  He was as nice of a person one could be lucky enough to know.  He always had my back.

Luckily, it hit my car...NOPE, not luckily, **it was MEANT to be**.  The baseball bat was just an introduction to my life-long best friend!  My life was about to change--for the better!"
55,0,"I think that people are inherently good.  I strongly believe in the Golden Rule.  I treat others as I would like to be treated:  Holding doors open for those that I sense would have trouble.  Giving up my seat to those that look as though they might need it: men, women, and the elderly.  Being considerate!  Saying thank you, and you're welcome!  Thinking of others before myself.  Writing ""thank you"" letters when appropriate.  Not being mean to animals (perhaps excluding snakes and spiders unless they keep to themselves).  I had always helped, and it felt good. But slowly, I began to notice things were changing.  I still wanted to help others, but it was getting more difficult as I was passing the 3/4 of a century mark.  I would tell my friends (just kidding) that I couldn't associate with people that old.  When did I get this old?  I have children over 50 and grandchildren over 20.  Has society changed?  Are its members less caring?  I have heard this.

&#x200B;

I went to a take-out pizza establishment last week.   Going in, I held open the door for a young lady who said ""thank you"", and when I entered, she insisted that I order before she did.  The place was busy with little space to stand.  When I picked up my order, I had to squeeze my way to the door as there was not much room, and I was having some trouble walking.  As I got to the door, it opened.  Automatic I thought.  I looked down to find a boy of about ten holding it for me and smiling.  ""Did I look that feeble?"" I thought.  I said thank you, and he was smiling as he said ""your welcome.""  No one had told him to do it.  He was on his own.  I think it made him feel good!  Someone had taught him manners.  It feels good to help others.

&#x200B;

Another pizza place I go to has a flight of stairs to overcome.  Going up is not a problem, but going down with a pizza in hand is.  One of the young employees asked if she could help.   I said ""sure"".  I went ahead, got in the car, and she handed it through the car window to me, all-the-while sporting a wide grin.  Thanks, I said.  You are welcome, she replied.  Every time I get pizza and she is working, she immediately says ""I'll give it to you through the window.""  I think it makes her feel as good as it does me!

&#x200B;

When I go to the grocery store, I buy 2-3 weeks of food because I don't know when I will have the energy again(pain when walking, but getting better).  The box boys or girls will always ask if they can empty the shopping cart for me.  Then they bag the groceries and ask if they can help me load them into the car.  I always ask them if they can go home with me and unload them and put them away too.  They smile, we joke.  I ask them if they are still in school and where they are attending.  They are always friendly.  I say thank you and they say ""you're welcome"".

&#x200B;

When did I get old?  I stopped playing competitive softball at 70 due to some injuries, but I received a call from one of my softball friends saying that he is forming an 80-year old competitive team and would like me to play on the team.  It was nice of him to ask, and I do think he meant it.  As soon as I get rid of my pain, I will start slowly working out again.  My mind says yes, but my body isn't so sure.  I am ""bird-walking""----getting off the subject now, so must get back on point.

&#x200B;

I had an appointment with a pain clinic.  I knew the area well but had never seen the medical office.  I had the address, but could not find any numbers on the buildings.  My car does not have GPS(2002 model), and I was ten minutes late for the meeting.  I had to park across the street in a dirt parking lot.  The street had moderate traffic, but I managed to get across.  The curb must have been at least 18-24 inches high. It seemed like an insurmountable wall, but by holding on to the front of a parked car, I managed to get up.  Now there were four steps to climb and a heavy door to open.  At the top of the stairs was a man of about 35 years old. He had tattoos on his arms and neck, and smiled at me and politely opened the door.   I said thanks. I was told that other patients would have to be seen before me, and the wait might be an hour or more.  I decided not to wait.  I would go to the car, call my private doctor, tell him my pain situation and see if he would give me a shot for the it.

&#x200B;

As I left the pain center, the tattooed man stood at the base of the steps.  He smiled again and asked me if I needed any help.  Was he waiting for me to leave so he might mug me?  I wobbled down the 4 steps and said no thank you, my car is just across the street.  He said, ""You don't look as though you can go that far"".  ""If you give me your keys,  I will go over and get it for you.""  I thought, ""Sure, then you will drive the car away."" My car was a 15-year old Hyundai SUV.  I didn't trust him even though he had opened a door for me and smiled at the same time.  Surely, he had devious intentions. ""This doesn't look good,"" I thought. So, I said, ""I can make it.""   He backed off but watched as I tried to negotiate the 18 in curb.  There was no car for me to grab for balance. He began to approach me again, and I began to sweat.  There was no one else nearby.  He put one arm around my waist and proceeded to lift me off the ground.  Then, oh so gently, moved me off the curb and onto the street 18 inches below.  ""I hope this helps,"" he said with a smile.  ""I'll watch as you cross the street"", he said still smiling.  I felt bad that I had jumped to conclusions and again said ""thanks"".

&#x200B;

I called my doctor whose office was 10 minutes away.  His nurse told me that the doctor said to come in, and he wanted to know if she could give me the shot.  I said that would be fine, but I will have a lot of trouble getting out of the car much less getting around to the office as the parking was in the back.  He worked from the house that he had turned into his office.  He was the only doctor that worked there.  I had known him and his nurse for 25 years.  She was cute and always in a good mood.  She came to the back, needle in hand, had me open the driver's side door, had me pull one side of my pants down an inch exposing my left hip, and with great joy jammed the needle in it.

""This doesn't look good!,"" I said smiling.  ""People might get the wrong idea!""  She laughed, I smiled.  This didn't look good, but neither did the fellow with the tattoo.  This was all about people that I had met recently and the good that they had done, and how it feels to help others."

""I'll help you wrap it,"" she said. It was her Christmas present, and she has said the same thing every year for the last thirty years. ""No,"" I say, ""I can do it myself."" So, saying that, I close the bedroom door.

She will stand at the door and turn the knob threatening to enter as I have the package exposed sitting on top of the first Christmas paper I find. ""Can I help you find anything---scissors, scotch tape, ribbons, bows, name tags?""

""No, I'm just fine"", I'll say. ""Now, where are the scissors?"". ""In the top drawer of the desk,"" she says from the outside of the door. ""The scotch tape, the ribbons, bows and name tags are in the box under the ironing board.""

""How does she do that?"" I mean, I didn't say anything out loud. I think we've been married too long! Come to think of it, she always knows what is in the package before she opens it. She finishes my sentences. She'll say things like, ""an In-N-Out hamburger sounds good"", when I've been thinking about it. I hope we're not beginning to look alike because I don't think she would look good with a bald spot. Well, back to work.

There were two gifts to wrap. The first was a package of two plug-in flashlights. It would have been easy to put them into a shoe box and wrap the square edges, but I thought it would drive her crazy to wrap it as it had come from the shelf. This way I didn't have to be neat. As long as all parts were covered, the job would be done. I covered the holes I made with Christmas stickers--looked great! Scotch tape the corners, slap a bow and name tag with 1-4-3 on it (code for ""I Love You"") and one down and one to go. Better get another roll of scotch tape. She must use dozens of rolls with all the packages she wraps.

""Sure you don't need any help?"", she says each time she passed the bedroom. I didn't. The first package took twenty minutes. If you want to do something right, it takes time. I once built a car from a weekend kit. The directions said it could be done in one weekend. I took ten months. Things take time.

The second gift was in a box with square corners. It was an espresso/cappuccino maker and about a cubic foot in size. I turned the package upside-down because I wanted all the taping to be on the bottom. I cut the paper the right length, but there seemed to be too much paper on the sides. How do wives measure the right amount? No matter, that's what scissors are for. I tried to fold the corners into little triangles that folded together at the center. Too much paper. Get the scissors. Now the corners fit, almost. Some of the box showed. No problem! Cut a patch and scotch tape it over the opening. The corners seemed to bunch up. No problem! Get the fat ribbon and pull it over the corners. How does she tie the ribbon? No problem--scotch tape. Put a ribbon in each corner and a name tag in the middle. Done--30 minutes, a new record. Looks good!

""Are you alright in there,"" she wanted to know. I said, ""all finished, and by the way, you ran out of scotch tape!""

Now it was time to make a grand entrance with both gifts. I would have to give her a couple of innocuous hints as to the contents, and a few phony places where I had shopped, and I was finished (until our anniversary in January).

I put them under the tree next to the ones she had wrapped for me. Maybe it was the change in the air temperature, or rough handling, or just bad scotch tape,but the presents just didn't have that professional look that they did in the bedroom.

But, it didn't matter. For thirty years, we've done it this way. It's expected. It's a ritual. It's our ritual. She knows that it's DONE WITH LOVE, and she wouldn't have it any other way."

""Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men; the shadow knows!"". But, who knows what lurks in the hearts of women? It's for sure that husbands don't, and neither does the shadow. Take my wife, please! (Sorry, old joke). We've been married for thirty years, and we went together for five years before that. So, you'd think I'd know her. Yet, it happened again last week.

""Where's the flashlight,"" she said, as she opened a drawer in the kitchen. ""I think I last saw it in the bedroom on the nightstand, but I'm sure it needs batteries,"" I said. ""No problem"", she said, ""I have more in the freezer""(first place I would have looked).

""What are you going to do?"" I asked. ""To do something I should have done a long time ago"", she sneered. ""I have to kill"", and with that, dressed in a bathrobe, ear muffs, and bedroom slippers, she turned on the flashlight, slid open the sliding glass door, and entered the backyard.

It was 40 degrees at 9:00 PM ,and she was gone for almost an hour. I was worried, but the football game still had three minutes to go. The door flew open. ""How did it go?"" I said. ""Don't have time for chit-chat"", she said, heading for the front door. ""You have to strike when it's not expected. She didn't look well. I needed more popcorn.

Twenty minutes later, the front door swung open, and I could hear sirens. ""They're dead, and I feel great!"" she said. ""By the way, did you hear the fire engine?""

I had heard that hunters shine lights in the eyes of swift animals such as deer to paralyze them in their tracks. My wife had managed to stop the swift-moving, hard-backed snail using the same method. And, as in the ""Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"", she steps on them--hundreds a night. It's a slaughter, the Iraqis had a better chance of winning. Night after night she searches them out. Not weather, company, or her favorite television show stops her. At any moment, as if she is some kind of controlled robot, she will jump to attention, grab the flashlight, and enter the war zone. Yes, Virginia, there is a terminator, and she is my wife!

Neither the Shadow nor I will ever understand what lurks in the heart of my wife. How can a woman, who wakes her husband up in the middle of the night insisting that he catch a moth because it is going to dive-bomb her hair in the dark, be so vicious when it comes to the dangerous snail?

""A little moth isn't going to hurt you, go back to sleep!"" I say. She says, ""he'll make me hurt myself."" ""Right"", I thought. ""That makes sense. Leave me alone, and go back to sleep."" ""No"", she says, ""Neither one of us is going to sleep until you catch him."" ""How do you know there's a moth in here?"" ""I heard his wings fluttering over my head. He's going to get in my hair, and I'm going to jump out of bed and run around the room bumping into things"", she cried. It's like being around Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. She may be boarding on Sybil.

Yesterday, there was a can of beer in our refrigerator. ""What's this?"" I ask. We don't drink, and alcohol is never found in our house. She wouldn't even let the roofers bring beer into our yard when they were working in 100-degree weather. ""Are you going to wash your hair with it?"" (I had heard that women will do this). ""No!"" She looked at me as if I had no understanding as to what was going on--which I didn't! ""I'm giving it to the snails tonight"".

Had there been a ""truce"", and no one had told me? ""The ladies on television said that snails are drawn to beer and will drown themselves in it"", she stated triumphantly and proceeded to put out four saucers of beer in various parts of the garden.

The next morning she found the saucers just as full as she had left them. ""I don't understand"", she said. ""What kind of beer did you buy?"" ""Lite"", she said. I didn't ask her why-- didn't want to know. ""Next time, buy the imported kind"", I volunteered. ""Don't be stupid"", she pouted. ""This is serious."" ""Salt! That's the answer. The ladies on television said to try salt."" Now, what was she going to do, give them high blood pressure? And, who are these ladies on television?

Two days later at 9:00 PM, she rose from the couch with that zombie look on her face, and with a cold, emotionless voice, uttered those chilling words, ""WHERE'S THE FLASHLIGHT?"""
59,0,"There are some things that a husband should never do: cheat on his wife, cook without cleaning up, go shopping with her, or LOOK IN HER PURSE.  These are all no-win situations.

""Have you seen my keys"", I said. ""I was holding them for you last night.  They're in my purse"", she says. ""Can you get them for me"", I inquire.  She says, ""My purse is hanging on the bedroom doorknob. You can get it yourself"".

I've been through this before. It's like opening Pandora's Box, like being Alice in Wonderland, like falling into a Black hole.  There are things there that you don't want to know.  There is order in disorder, and there seems to be no end.  No husband should have to look in his wife's purse.

It's a no-win situation.  If I find my keys, she will want to know why I, ""had to tear her purse apart to find them"".  And if I can't find them (even though I hear them jiggling), I will have to endure her barrage of, ""you can never find anything"", or ""you don't know how to look for things"" (as if there's more than one way).

The purse was one of six that she currently owned.  I would have guessed a number closer to the number of states in the union.  She said she only uses two. The dark navy blue one is for the fall and winter. The other one is white for spring and summer, and she starts using it on Easter Day.  She also has several small clutch purses (with many compartments) for when we go out, a fanny pack for swap meets, and a huge gunny sack for when we go to baseball games.  I've carried the same wallet since...Nixon was President.

I reached in and found them.  On the first try I had found keys--her keys on a huge safety pin.  I put them to the side.  I shook the purse.  I could hear my keys laughing at me.  There were two sides to the purse and four zippers.  I would find my keys, but not before emptying her purse on the bed.

For those of you too timid to venture into the unknown, let me list what I found:

""Did you find your keys,"" she yelled from the kitchen. ""Right where you said they'd be"", I replied as I hurriedly stuffed things back in.  I had filled the purse, but there were items still on the bed.  How could that be?  Maybe if I ate a few pieces of gum, used some of the Kleenex, and hid some coupons, I could close the purse.  There, everything restored!

I held up the keys like a trophy and said that they were right where she had said. ""Great"", she said. ""I have my purse organized so that when I'm driving,  I can just reach over, and without looking, find things"".

""I need some aspirin!"" I say!

""LOOK IN MY PURSE!"""
60,0,"""Let it go free, and if it return, then it's yours."" I'll never know if that would have held true for ""Ike"". He ""escaped"" a couple of times. He was a free spirit running with the wind until I would eventually corner him and bring him home. I couldn't give him the chance to return home on his own because he wasn't mine.

&#x200B;

He came to our home and stayed for a year and a half. He was a one year old black Labrador retriever, and he was beautiful! No, he was beautiful, regal, and gentle. We put a sign on the gate that said ""beware of dog"". It should have said ""beware of dog, he may love you to death"". He loved everyone, the gardener, the pool man, the meter readers, children, my wife, and me, but he wasn't mine.

&#x200B;

At first, he was expected to stay outdoors all the time. Two days later, he not only had the run of the house, but he had his own blanket at the end of our bed. He would sleep at my feet when I watched television. He would move room to room with me. He constantly laid his head on my lap and would often sit next to me--He just plopped down like he was human! I loved him but I knew he couldn't be mine. In my head, I wanted it to be, but I couldn't let it happen. It wouldn't be right.

&#x200B;

Whenever I went into the backyard, he would race towards me stopping just out of reach, and go into his crouch, front legs kneeling and rump in the air. It was chase time. Sometimes he ran with one of his many toys, and other times he just wanted to play ""catch me if you can"". I used to do the old fake throwing the ball routine with him. He wised up to that one in no time.

&#x200B;

My wife bought him a rubber squeaky toy shaped like a barbell. We kept it in the house. He went for it the minute he came in. Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, and on and on and on it went until he decided to force me to take it. I would throw it in the house to my wife's cringe and to his delight. He would bound over anything that got in his way to get that wet squeaky toy (he was graceful). This would go on until my arm got tired. He never did.

&#x200B;

On the weekends, I tried to find time to take him to a school nearby, early in the morning, and let him run. He loved this, and I was sad that I didn't do it more often. I was always careful to guard the only gate out of the playground. One day, a boy about 11 was jogging on the playground. I hadn't seen him, but Ike had, and off he went to run with the boy. The boy thought he was being attacked. I yelled to tell him that Ike was friendly, but he was too far away. The boy jumped a fence before Ike could get there. I suppose I would have been frightened too, seeing this large, sleek, graceful animal racing towards me. When he was finished running, I would put his leash on him. He never tugged at it. He would jump into the front seat right behind the driver's side as if to say, ""Where to?"" He was always ready for me, but he wasn't mine, and I had to keep reminding myself.

&#x200B;

""Dad, escrow closes on Friday. I'm renting a truck on Saturday. Will you and Mom be able to help us move? I'll take the cats on Monday, and if you don't mind, I'll leave Ike at your place for another week until we get settled.""

&#x200B;

Ike wasn't my dog. He was my son's. He had come home to live for a few months and then found an apartment, but couldn't take Ike. Ike was his. They would go hiking in the mountains where Ike could run free. He would always run way ahead, jump over rocks, swim streams, and always return without being called. They were buddies. Ike adored him. My son would set him free, and he would always return. I was afraid to set him free. I think he would have returned, but I couldn't take the chance because he wasn't mine.

&#x200B;

""I came to pick up Ike"", my son said. ""I guess you can get the house back to normal now. There won't be anymore dog messes to clean up. Maybe the grass will grow back soon if you reseed, and you can clean the dog hairs off the furniture"", he stated. ""Yeah"", I said, as I put Ike's leash on and led him to the truck. I could barely speak as I opened the passenger door. He jumped in and immediately sat behind the steering wheel. I guess things will get back to ""normal"" now.

&#x200B;

As the truck drove down the alley, the two of them were sitting side-by-side as if they were on a date. They were made for each other. They were buddies. I'll still see him occasionally. It is still going to be hard to remember that HE WASN'T MINE!"
61,0,"This is a short story that is based on true events, with slight embellishment.  I hope you enjoy and it brings warmth to your heart.

It was beautiful.  It didn't wobble.  Its spiral cut through the crisp November air.  It seemed to float toward its target.  It was the final play of the game because the lunch bell had rung just as the football was centered.  There was victory in the air.  There would be homeroom bragging rights.  They would be heroes to the eighth grade girls.  All Bret had to do was catch the ball-- just catch the ball!

The quarterback that day was John U.  He was thirteen, handsome, well-built, and excellent student, liked by everyone, including me, his eighth grade teacher, and fortunate referee of this noontime game.  This was 20 years ago, and John U. was a young Joe Montana.  He was fast, smart, and threw the most beautiful ""left-handed"" pass.  John had it all. Yes.  John U. was special, but it wasn't until that unforgotten last pass to Bret, that I realized just how special he was.

Did Bret catch that pass? Well, Bret was average height, overweight, soft, with no muscle tone.  He **was** that person that couldn't walk and, you know, the gum thing.  His hair was never combed (John's was perfect).  His clothes were unkempt (John looked like a fashion statement).  He had a big nose that held up the thickest, heaviest pair of glasses I had ever seen on a kid and they were always sliding down.  He was close to being blind.  In the classroom, Bret was an average student, getting mostly C's.  The other students weren't mean to him; they just left him alone.  Bret had nothing going for him except to be the recipient of a John U. game ending, championship winning, perfect spiral pass.

Bret was a ""rusher"" on defense.  He had to try to catch the other quarterback.  He was very slow, and his glasses kept slipping.  Furthermore, the other players enjoyed blocking him, and he spent a great deal of time doing ""nature study"" on the ground.  On offense, he was the center.  Again, his glasses would slide down as he leaned over the ball.  He often centered the ball into the ground because he was nervous over being ""canned"" as he hiked the ball.  But, he did his job and picked himself up after every play and never complained.  He got beat up each play, got yelled at for not blocking, and never had the ball thrown to him - until that faithful moment!

John knew that time was running out and that this was the final play.  As the referee, I stood by the huddle and listened to John make that final play.  The touchdown line was five yards away.  The defense was going to rush hard.  There would be one more player on the defense than on offense because no one needed to guard Bret. He'd never caught a ball in his life.  John knew this!

John told his ends to block once and then head for the corners.  This would draw the defense away from the middle.  He then looked at Bret and calmly said, ""Bret, after you hike the ball, I want you to run over the goal line and turn around.  There will be no one there.  I'm going to throw it to you.""  The other players protested and Bret, who never said anything, said that he always gets knocked down when he hikes the ball.  John said with a stern tone to his voice, ""that's the play!""

The ball was centered on the count of two.  The ends streaked for the corners.  The defense followed the ends.  Bret was knocked down.  John faded back.  Bret recovered and staggered for the goal line.  He turned; he was alone--no one for miles.  John dodged the on-rushers.  His eyes focused on Bret.  Bret's glasses were at the tip of his nose.  John let fly, and it was beautiful.  It didn't wobble.  It was on target.  It was thrown so softly that a small child could catch it.  But, this was Bret, and it hit him in the stomach.  He wrapped his arms around it, and his face grimaced with fear as the ball slid down to his knee, then his foot, and then the ground.

The boy that had nothing going for him had dropped the ball.  Boos rang out from the crowd, his teammates began to charge him with rage in their eyes.  Before they could reach Bret, a voice rang out from behind, ""Sorry, Bret, MY FAULT, I THREW IT TOO HARD."" And John raced past the other players and immediately threw his arms around Bret's shoulder.  ""My fault"", he said as he glared at the other players.

The dropped pass was never mentioned again.  Bret was not a person who had nothing.  He had John U. I always knew that John U. was special.  I just didn't know how special.

It has been twenty years since that incident.  I don't have any contact with John or Bret.  It was one of those moments that keeps coming back to me.  We must take care of each other!  There will always be times when the best thing one can say is ""My Fault, I...""."

When I went to college I wasn‚Äôt adjusting well. I had trouble making friends, and even though I loved my roommate I was lonely. It made me think of that show and how I missed it so for Christmas I asked my parents if they could buy me some dvds of sailor moon. Buying by series seem to be expensive and still are. But on Christmas I opened literally every episode that was ever released in English. It took me a year, but I watched every episode. I loved it. It really helped me through a tough time to have this nostalgic show to relive. 

I‚Äôve told my parents how much I love it, but I don‚Äôt think they truly know how much those dvds meant to me. To this day they sit proudly on my shelf in my house with my husband. 

What made me think of this is I currently have an account for Funimation. And my husband is binge watching Dragon Ball Z. 

Just want to shout out to parents that always try their hardest to make their kids happy. Even when they‚Äôre grown up and out of the home. Love you Mom and Dad. "

66,0,"So, it's Valentine's Day, and due to some really shitty choices on my part, my ex-boyfriend of almost 4 years, and I are not together anymore. 

It's all my fault, I royally screwed up and I'm feeling it especially hard today. 

So, I'm sitting at work eating lunch, watching RedLetterMedia videos trying to cheer up a bit when a delivery man knocks on my office door. He cheerfully greets me and hands me an Edible Arrangement.  

The card inside reads: ""Happy Valentine's Day, buftieboy! We love you and are very proud of you. Love always, Mom and Dad."" 

I almost cried and feel like crying while writing this. I felt so alone and unlovable, and it was such a kind gesture. 

What a fantastic reminder to never take your parents for granted. 

I immediately called my dad and thanked him and told him I loved him. 

Things have been tough these past few months, but I'm 70 days sober today, working at a job that I actually really love and I can't be more grateful for my parents than I am right now. "

68,0,"Hello everyone. I have started a [gaming YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwn6-MD4tWZQ0loPpYUQBUw/videos) for children and young people where the content can be reliably content appropriate.

I have worked with children and young people for over 8 years, and I have been a gamer for even longer.

With a lot of gaming content aimed at children and young people I believe that some of the games are not suited for them, e.g. grand theft auto and even five nights at Freddy‚Äôs can have a negative impact on younger children who are watching let‚Äôs play. In addition some of the language used by a lot of youtubers can be seen as offensive and most would not want their children repeating what is said.

There is also a flood of content aimed at children with a [malicious intent](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-39381889) (such as the videos with the most popular random tags to generate views or videos made to look friendly only to have shock value)  with many still getting though the YouTube kids app.

So, that‚Äôs why I have started this channel. The games I play will range between E for everyone and T for teens (e.g. overwatch). I will also be keeping the language clean.

This is the first time I have ever done video/sound editing as well as video game commentary. So it will be a learning process. I fear that it will start off abit cringey and low quality, but the more I do it the better I will get. 
As of this post I have only a few videos on the channel but I aim to have at least 3 videos added each week.

69,0,"Ok so today about an hour ago I was in the dollar store for food, the end of the month is the hardest time for my fianc√©e and I as we live off my ssi and food stamps. 

I'd gotten just enough and was so certain I'd counted everything down to pennies out as I'd be using cash then my card to buy it. A few cans of food, some frozen things to make a good meal and juice. It was declined twice (my card) and I started sweating and heading toward a panic attack. (I suffer from severe anxiety disorder due to ptsd) 

There was a little line behind me and while the lady at the register was being extremely nice I was upset over making it harder on her and keeping people waiting. My card was short 1.27 I was about to void everything and give up when I heard an older fella in line and this happened:

Gent: I'll pay the dollar. 
Lady in front of him: You got twenty seven cents? I'll help pay it for him. 

It all happened before I could fully register, my card was used for most of it then these two seperate people, strangers to me and each other, covered the last of it so I could get it all and get going. I've never met any of them before and I thanked them repeatedly for it then hurried out to the car. 

I closed the door and just started crying. My fianc√©e was worried of course. I told her what happened, she struggled not to cry too. 

In the past I've given before to people that have needed it as far as I saw but I didn't know how it felt. Now I do and I just wish somehow I could really just show them what that little bit they did...how much that meant to me. 

So to them and others that help others, Thank You. I hope you all have a fantastic day and as I'll do moreso than before, be good to your fellow humans. "

Hate on it all you like, I think it is a dumb waste of money but a certain 8 year old thinks otherwise.  So, got the zoomer with a lot of effort and beyond the silly thing not working I'm golden.

Got home from work close to 1am tonight.  Wrapped up presents in the appropriate wrapping paper (ya know santa gifts have to be in 'his paper' and non-santa gifts are in other colours).  btw - this is a rule in this house... seriously, if I fucked this up tonight I'd be in trouble. :D

Merry Xmas all, enjoy the holidays with your families and friends and if you have to work them - don't work too hard.

72,0,"A quick bit of backstory:

I live with my grandparents and my cousin, who has Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Normally when I go to the store, I'm with my grandmother and cousin, and my grandmother gets enough groceries to fill up one side of the back seat and the trunk. I have a small car, you see. A Kia Rio.

Today, however, it was just my grandmother and I, and we just needed to get a few things. When we finished checking out, a lady that looked just a little younger than my grandmother (who is 70) got in line and started checking out. She had forgotten something and ran back to get it. 

At this point, I asked my grandmother if she minded waiting, so that I could help the lady. She said it was fine, and I began unloading her cart. When she came back she thanked me for my help, and once she finished I asked if she wanted me to help her put her groceries in her car once I helped my grandmother put our stuff in my car.

""Oh, I don't have a car, honey,"" the woman said.

I then offered to give her a ride home. It was getting warm outside, and she had quite a few groceries to carry. She was grateful. I don't think I've ever heard someone say how much they appreciated what I was doing for them. 

She gave me hugs after we got all her groceries out of my car. :) "

74,0,"A dream started out with Mum going down the road to visit a friends house down the lane. Come suppertime, she should have come home to make supper already. Should even have been cooked and on the table by then. Dad phones people about if they had seen her somewhere and may have even phoned that friend. Not much info was given in the dream about this other than seeing Dad on the phone.

The dream shoots forward two weeks later to find my sister and I worrying our heads off in the girls' room about Mum as we still have heard nothing. Still no information given from the dream whether she was kidnapped for money or other sinister purposes. This was never determined in that dream.

Fast forward once again to another 2 weeks. Mum is suddenly returned, unharmed and safe in the second police cruiser that is behind the first one pulled up into the driveway. She comes out the back door of the police cruiser and looks very healthy and safe. Nobody hurt her, apparently. Must be that they fed her and just held her up. Dream just showed her coming home. Dream stopped at that point.

TL;DR
Mum was kidnapped for unknown reasons for a month, and Mum was finally returned unharmed by anyone by the police. This was a bad dream turned a good dream."

Why comics?
 
Whether I‚Äôm down, sad, stressed, bored, happy, relaxed, content, or tired I can read a comic book and be good, even if just for a moment. I love comics. I know people who say ‚ÄúI never understood it; never got into comics.‚Äù And that‚Äôs fine, not everyone is going to be into the same thing.
 I‚Äôve had friends and family ask me ‚ÄúWhy comics?‚Äù Why do I like them, why do I enjoy reading them, why do I like writing them so much?  Well my love for the medium goes back to when I was a little boy; my father would bring home issues of Fantastic Four and Spider-Man. Though they were cheaper back then we couldn‚Äôt really afford to buy off the shelf so we would find old issues at rummage sales. I didn‚Äôt think about continuity of the issues when reading as a child, I just liked comic books; as I grew older I started paying more attention to that. Things changed over time: my preferences, likes and dislikes, etc, etc. but the love for the medium has always remained. When I was a kid I could read random issues and be cool with it and as I grew I needed to know what happened; what was going on surrounding the issue. As I never had much money to keep up with the latest stories I never paid much attention to the overall continuity plus there were so many great stories in the past to still read. So I never really saw it as ‚Äúmissing out‚Äù on something as I always had some to read.
 
So many comic readers/fans have different ways to going about their reading. I have one friend who loves the month by month waiting and when it‚Äôs time to go pick up the new issues he‚Äôs right there at the comic shop. Over the years I‚Äôd lost interest in reading issue by issue and developed a love for trade paperbacks (TPB) ‚Äì which for those of you who don‚Äôt read comic books, it‚Äôs a run of a series (usually a complete storyline) collected into one book. When explaining it to people I like to compare it to TV shows on DVD: you watch an episode with commercials and wait week by week, season by season; with comics you read them month by month and wait and there are ads within them (commercials). Now, when you buy a season of a show you get the entire run of that season without commercials and extras and when you buy a trade paperback you get a run (whether it be in its entirety or sectioned off) commercial free and often times extras (bonus sketches and notes). To this day I prefer trades and graphic novels, although there‚Äôs always great one-shots (a story meant for one issue) to be read. The few times I‚Äôve been lucky enough to go to a comic convention I‚Äôve been more enamored with the indie guys trying to get their work out there than I am the famous folks stopping by. If I‚Äôm at a convention and I see some artists or writers setting up shop with their single issues I‚Äôll check them out, surely, but on average I‚Äôd rather just have the complete story. I love the look and feel of the trades (paper and hard back) and they fit great on a bookshelf. I know I should show more support and be buying monthly but I don‚Äôt; as said, I just prefer a certain format. Just as some prefer single issues and I prefer collections, some would much rather have them digitally.
 
Just like there‚Äôs an ever growing problem with downloading movies and music (illegally) there‚Äôs the same problem with comics. Comic books get leaked the same as other mediums. I know people who download them from some source and say ‚ÄúHey I can‚Äôt afford it‚Äù. When I can‚Äôt afford comics, I just go without. I‚Äôll go a long time in between getting to buy books if the money‚Äôs not there; I have no problem re-reading stuff I have. I don‚Äôt download comics just as I haven‚Äôt looked too much into digital comics. I like holding them, opening them, the whole nine yards; just as I like having albums and movies. I‚Äôve seen some webcomics I‚Äôve liked but I just never keep up with them; honestly there‚Äôs rarely a TV show I keep up with either. I think I‚Äôm more prone to re-read a really good story several times than keep up with a long, spaced out continuity. Maybe someday the concept and appeal of the digital comics will hit me but I‚Äôm not there yet.
 
I‚Äôve heard people talk a lot of crap about comics and those who read them. They‚Äôll say they‚Äôre for kids and not real literature. Every time I hear someone say ‚Äúit‚Äôs kids‚Äô stuff‚Äù I hand them something and it usually turns their heads just as it turned my head before. When I was a kid I was very much into the superheroes and the mutants in tights and suits fighting oppressors, but as I grew up my mind was being opened to these different ideas. I was finding horror comics, science fiction comics that would rival things I‚Äôd seen in the movies, just conversation/dialogue driven comics, and comedies; it was becoming clear to me from an early age that you could do anything with these ‚Äòfunny books‚Äô.  I went from reading Superman and Batman to reading things like Roachmill and Satan‚Äôs Six. I could sit and read Daredevil and X-Men and then check out Tomb of Dracula and Boris the Bear. It‚Äôs art and it‚Äôs literature, regardless of what people want to tell you. Sure there‚Äôs some of it that‚Äôs typical and as a fan I can see some of it and say ‚ÄúEh, there‚Äôs no life to it. It looks like every other issue.‚Äù And then there‚Äôs some that are far from typical and really bring out those finer points of being both art and literature. That‚Äôs what makes creators stand out and sets artists apart from others; the feelings of reading a comic that range from ‚ÄúYeah, it looks like people in tights punching each other‚Äù to ‚ÄúWow, there‚Äôs something here, more people need to read this‚Äù. No medium is without flaws; there are a lot of comics I haven‚Äôt cared for and I can‚Äôt remember them to list them off. I still enjoy superheroes as I did as a kid, there‚Äôs just a lot more out there that I enjoy as well and gear towards. These days comics are all over the map: you have adaptations/translations of historical events, Bible stories, classic literary works, and more.
 
I was a kid reading a lot of Marvel & DC (I was never partial to one or the other as they both had so much to offer) and finding strange indie gems along the way when Image came out. I was then reading Spawn, Wetworks, Youngblood, and more; it was incredible for me at that age & I still love those titles today. While Image Comics were attacked for being ‚Äústyle over substance‚Äù I firmly disagreed and felt that while, yes the art was new and exciting, the stories and characters themselves had a lot to them as well. I was very interested in strange looking books like The Maxx and Trencher and so my tastes shifted from more superheroes in tights to more oddball titles. I then learned of other titles and other publishers like Dark Horse Comics and their roster. Beyond a few issues of random titles here and there I didn‚Äôt get a chance to read much of their stuff until later but when I did I was in heaven. Much like Image they have a stranger listing than the standards, a nice alternative to the mainstream. And of course there are loads of publishers out there with wonderful titles to their name. It‚Äôs always nice to find something that you‚Äôve never heard of and just grabs you so it‚Äôs nice to not be specific to just one kind of book or publisher. A lot of times I tend to find a creator (be it writer or artist) that I like and check out more of their work and then branch out.
 
As to the answer of the question, ‚ÄúWhy comics?‚Äù I would have to say that beyond my love for the art form as a whole, comics saved my life. That is my love for the medium of comic books helped me and kept me out of trouble. When kids act up in school adults go to what they‚Äôre listening to, watching, and what they‚Äôre reading; comics get attacked like any other medium about their content and influence. In my case things like comics, music, and movies all kept me out of problems. Growing up in some of the neighborhoods I grew up in and with some of the people I grew up around I was set to be a thief, an addict or dealer of sorts, or even a someday killer- comics kept me clean. There were enough people in epic throes I was reading about that I didn‚Äôt have an interest in going through too much of my own. Kids turn to different outlets and hobbies, I turned to my geek likings instead of crime; panels instead of cells. I had friends who went from liking the same thing, reading comic books right alongside me, who then quickly turned into the ‚ÄúUgh, man, comics are for kids.‚Äù They went on to choose more of a ‚Äòthug life‚Äô and a recurring appearance in court and jail. Not saying comics will save the world (but who knows?) or even save your life, but it helped me out. Instead of vandalizing places I looked to a different kind of art. Instead of hanging out with people who I couldn‚Äôt be myself around, I found more likeminded folks that I could jest and converse with and even open up to. It had always been a goal of mine to be in the comic business as opposed to the likes of crime. I know a lot of young people turned to academics and sports and turned out the same, quite right; I just went down a different path choosing art. It all kept me on the straight and narrow. So yeah, coming from the places I‚Äôve been around and the people I‚Äôd been around sticking to a simple thing as comics saved my life.
 
You‚Äôre not always going to be around people like you or have friends that like everything that you like, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to let that part of you die. I always enjoy showing people in my life something new, whether it‚Äôs showing a fellow comic reader, who mainly sticks to superheroes, something with less tights and alternate conflicts to what they‚Äôre used to, or, showing a love interest a piece of work that says ‚ÄúLooks, it‚Äôs far from just for kids.‚Äù
 
While some kids read comics and dream of being Spider-Man or Wolverine, I read them and dreamt of being the guy who gets to create such people. I started writing them as a kid but never wrote in script form; that came later. I would come up with a character and write as I drew them. Friends and I used to get together and just make stuff up and start drawing and filling panels. I had gotten to a point where I couldn‚Äôt draw what I was writing or what was in my head and it was frustrating. Instead of just working on the art and pushing forward (like I should have), I stopped drawing and focused on my writing. I wish I would‚Äôve kept with the art as I can‚Äôt draw to save my life now but on the other hand my writing had gotten better. I was able to come up with characters, storylines, and scripts without my lack of artistic talent holding me back. I‚Äôve been writing for years and my scripts have been getting tighter and all around better but now that finding reliable artists is an issue (no pun intended) I now wish more than ever that I would‚Äôve kept drawing. For me, it‚Äôs definitely a case of ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt use it, you lose it‚Äù. These days comic adaptations are bigger than ever and I‚Äôve heard people talk about wanting to get into the business just for all the money that will come; I just want to make comics as I love comics for what they are.
 
Though still unpublished, I continue to write my scripts and map out storylines and characters. Why? It makes me happy, and someday I‚Äôll find an artist who can do them justice. Besides just my love for comics I hope someday my work will help others like so many others‚Äô has helped me. I hope someday some kid reads my work and will be inspired to write just as I was inspired as a kid. Whether you‚Äôre into it or not, give something new a look; you might surprise yourself. If you love something and it‚Äôs helped you, regardless of how others view it, write about it. Let people know.

99,0,I'll be in the Masters of Music Performance program next fall!
100,0,"Before I got a girlfriend, I spent a lot of time wondering what it'd be like to have one - would it be wonderful? Would I have commitment issues, like I did with my schoolwork? I actually spent nearly two years obsessing over whether to ask one girl out, and when I finally got the guts to do it, she only asked to think about it (and said no a week later). 

It wasn't meant to be.

I spent a couple of weeks feeling emotionally empty. I was sad and, over everything else, feeling pretty goddamn stupid. ""*Why had I spent so much time worrying about it?*"" I thought to myself- I was in a pretty shitty state of mind, and my grades slipped, even though this was only over a period of two weeks.

Then *she* came along. 

We'd known each other for about a year. She was two grades below me, but only about seven months younger (I'm a pretty smart guy, or so they say, and I'm ahead of most people in my age group). I'd been slightly attracted to her the year before, but decided not to pursue it, as she had a boyfriend at the time.

In 2012, however, she had no such attachments, and our friendship rekindled - we hadn't seen each other for about six months, since she'd moved schools at the end of 2011, and we just *clicked*. We'd spend hours on Skype, just talking or enjoying having someone else on the other end of the line.

It was obvious that we had a mutual attraction, and a week after we started talking again, she asked me out. It was, and I can say this with absolutely no doubt (and, let me tell you, I've stared a mountain lion in the eye, so I know what fear is), simultaneously the scariest and most exciting moment of my life. I said yes, of course, immediately. 

Going back to what I was talking about at the start of this little essay - I was afraid that when I got a girlfriend I'd have to settle for a girl who wasn't smart or funny - that I'd just have to deal with the fact that I wouldn't be dating someone who shared my interests or my sense of humour.

Luckily, she shares many of my interests - she's a Redditor, she *loves* Pok√©mon, and, above all, she has a wonderfully twisted sense of humour (quite similar to mine).

It's been nearly a month now, and that initial burst of excitement hasn't worn off yet. I still get butterflies every time I think of her, and I think that I love her (this being my first romance, I can't tell between so-called puppy love and true love - I'm fairly sure that it's the latter).

So, in conclusion, I am unbelievably happy. I've never been this happy, and though there are other things going in my life which are a *little bit* shit, this overshadows them and, best of all, she makes me **not care** about it. If this is what being high on love is like, I don't ever want to come down.

Edit: Oh, and she is *hawt*.

I'm stressing, and I'm literally struggling to stay awake in class right now so I don't know how charming I'm going to be. After 6 hours of classes and working on papers, it's going to be tricky but I'll try.

I have wine, cheese, nice beer, and she's bringing over some snacks. I think it should be a nice night.

EDIT: I should have put a ""!"" in the title!

EDIT2: It's 2:30, she just left my place a little while ago. It went really well!"

Still not Slap!

No way was it PigFerret.

Lobsters don't get Karma.  

Pretty sure it wasn't Avnerd. 

Kerri?  I don't think so. 

And Max whacked through that part of town a long time ago.   I heard there were some guys waiting for him if he ever shows his face in such a low rent area again though.  

I wonder [who](http://www.reddit.com/user/anutensil) it could have been!?!?  It's Reddit's own [007](http://www.karmawhores.net/)! 

I wonder if she'll reserve me a seat near the window.

I look at the bowl... ""Sunflower seeds?""

GF : ""Yes, the recipe called for them.""

I think I did the jackie chan mindblown thing.

I then plucked one out of the mix, opened the shell... ate seed and put shell in the garbage.

We haven't laughed so hard in a long time.  The kind of laugh where your belly hurts.  Had to share... hope it brightens your day.

And that's not even all. I wish I could mention every time reddit made me laugh and then taught me something. 

Two more years coming, hopefully. That'd be something good, eh? "
106,0,My 26 year old daughter slept over last night. When I awoke she was sitting on the floor in the kitchen talking to her mom holding her pillow and sassafras. Her childhood teddy bear. It was very sweet. 
107,0,"I have seen a number of posts about FedEx and some of the horrible treatment of packages by their worst employees.  Here is a story about an excellent one:

My dad got me a hat for Christmas.  It didn't fit.  I had to go back home, so he exchanged it and shipped it to me.  

Thursday afternoon, I missed a phone call from the FedEx driver who couldn't get in the security door of my apartment to deliver the package.  Hoping I would catch him on Friday or Saturday, I didn't return his call.  When the package wasn't delivered on Monday, I called the only number I had...the driver's personal cell phone.  What I didn't know was, it was his day off.

I don't know about you, but when I have a day off, the last thing I want to do is deal with work, much less take a phone call from a customer.  He gladly explained that he would be delivering it on Tuesday and even remembered where I lived and what package it was.     I worked on Tuesday and missed the package again!  

I was on my way home, around 5, and he called me to let me know he was on his way home but he would swing by for one more attempt.  I rushed home and got the package.  I just thought he, and FedEx, deserved some credit.  This guy, went above and beyond, to include me (just some schmuck customer) in his personal life to make sure the package was delivered.  Thanks a lot, FedEx!  I mean it!"

So, this year, we met up some friends and carved some gourds.  Mic and I carved a [Metroid Pumpking](http://i.imgur.com/MrEcZ.jpg) and [here is a pic](http://i.imgur.com/3oZdh.jpg) of everyone's.  Second from the left is a Me Gusta pumpkin, but you can't really see due to camera phone pics.


Has anyone else carved their pumpkins yet?  Please share!

At work I have a couple of student technicians, I usually hire a new one the year before the senior tech is to leave so that there is sufficient time for them to be trained and learn the ropes and such.  Last fall I hired a new kid, and because of what the senior tech had taught me about Modern Warfare and ‚ÄúRamirez‚Äù I told the kid ‚ÄúFrom here on out you‚Äôll be known as Ramirez.‚Äù  He likes having a nickname.  

Anyway, he‚Äôs a fairly serious kid, deliberate but kind and thoughtful.  When there‚Äôs a crowd he‚Äôs pretty quiet but when it‚Äôs just him and me in the office he can be a chatterbox.  A while back he told me about a girl he was interested in, we‚Äôll call her Emma, and that he had planned on asking her out even though he was really nervous about it.  They went to coffee and things like that and then one day Emma invited Ramirez over to her and her parents‚Äô house for dinner.  
Ramirez related the following:  
‚ÄúSo when I got there the family dog came running into the living room and Emma told me ‚ÄòThe dog‚Äôs name is Anus‚Äô.  I wondered why a nice family would name their dog Anus but then I thought ‚Äì well, maybe the dog is an asshole.  
So anyway, throughout the night I called the dog to me so I could play with him ‚ÄòCome ‚Äòere Anus‚Äô and later ‚ÄòHey Anus, come ‚Äòere!‚Äô  And then as I was getting ready to go home I stood at the front door to say goodbye and I called him to me one more time ‚ÄòCome here Anus!‚Äô  
And that‚Äôs when Emma said to me ‚ÄòThe dog‚Äôs name is Amos.‚Äô.""
