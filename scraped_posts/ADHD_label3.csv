So I’ve come to realize how many symptoms are paradoxical in nature. I found it too ironic not to share like this. 

1. You’re always tired, but can’t fall asleep.

Mind: exhausted. 
Body: still.
Brain: “Let’s overanalyze that awkward thing from 2009.”

2. You procrastinate everything… until it’s an emergency.

Four weeks to do a task? Nah.
Four hours before it’s due? Superhuman mode activated.

3. You’re forgetful, but have crystal-clear memories of random stuff.

Can’t remember what you had for lunch.
But that one random strongbad video from 2003? Engraved for life.

4. You struggle to focus on boring stuff… but can hyperfocus for hours on something niche.

Laundry? Impossible. 
Organizing your physical media in alphabetical order? Done. In. One. Sitting.


5. You’re sensitive to rejection, but might miss social cues.

Overthinking one weird text reply for days
…but didn’t notice the sarcasm in the first place.

6. You hate routine, but fall apart without it.

Need structure to function.
Resist it at every turn.

7. You think faster than you can process.

Brilliant insights. Lightning-fast creativity.
But you need someone to repeat the question because you zoned out for 3 seconds.

8. You want to do everything.

But starting anything feels impossible.


9. You need to take your meds to function 

but they’re also dangerously addicting?
Yet you always forget to fill them or if you even took your second dose that day


What did I miss?"
2,3,"Like some others here, my dental hygiene is bad, and I've historically only gone to dentists when there's an emergency. Just over a month ago, I had a crown break, and I went to a dentist to get it taken care of. The dentist was great, and made me feel good about taking care of my teeth, so when they tried to schedule me for cleanings and other procedures, I thought ""what the heck, I have insurance through my job now, let's do it!""  
A few appointments later, I'm in for a deep teeth cleaning and the dental hygienist is asking about my habits. I'm honest with him and tell him two things: (1) Over the last couple of weeks I've been trying to brush/floss twice a day, and been successful more than half the time, and (2) Before this I've spent several decades not taking care of my teeth at all.  
He then started asking about my habits. I was confused, because I'd just told him about my brushing. He said that he was just trying to help understand my baseline and insisted I tell him about what other habits I have. I don't really have any though; I honestly just feel like I'm winging everything every day. He grew increasingly frustrated, accused me of not working with him by answering his questions, and implied I was trying to make this difficult. He said this was going to be a problem when I came in for regular treatment, and asked increasingly personal questions about what I do daily, like showering etc. (which I don't always do daily, no surprise).  
I felt trapped in the chair and uncomfortable. I came home feeling embarrassed and extremely discouraged. Right now I want to cancel all the other appointments I have, and I feel pretty terrible about myself. I don't really know what to do from here.

EDIT: Fixed Typo"
3,2,"My wife is the most incredible woman I’ve ever met and the greatest thing that’s ever happened to me. Im so in love with her, all of her, her ADHD included, because it’s part of her and she wouldn’t be who she is without it. But I can tell it causes a lot of struggles in her life. She used to be on the max dose of Vyvanse, but it’s difficult for us to get her script refilled where we live, so she’s unmedicated most of the time.

I don’t think I can fully understand what life is like from her perspective without having it, so I’d really appreciate hearing you guys’ perspective. 

Do you have any suggestions for what I can do to make life for her easier, to make her feel more loved, safe, supported, or understood?

Thanks in advance"
4,0,"I found a lil hack that has helped me tremendousllllyyy. AN HOUR GLASS!!!! I keep an antique hour glass on my office desk so I can ""race the clock"" in a sense for important computer tasks, or any task really. I find this super helpful and quick/easy - just FLIP IT ON OVA and let the games begin! I find it much better than setting timers on phone, because fuck more screens. It's kind of calming and relaxing as well, and gives the illusion of time going by a bit more slowly. Tbh, my last one shattered, but I just ordered 3 more from Etsy, this time an hour, one for 30 min and one for 15 min. Just wanted to share with ya'll!!!"
5,3,"Hi. My current job uses slack and i cannot comprehend how anyone can focus on anything with the near constant notifications going off in the various teams, group chats, and DMs. 

The obvious first attempt at a solution was to only have notifications turned on for mentions or keywords, however, with those settings i was missing way too many updates. 

Without any hint of hyperbole or sarcasm, i sometimes feel disabled because all of the notifications just scramble my brain and make it so difficult to focus on ANYTHING and therefore be productive at all in my job. 

How have other people made Slack work for them? It has been paralyzing for me, particularly lately. Thank you in advance "
6,0,"I know some people say you don’t need apps or products to manage your life, but trust me, I do. These tools have actually helped me stay productive, and I honestly can’t imagine functioning without them.

Health: Oura (for sleep) + WHOOP (for daytime activity). I used to wear an Apple Watch, but the constant notifications were super distracting, and the short battery life just didn’t work for my ADHD brain.

Note taking: Notion. I literally throw everything in here. Random thoughts, long-term goals, even stuff like groceries and journal entries.

Time Management: TickTick (for task management) + Lifestack (for daily planning). I used to use another app but switched to Lifestack because it pulls in data from my Oura and WHOOP to plan my day.

Email: Superhuman. The speed is unreal. I’m easily saving hours each week thanks to it.

Screen blocking: Freedom (for web) + Opal (for mobile). I used to think I didn’t need screen blockers, but I was 100% wrong. I was wasting hours unconsciously, and these apps have made me realize that.

Finance: Rocket Money. Not sure it’s the best, but I saw an ad and gave it a shot. It's been fine so far, but I’m definitely open to better recs if you have any.

Tell me your tech stack!"
7,2,"I was diagnosed a couple years ago at 50. My 8 yo son was diagnosed (finally) a few months ago. I see a lot of myself at that age in him.

Whenever we go to a local playground he lurks at older kids hanging out. He'll hide behind walls or equipment and just watch. It's harmless for the most part, but I've heard some of the older kids say he's creepy. He can be very obvious about it.

I did similar at that age. I remember being told or overhearing that I was a ""creep"" for lurking.

I'm very open with him, talk with him and walk him through things ADHD related. This, though, he seems oblivious even when I mention it in real time.

I know of a couple ADHDers who as kids 'spied' on others. It eventually turned into outright Peeping Tomism and a number of arrests. 

As I write this, we're at a playground and he's actively lurking 10 feet from a group of teens who asked him why he keeps staring. I called him over and asked what he was doing -- ""playing"". I said it was rude to stare and to step away from them and play. He proceeded to climb the equipment while continuing to stare, not paying attention to what he was doing. 

What can be done?"
8,1,"When I’m not on my ADHD medication (70mg Vyvanse), my brain is so foggy that it’s a struggle to even stay awake, never mind focus on anything. I try to avoid being off it for that reason, but I always procrastinate ordering my prescription each month, so there’s always a day or two where I’m completely dazed.

For context, I wasn’t on meds yesterday, and my day went like this:

- 1:00 AM – 9:30 AM: Slept

- Awake (due to a GP call I had to take) and ate a sandwich

- 10:30 AM – 3:00 PM: Slept (was woken up because someone needed something from me)

- Ate some food

- 5:00 PM – 11:00 PM: Slept

- Woke up to eat “dinner,” then went to bed and slept another 8+ hours.

Whenever I’m actually awake, my body and brain feel so lethargic that all I want to do is fall asleep again. It’s like I have to consciously perform every subconscious action, and each one takes so much energy that I feel drained just from opening my eyes. I barely feel any emotions except apathy, and I stop caring about how my behaviour affects other people.

Even when I’m awake—whether sitting up, reading/watching TikTok or doing something like eating—I get intense bouts of dizziness and tiredness. Sometimes, I fall asleep right there at the table. This has been an issue for years and recently I had a slight epiphany that this can’t be normal, so just seeking advice and guidance from other people’s experiences."
9,3,"I assume my ADHD is relevant to this question which is why I'm asking here. I spent all day sleeping and eating today, and then once I got drunk, I did some of the cleaning that I got assigned to do this week in my and my roommate's chore chart, and I cooked dinner for tonight as well as breakfast tomorrow. This isn't the first time I've had a motivation spike after drinking alcohol. My question is why alcohol makes me more motivated to get my shit together when it's not supposed to and not portrayed as such. I'm drunk writing this so excuse any spelling/grammar mistakes."
10,0,"60(F) When I was in elementary school in the ‘70s I remember a boy in 4th grade who in hindsight clearly had the H variety of ADHD - very disruptive. In one instance our very granola female teacher actually had him pinned in a body hold on the couch that was in the room, will never forget it! 

In searching my own history for evidence of its existence, I can hardly remember myself or my siblings. My brother is 7 years older and his wife apparently stepped on him hard years ago and got him trained to do the dishes right after meals and keep the place tidy. I remember her murmuring about how bad he used to be. Also comments about being scatter-brained. I don’t remember him behaving in a hyperactive way given I was so much younger, so wondering if he was the inattentive type as I believe I am.

Are men more likely to have the hyperactive variety than women? Who here was missed because of having the inattentive type?"
11,1,"I am 22 and for two years have been trying almost every med and combo out there combined with therapy. I am Bipolar 2, ADHD, dyslexic, OCD, SEVERE Anxiety Disorder and I am officially tapped out. My mind is and has been splitting into 8 pieces for over a year now and nothing helps. I have reached a point where the chemical imbalance in my mind has trapped everything I am. I have no friends, can't hold a job, severe paranoia, and I haven NEVER been able to hold onto my passions. Otherwise I would be a real artist, musician, baker, literally anything else by now.

Every time I tell a new psychiatrist or doctor how many meds I've taken they audibly and visually go ""Woah, like for real?"" then tell me that I am the first they've seen and it's just so hurtful because it makes me feel absolutely hopeless when I have taken more meds than every adult in my life with bipolar combined.

12,3,"Hi! I work from home with a completely flexible schedule. I take 56mg of Concerta at 7am. It allows me to be awake by 9am but I can’t seem to get out of bed. I just doomscrolling for hours. 

When I get up and start working, I am able to complete tasks, but the initial morning wake up is so difficult for me. I try schedule meetings for the morning but I end up taking them from bed and then going back to doomscrolling. Or when I had to go into an office, I would be on time initially and then be later and later. 

How do you guys get up and start your day?"
13,3,"I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was, I think 7? And I didn't know until recently, on thanksgiving this year. Kinda crazy. But anyway, I've had this epiphany about doing work.

I am a gamer. I spend most of my time gaming and I am looking for a job. But I CANNOT bring myself to look for one sometimes. I don't want to go find all these dates and make a resume because I have to research all these different things just to make sure my resume isn't rejected by some robots???? And it's so difficult because I know that I wouldn't get stressed if I was playing videogames. 

But I play games all the time and lots of time goes by. My day would have the same time in it if I was doing productive stuff all day. It makes me feel so guilty about doing anything I love.

I just need some support because I feel like I can't do anything at all. I play games, I feel guilty, I look for work, I feel miserable. I'm getting a headache right now.

I'm unmedicated because I have to apply for insurance, and I haven't applied for insurance because the government thinks I'm employed and I have to do all this stuff to figure that out?? idk how people get stuff done man. Literally any advice is great. Also checklists and writing stuff down doesn't work for me."
14,3,"I'm a student and I struggle so much with school. Once I start I really enjoy my school work because it's fun, I just can't get started until last minute. Idk if it's just me, but I haven't found an app that actually works for my adhd. I've tried so many, but I find that it either doesn't have all the features I need, or it's really expensive. Some apps I've found work for a few weeks, and then I forget about them?

What do you guys do? And if you could add features to an app, what would you add?"
15,3,"Late self-diagnosed ADHD person. 

I'm at my most creative in the morning. But I have the hardest time starting work from 8 to 10 am. I have an office job, and often spend it browsing social media / surfing the web and telling myself 'just one more thing'. I also usually generate about 30 lines of written random ideas in a notebook.  

I'm an efficient worker once I get started (Mr. Hyperfocus). Do the work of 8 hours in 6 or less. But it's boom and bust, inconsistent.

17,0,"I've always struggled to play video games all the way through, as I get bored or lose interest in the middle of them, especially when something isn't as much fun.

  
Does anyone experience this or go through similar things? I know it's not that important or pressing, but I have been wondering if this is related to ADD."
18,3,"I'm not sure how to explain this in text, but I now tend to avoid getting attached/liking new things because I know if I get interested in it, it will immediately turn into a severe hyperfixation and I will get REAAAALLLLY into it for a bit. (probably spend a lot of time making some elaborate art project like cosplay, a plushie, a painting, keychains, sculptures, etc)

 and then I will lose my interest in it.(and those projects will be left to just sit there) 

I only allow myself to get attached if it's something that I invent myself (original characters/creatures) because I don't seem to lose interest in those the way I do with pre established things?

I cant even enjoy inanimate objects too much because i know i will get too into them! 

I really want to be able to enjoy things without the fear that I will entirely lose interest within the next month, or best case scenario wait for it to reawaken and I'll finally get those projects done that were passion projects of that niche thing."
19,3,"As someone with ADHD i struggle with romantic relationships. 

And most of the times when I am hyper focusing on something . I get so much into hyper focusing that practically nothing else matters for the time that I am hyper-focusing.

Also I feel I am emotionally very volatile so I get extremely hurt at the small things which my partner may or may not understand .   And with a lack of understanding partner I might have to mask my ADHD so that my emotionally sensitive side doesn’t show through.  So this also makes being in relationships feel like walking on egg shells because sharing my struggle with emotional regulation may make the other person feel like I am too much. 

Also I am a people pleaser I go so overboard with people pleasing to the point that I might not even express my concern thinking that I might hurt the other person by being too much

I think I use hyper independence as coping mechanism for my ADHD

20,2,"Does anyone else feel nauseas on vyvanse? And if so, does anyone have any advice as to how to avoid that? I know that coffee and/or an empty stomach makes it worse. So does driving or flying.   
  
Sometimes it combines with feeling sweaty. My nausea makes it hard to focus and I just want to lie down, which kind of defeats the purpose. "
21,1,i’ve really been struggling i just love being cozy and do not feel urgency to get to work on time (but i really want to be the person that is always on time). i scroll (oops) and just love sleeping as much as possible. once im out of bed i move quickly but i just don’t feel any urgency and i guess i always think i can move faster. i know all these things logically and it’s like im screaming in my mind to get up but i just don’t. any suggestions?
22,1,"lol so I have major depression (or so my therapist told me today). 

Makes sense because I literally have lost my will to live. I am adhd and I currently take 30 mg of adderall daily. Even with daily adderall I have been bed rotting for a months. I never leave the house. Lost my job. Have no relationships because I can’t maintain them. I just kinda have lost my way I guess… 

I also have terrible insomnia. If I go to bed it’s at 6 am and i wake up at like 4pm. There has been days where I haven’t slept. I take 200 mg of trazadone for this. But even the with the trazadone I stay up all night. 
I have been doing some research and Wellbutrin seems like a good option. What is a starting dose for this? 

Can people share experience with Wellbutrin? I am extremely depressed and will it actually help or? "
23,3,"Probably the least productive 3 months of the last 5 years of my life.

I'm stuck in this weird in-between where adderall makes me anxious/gives me GI symptoms but I cannot be productive without it. It works for me when it works, which is why I'm so gungho about it.

Being off my meds for the last several months was actually a stark reminder of how unproductive I was for pretty much my entire life until I was \~30 years old. It's difficult for me to accept that I may need this indefinitely but the other side of the equation is a soulless, unproductive lifestyle where I constantly beat myself up about what I can't do/what I haven't done.

Anyone else?"
24,2,"So, I went to Scotland (I'm from England), I've been a few times before. But this time, I went in to my favourite restaurant and the man asked if I had a booking. I said yes and he asked the name it was booked under. I said my name in the most Scottish accent I could muster. Really rolled my R's and everything. I have NO idea why I did this!! My boyfriend laughed at me so hard afterwards and still mentions it now, and this was about 5 years ago. It was so embarrassing. I genuinely didn't plan to, or mean to do it. It just came out. I'm not sure if that is related to ADHD or not. Perhaps I was a bit zoned out, but could hear the Scottish accents or something. I don't know but I immediately regretted it and felt so embarrassed. I can laugh about it, but I still hope, even now, that the waiter doesn't think I was taking the piss 😩"
25,2,"I'm 39 and feel like this has gotten worse as I'm getting older.

I struggle to order things when I'm out as I forget what to ask for, even if I've ordered it 100 times. Or I assume they know what I want, it's so familiar to me that they should know.   

I end up standing there like an idiot. 

It's really embarrassing. 

Does anyone have coping strategies other than don't go out 😂 
Would this be an ADHD thing ? I'm only recently diagnosed.

26,0,"I (35F) and my wife (31F) have been together for nearly 10 years. we knew the other was “the one” after the first date. we’ve always had great chemistry and continue to do so. 

my wife is also very patient with my adhd-ness in the most incredible ways. she reminds me to do household chores over and over again because i simply will forget, and makes sure i complete “life admin” tasks that i really hate doing , such as paying my bills on time. I definitely won the lottery as far as partners are concerned. 

the ONE THING that irks her though - when we walk around together i’m a terrible hand holder. i cannot keep a firm hold on her hand and prefer to leave my fingers splayed out and straight. i think it’s because i get distracted and keeping a firm grasp takes too much concentration. 

is anyone else like that??

27,3,"Hello! I am diagnosed with ADHD and a few other things. I've had intense hyperfixations before but this one is literally so intense I asked my friend if I should go to the hospital. 

Also I think this is important just to add on, I recently went off my ADHD meds that I was on for about a year. Even then I've never experienced anything like this. 

Basically I'm hyperfixated on a game right now, and there's the normal drawing it all the time, playing it everyday, consuming only media related to it but it's become physically distressing. I have BPD as well and it feels similar to really intense euphoric episodes, I get so excited about it that I literally start hyperventilating. 

It's all I can think about so I want to interact with more media, and if I don't it literally feels like quitting cigs cold turkey. Except when I see media or my friends talk about it I can't breathe, and I get close to having a panic attack over how excited I am. I feel like I have adrenaline somehow to where I literally feel it through my whole body and have to stim to keep me from shouting. 

I feel like I need to scream and I feel like I'm burning alive and being strangled and I feel physically ill and so many more things just from seeing an edit of a character. I've been using my coping mechanisms from a dbt course I did. I've literally cried and broke down because I saw a concept animation. 

I've been so excited over it that I have been given sleeping meds every single night or I stay up for days. Is this just like the Autism + adhd combo or is it joever. Also I would talk to my therapist but I'm out of town for a week. I know this probably sounds so stupid but like I feel like I'm going to explode. 

How do I lessen the hyperfixation and also is this just like? A normal thing with ADHD? I've been diagnosed for 5 years now so I know quite a bit and I know how intense hyperfixations can be but dude. Why am I vomiting because I saw fanart of a roblox game. "
28,1,"Hi ! 29M
 
Today I increased my dose to 54mg and at the moment im at work. Workwise its going well and very productive. However deepdown im struggling big time.

Could do with a virtual hug as well... "
29,3,"Ever since young, I've loved picking at stuff, and that includes my lips. It's gotten really bad... I can be sitting at my desktop doing Stuff until I realised I've chewed my lips halfway through, and now I can't stop because there are bits sticking out 😭😭

I think the constant abuse has left them dry and scarred all the time, which makes them even more tempting to bite at. I usually bite at them using my teeth, and I often do it when I'm thinking about something.....

Does anyone have any coping mechanisms? I desperately need to stop this, and I'll do anything. I've been considering applying numbing cream so that I don't feel my lips and the need to bite them. Does anyone else have any other suggestions?"
30,2,"Hello. I'm not really sure how to ask this question.. I have a problem where being physically and emotionally close to someone makes me feel like they're trying to be intimate with me. This is enormously uncomfortable for me and incorrect about 95% of the time (friends, family, strangers.. anyone). Is this hypersexuality? I was.. abused by some peers when I was little and do know I have hangups because of it. But this is much more general. It happens with everyone, and it makes my skin crawl. I desperately want to connect with people but I feel gross when they interact with me."

Once I get to that point of spiraling there’s no return. I’m not talking about procrastination or general executive dysfunction… more that sense of impending doom and crash. For me, when I hit that point, it’s game over.

32,0,"Hey ADHDers 👋

I’m having short 1-on-1 chats with people who have ADHD to better understand how it shows up in daily life - the stuff you don’t read in articles.

If you're open to sharing your experience in a quick, casual convo, shoot me a DM and we’ll book a time.

Nothing formal, no pressure - just a real talk about what life with ADHD actually feels like. Your perspective would help a lot.

Thanks in advance!"
33,2,"So, I've recently been diagnosed with ADHD-I at the age of 35. I’ll be meeting with my clinicians the day before my birthday, when they’ll prescribe me Ritalin. My 36th year could very well be when my life actually begins.

There were so many things I found deeply fascinating and interesting, especially in the STEM fields, but ADHD made it nearly impossible for me to stay focused in math. I failed my final year of school twice because I couldn't focus. I got accepted into a Journalism course but decide to go directly into the workforce to help support my parents so never got a tertiary education. 

Prior to the diagnosis I had tried time after time to improve academically, but every time I failed due to an inability to commit and focus. And now, it feels like there’s finally an opportunity to go back to school and do something I love.

I want to hear from those of you who’ve found yourselves at this kind of crossroads - when you’re suddenly given a chance to pursue your passions or interests. Right now I’m feeling unsure, hesitant. But I know there are people much older than me who would jump at the opportunity. They’d probably want to slap some sense into me too. Your success stories might give me the push I need to start living the life I want."
34,2,"for the longest time i kept wondering why i couldn’t follow through with stuff i actually cared about.
i’d build systems, make plans, try routines—then still end up feeling like i didn’t even exist in any of it.

i thought maybe i was just lazy or my brain was broken or i wasn’t trying hard enough.
but lately i’ve been realizing… i think i’ve just been performing constantly. like even when no one’s around.

changing how i talk in every room. laughing when i don’t feel anything. nodding along just to not mess with the vibe.

none of it feels super dramatic in the moment, but over time it adds up. like i’ve been disappearing in small pieces.

i started writing down the moments where i felt “off.” like when something felt fake or automatic.
not in a journal-y way. just little notes.

and weirdly it started helping. i could feel when i was slipping into that version of myself again and pause before it swallowed me.

i’m curious if anyone else has felt this? like that quiet kind of exhaustion where you’re doing everything “right” but it still doesn’t feel like you’re really there?

not fishing for advice—just wondering if anyone’s gone through this too."
35,3,"Hello guys, I would like to start by saying that I’m not formally diagnosed with ADHD. But I truely believe I have it, I know self diagnosing is bad. Anyways I have the common like hyperfixation and executive dysfunction ect… but to was different like I was like forgetting moments in time and felt like I wasn’t there. I am a registered Nurse and I’ve never hurt any patient but today I started an IV and left the tourniquet and it was in the patient for a long period of time. And like I could barely remember starting the IV. And the. I went to volleyball which I usually play and like I felt like I wasn’t there. And ended up hurting someone because I was erratic and went under the net. And idk I just feel off and I hate it. I wish I was normal.  "

I don’t know why I do this. Sunday it was the Selena Gomez Oreos, yesterday it was a 6 pack of insomnia cookie, today it was a Starbucks coffee and a small gift card for the homeless guy living by my apartment since his birthday was this past week.

I don’t know if it’s the novelty aspect of it but in a way my brain acts like it’s a requirement that I MUST treat myself. I don’t actually have to treat myself in theory. In truth it’s cutting into my savings, in theory I can afford this lifestyle but not if I’m trying to get married and move in with my fiancé within the next year. 

I keep telling myself “Save the pennies, the Porsche will buy itself”. Except I’m still spending the pennies and I don’t know how to stop. I do my groceries every week so I should have enough to live off of but I will still myself routinely buying a treat that is only nice to my tongue in the moment. "
37,2,"I just wanna know what other people's experience has been if they accidentally took a double dose of a similar amount before. I usually have a weekly pill case but I never reorganized it over the weekend. I remember walking over to my nightstand to take it, but I think I might have gotten distracted packing my bag and never took it, so I took it for sure before leaving the house. I'm worried I did end up taking it twice, which would be 60mg XR. It's been about an hour and I feel alright. I guess I mainly just wanna ease my worries in case I did accidentally take double the dose: how can I know I did, and how bad is it if that's the case? Would it affect my tolerance for the regular 30mg dose afterwards? Should I take a break from it for a few days just in case?"

Majority of my life i've struggled with basic functions, such as keeping my home clean, proper hygiene, dental, relationships, etc. It also doesn't help that I grew up in neglect where my mother had spent more time trying to be my friend than my parent. I now believe she also had ADHD, as I was often raise in disorder and filth. 

  
For most of my adult life I tried to break away from those habits myself, going as far as joining the military to separate myself from my mother but to also learn discipline. However, each time I made strides forward, I'd always take steps backwards or lose the momentum. Nothing would stick. Sure, when I was in a structured setting like the barracks, I had to keep clean, but I did so with the most minimum effort. Afterwards, i've utilized a number of resources such as therapy to help me process my childhood and identify root causes, but it wasn't until I was diagnosed with ADHD that I began to suspect it may be a root.

  
My question is, when I start taking medication, how would I feel and what effects would I see change? As of now, I have the ideas of all the things I want to do but lack the functionality to follow through with it. Moreover, I've pretty much dumped all knowledge I had of proper habits the normal folk use to keep themselves functional and orderly, so i'm not sure where to begin once i'm on meds. 

  
I'm hoping this will help me as I am running out of options and losing hope that i'll ever feel like i'm no longer drowning. "
40,1,"Hi all

I'm not sure if this is the right place for this or not but I'm having a bit of a time and any help would be greatly appreciated!

Recently diagnosed but have long suspected. Finally took the plunge and it was as we thought.

Started on Dexamphetamine 5mg 3 times daily but able to move up to 30 as required. First day was great! Second day not so much. But the third day I was completely broken. I'll admit I wasn't 100% beforehand (few personal issues going on) I but I genuinely didn't think I was that depressed but I am now in the grips of a full mental breakdown. It's one thing to get some focus, it's another to only be able to focus on how fucking depressed I apparently am. I spent the third day in complete disassociation and stared out a window for about 6 straight hours which felt like 15 minutes. 

So I stopped taking them and if anything I've gotten worse. That was 5 days ago. I can't eat, I'm both sleeping too much and not enough, I can't shower and I can't seem to function at all. I've had my moments with depression but this spiral seems to absolutely take the cake. A whole new layer of dark thoughts with a healthy dose of what feel like actual insanity.

I appreciate there is alot going on here and I have some things to figure out, and the two may be completely unrelated, but physically I feel different. I keep rocking my jaw like I'm on something, my throat has a weird ball at the back of it, my mouth is dry. I get depression has a physical aspect but I physically feel like I'm still on the dexamphetamine despite not having taken anything for five days now. 

I'm working with a therapist and have a support system (thank god) but I'm wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar? I've had my bouts but I've never physically or mentally felt like this before even on my darkest days (of which there has been a few)

Thanks in advance. "
41,1,"Title says it all. I can’t handle the responsibilities of life. I’m a 30F with a young daughter. No one ever taught me shit. I know that’s not an excuse. But I’m drowning in debt, unemployed, don’t even understand health insurance and I’m too scared to call and figure it out. I need to file for bankruptcy or something but don’t even know where to begin with that. Just getting my daughter through the day takes everything I have. I’m going to run out of my tax money soon. I’m up at midnight with these racing thoughts of what I need to do. Everyone makes it look so fucking easy and I literally get suicidal thinking about all the things I need to keep up with. I feel so fucking inadequate and stupid. I have no one in my life to help me. I just want to disappear. I’ll delete this in the morning but for now we wallow.

I cannot stay on top of my housework (putting groceries away, doing dishes/laundry, general clutter build up).

I'm open to ideas for how to find the motivation to start."
43,2,"Hi,
I just stopped taking my meds (Focalin) after being on them for a few years. I stopped because I was always very tightly wound and not able to socialize very well. I was able to get everything I wanted to and more done but it was making me kind of irritable and neurotic.
Now that I’m off it I’m finding more joy in socializing or dancing around the living room just having fun but the downside is that I have zero control.
I am eating way too much, acting impulsively, being overly emotional and feeling really anxious/overwhelmed about life in general. I can’t seem to see out of it if that makes sense - I have no idea what I’m doing or how to get control or even what I want to make myself do.
Anyway I’m thinking about going back on my meds but I’m hesitant because I’m not sure which mental state is worse.
Any words of wisdom? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

like, i have THREE projects due next week (plus my exams) and i haven’t started any because i simply forget about it 😭 i have them on my calendar, and that’s the only reason i remember they exist in the fist place. but im always falling into this never ending cycle:
1. i open my calendar and see all the crap i have to do
2. i scream “OH NO” 
3. i tell myself i need to get this done ASAP cause the deadline is fast approaching 
4. i close my calendar and completely forget about it 
5. i open my calendar (…)

i’m going insane. i’ve had months to do these things, and im not even procrastinating doing it. i just completely forget about it.

PLEASE let me know what tips and tricks work for you if you experience this same thing! i’m desperate, i need to do this asap 

(and before anyone asks “oh, why don’t you just do it when you open your calendar and see it” - because im usually already doing something else and i tell myself i’ll do it after and never do because i forget)

46,2,"Currently taking a couple of online classes, the kinds where you watch these pre recorded videos and answer questions. And so far, I haven't been making much progress. Currently taking a couple medications, but I feel like they aren't helping much.

I feel like I just can't focus whatsoever, like my mind is constantly racing all the time. Plus my memory feels really fuzzy, I'm forgetting things all the time. When I'm using a book or video to study, I end up forgetting everything the next minute. And I guess I should also mention that I have untreated sleep apnea, I'd say for about a year I average 4 hours of being able to sleep uninterrupted before sometimes I kinda just wake up.

47,3,"Hello guys,

I think many of you know that permanent exhaustion because of daily life. Often, If I come home from work or from other activities I am exhausted. Thank god, mostly I do have time to rest/restore or I plan it. 

Than my logical brain says ""Lay down, relax, rest"" ... But I cannot. No, wrong, this stresses me out even more! It almost hurts! This is very frustrating for me! Every time I am asking myself why I cannot relax!?

Who can relate? What do you do to relax If you are exhausted?

"
48,2,"Does anyone else get a large boost of confidence and lose their social filter when taking their meds (currently vyvanse)?

I had to stop taking adhd meds altogether (tried various types of amphetamines and methylphenidates at small and large doses) because while my head gets quiet and I can actually start/complete tasks, the noticeable boost I get when the med hits and while it’s hitting (about 2-3 hours) makes me kind of insane.

For example, I’ll message people I haven’t messaged in a while, make plans, tell my family and friends how much I love them, and overall just do things I’d be more embarrassed doing unmedicated (and often things I do feel embarassed by once the meds wear off).

I’ve tried some XR adhd med variants, and they help reduce this behaviour, but nothing makes it stop entirely. It’s like taking meds make me MORE impulsive, not less.

I already struggle with hyperactivity (and inattentiveness) so I wanted my meds to calm me down, not vice versa.

I get 7-8 hours of sleep and eat protein too so I’m not sure what to do. Has anyone experienced this before ?? "

Between my job, school, taking care of my cat, having a girlfriend, trying to keep up with friends, having hobbies (so I'm not depressed), personal hygiene, taking care of my health, gym, and work, my days feel impossible to keep up with.

53,2,"Hi all,

I (28 F) am feeling a bit anxious and frustrated with myself.

I booked a trip overseas and didnt check country entry requirements and may not be able to get a doctors note in time and facing the realization that I may be off the medication for 7 days.

I have been taking ADHD medication 10mg daily (dexedrine) for the last 15 years of my life. I can do a couple of days without the medication but by day 3 i start to feel like im spiraling.

Im also nervous about the withdrawals because Im sure there will be some after taking this medication for so long.

The idea of being without the medication while on vacation in a foreign country…well I am freaking out. I am also meeting my partners family to add to it.

I am travelling to England, Italy, and Armenia. I am most concerned for Armenia but would appreciate any insights anyone has about travelling to any of these countries with ADHD medication.

If anyone has gone through something similar (going without medication after being on it for so long) and has any tips or tricks - I would very much appreciate it.

I will do everything I can to recieve a doctors note despite my current family doctor being away.

Thanks in advance"

* When I randomly remember something I need to do
* When I have a thought I want to remember later but know I'll forget
* When I want to pick a place to eat or go (looking at all the reviews and stuff is great but it overloads my brain)
* When I want to buy something (like a water bottle) - I just want the best one handed to me immediately, because researching them and stuff is so much work and I just procrastinate indefinitely"
55,1,"I'm a mom and I have adhd myself but I wasn't diagnosed until adulthood. I got good grades in school but had to work extra hard, and looking back I do wish my parents did more to get me checked as a kid.
                  
Now my daughter (11) is showing signs of adhd... She's just like me, she gets good grades, isn't hyperactive, but can't focus on a single topic for longer than a few minutes. When she reads things for school work she has to keep starting over because she won't absorb the information in the text and that was one of my biggest struggles too. 
             
I took her to her doctor halfway through the school year and her doctor agrees that she probably does have adhd. I was supposed to have her teachers fill out some form but I never did because I'm conflicted but also because I don't think the teacher's answers will point to adhd since she's quiet and smart.
                
Anyway my question is, should I continue to get her diagnosis next school year and subsequently put her on medication? Also a big thing is, my family has a history of alcohol and drug addiction.... I'm terrified of her doing drugs when she gets older and putting her on adhd drugs now makes me feel like I'd be setting her up for failure. Thoughts?"

Should I continue with adderall just upping the dose or try something different? "

Has anyone tried this? Know what I'm talking about? Or is there another ""supplement"" that also helped your ADHD symptoms? 

I recently (beginning of 2025) started taking Adderall again after a 5 year break (pregnancies/miscarriages/breastfeeding) and am so glad to be medicated again but still hoping to reduce my Rx strength. "

60,2,"Hi! So as the title suggests I’m very new to my ADHD diagnosis. I’m a 21 year old woman and I’ve lived my life up until this week completely un medicated, and all in all I’ve done pretty good for myself. I would say in kind of a mess of a person, but I’ve always gotten the job done and been widely considered very successful by the people around me. However, as I got older and decided I wanted to go to med school—these amount of time and concentration needed to balance it all made issues that I’ve had throughout my life more clear. It was due to this and advice from friends that I sought a diagnosis. Now I’m diagnosed and I’m on the starting dose of IR adderall, but I’m torn. I don’t know how this is “supposed” to feel, and I’m very anxious about this affecting my personality/growing dependent. I don’t want to play life on hard mode, but I also don’t want to be overly reliant on meds that I can’t truly decipher how they make me feel. How long does it take to adjust to not only the meds, but feelings like this? "
61,3,"Just want to see what other peoples experience with this has been or any success stories, but I've come to really realize and accept that gaming and other distractions (YouTube, Comics, etc) in general have taken over my life. To the point that I've gotten no work done at my job the past week, failed classes, and plans to play 1 game or read 1 chapter before I start the day end up being the rest of the day. Even if I have the will power and make the conscious choice to put it down and do the things I need to, the entire time I'm trying to engage with those things my mind isn't really there, which is especially problematic working in Academia where fully processing the information is critical. 

So I am trying to take gaming and all the distractions out of my life, so far I am only on Day 2 but it's been a bit difficult, as I find myself unconsciously opening things, turning on the TV, etc. These things have become almost impulse responses at this point. Additionally, when I do try to engage with work it all just feels empty, which really sucks cause I love my field.

What is yall's experience with trying to cut out distractions or at the very least create a balance? It seems, at least for me, that even trying to set healthy boundaries or balance things, it's mere presence is an issue."

However, he hasn't stuck to this agreement and it causes a bit of a clash as I'm straight up refusing to do his rooms (this has been an on going thing for a while where I took all of the work and it's taking a toll on my mental health). For those with ADHD what are some coping mechanisms we can put in place to help him get these tasks started, he is okay once he has started but it's getting the motivation to do it he has a hard time with he says it feels as though he physically cannot do it or he just completely forgets about it until it's too late"

i’ve been on genetic concerta 18mg 2x/day for about a year now. ive been paying out of pocket with coupon due to my insurance requiring a pharmacy that’s inaccessible in my state. rn, i’m out of state and am able to fill at that pharmacy so i figured why not try.

well fast forward, the doctor i saw to refill here recommends i up my dosage to address my med not lasting as long (i never rly bothered). its sent to the pharmacy, my insurance requires prior authorization which is denied (happened before, for other reasons, why i gave up before). i cant afford to pay out of pocket at that pharmacy even with a coupon.

okay, so i ask my doctor maybe we can try generic vyvanse 1x/day instead if they’re gonna be picky about two doses a day. pharmacy won’t fill that because he’s “not licensed in the state” to prescribe. he is tho? how did you even do the first request then? i asked the doctor to send it to cvs instead, where ive never had issues. i’ll just use a coupon again whatever. 

i cant pick up until a month later because i apparently already did. 

i haven’t refilled my meds since april lmfao. the cvs pharmacist said the requests at the other pharmacy was likely blocking it. i call them and tell them to get rid of whatever prescriptions they had (that they didn’t want to give to me lol). still can’t fill.

i’m guessing at this point it’ll take a while for the system to straighten out but honestly, i feel like that other pharmacy is out to get me. i wouldn’t be surprised if they didn’t get rid of the prescriptions like i asked them to or marked it as picked up when i literally haven’t. the workers there were really judgy……."

74,0,"I'm searching for a new reminder app for Android, mostly to help with routines like going to bed/getting ready in the morning that will keep me on track.  I've noticed with my go to bed alarms that I just dismiss and ignore them because I want to turn them off quickly.

Then I noticed with reminders instead of alarms I could set it to play a 30 second clip of a song that doesn't loop, but the reminder would still show when I picked up my phone.  That way I don't feel rushed to turn it off because I know it will stop, but I'll still have that reminder taking up my screen.

The only issue with my current app (Alarm Clock Xtreme) is that I have to use the same notification sound for each reminder, whereas I'd like to be able to set different sounds for each one. So here are some of the features I'm looking for:

- Customizable ringtones for each reminder - I want to use my own songs
- I'd like the reminder song to play once and not loop
- I want the reminder to take up the whole screen and have to be either snoozed or dismissed - something with enough space to include a short message to myself for a visual reminder would be nice
- Would like to be able to schedule the same reminders to repeat daily or only on weekdays, for example
- Optionally, if I don't dismiss the reminder after a few minutes, it would go off again, but I could also just set multiple reminders instead 

I did a quick search, but sometimes it's hard to tell if an app includes all the features I'm looking for, so if anyone has found an app they like with these features, let me know.  Thanks!"
75,1,"I have hyperactive ADHD, which in my case shows up as thinking very fast and moving very quickly between thoughts / concepts / ideas. I love having conversations that move around (lol as many of us do) but thanks to medication, I'm also very happy to have focused conversations, as long as they feel meaningful -small talk drains me.

All that being said, I've noticed that friends with inattentive type tend to zone out or lose their train of thought throughout conversations and just kinda go along with the vibe -not fully engaged, which I know is not necessarily intentional but does make me instantly disconnected. Internally I feel like ""well, if you are no longer interested in the conversation, that's ok, and now i'm instantly disinterested too."" And while that feels mostly frustrating-neutral, it means I start pulling away from those friendships. I don't end them, but I can't bring myself to try to be close, because it feels like our communication needs / styles are too incompatible and with time I know my feelings will get hurt / I'll grow resentful.

1. Does anyone else struggle with this?
2. And if you do, have you found ways to cope / stay connected when that happens?

Would love to hear from inattentive types (and any other type) also on how you struggle with hyperactive folks and/or what it means to you when you space out in conversations? It feels unintentional, but there's a part of me that feels like the person just doesn't care enough, is not interested enough to stay in it and uh, it's hard to convince that part otherwise!

Thank you all in advance for any insight!"

b) I can basically only work at home. For some reason, school I can't work at ALL.

79,3,"Long story short- after 35 years of unmedicated / undiagnosed ADHD I am wondering if some habits are just too ingrained? 

I, 37F, have struggled for my entire life to keep a clean and tidy room/ space/ home. When I lived with my parents, I thought morning of it because I was a kid. When moved into an apartment and got married, I figured it was because there was no storage space, and I didn't know how to organize. Finally we moved into a house, but not long after things started piling up again. Fast forward 5 years after moving in and I get my ADHD diagnosis and everything suddenly makes sense... 2 more years and here we are, struggling to undo the years of madness. The unfortunate ebb and flow of cleaning, burn out, more cleaning and more piles forming. 

I woke up this morning and decided to pay off 2 of my credit cards and to clean our bedroom. I paid off one of them, and made a sizable dent on the other.

The bedroom I am making progress on. I made myself a to do list that seems quite manageable, and I am trying to keep myself focused on just the bedroom, so no washing laundry today. (I am really trying not to dread the massive truckload of laundry I have sent to my laundry room.) I am finding it hard to keep going at it. I mean I don't want to burn myself out, at the same time I don't want to half-ass it either. 

I guess I could put it this way. I am a truck, I have the keys, spark plug and battery to start the engine but I feel like I am running out of gas. Anyone have any tips to keep me going?"

I have ADHD and really struggle with starting tasks, meeting deadlines, and not procrastinating on work. I’m in therapy, and while it helps with emotional regulation and self-awareness, I often feel like I also need someone to guide me through the actual doing—like breaking tasks down, staying on track, and creating structure in my day.

Is that something a therapist is supposed to help with, or is it outside their scope? Should I be looking for an ADHD coach for that kind of support instead? I’m a bit confused about where the line is between emotional support and practical, day-to-day executive function help."

83,2,"I was prescribed clonidine 0.1mg a few months ago by my psychiatrist to help with stimulant-related insomnia, to take on an as needed basis. I’ve probably taken it three times in total, and the last time I experienced SEVERE heart palpitations and intense anxiety/depressive symptoms in the days following. 

Jump forward a couple of months and I’ve hit another burnout phase, which is partly due to lack of sleep (and array of other things). Of course, this only made getting to sleep even harder! 

I was so desperate to sleep last night, so (regretfully), grabbed a clonidine pill (0.1mg) from the drawer, and I’ve just woken up remembering all the reasons I told myself I’ve never take the stuff again! 

Has anyone else had experience taking clonidine once, or just a few times, and having extreme withdrawal symptoms? And if so, did these go away over time? 

I’d already been thinking about stopping my stimulant medication (vyvanse) as I feel it’s changed my favourite parts of my personality (humour, chattiness etc) and has lead to severe burnout, but I’m now wondering if the clonidine could be an underlying reason for certain things too….. 
 
Any suggestions would be much appreciated!

Now I'm about to be my own boss (or unemployed, however you want to call it), and I have a million plans.

Plans to get projects done around the house this summer. Plans for creative endeavors. Plans for potential businesses. Plans for small side hustles. Plans to cook more for my wife. Plans for just having fun. 

And somehow I suspect I'll instead spend the summer sitting on my ass scrolling Reddit while the sun shines outside. 

Over the last few years I've been comfortable and secure enough in my job that I haven't had to be as rigorous about to do lists and structure and I've kind of lost the habit. Now I need to get myself together. But you know how it goes, you plan for this magical future where you're somehow disciplined and organized, but you know you're still going to be you.

My wife (34F) and I (34M) have ADHD and have been trying to find ways to support ourselves around ADHD. Instagram has been a big sinkhole for our productivity and stress. We were wondering if anyone has ideas on if there are tools/apps/etc to lock an app for each other so we can hold each other accountable with Instagram access. For example, sometimes we like watching videos with our kids as a reward or for down time, is there an app so if I wanted to go on Instagram for an hr she can unlock the app from her phone for me and vice versa? Or is there a way to lock our access to downloading the Instagram app in a similar way to what I described above?

Thanks!

87,1,"I feel like I’ve been in a rut since last November or December. I don’t know if this is the specific trigger, but the start of this period coincided with a falling out with a “friend” (he basically starting leading me on and then got back with his ex). I originally was very high-functioning last fall— a regular sleep schedule, all As, consistently clean room, healthy diet, etc. and I was able to still keep up for the rest of my fall semester. However, this spring semester, while I still got good grades and kept myself busy, underneath the surface, I feel like I’ve been unravelling apart — my dorm became a depression room, I stopped going to the gym, my sleep schedule was terrible, I started ghosting everyone on every messaging platform, when I have previously been a very responsive person, etc. However, it’s been six months and I’m on summer break now, and I still haven’t dug myself out of this hole. In high school, I would have brief periods like this, but it’s never lasted so long.

The most excruciating part about this rut is that I feel like I don’t have any direction or passion anymore. Before, when I had these moments where my mind felt stuck during projects or assignments, I still retained passion and caring about that project. However, now, I feel desensitized to everything, whether that be my interests, hobbies, career aspirations, or the news. I feel like I’m just slugging through each day. I used to feel so deeply and get so emotionally moved or excited about things, so now, first and most importantly, I want to know how to reignite that drive, and second, I want to learn how to return to the old, healthy habits that I built. Any advice would be appreciated :)"
88,2,"Hey,
I'm reaching out because I'm slowly losing my mind (and apparently, all my belongings) in our house. We're a young family of four, including a small dog, and lately, things have been disappearing without a trace. It's even stuff that doesn't just vanish into thin air – large kitchen utensils, one of my earbuds, a screwdriver, even the remote control (again!).
I've done deep cleans, scoured every nook and cranny, and nothing. No logical explanation, no hidden stashes. It's becoming more frequent, and honestly, it's driving me absolutely bonkers. I already struggle with object permanence, and this just amplifies the chaos!
So, I need your wisdom. For those of you with coping mechanisms, especially those with families and pets, how do you cope with the constant vanishing act of everyday items around your house?
Any tips, tricks, or even just shared commiseration would be greatly appreciated. I'm open to anything – organizational strategies, coping mechanisms, theories about tiny house gnomes, whatever helps!
Thanks in advance for any insights!

Unfortunately my go to method for APD, reading lips, and even mirroring what they’re saying doesn’t work because it’s on the phone.

91,2,"Hello!

I have a question that I’m curious to hear your experiences and your opinions on. 

Do you disclose your diagnosis to your employer?

I’ve just graduated and I’m going to be applying for jobs, mainly as a teaching assistant at elementary schools. I’m unsure of whether or not I should disclose my diagnosis to my employer, or rather maybe, when I should disclose it. 

The reason for me wanting to disclose it is partly because I believe that my diagnosis is something positive in this type of work. My own experiences help me better understand and relate to the kids that I will be helping.

But the main reason I feel like I need to disclose my diagnosis at some point is because I would need to ask for certain accommodations at the workplace. These accommodations would mainly include:

- Needing instructions and information in writing and not verbally
- Some guidance/a mentor in the beginning that I can ask questions to about how to do things properly. I don’t want to have to guess and accidentally do things incorrectly, I would rather just know how to do it correctly the way this workplace does it from the start. 
- A quiet space to go to where I can reset a bit, as I am quite sensitive to noise. I would also maybe ask to not have to stand guard at recess, as that is very draining for me and I believe it would negatively affect my ability to work the rest of the day. I would not be asking to not have to do anything but instead ask if I could compensate in another area, such as patrolling hallways or maybe organising/administrative work. 

I hope these are reasonable accommodations to ask for, but I believe they would allow me to do my work as good and sustainably as possible. 

So how would you go about disclosing this information? I have a fear of doing it too early as I don’t want people to see me as incapable or unreliable, but as I said above, I would need accommodations from my workplace. 

Thank you so much in advance! "

GP agrees that I need to be referred but unfortunately my county, Oxfordshire, is closed to adult diagnosis and remains so. I ask about RTC and my gp dissuades me on a sketchy quality argument.

Fast forward to 2024 and I get made redundant.

Fast forward to 2025 I’m still unemployed. I go back to gp and ask for antidepressants (which I get) and for a formal diagnosis path.

My referral was made on April 14th and I’m waiting to hear something.

My question is what are people’s experiences with RTC? Good? Bad?

Thanks in advance.

My worst symptom is forgetting things all the time: both at work and in my private life. Meds help with that. They also make things easier to do, especially things that require longer periods of focus - which my job does.

I've come to the conclusion that maybe it would be good to take meds just for work... but that means being on meds 6 days out of 7. So not really on demand. How the hell do I decide which days to skip?

What's your algorithm for making such decisions?"

i got on the call, doc asked me about my medical history but thats about it, i dont remember them asking me about my actual adhd symptoms (which i thought the call was gonna be about), i was immediately prescribed some meds which is good cuz i need them, but idk at what point the diagnosis happened, was it the in take form i filled out?.  
  
anyway im waiting for my farmacy to have the meds, and they cost 245 bucks a month. initial visit was $200 and the next one will be $160. everything out of pocket  


*i*s  any of this standard for treatment?

I also called the medvidi to request a diagnosis letter cuz im having to convince my family that im not making excuses, and that i actually have a condition. The letter i was sent was super brief, only a paragraph, and the actual part that confirmed my adhd was just single sentence long.

Since very early I was suspected to have ADHD but my parents didn't really care about me so I was never properly diagnosed. Now that I am more aware that I might have ADHD I realize that I thick all the boxes. And I understand more of my behaviours. My therapist told me he is pretty certain I have ADHD.

It's been 2 years that I am with someone. He has kids. In a nutshell, I have done a lot for them but It’s very exhausting and not at all rewarding. My SO was at the beginning super attentive to my needs and love bombed me a bit However, he never told me he loves me. We have a 15 year gap. We lived in different cities and I have almost dropped everything for him and our fights are about mostly how I don't feel loved, heard and seen in this relationship. He never apologizes or do anything about it and says I can leave If I want because he won’t do better because of my behaviour (I burst out after repeating many times and nicely things I would like in my relationship or when I feel disrespected) and says I am making the relationship unstable because of my complaining.

I am wondering if I am just over sensitive because of ADHD or if it's him who is simply not a good person. I feel like I can't trust my own judgment. I have read that ADHD people tend to attract toxic people. "

I was previously on it for about a year. I stopped about a month ago. Since then, things have been overwhelming. My emotions feel incredibly intense. Everything feels heightened.

This is a hard one to explain because I feel like even within the ADHD community I rarely come across people that know what Im experiencing. Im Lebanese and Muslim. I would say I have a very strong connection to my culture and proud of my heritage even though I was born in the US. I have struggled growing up in Western society where I've experience the full spectrum of anti-Arab/Islamophobia sentiment in this society since the 80's.

I've been able to overcome most of the adversity Ive experienced but recently my mental health has nosedived. I will try and keep the politics out of it but it is what it is as far as my perspective. Watching the gen0cide of my people has profoundly changed me as a person. I don't think there is a version of myself that I CAN go back to anymore as if I can unsee everything I've witnessed. The extreme injustice of it has me mentally paralyzed. The full spectrum of emotions is hard to describe but essentially I no longer find any purpose in succeeding in a society in which my taxes fund this. I'm just stuck and I cannot figure out a way to unstick myself. I maintain a healthy diet, I workout, I continue going to work but my brain is always in that place. I will just sit and doomscroll any coverage of that region. I recently had to delete all my personal social media just to stop.

Id be interested to hear from other Arabs, people of color, and indigenous people that have somehow found the strength to overcome this paralysis in the midst of their people suffering from great injustices. I find myself in auto pilot, not really interested in advancing in my career. Just kinda existing and glued to social media thats reporting on the events."

106,3,"Hi all. I’ve recently been having trouble at work, since I disclosed my ADHD diagnosis. Despite my manager repeatedly telling me he is supportive, his actions have not matched that. Today, I was pulled in for a reprimanding for the 2nd time in the past week regarding my ‘communication’ skills. Despite the fact i’ve repeatedly explained that he is demanding I change something innate about myself, he was so mad at me. I also explained that, without giving me the resources to build those skills, it is impossible for me to change and I compared it to asking someone with a broken leg to walk. He scoffed at this suggestion. The crux of the argument was me telling him he couldn’t sack me for something related to my disability, without offering support for me to improve, and giving me adequate time to implement these improvements. For context, I work for a small company and my boss owns the business -as he pointed out to me today, he can do ‘whatever he wants’.

Anyway, the conversation ended positively, but the real reason for making this post is I am so fed up. I hate living in a world designed for people without ADHD, and feeling like every system out there is designed to fail me. I am a good person - I am kind, generous, hardworking and intelligent. Yet I am genuinely struggling to exist in a world where I feel I am not wanted (because of the system design). I’ve spoke to my mum, and we are going to look at applying for PIP (disability benefits) so that I can afford to work part time, but I know this is a long road. I cannot afford to live on SSP (statutory sick pay). I am exhausted, burnt out (professionally and emotionally), and I am so frustrated that I am expected to just accept that and put on a mask for the rest of my life, just to appease others.

108,1,"Ever since I started taking Abilify, I’ve noticed a significant reduction in the effects of stimulants. I no longer feel the full kick from caffeine, and I used to be very sensitive to ADHD medications—small doses were enough. Now, I require a much higher dose to feel any effect.

I also suspect that Abilify is dulling the effects of my antidepressant, Wellbutrin. I used to feel motivated while on Wellbutrin, but since starting Abilify, that motivation has disappeared. I’m now struggling with a chronic lack of drive and motivation. I also continue to feel emotionally numb and anhedonic—though this is somewhat more tolerable with Ritalin.

I’ve reduced my Abilify dose to 2.5 mg, but it still seems to be interfering with the benefits of my other medications. I don't know why this is happening.

Unfortunately, I can’t stop taking Abilify because it helps manage my bipolar and schizoaffective symptoms. I’m also very paranoid and afraid to try new medications due to the higher risk of severe side effects. So for now, I feel stuck. I’m debating whether I should lower the dose even more.

Anyone else here on Abilify? Did it dull the effects of stimulants for you, or did you not notice a difference?"

For the last month of my titration I have the option to try Methylphenidate (after having tried Elvanse) to see if I don’t get as many side effects. (Elvanse has been great and I am slightly reluctant to stop, but worst side effects are teeth clenching, very spotty and burnt out feelings).

I mentioned that I cycle in the mornings and have to take it a bit later, so she suggested a short-acting version.

I would love to hear experiences of Methylphenidate long and short acting to help me make a decision, as I can only try one of them in my titration. After that I have to pay.

I detest being treated disrespectfully, yet I'm becoming stressed out because I've had a few people complain to my manager about me. I don't want to get into any kind of difficulty or be fired. I'm not sure whether I'm making this up, but it really is difficult for me to keep my emotions in check when I'm under pressure or when someone is rude or disrespectful. I’ve never been good with confrontation ever, so when I feel like people are upset with me or pissed off at me, I feel defensive. I realize this is a problem and I would be devastated if I were to lose my job because of this.

But I just realized I really struggle with depression and used to skip showering every other day or sometimes more…. But showering at the gym is really easy?? Like it shouldn’t be easier because I used to shower before bed and I didn’t usually change into clothes afterwards (wearing pjs to bed adds to my unorganized laundry baskets so sleeping naked is easier) 

However it was easy to feel too tired at the end of the day and throughout the daytime I’d completely forget about the shower. 

So the gym is just the perfect reminder for me. Like it’s right there so I can’t forget. Is this strange?? "
114,1,"Social media and video games worsened my productivity and executive function, which were already poor- obviously this isn’t a unique story. I knew it and decided to do something about it. I’ve deleted social media, and haven’t had it for months. Same with video games. I thought that once I eliminated the distractions, I’d get back to being productive and having drive to get things done like I used to, like working out and reading. But even now that I’ve had these distractions cut out for awhile, I’m still having so much trouble replacing them, and picking up the slack. My brain doesn’t want to do anything. I just want to sit on the couch. Or watch TV. How do I turn this around? I can force myself to suffer through tasks with no drive and hate every second of it, but how long before I get back into the good habits, and start enjoying them again? Start having a drive for them again? Is there anything else I need to be doing? "

116,3,"Getting out of bad, preparing myself for the day and making breakfast is one of the biggest challenges of the day for me. Sometimes I spend hours procrastinating, doomscrolling, letting the day pass by until there is immediate urgency to do something.

However, cooking is one of the most tedious chores for me (also, since my appetite is very low in general).

Since starting a medicine for anxiety, I decided since my anxiety had improved that it would be fine to try some black tea (which was caffeined). Before going decaf, I didn't really have caffeine a lot, except an occasional iced coffee. When I tried the tea, the tea was good, but the caffeine honestly ruined it for me. It made me very sleepy to the point I want to take a nap, and I don't think I will be having any caffeine any time soon. Does anyone else here have strange reactions to caffeine?

119,3,"Hey there,

I (24F) just finished my studies, have my master degree, and my first well paid job. It's an office job that requiers alot of autonomy, to plan my own projects, and I can fully work from home.

Like every job I ever had, I just get bored, procrastinate, can't be stimulated, and keep doing the most stupid mistakes because I don't really care that much. I daydream of changing, doing jobs where everyday is different, but I have no idea what would fit me. I feel like every job ends up the same : After 6 months, I lose all interest. (Rn i'm in consulting)

I have ALL the conditions to live like a queen and I keep failing. I can WFH, work at the office, work like I want, and I still fail. Even when I had hours imposed (9/5) I spent 6 hours of scrolling reddit and the last 2 hours stressing on the deadlines I had.

I am medicated but motivation is still not here and I'm terrified of losing my job. Every job I do, my bosses are not happy with me and say I'm not motivated. They are right.

I feel lazy asf. My coworkers are probably not motivated but It doesn't seem like a chore for them to just START working. They don't question it. For me it's a daily battle and it kills me. I have to work on week ends bc I don't work during my work days.

Pls what the fuck can I do. I'm an ambitious girl, always find my way, always got the best opportunity, but I can NEVER stay. I just don't want my life to be a daily nightmare and anxiety to never be good ever and always feeling like a fraud.."
120,3,"Currently on desktop I use Sunsama, but the mobile version is not helpful at all. When I’m not at my desk, I want something very visible on my phone and Apple Watch both with plenty of widget and notification options. So for mobile I use structured. 

Both accept calendars as input, which is good, and Sunsama also integrates the other way so tasks there can make their way over to structured. I also really like how Sunsama measures how much time you spend in each category (channel) without needing a separate app to track it by hand—as many of you may know, time tracking is a tool frequently recommended for ADHD patients in therapy but doing it is nearly impossible because that itself takes time and you have to remember to do it. 

Sunsama also has a fantastic feature where you can add subtasks to a task and assign times to each subtask. Not only does Sunsama auto-calculate the entire time for the whole task based on this, but also gives you separate timers for each subtask so you can go back and see the Actual vs Planned time for each subtask. Pretty incredible. 

If Sunsama had a usable mobile interface I probably wouldn’t be here as this is so close to what I’m looking for. However, another big problem is multi-select. Not one of these apps has multi-select. Apparently if you pay for a desktop tool for google calendar you can multi-select that, but I don’t really want to. 

Why I can’t find a time blocking app with good notifications and widgets on mobile, multi-select, time tracking, and subtasks, I will never know. All of these seem like the very basics of a time blocking app, and yet here I am using three separate apps just to get through the day. 

So tell me—what system do you use that keeps you moving from task to task and actively working on time blindness?"

But I’m holding back from being fully open about it because it’s so stigmatised. I see the way other people cringe when somebody else’s discloses theirs, the way the atmosphere changes and how judgemental people are about it. And being able to think more clearly has made me realise how savagely stressful my job is and I love it so much but I’m not sure if it’s sustainable. I’m also realising my age, and realistically where I am in life. Even though logically I know I’m doing okay, especially given the challenges, it just doesn’t feel that way"

This morning I set a long-overdue medical appointment, then realized it was during the period I was going to suggest for the trip. 

I called our project manager and it turned out the boss didn't want me to travel anyway. We talked about the pacing of all of my projects, and I felt like I had a handle on everything after the call. 

**And so I spent the next 2 hours on my phone taking a ""break"".**

I like my work most of the time, with the exception of the ambiguity. The ambiguity can be dealt with by spending dedicated time writing things out, or asking questions.

I'm only just figuring out that the deadline I'm given is usually the drop-dead deadline for the project as a whole, not when I need to have materials to my coworkers so they can review, and I'm afraid if I can't get myself to...

- set made-up deadlines
- honor them as real

... I'm going to get a reputation for procrastinating until the last second and stressing out my department in the process.

I've never been able to actually believe my own faux deadlines/boundaries.

2. Place feet in air, mimic sitting position but with back against bed

3. Rock body in direction of head to feet, building momentum.

4. Stop when torso in air. 

Congratulations. You’re no longer lying down. Getting off the bed is now much easier.


 ——————



It’s helped me get out of bed when plain “GET OUT OF BED” thoughts don’t work.

The torso feels most heavy for me so getting it up in one go feels it takes conscious efforts. My execution mind doesn’t allow it.

But by using momentum, and starting small with only micro actions showing I can control my body, I effectively lower the mental wall of getting up.

132,2,"Hey everyone,

I have an intake appointment this Tuesday to finally look into a possible ADD diagnosis. Yesterday, while going through some old files, I found a psych report from when I was 16. It was part of an autism screening, but ADHD was considered too. The conclusion? “No signs of autism or ADHD.”

Reading it now at 25 honestly blew my mind. It felt like reading a profile of my current self. Some quotes from the report:
- “She’s unable to make a plan on her own. At the same time, when she really wants something, she’s perfectly capable of planning it out. Her father believes her abilities don’t come through because she lacks interest.”
- “Needs support with learning how to study, get organized, and tackle assignments.”
- “Always had a restless mind and needed extra support to get started, even with small tasks like cleaning her room.”
- “Needs constant, very strict structure to take action. Without it, nothing happens.”
- “Zoned out a lot in class. Couldn’t get started on tasks. Got stuck in the details.”
- “Spends hours on her phone. Neglects herself and her environment.”

This is just a small part of it. I’m honestly shocked this wasn’t flagged at the time. The tone of the report leans toward ‘personality quirks’ or external factors, but now I read it and think… how was inattentive ADHD not considered more seriously?

They only checked for ADHD because it runs in my family (dad, both brothers, niece, nephew).

Now I’m wondering: should I bring this report to my intake? It clearly shows these traits have been around for a long time, but I’m worried it could bias things or make them think it was already ruled out. Thing is—I’m struggling more now than ever.

Has anyone here brought old psych reports to an assessment? Did it help or hurt your case? Would really appreciate any advice or shared experiences.

133,1,I’ve kind of came to terms that I’m not suited for office jobs that are fast paced and require high attention to detail. I’m currently working as a transcriber and there’s a target that I would need to achieve everyday and I can’t reach that target and I make mistakes. Im most likely not going to get my contract renewed and that’s ok tbh. However I’m not sure what kind of job would suit me afterwards? I don’t want to waste time. I feel a bit discouraged and sad but I’m trying to embrace it and take it as a learning experience. 
134,0,So..good news 😁 I'm just a physical check up away from ~finally~ getting my meds. Appointment is next week so I might have about two weeks left until I can start taking them and I'm super exited. I thought about trying out some things before and write a kind a diary to compare how the meds affect certain things. For example write for an hour or two straight or go the gym or whatever. I really don't have a clue and may have to high expectations on what the meds can do but yeah. Maybe you have suggestions? 😁💚
135,1,"So I recently had an eval for ADHD... I got my results back today and according to the results, though I showed signs of ADHD and it runs in family, they diagnosed e with depression.

I'm frustrated as hell cause I can't ever seem to get done the things I want to get done and yeah that makes me doubt myself a lot and fucks with my self-esteem making me feel like a joke or worthless but I know I'm not.

I guess there's the old trope of artists and creatives having ADHD. Maybe ADHD is beneficial for creativity, but terrible for productivity. I was wondering what artists can do to manage the problematic symptoms of ADHD? How have you maintained productivity? How do you deal with perfectionism? How do you get through the boredom? How can I focus on making one piece of artwork when I'm constantly being flooded with new ideas that interest me more?

I'm really frustrated by my procrastinateions. I have spent my life, from childhood on, creating art. From my earliest memories, all throughout school. When I went to art skool, things all fell apart. I couldn't find a niche, always was changing methods, changing mediums, and always turning in assignments late.

I'm on Medikinet/Ritalin for around two months now. I wanted to ask you all that use it what are your best practices while using it? I'm mostly using the version with longer release for 8hrs. Sometimes the short 4hrs one. 

I noticed that I definitely need to remember to eat because if I dont I will ""pay for it"" later. Meaning that when the drug wears off I feel double tired and lack of energy. 

So for me when it stops working I feel tired and kind of ready to fall asleep (luckily I have no issues falling asleep later). But the really annoying side effect is headaches and some kind of a feeling of pressure in my head. 

Is there any best practices you have? From silly ones like drink more water to maybe some diet tips?

145,2,"Hey everyone,

I’m 25F and currently waiting on my ADHD assessment results, and honestly this part is turning out to be way harder than I expected.

I finished all my testing almost a month ago - the interviews, WAIS, memory tests, TOVA, attention tasks - and I finally get my results this Wednesday. And now that it’s getting close, my brain just keeps spiraling. Some moments I feel like “yes, everything finally makes sense,” and other moments I feel like I made it all up, or that I’m just lazy and looking for an excuse.

The testing itself was a little rough emotionally. I felt really dumb during parts of it - especially the digit span tests (I couldn’t remember more than like 4-5 numbers) and a couple general knowledge questions I completely blanked on under pressure. I keep replaying my answers and cringing, thinking ""they must think I’m dumb."" But I also know that I don’t struggle because I’m unintelligent - my brain just doesn’t always cooperate when I need it to.

The worst part is my clinician kept a total poker face the whole time, which made everything harder. I know they’re probably trained to stay neutral, but it left me feeling so unsure and unseen - like I have no idea which way this is going to go.

It’s been exhausting carrying this stuff for so many years without answers - the executive dysfunction, procrastination, perfectionism, emotional spirals, people-pleasing, burnout, anxiety, depression… and now that I’m finally this close to clarity, the waiting is driving me up a wall. I feel ridiculous for needing so many little coping strategies just to survive the waiting period.

If anyone else has been through this part, or just wants to share some reassurance, I’d really appreciate hearing from you. Logically I know the waiting doesn’t change the outcome, but emotionally it’s getting really heavy.

Thanks so much for reading 💛"
146,2,"I'm one of those ""diagnosed late in life"" folks. I'm just shy of 2 years knowing, medicated going on 4 months or so. 

Yesterday, my spouse and I got all the way to the fireworks store before realizing **he forgot the coupons.** Which was the whole reason for going. 

I observed having a few moments of panic when he realized he'd forgotten them. My first instinct was to apologize for not picking them up when I saw them on the table at home.

I had to interrupt that thought pattern, and my actual response was very gracious and compassionate. Whereas, that's not at all how *I* am with myself with *I* forget something... I digress 😑

We weren't far from home, so we went back and grabbed the coupons. 

Then, when we checked out... He misread the fine print and we picked out the 'wrong' fireworks. We had already been gone for almost 3 hours at this point. Apparently, I have a fireworks shopping limit and we were quickly approaching that. 

I experienced another little moment of panic because, ""oh shoot we got the information wrong, we wasted time, etc"" and now we have to figure this out. 

I started to try and make sense of the items, and quickly interrupted myself again. I comically said aloud, ""Ya know, this is his purchase. I'll just step outta the way and let him handle it."" Then, I asked him for the keys and went and sat in the vehicle.

The awareness of my own thought patterns was new. It surprised me that I was able to identify that the feeling of panic was in response to someone else's mishap. No doubt, I was getting ready to shame spiral and it wasn't even my fault.

I assume this is just a trauma response from my own past (and current) struggles. 

Have you noticed you do this? 

How do you calm yourself down?"
147,3,"Hi guys, do you know any credible doctor who can give online diagnosis?

Here's the thing. I have official diagnosis in my country but it was extremely short meeting. Idk, maybe it was obvious, but I'm afraid that it was due to the time constraints. All doctors here are extremely overloaded so it was impossible even to find alternative. The others wouldn't even put me to waiting list. So I went to the only one who had place and he gave me diagnosis and Strattera recipe.

Now, Strattera doesn't really seem to do anything for me, except for making me give up running I was doing regularly for almost a year, due to elevated heart rate with which I don't feel comfortable running anymore tbh.

Now, I'm not such a fan of running, so if meds worked, I'd be totally OK with never running again or just running slower paces. But meds don't seem to do anything for me! The only other option to try in my country is Ritalin and I'm thinking whether it makes sense to try it (doctor offered to try it if Strattera doesn't work after month).

Thing is, while I have a lot of ADHD features, I'm not 100% sure I have it. I don't remember when symptoms started. In first years of school, I'm sure I was OK. But then I'm sorta not sure. I'm more inattentive type (if I have ADHD), and it's difficult to judge symptoms during younger age for me. My mother was extremely controlling and I had very rigorous schedule, and I also didn't have to do any house work ever... So I cannot judge much whether I had same issues as now at that age.

I want to speak with someone who is mainly specializing on ADHD in adults, who has more time and has a lot of experience. I don't need this person to give me any prescription. I just want to confirm/reject the diagnosis in a longer more in-depth session, even if it costs some money.

Do you have some recommendations for online specialists? Is it more difficult to give diagnosis online than in person? Is it possible even? Please, help me find someone experienced!"

149,1,"Hi everyone,

I’m a software engineer living with ADHD, and I’ve been struggling with something that I hope others can relate to — and maybe offer some advice on.

Because of my ADHD, I find it hard to focus on just one thing for a long time. I tend to jump between multiple activities every day. For example, I go to the gym and lift weights, but I’m just an average lifter. I do Leetcode problems, but I struggle with the Hard ones. I try to work on hobbies, but I rarely stick with them long enough to see progress. Even in conversations, I often have ten things I want to say at once, and it makes communication tough.

Professionally, I know I’m a good engineer — I can solve problems and contribute meaningfully. But personally, I feel like I’m surrounded by people who are really *great* at one thing: whether it’s gaming, weightlifting, communication, or some niche skill or hobby. I feel spread thin, like a jack-of-all-trades and master of none. And it’s starting to feel discouraging — like I’ll never “make it” or feel truly accomplished at anything.

I’m hoping to hear from others who might be in the same boat — especially fellow software developers, athletes, gamers, or creatives who deal with ADHD. How do you deal with this feeling of being average at everything? Have you found a way to balance variety and focus?

Thanks in advance for any thoughts or experiences you’re willing to share. It would mean a lot."
150,3,"I’m on adderall 20 XR and I still feel like I have crippling ADHD. I have a new high demanding job that required attention to detail and focus. I work in weddings. I do well at selling the wedding venue which is what my job is but I’m helping detail weddings and it’s taken over everyday because I have such bad adhd that detailing the weddings is my hyper focus because I’m so scared I’m gonna miss something and somehow I always do. I was so confident at my old job when I was selling but it became toxic so I got this job and the detailing part of it has me feeling like I’m failing. Not to mention I’m not making sales because these clients need so much attention. 
When I get home I’m completely beat. Thank god for my husband he helps so much around the house but it’s to the point where he’s doing pretty much everything. I have never had the patience to cook a meal the hyper active part in me just wants something quick. So he cooks. My laundry is legit the most overflowing in my bedroom and my kids. I will say I take care of my kids laundry first and always make sure they’re taken care of. Then my husbands and then mine. But it over flows and I can never catch up. I’ve tried the one load a day. Doesn’t work because I get so sick of doing it everyday I leave it and then it sits in the wash and I feel like a failure. I clean my floors and then my 2 dogs just come right in and dirty them up in seconds. I just feel like I’m doing something wrong and just can not catch up. I need to learn techniques to get better because I want my kids seeing a healthy happy mom who takes care of things so they can learn from me. I don’t want to be someone they learn what not to do from. "
151,1,"Im a runner and I always thought that exercise was supposed to improve adhd symptoms. Well... for me it does the opposite. Like going for a short run is beneficial but if im training for a long distance race and running everyday it gets impossible to keep a stable mental state. I just start spiraling, getting very confused and shifting focus unable to preform normal home tasks without it taking twice as long. after a few days of such training my mind gets very calm and thats a bad thing because my working memory gets very shitty.

Im very upset because running is honestly my only consistent hobby and the reason to live (dramatic but true) - and regulating my runs to keep them short sucks. its probably some electrolyte or vitamine deficiency idk...

Anybody with simmilar experiences?"

154,1,"Every time I or someone close to me has to take an ADHD test about me, I always test negative. I've realized this is probably because I was raised (or tortured, more accurately) to be the exact opposite of what a person with ADHD naturally is.

I grew up in an environment where I had to understand tasks without clear instructions. I learned not to ask for clarification because all I would get were blows or insults (from my parents), or a sarcastic response or repetition (from my teachers). And when I got things wrong, they simply assumed it was because I didn’t know the answer, didn’t know how to do the task, or didn’t listen to them. 

I'm naturally a very energetic person, but due to frequent moves and strict parents who taught me to undervalue friendships, I ended up converting all that energy into hours and hours of daydreaming. My moments of concentration often drive me into depression because my parents have made it their mission to belittle everything I do.

I also tend to treat people formally, avoid eye contact, and speak quickly. And the criticism for this has led me to simply not speak at all.

Emotionally, I was completely stunted by my parents.

And I'm sure many people have identified with this. This is why ADHD testing shouldn't be the reason to rule someone out for ADHD."
155,0,"2021, me and a friend started in arts, painting and drawing. I quickly grasp the concept, practiced on it non stop thanks to my overfixation. 

My friend was slow, he understood it a bit late. 

5 years later... My art was average, at best. 

That friend, he was already at levels above me. Even profiting from his arts. 

Thats when I realized an ADHD's fatal flaw,

I can analyze anything fast. But forget it immediately. 

My friend grasp the concept, he familiarized it, and made his own technique. 

I was a mixture of many techniques for the sake of ""Exploring"", thats why I did not master anything. Even if I did, my memory will just RESET again after some time, mastering nothing. 

Understanding this boosted my skill in arts. Applied it on other fields like fitness and public speaking. I can now confidently say, i'm competent in those. 

My skills may not be that good as masters, but I know where my strengths lies. That itself is mastery.

Hope this concept helps you, and you overcome that mastery wall. "
156,3,"Good lord man, it’s like I never learn.
This is gonna be another expensive repair and heaven only knows if any of the files I had are going to be on there, if a repair shop even manages to revive it.
At a certain point, I acknowledge that ADHD is different from simply being negligent and not being a good steward of my belongings but it’s very irritating having the problems in your path piling up and knowing that at the end of the day, you are the primary cause.

"
157,2,"I'm going through the diagnosis process right now, and according to the medical professional, it seems to heavily sway in favor of me having it.

So though to ask about how do people with it manage to keep their living spaces clean and orderly, or to start cleaning in the first place, when it all seems so overwhelming especially when the amount of cleaning needed is very high."
158,0,"I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately. Most stories paint immortality as this tragic, lonely curse where people grow tired of life. But honestly? I think if anyone could actually enjoy it, or even want it in the first place, it would be someone with ADHD.

We’re wired to crave novelty. Constant stimulation. A deep hunger to learn, explore, and try new things. The idea of having unlimited time? That’s not a nightmare. That’s a playground. The meme of wanting to do everything can no longer be a meme. 

Imagine being able to master every hobby, learn every language, experience every era of culture, travel the entire galaxy once space opens up. You could reinvent yourself every few decades just for the hell of it. You’d never run out of new obsessions. You’d never have to choose one path and stick to it forever. You could chase every spark of curiosity as far as it goes.

Immortality would feel less like a curse and more like finally having enough time to do everything your brain ever wanted to do.

Anyone else feel this way? I mean we’d definitely lose loved ones along the way but it doesn’t mean we can’t find more and cherish the time you do have with them. 
"
159,1,"TLDR: how far off is ADHD from narcissism & is there anything we can do to be better ppl?

I (M30s - Dx)  have recently been liatening to an audiobook on narcissists called ""Its Not You"", after my fiancee (F30s - BP2) ended our 10yr long relationship basically labelling me as a narcissist (well, really she listed off all the terrible things about me & told me all her new friends think I am scum). This is the person who has known me better than anyone, who I considered my best friend up until the turning poing about a month before she called off our engagement, so I took her critisms quite seriously. I honestly want fo reflect inward & address this, see if I should be labelled a narcissist, and if so what I can do to grow.

During my research I found ""Its Not You"" on relationships with narcs. While listening to it, they talked about narcs having major insecurity & a massive sensitivity to rejection.... RSD being my biggest challenge with adhd as an adult I now do wonder if this accurately labels me and if its more narc than adhd that I struggle with."
160,2,"Hi all, looking to hear others’ experiences switching medication. I was on Concerta successfully for a good 10 years — took 54mg every morning and it helped me function successfully in life. Over the last several months it hasn’t been working the same. My Doctor had me try out 60mg of Vyvanse in the morning and 10mg in the afternoon, but still I saw no improvement. I’m trying out 5mg of Adderall tomorrow morning and then 5mg in the afternoon… my question is… will this make any impact whatsoever? Given the high dosages I’ve been on, I just can’t imagine this is going to do anything at all… and I’m a bit nervous being this close to unmedicated during the work week. "
161,2,"I’ve realised as of late that I can only really operate when I have someone else with me; I need a goon

Such as

extremely difficult to actually purchase things from vintage stores without a friend with me

Or it would take me hours to get a single sentence for some sort of school assessment, but the moment I have a whiteboard and a friend who nods their head at me while I’m doing the whole “IT’S ALL CONNECTED” thing, and I can finish it in minutes

Other social stuff also

I imagine that having a friend with me constantly is impractical 

So

Can a support worker be that person for me?, if so, how do I go about getting one? Is this the accountability buddy thing I’ve been hearing so much about? Would some other kind of person be able to fill that role?"
162,2,"Are there any relatively accurate ADHD screenings/tests online I can take just to get an idea if I even might have it before making an appointment with a psychologist?

Would like to get something figured out, thanks! "
163,0,"I’ve been thinking about an app idea that helps you manage your time across different apps, like if you spend too long on social media, it could remind you to switch over to something more productive, and even step in and block certain apps after a set time.

It’s not about being super strict, just giving you a bit of structure so it’s easier to stay focused without things getting out of control.

Would something like this be helpful for your focus or routine?

Is this the kind of tool you’d actually use , or even pay for if it worked well?

Would love to hear your thoughts.

164,3,"So recently diagnosed, still trying to get dosage on meds right for me. Started with 5mg tablets of Ritalin. The pharmacy was out of them and I had to wait for them to order more.

They ordered them but apparently they didn't arrive, so im pretty much screwed in that department for another week. Anyone else experiencing something similar or have any advice?"
165,1,"It's always the hyperfixations, all the time. I have no real passions at all, I have nothing special about me. I always see other people with all these cool things that they love doing and I get o jealous, I wish I was me, I wish my brain wasn't always a fake version of myself who I think I am. 

Hyperfixations suck, I always get them, I feel like I have actually found myself for once, like I know who I am. I get so excited for a couple weeks before, everything just shifts, I notice it the moment it happens, that happiness and excitement starts to fade and it almost feels like you are losing a pert of yourself, it's sad, it's horrible. 

I just need some empathy, I wish I had actual interests that weren't fake versions of myself."
166,2,"I started taking Adderall XR last week. I went from 10mg to 15mg this week. It's been a weird experience because I was on Concerta before this and I felt absolutely out of my mind with anxiety and insanely wired.

Adderall makes me tired and generally I feel normal. I can tell I'm slightly more motivated then before. I am pretty sure I'm bumping up to 20mg next week.

What I'm finding though is the dry mouth and nausea are starting to show up. 
Neither gravol, Pepto or anti acid seem to quell the nausea.
The dry mouth I've tried Xylitol tablets and gum with little help. Drinking water is making me rush to the bathroom every 30 minutes and still doesn't take the edge off my mouth.

The XR is supposed to last 14 hrs I was told and I'm finding if I take it at 8am, by 6pm I am absolutely exhausted with no motivation. This also seems to be when the nausea is the worst.


Any recommendations on how to combat any of these side effects? Do they end up going away once you plateaued?

167,2,"Hi folks - I was just diagnosed with ADHD about a month ago at age 28. I started with 10 mg XR of Adderall, felt *amazing* for about a week, then felt like it just completely stopped working. My doctor upped the dose to 20 mg XR, and on this dose I feel like my anxiety/trichotillomania/dermotillomania have skyrocketed. Has anyone dealt with this, and should I maybe try switching to Vyvanse? I just messaged my doctor to talk about switching or trying maybe 15 mg, but I am so new to stimulants and I have no idea where to go from here. 

I’m feeling a bit defeated. That week where my brain was calm was so amazing, and I’m scared I’ll never feel that again. Any advice would be so appreciated 🩷"

I could have them repeated too and still forget. However, I could recite the entire plot of all 3 seasons of my favorite shows, or a very good chunk of the weapons in splatoon 3 and my opinions on them. Is this something other ADHD-ers(?) have trouble with? If so, what strategies do you use? "
169,3,"Hello peeps 

I have big big problem, 

How can I stop seeing everything that I do as a chore,.

What I mean by that is that every task i dont want to do or  don't see the use of doing even i need to do it...
For example: Daily tasks, exercise (especially the last one)

it is extremely hard for me to start/continue doing or even finish the task
Most of the time i just dont do it 

Then the spiralling starts....
I don't do it knowing well that It needs to be done them i feel guilty and very bad that I did not do the task
Blaming and putting myself down, beeing angry at myself, starting to panic and freeze totally shut down.... 

Anyone els has this problem? Or any tips or tricks how I can overcome this problem 
(it really bothers me, has a huge impact on the ppl around me and also my mental and physical health) 

I'm currently unmedicated and not in therapie 
But open for everything that might help me 

Any tips/tricks/advise? "
170,1,"I made a post earlier, but because i kept making mistakes i ultimately failed my course for the second time not because of the exam but because of the placement associated with it.

I do want to stay but i dont think ill find a cure in time. It would mean i take a risk of unemployment because thats the reality of university. Im 23 now and im just a burden to mg mum and dad.

171,0,"I know being indecisive is a thing with people with ADHD, but I feel like I am the opposite. Sometimes in an extreme way.

For example, I have a vague, brief idea for something (let's say... for a tattoo) and within a few seconds I decide that is the thing I need to do and will just do it. This goes along with bigger, life-altering decisions (opening a business, purchasing a house and other big investments, starting a new medication, etc). A lot of the times, it leads to good things so I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing. But for these big life things, I often don't put any thought into them, I just decide it's what I want to do. Of course, this has also ended in some bad results from time to time, but I guess the point is I just come up with an idea or thing I suddenly want to do and need to do it, even if I have no idea what I am doing.

Anyone else like this? What's it like for you? Would you consider this impulsiveness or just being super decisive? "

tell me why its midnight and i wont get the 8 hours of sleep i planned. this feels like a nightmare and this happens all the time. do you guys do anything specific to get into gear mode?

most of it is the fact that after 6pm, my brain stops holding itself accountable and is more lazy so i'll spend 30 minutes making myself a tea instead of 5 minutes... the tea was meant to motivate me to go study.

182,2,"Within my workplace, I was recently coached and instructed to cease using certain objects during periods of the workday - as they 'are not directly related to the task I am performing, and may be distracting to myself or others during times we are expected to be focused and vigilant.'

The issue is I have been using healthy tactics to maintain soft-focus & stimming relief, to contain the body reactions of hyperfocus, etc. Even expressing this notion with my supervisor, they are not understanding or tolerant. I need some advice!

For more context: I'm spending most of the workday in front of a computer console, an array of monitors, and other digital feedback of automation equipment & telemetry. I often will bring a small ten-pound weight with me to the chair, set it aside, and use it infrequently to help move some blood-flow around, active-stretch my arms, shoulders and wrists, and it really helps contain any physical symptoms of hyperfocus. It's immensely helpful, low impact, and hasn't caused any detriment to my performance. 

How can I swing the perception of this around to a more understanding view? Or, how can I best prepare and protect myself as an employee if I need to elevate this as an Hr complaint?"

188,1,"I've recently discovered that i am likely dealing with ADHD as i hit pre menopause (43 year old woman) and it specifically started to show when everything in my life crumbled all at once anout 1.5 years ago., I'm talking marriage, multiple jobs, hobbies; everything that I focused on throughout the day and night just all kind of ended around the same time.

Now i am reflecting on what issues and challenges may be due unknowngly having adhd. I am curious what kind of relationship issues or challenges others have noticed that could be due to either undiagnosed or diagnosed adhd? Specifically surrounding emotion dysregulation and communication Styles. 

I'm finding that it's hard to determine if there's certain personality traits or things that I thought were personality traits that are actually due to ADHD.

I'm also trying not to use it as an excuse but I think I've discovered a lot of things about it recently that is making me question certain things about myself more as I dig into this a little deeper and I was curious about other people's experiences. 

I'm also very in tune with people's emotions and non-spoken communication, I can generally tell when a mood is off or something is wrong. I have a lot of empathy and I can be very tone sensitive and I'm a very direct Communicator so I think I often struggle with when others aren't as open as I am, especially when I can tell something is off. This can make it hard for me when issues aren't dealt with right away but I also know that other people need more time to process things. I find it very difficult to have that limbo waiting stage when issues arise in relationships and I'm trying to navigate it but it is extremely challenging and sometimes it prompts me to make things worse due to needing some kind of closure or resolution of the matter.

Pleaseeeeeee give me your suggestions for what y’all do because my mom is sick of looking at my laundry in baskets. "
193,3,"This one over here: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSfCdBBqNXY

I watched that and was floored how well many of the descriptions matched my experience, save one. 

In this video, Dr. Barkely suggests people with ADHD should be punished ***more*** for the effects of their ADHD as if that will somehow help train them to overcome the symptoms of their ADHD. 

The point is made several times during the video but the bulk of it starts around the 1:21:00 mark. 

If punishment or consequences or negativity helped, it already would have helped. You know? Having ADHD hands you a lifetime pass to more negativity and consequences than most other people. I'm so utterly and completely over people nagging and complaining at me that my brain works differently. The idea that being nagged at ***more*** or criticized ***more*** is somehow helpful is completely counter to my entire experience. 

So is anyone with more experience with this guy able to explain what he actually means here? Because as he says it in the video it sounds like a living hell of even more negativity and bullshit rather than anything even approaching useful or helpful."
194,0,"I ask this because I feel this is a situation some of you may have experienced if you are readers. I have a couple novels I started many months ago, probably half a year or over by now, and it has been months since I last read them (I start way too many books at the same time). I want to pick them up again and finish them this summer, but I'm having a hard time deciding how to get caught up. I feel reading a summary or the last few chapters would be a nice quick way to do that but I'm also really tempted to just start both of them over again. This could most accurately refresh my memory of the story and wouldn't take as long since I have already envisioned every character and scene that occurred up until the stopping point. Still would take longer than a summary, though. One I was half way through and the other a third of the way. Any suggestions on which route to take?

For anyone wondering, the books are The Lords of Silence by Chris Wraight and Clockwork Angels by Kevin J Anderson."
195,2,"i'm on focalin XR right now, and it kind helps me not procrastinate but that's really it. i've experienced some weird side affects such as being really out of it. it's like my brain is somewhere else and i can't make any thoughts without having to focus and put all my energy into this one thought. so like i'll have to stop walking or sit down to just stare and try to think of what to do. also it's kinda like a 3rd person thing, i see through my eyes but i don't feel that i'm there.

anyone else relate? also any tips please"
196,1,"I've been on Methylphenidate for about a month and a half now. I was originally on 18mg but I was recently upped to 27mg and my experience has been horrible. My anxiety has been cranked up, ive been extremely depressed, and since friday I've felt drained and tired. Has anyone else experienced something like this on Methylphenidate? I have an appointment on the 24th and I'm 100% bringing this up. I have enough 18mg pills left to last me the week until then do you think its a good idea to go back to the 18mg? "
197,3,"So in the mornings I wake up brush teeth face restroom right but then go back to bed. I take my Vyvanse and Wellbutrin doom scroll until I feel I have energy enough to get out of bed. There has to be a better way what gets you going in the morning? What’s your routine like? Do you take maybe a booster in the morning instead of mid day? Exercise first thing? Coffee caffeine first thing then meds later? Run for some protein shake, eggs? I’m just useless until the meds kick in so sad. "
198,0,"I've noticed something strange about my ADHD brain lately - I actually get more creative and motivated when I'm hungry or really need to use the bathroom. It's like my brain suddenly kicks into high gear when there's some kind of physical urgency or discomfort.

Maybe this feeling was there before when I was doing other tasks, but I just ignored it or didn't pay attention to the pattern. Now I keep procrastinating meals until the cafeteria's about to close because I've unconsciously learned that I'm more productive in this state.

I'm thinking maybe I should eat less breakfast so I get hungry earlier and actually eat at normal times, but it feels counterintuitive to intentionally create discomfort just for productivity. Part of me wonders if this is just another manifestation of how ADHD brains work differently with urgency and pressure.

For fellow ADHD folks - how do you work with these kinds of deadline effects and physical cues? Do you lean into them as a productivity hack, or do you try to create more sustainable routines that don't rely on discomfort? I'm curious about your experiences with similar patterns.

What does this mean for managing ADHD symptoms in a healthy way? Should I be concerned about relying on physical discomfort as a motivator, or is this just another quirky way our brains function?"
199,0,"I was diagnosed at 42 in 2022. When reflecting back on my entire life until that point, so much made sense. Every struggle, every risk, all the things. What was my push to figure myself out? Noticing the same struggles in my daughter and then recognizing it all in my own mother.

I wanted to share my journey with medication, with maybe the hope that it would be helpful to some. I initially started taking Adzenys in 2022 and I did not like it. I took my entire prescription and never refilled it and then just went on existing without meds until 2025. I was tired of feeling stressed, my business is struggling, constantly overstimulated, bad sleep, etc. I found a new psychiatrist and she suggested Straterra. She started me out on 10MG a day and I eventually moved up to 10MG in the morning and then in the after noon for a total of 20MG for the day.

I am still on a lower dose than what I’ve been reading a lot of adults begin on, but this strategy seems to work really well for me. I wanted to share this with you all in case it might be helpful to split it up? Since being on Straterra my sleep is significantly better, my concentration is better, stress is down, anxiety is down. Overall, it’s been a game changer for me.

Constipation is definitely noticeable with this medication so I am diligent about water intake and healthy fats to help things along. I was surprised by this side effect, but it’s not terrible."
200,2,"Hi people!

After a long time of wondering why I couldn't focus on tasks like others, I recently came to the possibility that I might have ADHD. After doubting this, I booked an appointment with my GP who has given me a screening test to decide if I was eligible for a referral to get diagnosed.

I turned the test in and waited a few weeks to find out that I had ""passes"" and that I would be put on a waiting list to get diagnosed! Except, the waiting time was estimated to be *26 years*.

Yep, I asked my GP twice and she indeed confirmed that it was approximately 26 years. Obviously, it's not something feasible to wait for and so I was thinking of getting a private healthcare diagnosis. However, this is a problem since they are quite expensive and I am but a broke student.

Regardless of the expense issue, I wanted to tell my parents about this as I feel it is something I would feel guilty of hiding from them.

I floated the idea that I have ADHD, pointing out instances of my sometimes flagrant forgetfulness, and they chakled it up as something ""normal"" that ""everyone has"". Moreover, I was never displayed much or rather any signs of the ""hyperactive"" aspect of ADHD that it is widely known for as a child. I was very much quiet and reserved.

Now I can't take next step in telling them that I already went to see a doctor about it and that I want to get a diagnosis and possible treatment for it, treatment which may involve medication...

I should say that my parents care for me a lot and are very supportive but I'm still scared of being dismissed for something which I feel that if I start treating right now, it could change my life for the better. They would also feel very skeptical towards the idea of medications, especially stuff like amphetamines.

Bit rambly but I guess I just wanted to type this out to give myself some motivation to do it, and to stop putting it off. Thank you for reading.

Tldr: I probably have ADHD and I want to tell my parents but I don't know how."
201,0,"Why or why not?

I'm curious to hear about other people's schedules/routines, etc. and how you manage (or don't manage) them. Like, for example:

Do you eat meals and snacks at the same time every day?

Do you have strictly set routines/habits? (Like brushing teeth or doing dishes at the same time daily, for example)

If yes, how do you keep everything in check? Do you prefer it that way?

If no, then why? Do you prefer it that way?"
202,0,"Ok we love gum for this reason right? Love the feel of the  soft chewy chomppp lol

Regular piece of gum- excellent 

Big fat piece of gum- hell yeah brah

BUT have you tried 2 fat pieces on either side of your jaw?!  My brain just exploded and I think I need to change my underwear- like so good 😌💦 LOLLLLLLLLL

And I can do this like anytime?! wtf hahahahaha we’re so simple I love it 

"
203,0,"I started a project that I'd been thinking about doing for a long time, but haven't gotten the motivation to start ... until today. Like, 2 and a half hours ago. I have no explanation as to why I want to do it - best attempt I can make is that it can give me better geographical skills? I've also always had an interest in people - I'm currently in school to become a therapist, which isn't helping lol - and especially the intricacies of sonder (for those who don't know, the term ""sonder"" refers to the feeling of realizing that every other individual has a life as vivid and complex as one's own. It's the awareness that each person is living their own intricate story, with their own thoughts, feelings, and experiences).

I also once met this kid at an event who basically had a globe in his brain - he could give you the location of any country in the world, and I was absolutely fascinated by him - he even challenged me, and answered all of my questions correctly, it was so cool. I don't have the desire to be like him, per se, but he serves as a bit of inspiration.

To a person without ADHD, those two reasons don't really equate to the hours of research and writing this is going to take, so my next best answer is ""ADHD"".

Anyway, to get to the point, my ""project"" is basically researching and writing down every single country in the world, organized by continent (in alphabetical order), along with their provinces/regions, the capital city of each country and province/region, as well as their national and official languages, currency, and population. I'm currently making my way through Africa, and honestly, I'm having a grand ol' time so far. I've always loved learning, and this project gives me something to do after work instead of doomscrolling or wasting away in my bed like I have been.

Let's just hope the motivation lasts!"
204,1,"Since I was a kid, I felt like something was wrong with me. I couldn’t sit still, couldn’t focus, couldn’t finish anything. Teachers called me “smart but unmotivated.” At home, I either got ignored or punished. No one ever asked if I was okay.

I grew up believing I was just broken.

Every little task felt like climbing a mountain. I saw other people fly through life while I struggled to get out of bed. I felt behind, like I missed some crucial life lesson that everyone else got.

Eventually I got diagnosed with ADHD. But honestly, that didn’t magically fix anything. It just gave the chaos a name. The feelings? The pressure? The self-hate? Still there.

Recently, I tried to express all of that — the pressure to succeed, the trauma, the feeling of being stuck — in a short video I made.
Not to “go viral” or whatever, but because I just needed to get it out. For myself.
It’s raw, emotional, not perfect. But it’s real.

And if it helps even one person feel less alone, it was worth making.

You’re not lazy. You’re not broken. You’re just carrying more than most people see.
And you’re still here. That means something.

(I’ll put the link in the comments in case anyone wants to see it. No pressure.)

205,3,"I am just wrapping up a weekend spent at my family’s cabin with my brother and sister in law, and their two young kids, who are close in age to my two young kids.  We travel here several times a year but typically just with our own family unit.  Prepping for every trip, even though we visit every 4-8 weeks, is a week-long ordeal for me. Catching up on my family’s laundry, meal planning and grocery shopping for the trip, packing for my two littles and myself, and getting the house tidy enough so I don’t feel judged by the neighbor kid who feeds our cats while we are gone, is just an overwhelming amount of work for me.  I have packing lists and to-do lists that I use over and over, so I’m not reinventing the wheel for each trip, but it still takes me a full week to do it all.

Watching my sister in law prep to head home today, quickly, efficiently, seemingly effortlessly, without the anxiety and worry about getting it all done that plagues me, felt like a punch in the gut.  Another reminder of how much more smoothly life could be going, if only my brain worked a little differently.  Now I’m sinking deeper into a pit of sadness, thinking about how much time I’ve missed with my babies while stressing about and toiling away at things that others can complete in half tie time.  Not every mom struggles to keep her home in a state that is not overstimulating - why can’t I be one of those regular moms?

I was diagnosed at age 37, a year and a half ago when my second baby was 6 months old.  At first diagnosis was so validating, but now it just makes me more aware of the things that are hard for me, that are not at all hard for others.  Even medicated, and with new knowledge and tools, I am acutely aware of how much harder I have to work just to get to a “normal” person’s baseline… and I’m just so tired of it."
206,2,I took adderrall 10-20mg between ages 16-25 with hige success. Stopped abruptly for the last 5 years because any kind of stimulant started to give me panic attacks. Went off caffeine for three years. I am back up to where I can drink two ENTIRE diet cokes without freaking out 85% of the time. Thinking about going back on like 2.5 mg a day because my adhd is getting awful. However i am asking for advise on any other stimulant option that may not be as intense. I tried welbutrin/strattera and did not like it. THANKS!

He is not medicated. We have tried melatonin and it doesn’t work for him. I have tried herbal teas also. He takes magnesium only. We take technology off him around 9pm so he can unwind which he does by playing with Lego etc as he loves to be creative but he will do this for hours. Can anyone suggest something that has helped them sleep, preferably natural and any other insights about sleeping. Thank you"
208,2,"Hi! As the title says, could I get in trouble traveling with my medication to any of those countries?

 I'll be on vacation for about a month and even if I won't need the meds to work I like to take them to be more aware of my surroundings and keep track of my itinerary.

If anyone had travel there and can give me advice I would really appreciate it

209,0,"Hi all,

I wanted to ask about the price of Wellbutrin in Switzerland. Is it more expensive compared to other countries in the EU? I usually pay €5 per pack in Belgium, but I'm currently in Switzerland and may need to buy more soon. I still have a few tablets left, but just in case, I’d like to know how much it would cost here.

Thanks in advance!"
210,1,"I feel absolutely stuck in my life. I am 27 and was diagnosed with ADHD at 6 years old I am consistently on medication and have been in and out of therapy my entire life. I have had a partner for over 4 years now and I am madly in love with them but I have been incapable of moving forward with them.

I want marriage and a family but I can't make anyone happen. We get in fights because of this, they feel like I don't actually care and it's hard to blame them for feeling this way at this point. This is the person I want to spend my life with but I can't keep focused on the future. I get so caught just trying to manage my day to day that I don't think about advancing plans for the future. 

My memory is also miserable. I feel like brain is covered in fog and I can't remember conversations in the past making my partner feel like what I said didn't matter to me, like my promises weren't things that I meant. I just have no idea how to stay on task over a long period of time and I would appreciate any help."
211,2,"I’ve come out of a 5 year relationship which ended on good terms due to drifting apart. I’m now 1 year and 5 months being single. Myself and my ex recently spoke and she confirmed she doesn’t want to get back with me which if I’m honest I was expecting and it’s given me the closure I needed.

I have met someone new and it’s going so well. We click and it feels natural and nothing seems forced.

My concern is with my ADHD I fall really quickly for people and I’m worried I’m gonna end up putting her off. She’s fully aware I have ADHD but it’s getting to the point where I’m sitting on the edge of my phone waiting for her to message me back and also I’m not talking to family and friends as much as I’m so wrapped up in her.

How do I stop myself from getting so attached to feelings? Dating is tough and even harder with ADHD cus I’m always worried I’m gonna say the wrong thing or as already mentioned I get to wrapped up.

Thanks for reading"
212,0,"I’ve been slowly reducing my meds lately, and with that my sleep started to get affected. I also wanted to stop relying on melatonin (I always wake up groggy). It’s a pretty strict routine, but I sleep soundly and wake up with few/no tension injuries the next morning because I was so relaxed! Hope it helps give some guidance to people looking for something good:

- 8:45ish Do basic getting ready for bed stuff before starting in earnest. The main routine starts an hour before bedtime.

- 9pm/1 hour before bed phone goes away. Podcasts/music are ok, but no more scrolling.

- 9-9:30 do a calming activity that engages the brain and brings satisfaction (I either work on a puzzle or a page from a coloring book).

- 9:30-9:40ish 10 minute meditation (this is the last time I use my phone to set up and turn off the app I use, which is Oak btw! It’s free, and super minimal and chill). Put phone in a separate area for the night and head to bed. Do any last minute bed prep now.

- 9:45 Journal. Can be a few sentences or a few pages, just get any lingering thoughts out.

- 9:50-Falling asleep: Read. I can’t read educational books for longer than 10-15 minutes before losing interest, so I’ll read a section out of a good book until I’m starting to doze off, put it away, and go to sleep.

The difference is drastic and makes it worth the discipline it takes. It keeps me occupied away from my phone, doing fulfilling things, and releasing any lingering thoughts/anxieties I might have from the day. I highly recommend trying it out!"
213,2,"My son has been diagnosed with severe ADHD/anxiety and we’ve found stark differences between him taking pills (which he can rebound harshly) or a transdermal patch we we tolerates very well.

Does anyone have any ideas or things that have worked to cover the patch? Just wondering if anyone has had the same issue?"
214,0,"I used to get a bad headache after working hard mentally for hours or studying for the rest of the day, but since I started my medication, it all changed. Mental effort doesn't feel as draining anymore, it just feels like routine, like it's supposed to be. 

Therapy is probably awesome, but I really don't see how being better at scheduling can compensate for such things."
215,1,"Hey all, something that Ive noticed about myself this year is the excitment/hyper focus aspect of ADHD isn't effecting me how it has in the past. Nothing interests me or motivates me right now. I still get glued to things, usually doom scrolling or obsessively reading but I have zero hobbies or interests. 

When I Google hobbies to try and find anything, I dont feel the normal desire to start new quests. Im wondering if anyone has read any books that discuss having ADHD and depression? I have both and really want to find ways to work with them and get myself accomplishing things. I want to create and do but it's as though Im glued to the floor.. any book recommendations are welcomed, or if you know of a good Youtube video about this that's also encouraged!

Thank you in advanced, appreciate y'all a *lot*.


Also, I am currently reading *Now It All Makes Sense* by Alex Partridge and it's been a great read so far, highly recommend."
216,0,"Hello everyone! I’m really interested in understanding the relationship between ADHD and weight issues. Specifically, I’m curious about what percentage of individuals with ADHD tend to struggle with being overweight. If anyone has insights or relevant research on this topic, I would greatly appreciate your input! 

Reflecting on my own experiences, I dealt with weight challenges during my childhood in the early 90s. Back then, I often turned to food as a way to cope with the lack of stimulation or excitement in my environment. It would be enlightening to hear from others who might have faced similar struggles or have knowledge on how ADHD can affect eating habits and weight management. Thank you!"
217,1,"As I title, I often get this feeling that Im so much worse than everyone else. Two crucial facts about me is that I've been called smart my entire life, so a lot of my self-esteem is based on this fact, and second that my adhd is mostly ""tired type"". I dont hyperfixate often, although I have multilple intrests. But I'm constantly tired, I dont have energy to watch, think, study. I work on it but everytime I see people with ADHD who do stuff(even if its not reallly good in thier situation) i feel so jealous. 

So everytime someone says something I havent noticied, is funnier etc. I feel so less inteligent. I could write multiple examples, but its counter-productive. I work on it in therapy but I live in this contanst state of mind that everyone around me have so much more intresting things to say and that I don't have any orginal thoughts. 

So I wonder if it's common expierience. "

219,0,"After about 7 years, I’m planning to go back on ADHD meds. I was originally taking 20mg instant release Adderall 2x daily, but felt at the time that I was kind of losing my creativity, etc. However, now as an adult with an adult job, I’m finding it difficult to sometimes impossible to get tasks done regularly, so I’ll be consulting my doctor about starting a new prescription. Since I’ve only taken adderall, I’m curious to what the other options (or dosages) are and how people tend to feel about them. I’m specifically looking for anecdotal examples and personal experiences, not necessarily looking for a recommendation/advice, and again I will be consulting a doctor as well. Please delete if not allowed, and thanks in advance!"
220,1,"I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD just recently, and before that, my parents persuaded me to read and pursue education since childhood. Just to be clear: both of my parents are smart. Really, really smart, and I always was inspired to be like them.

My brain is filled with knowledge from everything I’ve ever learned—despite this, my grades are low, no one takes me seriously in real life or thinks I’m dumb, and the knowledge that I have? It’s nothing but a foggy snow sometimes falling right on the part of the brain that expresses it. Most snowflakes just fly by…

What was it all for? Freud, Kafka, Orwell, Plath, Camus, Plato, Woolf, Shakespeare, even Dante, damn you! Why do I need all this if everyone still looks at me like a complete illiterate idiot?"
221,2,"So I titrated on ritalin (5mg - 20mg) for a month with no real improvement to my ADHD symptoms. I felt slightly more productive and a little more sociable, but overall, nothing that really came close to helping with my other crippling ADHD symptoms.

 I felt disappointed, told my clinician that I wanted to try an entirely different drug next, as productivity and sociability weren't things I really need to improve. She said ""Elvanse is an entirely different drug, let's try you on that"". I'm now on week 2 with Elvanse (30mg currently), and it appears to be having the exact same effect as ritalin. Like, literally exactly the same; I'm a little more productive, and slightly more sociable. I even have the same side-effects as I did on ritalin; dry mouth, increased heart rate, loss of appetite. 

I'm not sure what I was expecting exactly, but knowing that it is an entirely different medicine, I guess I thought maybe this one would help with totally different aspects of my ADHD like brain fog, distractibility, focus, maybe even lessen my depression somewhat? If I didn't know that I was taking a different drug, I would think that I was still taking ritalin. It's so strange.

 The highest dose of ritalin I took was 20mg X3 daily, now I'm on Elvanse 30mg which is long-release. I wonder if, at higher doses, the differences between these drugs would be more prominent? "
222,2,"I always forget to eat and im usually on an empty/almost empty stomach, and when I take my concerta it hits me like a train wreck.

What’s something(s) I can eat to slow the medicine down?? (I can’t eat before taking my concerta it counter acts my other meds)"
223,1,"I really don't have the money but I'm going to figure it out somehow. There's a mutual aid group for queer people in my area where you can hire unqualified people to help out and I've decided to do this.

I've decided to hire someone to come help tidy up, do some admin with me and declutter once or twice a week. I get a small amount of disability benefits and I think this would be a good way to use the money. 

I'm also going to save up and get a dishwasher installed but this will take months on my income. But the constant dishes is really impacting my mental health. My kitchen is tiny and there's no free surface because of it.

I keep wishing I could just do these things myself and cope but idk maybe I need to just except that I need more support and trying to become a different person is going to hurt me more "
224,3,"Hi, all! Looking for a little bit of guidance. I’m currently recovering from my fourth concussion in my life, but this is my first since being diagnosed with ADHD. I’m 33F for context. This is my third concussion as an adult, one was as a toddler. 

I feel like my symptoms are worse than they have ever been. I take 15 mg XR adderall and 10 mg IR in the afternoon. I took a break for a few days over the weekend to try to force myself to rest and took it today on my first day back at work, but there is no difference between today and the unmedicated days post-concussion. My emotional regulation is not a thing anymore. Working memory and ability to focus? Never heard of her! etc, etc. 

My question is for anyone with experience recovering from a concussion with ADHD as an adult. Did you take a break from meds? Did your meds help? Did you have to adjust meds? What helped you during recovery?? I feel like I’m losing my mind. "
225,3,"Every day that I work, I hit the end of the work day and I think 'ahh, I've survied another day, they haven't caught all the things I've stilll not done yet'. I feel like I've got to work so hard to try and feel like I'm succeeding in my role but it never feels like it's actually enough and I get this dread that I'm going to get outted as a fraud. This stress carries over into my personal time and I just end up stressing there too, if there's friction outside of my work like it feels like everything cascade fails. 

I've not had the opportunity to actually be taught how to live my life properly since my diagnosis, and all my attempts to get help so far have been rejected. Now that I'm avoiding talking about it, I feel it more accutely, I don't think I'm going to be seen or understood any time soon. "
226,1,"So at 31(F) I have finally been diagnosed as having ADHD inattentive type.  The claim that undiagnosed adhd has ruined my life is an understatement. I went to college for different programs and different fields of study maybe 5 separate times because I couldn't figure out what I wanted to do, and of course ran into the difficulty of having too little experience for the required ""entry level"" positions. It also hasn't helped that the jobs I did get over the years I had a ton of work performance issues because I kept making a bunch of careless mistakes  I should have caught if I had just paid attention closely enough and focused but my mind would not let me. 

I envy those with adhd that were able to find something they were passionate about from a young age and able to hyperfocus on something well enough to get good at it and thus make a career out of it.

Passion has always been a foreign concept to me. There was never anything I felt passionately enough about to hyperfocus on, so I envy those that can just dedicate themselves to doing something just for the pure enjoyment of doing that said thing. I don't know what that is like.

It also doesn't help that I grew up in a toxic family dynamic, with one emotionally neglectful and abusive parent, and the other being extremely distant mostly due to said abusive parent. My depression stemming from a young age may have made it impossible to find something I was genuinely passionate about, because I couldn't find joy in anything. 

Wondering if anyone has dealt with a similar situation and if or how you got passed this. "
227,0,"Hi,  as of now I have not been diagnosed with adhd officialy although i tried implying it to my psychiatrist. I'm on some antidepressant and I'm wondering. How does the Adhd medication affect you? Better focus? What are the negatives? How does it pair with anti-depressants(sulpiride)? Thanks"
228,0,"Using the term very liberally, but what I mean is that what works is telling myself:

**""I'm not going to [do X], I'm just [doing Y].""**

So like *""I'm not going to work, I'm just opening my computer""*. Or *""I'm not going to shower, I'm just getting up from bed""*.

I don't know why this works, as even the ""breaking tasks into smaller chunks"" strategy by itself doesn't work for me. Maybe because it combines that + active comparison to the big task + sunconscious effect of words, even if false? Who knows."
229,2,"So, i'm AuDHD and started meds a few months ago (methylphenidate XR). It works really well for my executive dysfunction. But what i've noticed, is that I now very often go into a store (where i have to tell the cashier what i want) and my mind kind of blanks on what I wanted to say.
 Previously I'd ""rehearse"" the situation, by telling myself what i'll say once i'm there. So that when I got there i'd automatically say what i had rehearsed. But since i started the meds i've noticed that that automation is gone. I now go into the store stand in front of the cashier and just blank for a second, before realising I have no clue what to say, frantically searching my mind on what i wanted. Sometimes even saying the wrong thing.
I have no idea if it's because i now don't have to convince myself to go into the store anymore, or if the meds kind of mess up my brain in that way.
It luckily isn't anxiety inducing, but it feels a little awkward walking in there and being like ""i'd like to get uuh......... this...uuuh..... i'd like xyz!""

So are there any other audhd people with the same or similar situation? "
230,2,"Hello,

I can tell when my ADHD meds aren't doing their job because I have a physical feeling in my head. There is a physical sensation in my brain that isn't there when I can focus, and is there when I can't.

Is there anything I can do to get rid of it? I've tried going outside and taking a walk, taking a break and doing something more enjoyable, and the 20/20/20 trick and nothing has really worked"
231,3,"Hi all,  
I’m really struggling with reading for pleasure at the moment. I used to love it — getting lost in a world, escaping reality — but now it just feels stressful and overwhelming.

I have *so many* books. A mix of physical ones and ebooks (I overthink whether to get the ebook or physical book - it's an agonising decision sometimes!), mostly fantasy, sci-fi, and detective/noir. I’ve picked up loads from charity shops, but some are halfway through a series, which sends me into a spiral — I feel like I *have* to start from the beginning, then I look up the full series (like Michael Moorcock stuff) and get completely overwhelmed by how much there is.

I find myself avoiding the books I already have, even though I used to be excited by them. Nothing feels like the ""right"" thing to read. I usually only read one book at a time, but right now I’ve got several on the go — *Uzumaki* by Junji Ito, *Greatest Hits* by Harlan Ellison, *How to Be a Stoic* by Massimo Pigliucci, and *Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*. I don’t know how I ended up like this. While I’m reading one, I’m thinking I should be reading one of the others.

And I hate how much other people’s opinions seem to affect me. I’ll be enjoying something, then hear someone say it’s not good or overrated and suddenly it colours how I feel about it. I wish it didn’t bother me, but it does.

I’ve been told I’m burnt out — nothing I used to enjoy is enjoyable right now, and I feel pulled in a thousand directions. Like that Tolkien quote: *“I feel thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread.”*

Part of me just wants to throw all my books in a skip, delete everything off my Kobo, and start from a blank slate. But then I feel guilty, or like I’m giving up. I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this — with reading or anything else — and if so, how you got through it? Tips, reassurance, or just someone saying “yep, been there” would honestly mean a lot.

Thanks for reading this ramble."
232,3,"The mess/clutter in my house is overwhelming.. it makes me feel so anxious and on edge all the time. It's like I'm trapped in a paralyzed state because I don't know where to begin. More recently, I have had the motivation to get things done, but my squirrel brain starts one thing then moves on to the next without finishing the first and repeats that about 20 more times creating more disarray. It's affecting my relationship because he's not a self-starter and relies on me for direction/instruction (which is infuriating when you don't even know for yourself where to begin or what to do). We both have ADHD and pretty high anxiety. Our living environment, being the way it has been the past 6 months(ish), is so unhealthy for us mentally. We both struggle with organizing on a broad scale, but can hyper-focus on the smallest things and get little sections done like that..but it just feels defeating because it takes us such a long time to do so little and there's still so much to do. There is honestly not enough time for us to dedicate to our housework. This goes for when it wasn't such a cluttered mess. In general, we haven't been the best at staying on top of things because of how draining/exhausting life seems to be this past year (probably more) so I think it kind of all built up and now I feel like I'm in a mess I can't get out of."
233,3,"One thing that absolutely fires me up is when I'm given instructions to complete a task, but then once I complete the task, I'm told that it's incorrect or I should've done something differently, even if I followed the instructions to the letter. Totally pisses me off. 

Today, I wrote out answers to the questions we were discussing and sent them to my work lead. They agreed with what I had & told me it was correct. 

Then, during the meeting, in front of other supervisors & coworkers, it suddenly wasn't. WTF? When I tried to expound a little, I was interrupted, then told to let them finish but never given the opportunity to go back to my answer. 

I overall really like my job and my coworkers & supervisors. But this crap makes me so angry, frustrated, and unmotivated. Why try to answer and participate if the goalposts keep moving (or Lucy yanks the ball away)? It makes me feel stupid, and I'm not.

234,2,I was recently on 60mg of Vyvanse with a 15mg Adderall booster… I felt like it wasn’t really doing anything.. so my doctor switched me to Adzyns.. I noticed a total difference with this medication. It gives me more executive function and lasts longer. (I do have dips in the day where I lose focus) but it’s XR so I kind of expect that. The only issue I have is towards the evening when it is wearing off I start to become irritable and a little anxious. Im on 15.3mg. Not sure if I need to maybe go up a dose? I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced that. Even if you are not taking this medication I would love to know what you do to help your irritability or anxiety on stimulants. I know I’ve heard people say magnesium.. but any more advice would be really helpful! I’m new to this. Thank you! 
235,0,"Hi. My 7 yr old daughter has ADHD and shows attention deficit and hyperactivity equally. I see her having trouble sitting still in classes and keeps rolling off chairs to almost sleeping on it, can’t stand reasonably straight for a 30 min singing class, and so much more. I’ve seen her teachers give this feedback for her but they don’t understand why she can’t sit still or needs the movement. She is doing fine in understanding concepts, and is not falling behind in her class so we are not considering medication and helping her with time management and positive encouragement using points based rewards, etc. But i do see her teachers struggling (including us) in getting her to her still properly and focus. 

I’m looking for any suggestions from parents on things that worked for your kids. I’ve seen chair bands, etc. for helping with movement. Checking if any of these worked well.

Edited a little to clarify my intent as a parent to help in any way i can. Her teachers are not hard on her, it’s just feedback we get from them :) "

240,1,"I have not officially been diagnosed with ADHD but have always been convinced that I have it after taking psychopathology courses, reading through DSM diagnostic criteria and talking to friends. I just graduated from college and have always felt as though I could get by without meds, diagnosis etc. because I am generally ok at school and can work hard even though things definetely take me longer than others. I'm also a STEM major and these days there are endless resources to get by without having to read anything, and if I'm in a pinch I can use online tools to summarise texts that are easy to skim and get the big picture. I could never use textbooks for info because I can't focus on the text and don't retain any info, so I always prefered videos and talking through examples to learn. TDLR I really struggle with retaining info when I read and have been able to get around it in my college carrear. 

This never was an issue until I took the MCAT. I was pretty ok on the other sections but there is a reading comprehension section on the exam and I could not improve my score at all. I studied for the exam for 3 months and postponed for another 4 just to work on reading comp. I thought i was improving unitil I took the exam and got the same score I was at in the beginning, which was so incredibly frustrating because it is affecting my ability to apply to the programs I wish to attend. I am considering retaking the exam but only will do so if I can guarentee improvement on the reading (getting the same or worse score looks bad for your application). 

  
I was hoping to reach out and ask if anyone has felt a similar experience or has any advice on what to do. My options are 1) learn strategies to improve reading from others with similar issues, 2) see if I actually do have ADHD which I don't know for certain and if that is true try medications that may help with reading or 3) not do anything and don't retake the exam.

241,3,"I'm really struggling to find a local treatment option. I've been diagnosed with ADHD since I was a child but stopped treating it sometime in my 20s.

Every place I have spoken to made it a note to tell me that they do not prescribe ADHD medication. I've had a long history with taking ADHD meds and Im already familiar with which ones worked for me and which ones didn't. But I'm struggling to get my foot in the door to even have this conversation to consider options. 

Is there some kind of secret to getting treatment these days? Is there a telehealth option I could use that is reliable? I'm located in Southeast Michigan if anyone knows of any local options as well.

242,1,"For context, I was diagnosed as a kid with ADHD, but after \~15 years of struggling without any idea why, I finally found out and started pursuing medication. 

My appointment is tomorrow. I've officially lost any reason as to why I even want the meds in the first place. Of course, I still want them, but I have no idea what to say to my psych. I don't want to say the wrong thing, because then they might refuse me, or turn me away. All I fucking want is to feel normal. To just do things and not forget instead. To not spend my days rotting in my bed, buying new games I won't play, chronically watching pornography, wasting my life. I want to achieve something but its so hard. I hope that the meds will help me but I'm scared I won't get them.

Along with this, I emailed the service I'm attending about some concern I had, only for them to clarify it and mention a \*second\* session. I was the under the impression that, given my previous diagnosis, I wouldn't need more than one session - I've heard as much from others who have attended it. I'm scared because I struggle with saving money so badly, I had to take out a loan just to get the money for this appointment. I don't know what I'll do if I have to attend another one.

243,2,"Hi everyone,  
I'm wondering if others here struggle with this too — I find email incredibly exhausting, but not just because of replying.

What really gets me is the **mental energy it takes to dig through the noise** — newsletters, social notifications, promotions, random updates... just to find the *few emails that actually matter to me personally*. The stuff that's important *for me*, not for the sender.

It’s like walking into a messy room and having to **search under piles of junk** to find the one thing you actually need. And by the time I’ve found it, I’ve already lost the energy to respond.

I end up **avoiding email entirely**, and then everything important (and unimportant) just stacks up. The worst part is the guilt — feeling like I'm failing at something so basic.

I’ve tried tabs, filters, labels, but nothing seems to help long-term. I don’t need inbox zero — I just want inbox peace. 😮‍💨

245,0,"I'm currently on medical leave from work for \~4 months. This leave is related to work induced stress and anxiety, it's TBD whether I'll go back at all but taking this time to get some relief and hopefully reset for whatever is next. I've been on ADHD stimulant meds for the last few years after trialing all of the stimulants and non-stimulant options.  We';ve settled on 10-20mg dexedrine ER in the AM + 5mg dexedrine IR with an optional 10mg ER and/or 5mg IR in the late morning or early afternoon as needed, this has worked well and given my the flexibility I needed with my work. I work in the data science field and am a 40 y/o male.

My medication provider is the one who supported my medical leave by providing the necessary paper work and ahead of my leave we had talked about whether medication for anxiety (or depression) would be useful to try before going on leave or during. This isn't due to the the anxiety (or depression) as a result of the stimulant meds. My experience with stimulant meds has been overall positive after getting the correct dosage/type described above. I opted to wait to try anything else until I was on leave to consider any more medication and wanted to remove the factor of work before introducing anything else. 

I've been on leave for about a week and met with my provider last week and we discussed anxiety meds again. He made the fair point that it could be worth trialing some anti-anxiety medications sooner than later (if I'm interested) to give myself time to work through any needed titrations or different meds. While I'm not sure if I'll go back to my job, it could be smart as my provider said to try some things out in this lower stakes environment I'm in where I'm not working. So....

  
I'm generally curious about anyone else who's utilized both anxiety (or depression) meds and ADHD stimulant meds and if they have any feed back on their experiences. TIA."
246,3,"I hate that I procrastinate until the last moment.

I am a PhD student, and whenever I have deadlines, I meander around until there are just 5 days or a week left for any deadlines. This happens especially during the writing part.
So, I keep procrastinating and then suddenly, my hyperfocus kicks in and like magic, I can write the entire thing in those few intense days. During these intense days, I forget to eat, barely sleep, and live in full focus mode.

It works, and the work is actually good, never sloppy. I feel I do my best work during this hyperfocus mode. However, these intense days wreck my body. I do not get enough sleep, my diet collapses, and I always end up saying, “Never again.” But somehow, I do it again. Every time!

Now that I am in the paper-writing phase of my PhD, the deadlines never really stop. There’s always another submission, another revision, another task.

Sometimes I am impressed by what I can accomplish in just 5 days of deep focus. But then I ask myself, all this at what cost?

I, just submitted the first draft of my well written paper to my boss, but now physically I feel shitty. I am proud of myself that I got it done but at the same time angry at myself that I feel like a zombie.

247,2,"Hi I (23F) was diagnosed and prescribed stimulants at the beginning of this year. My psychiatrist told me I can take break to avoid building tolerance or on days I feel like I don’t need it. I tried that, like not taking it on the weekends, but then I would have pretty bad rebound effects on being exhausted, anxious, and eating so much. 

I started on Concerta but now I’m taking Adderall XR and an IR in the afternoon to get me through the day. I haven’t been taking any breaks, and I don’t know if this is good or bad. I want to make my meds because ADHD issues is an every day problem for me, and I don’t really have a lot of days that aren’t demanding. This is largely because I have the combined type and so when I’m in an excited mood I always overschedule myself, and I don’t know I like doing things on my weekends, but I still feel like I need my meds and I feel better on them even when I’m around others and not doing like schoolwork or working. 

I was wondering if I should take breaks, or like what would be a good schedule? I was thinking like maybe not taking them twice a month, because not taking them every weekend doesn’t really work for me. I’d like to hear what you guys do, because I’m curious and not really sure.

For the last few years our son has STRUGGLED in school. At first I chalked it up to him being one of the Covid kids, ya know, the ones who started their schooling in masks and half at home? Well he will be going into 5th grade and is way behind academically, plus in other areas. But academically is my main concern. Reading? Basically non-existent skill. Anyway, I’ve tried for 2 yrs now to get my spouse (his dad) to agree to trying medication. It’s alway shot down and he gets defensive. My last attempt was basically a 7 page essay with citations as to why I felt so strongly we should try. Again, shot down. This is one of those hard limits for him but aside from watching our son struggle and not make progress, it’s kind of hard to let him gain independence and what not, like his friends, when he has the memory of a goldfish and can’t read to save himself. It honestly pisses me off at this point. Not at my son, but at his hardship he endures. This argument that is reoccurring with my other half could really be a make or break for our relationship. I’ve done things his way, our son has an IEP. I spend extra time and efforts and patience (he doesn’t do the same) to get us nowhere. And I feel like if I’m enduring the challenges, my say should overrule his at this point. Our son isn’t 5 anymore, he’s 10. This isn’t just a ‘he’s a little bit’ thing anymore. 

I’m guess I’m looking for insight from those who have taken the step without their spousal support, or taken on this battle that really could break your family. My other half isn’t a bad person, but fatherly, he’s not 100% what I would have chosen if I had hindsight.

256,3,"I just got into an argument with roommate over what direction my window faces for sunlight. Stupid topic and I didn't drop it when he asked. I was the asshole - no questions on that.

My questions are these: 
- Does anyone else have trouble stepping away from a topic when needed? 
- Tips on how to stop my brain from focusing on the topic? 

:: Backstory ::
I'm trying to figure out where to put a plant I recently got. I mentioned how my window faces West and he said it's facing East. The road we live on curves 90° and then goes into an intersection. The intersection is not an average size ... It's as wide as a roundabout, but it's like they forgot to put the grass area in the center, so it functions like a regular intersection. When you turn onto the intersecting road, the driving pattern is more curved then a standard 90° angled, and so in his mind he keeps picturing our street going in a different direction than it is. 

I showed him on a map (my idea). We drove it (his idea). Nope, doesn't click. 

And this is were I'm the asshole, and why I'm asking for help. 

I could see him getting frustrated (we both were) but it's like my brain is a runaway train. It's not a ""I need to be right"", it's a ""I need to be accurate"" ... He tried to get out of it by saying ""if you want to be right, your right"" which set me off more because I wasn't trying to be right, I was trying to get to an understanding. I like accuracy, my sometimes brain focuses too much on that, and falls into controlling. 

How do stop the train when it's running away? "

I have two cats who mark and scratch everything and I have zero drive or capability to show my space tenderness and care. Ive dealt with job inconsistencies, and although I've kept my current job for a year I work in non profit and don't make much, but also find it difficult to motivate myself to take on a second job despite knowing I need to.

I have horrible social skills and deal with devastating loneliness and I can't bring myself to feel like I'm worth a fraction of a shit to go out and date again.

No one seems to get it either. People think I need to work hard, I need to focus, I need to not be lazy, I need to be organized, I need to budget better, I need better finances. People don't see how I unintentionally self sabotage because I forget my backpack, or didnt do a case note, or forget to bring a change of clothes for my son when we go to the pool, or push things out of sight rather than simply cleaning, or taking short cuts, or finding distractions or vices to keep myself from submerging into depression.

I really wanna make these characters and have fun with it but it's so hard when I start to freak out the second it's not perfect.

262,3,"It feels like a lot of people in my life have so many different things that they want to do, and when they’re bored, they can dedicate as much time as they want to that thing. Even my dad, who has a full time job, somehow manages to find time to do things like learn songs on guitar, come up with ideas, make up songs, etc.

When I come home from my 8-4, all I want to do is sit back and chill. Even when I have spare time on the weekends, I just default to jumping around on different video games. I feel like I have so many avenues of interests that seem interesting but I’ve never even tried or thought to try, like 3D modeling, music composition, or drawing. I just fill my free time with whatever’s easiest for me to do right away.

I feel like I should have a good grip on these things since I’m on medication, but it doesn’t seem to be happening. Is there anything you guys tend to do or practice in order to maintain consistency with your hobbies? Just trying to remember that I want to do these things feels impossible. It’s hard for me to feel like I truly like these things I wanna do if I’m always forgetting about them, even if, in the moment, they seem super cool and interesting."
263,3,"Hey folks, I am a 24 year old trans man diagnosed with ADHD about a year and a half/two years ago. I have combined ADHD and have been having a very hard time finding a medication that works for me. 

Some information:
-I can’t drink caffeine, as it ups my heart rate and makes me incredibly tired
-I’ve tried Adderall and Concerta, both of which made me feel crazy and didn’t feel helpful
-I’ve also tried Wellbutrin & Guanfacine, both of which didn’t work for me
-I typically react very sensitively and quickly to medications, so i’ve had big reactions to all of these meds

I recently got a real med manager, who started me on Strattera about a month ago. It’s been making me insanely tired, so i’ve been taking it at night time, but about an hour after I wake up in the morning I’m hit with a huge wave of sleepiness that lasts throughout the entire rest of the day. It’s been making it very very hard for me to do anything over the last few weeks. 

I also have yet to feel any positive effects in regards to my ADHD. It hasn’t felt helpful… 

So my question is, is this normal? Should I keep trying? I have a check in with my doctor this week, but I want to hear from you all too. Does this sound similar to anyone else’s story? TIA!"

As above, I'm looking for an app to beep / vibrate every 10 minutes to remind me to have a drink of water, every 90 minutes for a quick leg stretch at work etc. Maybe every hour to help with time blindness.

I'm after something subtle - a vibrate or small beep - not a loud alarm that will totally pull me out of what I'm doing or something I have to stop or cancel for the same reason.

Ideally free, but I don't mind paying if it's a good one.

I use Alarmy which is amazing for me to get up in the morning, but doesn't offer the above, as far as I can tell."

Woke up at 4:30 AM to go pee, came back fully awake and bought an electrical engineering 101 book on discount (not even working in this field). Worried about oversleeping and debating whether I should go to sleep or just stay awake until 7, can’t decide. Went to ask computer what happens if I only sleep for 2 hours, it gave me reassurance but didn’t recommend me to sleep. I said no I might oversleep or wake up groggy. (My wife suddenly snores while I’m typing.) It said yes it might be risky to sleep now, let’s just stay awake. Didn’t trust the computer, went to google “is it okay to go to work with 2 hours sleep”, results showed the harm done to body from lack of sleep. Scared, go back to sleep, typing this and now it’s 5:45 AM.

266,3,"Hi, 32F, as the title says how do I channel my morning energy better? 

I’m a light sleeper and I wake up before my partner all the time. We do not currently live together. 

I overwhelm her with my morning chats about big things and plans. I feel like it’s impacting our relationship. 

When we are together I tend to make the first tea of the day and offer to make breakfast - I get hungry quickly after waking up, my partner is sometimes still sleeping when I want to eat but I just wait for her to wake up so we can eat together. 

It’s difficult when we are apart as I am mentally agile and active very early in the day and I feel like I overwhelm my partner. 

She needs time to herself in the mornings and after work too (to decompress). 

Any help or advice appreciated I feel so bad for her and for myself.

He said to take 1 pill, twice a day, for the first week, and then 2 pills, twice a day, for the second, and 3 pills, twice a day, for the third week, so I could figure out what the right dose was for me. I got to the third week feeling almost no effects from the meds, and initially, when taking 3 pills twice a day, I felt more focused. The second week taking 3 pills a day, (June 9th to today) I feel much more restless even though I'm taking the exact same dose as I was before. Is there a reason for this? I'm also experiencing other side effects, like shortness of breaths during my workouts, which I did not experience in the first week on the same dose."
269,1,"I'm a 25-year-old female, and I’ve been battling anxiety, OCD, and persistent depression for the past four years. I’ve tried medication after medication with little success—until I started Wellbutrin. It’s helped a lot with my depression, but unfortunately, it hasn’t touched the anxiety.

Growing up, I did well in school, but everything changed during my teenage years. I became impulsive, made reckless decisions, and even got into trouble with the law.

Now, as an adult, I feel like I’m still constantly struggling and just desperate for answers. On a daily basis, something as simple as getting ready or leaving the house feels impossible if my environment—especially my home—isn't clean. I get intensely angry and irritable, and I don’t fully understand why.

Yesterday, for the second time in six months, I left my wallet on top of my car while leaving Aldi. I drove off and only realized it was missing 30 minutes later. Miraculously, I recovered it both times—but it’s so frustrating and embarrassing.

You know that feeling of being able to fully relax at the end of a long day? I can’t get there. No matter what I do, it just feels *off*, and I can’t really explain it. I'm always fidgeting—wiggling my toes, messing with my hands. My memory is terrible; I feel like I can’t remember anything. Emotionally, I feel numb most of the time. I’m not sure if it’s anhedonia or if I just don’t know how to recognize my feelings.

I’m not looking for a diagnosis—just curious if anyone else can relate or has had similar experiences."

The problem with that is that usually, I can be maybe 5 minutes late to an appointment, but if I'm 5 minutes late to the train station, I'll be 30 minutes late to thr appointment because I missed the train I needed to cach to be on time... 

Before I strates working that was still OK. It was incredibly humiliating being that late, but often times my friends would actually expect it because they know me. But now that I'm having to be on time for work, it's become a lot more grave if I'm that late to it and I'm really despairing and stressing a lot about it... 

So I wanted to know, what strategies do you guys put in place to leave at the time you planned, or be on time? How can I get myself to leave early enough to actually cach my train? Because no matter how early I plan to leave home to cach the train, I always miss it by a hair..."

Were you somewhat aware that you weren’t behaving the way you had in the past? Were you hospitalized without understanding what was going on? Were you able to quickly attribute it to your meds? I would appreciate the details. 
Context below:

I have learned at an older age that I have and likely always have had adhd. I was never aware of the inattentive type and when I read the symptoms only a few years ago, I cried. I finally had a name for this heavy weight I’d been pulling around my whole life. It answered so many questions. The problem is that I also had a traumatic childhood from an extremely sick mother who suffered from schizophrenia (unmedicated and alienated all family and friends) and because I was an only child and she was a single parent, I walked out with CPTSD. 

I have never had a psychotic episode and am older. I’ve lived a normal life but my adhd tied to my cptsd has me at a brick wall and can’t move forward.  I really want to try medication that works and I’ve learned that stimulant based meds work best - open to opinions - but I am worried about the warnings to those with a genetic link to schizophrenia, which I clearly have.

I would make up my mind to stop doing it and would only last one day before I get back into it. Its like a loop I am stuck in.

280,2,"😭 seriously I think i have the worst memory and attention span in the world. I had two-step verification on my instagram account and it was getting really annoying. Mind you, I dont keep my login saved so I have to manually write my user & password everytime I go onto instagram. Literally AS I'm typing in my password I'm thinking to myself ""man i gotta take this 2 step off."" I hit the 'log in' button

And just like that- completely forget the purpose of going onto instagram. I scroll for about 2 hours and log off. As soon as I log off I'm like ''damn how did I not do the ONE thing i got onto instagram for??"" So, I type in my user and password again, annoyed at myself. Click the 'log in' button, and just like that, i scroll for an hour. I kid you not as SOON as I log off, I remember that I forgot to take off 2 step.

This went on for 2 weeks.

I told my friend about this and she was just completely gagged at how this was even possible, she almost refused to believe me. But yes, it did happen. I'm not diagnosed for ADHD but if theres one thing that made me suspicious out of the many symptoms I have, this is def at the top."

I was diagnosed with ADHD around 6 years old and am now 26. I was medicated from age 6 to about 14 with a variety of different stimulants. I ultimately stopped taking med because I felt the “zombie” effect and made me feel like I didn’t have a personality. I don’t feel like that with my current prescription but I guess it’s noticeable. I’m feeling conflicted/upset and am wondering if other people notice. Has anyone dealt with this and how?

And i desperately want to climb the hill.~~

My parents however have been anything but nice about this process because they fear i'm 'using it as an excuse' when it is a fucking disability . I have been struggling to do even the things I enjoy as of late and this diagnosis has the potential to help me turn my life around.

284,2,"Hello,
I have been diagnosed with ADHD this week and I have been replaying and analysing my entire life with this additional information. At school and college I couldn’t never pay attention and follow the lecture but at home I could read the materials, understand everything and pass the exams. I liked to be in the spotlight and was eloquent. Then I started working a corporate job and within a year I became a low-energy brain-fogged anxious procrastinating zombie that hides from everything.
Anyone in a similar situation? Is this common?
Thanks"
285,0,"Hi ADHDers. I'm not diagnosed with anything (at age 56), but I've had a couple of sessions with a clinical psychologist qualified to DX ADHD and autism, who said it would be very sensible for me to get assessed for autism, but (and this was a surprise at the time) that a lot of my descriptions of challenges and thinking style sound compatible with ADHD.

Looking into both neurotypes further, I now think I have what I'd describe as arse-kicking ADHD, that's really limited my ability to pursue a career (or even survive without getting sacked from month to month... or even get through the day sometimes).

But I think there's more to it than ADHD: all my life I've been baffled by most people, struggled to group play (basically, at school I didn't group play) with other kids, I've had a couple of decades-long oddball interests that... consumed me, but in a very socially non-strategic way (little intent to make a career out of them, for instance). And maybe-autism-compatible sensory issues. And I hate eye contact. And a tendency to shutdown under stress. And an obsession with sameness.

Basically I'm dying to ask some ADHDers who are confident they're not also autistic...

How do you feel about most human beings, and interacting with social groups? Do you feel like your social issues, if any, are rooted in issues around focus, attention, memory? If you medicate and your executive functioning improves, do you find group scocial interaction feels... at least somewhat natural? Or do you still have this feeling like you're living among a species that you fundamentally don't get?

Thanks for any insight."

I always feel like a fraud and don’t know how to explain it to other people without just sounding lazy.
The despair and the frustration caused by this is just making me too anxious, so either i avoid the task (and fuck my life up) or torture myself by forcing my self to do something while my brain refuses to cooperate.

I’m 32 now and honestly regret not planning my life 5–10 years ago. I feel like I’ve just gotten older without much meaningful progress. I’ve done some job-hopping, but now I’m back to ground zero.

Back then, I didn’t know I had ADHD. I do now, and I’ve realized how much it affects long-term planning — how we’re often blind to the future, stuck in now-or-never mode. But I don’t want to fall into the same trap again.

I genuinely want to plan my next 5–10 years in a more structured and realistic way. Not just vague dreams, but actual goals, systems, and steps — ADHD-friendly if possible. 

I know many of us with ADHD struggle with this — being stuck in the present and unable to plan ahead. Please share what helped you get unstuck and actually move forward.

Thanks in advance 🙏"

I know nobody can give medical advice, but can anyone think of why this happened??? My doctor knows everything I am about to say but couldnt give me any answers to why this happened.

I am on 100mg pristiq, 54mg concerta, 12mg seroquel


Ive been on this combo for about a year and i went from a different form of methylphenidate to concerta about 2 months ago, and the second I got on concerta my blood pressure and HR SPIKED. No matter what I did or if i consumed caffeine or not they went up so high that I could constantly feel my heart beating very hard.

About 3 weeks ago I dropped my pristiq from 100mg to 50 because I wanted to see how I could manage (just so i could have less meds dumb mistake lol) and the withdrawal was so horrible i went back up to 100mg about 8 days of being on 50mg pristiq.

The second I dropped down to 50mg pristiq my BP and HR made the drop, and even after going back up on 100mg I still have a very low and normal blood pressure/heart rate

I know this is technically a good thing but I feel almost a little but off put because of such a drastic change. I am a caffeine addict and no matter how much coffee I drink it doesnt raise my vitals at all.

I know I need to stop drinking coffee and I really want to its just so hard… anyways if anyone has any ideas lmk!

My psychiatrist recently spoke to me about the possibility of starting medication in the future.

We are still discussing whether I actually have ADHD and/or just executive dysfunction given that my head seems to struggle with doing anything. (Among other things like common anxiety, depression, blah blah blah)

So I wanted to ask people who've already been diagnosed and medicated. Did it make a big difference in your lives???

And many others who never benefited from medication.

But everything was just falling flat. Every joke I made and every piece of conversation I tried to contribute. It was like I just feel the energy in the room dip when I spoke. I struggle at the best of times to keep up with a group but I couldn’t follow anything. Nobody’s story or joke or reference from earlier it was all just slipping right past me. 

So I went inward, stared at the walls a bit and went home feeling like I’d let everyone down by being so dull that day. I was horrible to myself, especially with a few drinks in me. My partner tried to tell me she didn’t notice any difference in me but I think she’s just being kind and compassionate. 

How do you react in those moments? When you’re just not ‘on’. I could make my excuses and leave but that seems rude. But staying whilst I bore people or don’t engage, that’s just as rude.

 I know it's probably more than 280 word but I just need some help or advice "
300,1,"I was diagnosed with ADHD back in April. All my life I've had issues with hugging. I once made my mom cry because I didn't hug her on Mother's day. I've made my family mad because I don't immediately go in for emotional hugs. I've read that hugging difficulties can be a symptom of ADHD especially if you have sensory issues. I don't think that's what it is for me. I like hugging certain people like friends I can be vulnerable with. I don't know if maybe it's just because I don't feel like I can be vulnerable with my family or what? I just feel awkward especially when it's expected of me. Do I feel bad? Yes, every time. And I'm always hating on myself in these situations, I get to the point where I wanna break down. Any thoughts? Advice?"
301,2,"For those of you who consume caffeine while taking medications, how do you manage it? I’ve noticed that the combination of both keeps me excessively wired throughout the day. However, I’ve become accustomed to taking caffeine in the morning, making it challenging to eliminate it from my daily routine. I’ve tried taking decaf as a buffer, but it doesn’t provide the same effect. Should I simply eliminate caffeine altogether? Thanks. "
302,2,"Anyone else get that?

Like, I could have an answer to a question, or, I share some of my knowledge on a subject, and they ask ""How do *you* know *that*? or ""How do you *know* all these things?""

Although they're innocent questions, I can't help but be annoyed by them as if whoever asked them isn't curious enough to want to gather knowledge about things. I know it's mean to think of it this way, but I can often feel like I'm judging that person. The ignorance I can forgive, but it's the seeming ""willfulness"" of that ignorance that's frustrating.

Even the self awareness that the genuine answer being mainly ""because I'm curious"" can come across as arrogance.

It's exhausting."
303,3,"Hey everyone I am dealing with something that I haven’t found an answer to online and it’s making me a bit concerned. 

I have been on adhd medication for about 2 and a half months so far (15 mg of ir 2x a day). The medication works well for me and I have adjusted to the dosing as the months go on. One side effect that I have noticed is that my sense of urgency is nonexistent without my medication. 

Before I was medicated I would wait until the very last moment to get things done and then I would gaslight myself into thinking I was the most horrible human on the planet because I was so lackadaisical. For example I used to wake up 10 minutes before I had to leave for something important, have a bunch of negative self talk and then a fire would be lit under my ass for the entire morning until I left. 

Now that I have experienced the glorious effects of meds and I no longer need to beat myself up to get stuff done, I have no urgency. Another example, I wake up late, realize I am late and need to go, but I just don’t care to rush and be mean to myself mentally. I don’t have my medicine in my system until I eat breakfast so when i wake up I am unmediated. Being unmediated in the morning makes me extremely late for everything now! 

Yes, I could take my meds as soon as I rise out of my slumber, but there is like 40 minutes until the meds kick in so I still would be doing the same thing.

Any advice guys? Thank you. "
304,0,"Hi all, I hope you’re well 🙏🏻

I’ve been pretty new to the concept of electrolytes and the necessary benefits of water intake and hydration. 

I’ve used what we had in the house and ready to buy my own. 

Can anyone recommend a powder that incorporates some of the good nutrients/amino - that they say helps ADHD please? 

I was thinking mainly L-tyrosine, ashwanganda, rhodiola? 

Or would they me in such minute amounts it’s not even worth it?

I’ll bet my house you’ve got some good advice or experience? 

Thankyou in advance everyone

Have a lovely day

🙏🏻😘"
305,0,I have always rolled myself to sleep as far back as I can remember. I did  stop when  I had  a partner and on another occasion with gummies of the special kind. Dometimes though I wake up rolling. During the day or at the movies I have and the renowned grasshopper legs. Anyone have any tips for this? Be good to stop. I exercise every day. 
306,0,"I went to an out of district placement for ADHD for middle school and high school. When I was a senior, my case manager (the district liaison between the school and district, allegedly on my behalf) insisted that I shouldn't go to college. She said it would be too much manage for me. If I insisted on going to college, I should go to community college, so I could keep up and maybe go to four year college after that. She suggested that I work with my hands instead. Five years after that conversation, I graduated with my BS degree from the regional state university. 

Now, more tha 20 years after being told that I couldn't do it, after one failed attempt due to relocation, I'm officially a Master of Science degree holder. I feel like I finally pushed a boulder completely over a hill. I carry a lot of self-doubt around academics, so this never felt like a given until I walked across the stage. I completed the program at the perfect time too; my cohort is the last from the program, and my extremely wonderful and patient partner is due to give birth to my daughter in September. 
"
307,2,"Hi! I've been medicated on Concerta for about 8ish months now and I've really liked it. Recently, the pharmacy I go to has been changing the different shapes of the pills and I kinda figured it was a different one but did the same thing. It was the same color, a light cream with some black letters on it, it just changed from a small circle to a longer cylinder kinda size. For context, I'm on a smaller dosage of 18mg, so I didn't go up in dosage, at least to my knowledge. Because I am forgetful of my meds, my mom gives me my meds. Today, when I went to take them, it wasn't even a cream pill or anything. It was a super small pill, like almost smaller than the birth control I take. It was pink and it had an engraving on it for some reason. If anyone's had this experience with concerta or the generic version, please let me know 😭 it feels like the meds didn't work today so I dont know if that's a placebo effect bc of my panic or genuinely not my meds. Thank you guys! "
308,1,"Does anyone else have lots of wild ideas all the time that actually seem like you could do them but just never know exactly where to start and so start to feel down about it. For example business ideas or even just projects. 

Needed to meet character limit. Needed to meet character limit. "
309,3,"Have any of you gotten significantly faster at things like exams? I used to get extended time in college for exams, so I never had to figure out how to get faster at answering questions. Now, I am no longer being given that at finding that I can’t finish exams in time.

Does anyone have any tips on how to process, think, and reason FASTER than your brain wants to? Exercises you did? Compensatory strategies? I am also not just slow at exams but generally slow in life- it takes me forever to even take a shower for example. I think it’s just the way my brain works: one thought leads to another, and suddenly I’m not thinking about whatever I was originally thinking about. It’s hard for me to focus on the task at hand. 

TLDR; I AM SLOW HELP! 😭"
310,2,"Hi all,

I'm in the process of receiving an ADHD diagnosis atm. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder with occasional panic attacks a couple of years ago and did not find much benefit from anxiety meds (Zoloft, currently trying Buspar). My anxiety stems from hyperfixations on body sensations, especially having to pee too often, which is a self perpetuating/worsening thing - my brain cannot focus on other tasks and thoughts. This led to a recent ADHD test, which found that I have the vast majority of symptoms of inattentive and hyperactive ADHD. I am anticipating my psychiatrist will prescribe a stimulant at my next meeting with him, and I'm curious if I should be concerned that this will worsen my anxiety. I should note that I'm incredibly sensitive to caffeine (half a cup sends me into intense jitters, sweating, peeing constantly, and chronic overthinking). However, I also suspect the anxiety I was diagnosed with is a symptom of having untreated ADHD. Should I be concerned? Is it possible that I will respond well to Adderall or Vyvanse despite reacting badly to caffeine. Any advice is appreciated."
311,3,"Hey all, I am struggling with starting tasks especially around the house like laundry, dishes, outdoor maintenance, scheduling appointments, meal planning. I am a father of four and my newborn is 3 months old. He is actually our easiest baby but sleep with a newborn is still hard to come by. I get about 5-6 hours a night which is much better then previous kids but I am struggling to get anything done on my days off. It takes everything out of me to get the laundry done and then we are living the rest of the week out of laundry bins instead of the dressers they belong in. To an outsider it may look like depression which I have had as well but I truly don't think it's the problem, I still find joy in things and don't really feel sad other than not getting my stuff done. I am currently on buproption for the ADHD and depression and really don't want to start a stimulant/new medication if I can help it but I'm starting to wonder. Anyone else who has these issues, what were some pro-tips? I am being gentle with myself and aware it's just a stage of life right now but it does get me frustrated as a man who values his own productivity. Thanks!"
312,3,"So I’ve always had some level of noise sensitivity but on the past months it’s been over the roof.

To make it worse, my father developed a noise with his mouth because he was a problem of something stuck on his teeth from a dentist appointment he had and he does that sound (like “tsssss”) every 5 seconds, and sometimes he makes it quieter but I still hear it and it drives me insane.

I tell him countless times to stop and he says he can’t control it, and I kinda believe him but he always had some tics and I believe this is one of them now.

And… this is embarrassing and I don’t know if this is any normal, but it also triggers my vaginal nerves, ITS SO ANNOYING. I hate that feeling so much, that’s also why I’m going insane.

What do I do? I’m desperate. I’m not medicated for ADHD yet. I thought about headphones but they makes my head hurt when music is playing, and when it’s not, I still hear him."
313,1,"So I (20NB) recently dropped out of uni after my 2nd year, music school sucks lol, and have finally found some work in my city. It's only a bar support position for 1 day a week (genuinely how is the job market so slow) but I had my first 2 shifts back to back yesterday and the day before and I felt so useful. I haven't felt truly busy or helpful or necessary since before coming to uni and it was mind-blowing to realise that the last time I felt so level headed was working 50 hours a week at a busy coffee shop. Anyhow it's now today and it's been a STINKER. Been crying about everything and feeling so useless and aimless, I didn't think it was connected to my job until my partner(20NB) pointed it out and I'm beginning to think they're right. Is this an ADHD thing or a me thing? Please help!!"
314,2,"i’m 21 and a college dropout. i recently had surgery and before that i was set on finding work but that surgery really hit me hard. my surgeon adviced to not do anything physically grueling activities and most job offers that are available to me are those that require that. getting hired for a remote job is already something i can only dream of as i don’t have the set of skills they’re looking for, so i’m just stuck at home doing nothing.

i usually don’t mind doing nothing at home but the hospital bills cost me a lot that i had my parents help me pay for it. i’m worried that i won’t be able to find a job anytime soon as my ADD keeps getting me sidetracked from sending out my resumes to possible clients. the fact that it’s my birth month too ...

why is it so hard to do such simple tasks? the frustration is driving me mad bit by bit and i'm already embarrassed that i couldn’t finish college because i could not pay attention to the lectures."
315,3,"Obviously, to people with ADHD, the experience of losing things is all too familiar. I don’t know if it’s just me, but no matter how many times I lose things, it never gets easier—The overwhelming amount of guilt, regretting not being more attentive, the frustration of wracking your brain to remember all the details, trying your best to retrace your steps, getting blamed for being too careless, replacements being too expensive/difficult to find… 

It’s really hard!! and genuinely one of the most upsetting parts about having ADHD for me. Especially as someone who gets really sentimental 😭 I hate the pit in my stomach that I get when I realize I’ve lost something. My heart hurts, knowing I’ll probably never get it back. I really feel so guilty because it’s no one else’s fault but mine! 

**I’m making this post as a safe space for you to vent out any frustrations about anything you’ve lost recently, or the worst thing you’ve ever lost.**

For me, the worst has to be my 3DS with all my game cartridges in the case it came in as well. I lost it at an airport a couple years ago and it was a limited edition Mario-themed version. I loved using that 3DS so much, and I didn’t know that flight back home would be the last time I’d get to use it :( I will literally never get over it. Any mention of DS’s or 3DS’s is triggering for me 😭😭 genuinely saddens me so much every time I think about it. How could I have lost track of something I care for so much?? Where is it now?? and then I see tomodachi life being resold for $200 ON EBAY??? I’m never getting it back. My childhood. Gone before I knew it."
316,2,"Hi all… 

I got diagnosed with ADHD around 6 months ago now and I’m really struggling mentally at the moment. 

My questions questions here are 

Are the following symptoms of ADHD or is this some other form of mental disorder?  

- always seeking something better in life and never being happy or fulfilled in every aspect of life eg relationships career 
-being extremely sensitive and taking everything deeply personal 
-not being able to have a romantic relationship because I go off the person abruptly, as soon as I see something that makes me icky (this ruined my relationship with my sons father)
- having big ideas and not doing them
- creating multiple “businesses” , putting all of my energy into it- unhealthily, for weeks and then one day wake up like meh don’t wanna do that anymore and I never think of it again, until I find something else and the pattern starts all over 
- having over 100 thoughts a day and constantly googling 
-feeling restless and like my mind is going 100 miles per hour 
- struggling to remember anything from my childhood or even recent past, it’s like I’m not present in any moments and I can’t think back and remember them happening even though they have, with very sensitive things such as my dad passing, I feel completely blank as if I can’t remember it, when I was the one who found him and it’s a deeply traumatic thing, why aren’t I a mess?
Other question is: 
What is medicated/managed adhd supposed to feel like? Does it take away the constant seeking of something else in life 
"
317,1,"I believe it’s an ADHD to be intuitive and sensitive. I’ve always been told I was a daydreamer and overly sensitive. I used to cry every. Single. Day. until the age of 10. I always cared about people’s feelings (probably too much). Doomscrolling is making me so depressed because I always see multiple perspectives. Whenever I see what is going on in the world I try to google fox articles to see what the other side is seeing to gain some perspective. I always imagine being in someone else’s shoes and try to see WHY someone is the way they are. 

I currently just want to scream to the world that we are being manipulated. Algorithms and politics are the downfall of our society. I just want peace. It may be time for me to shut off my phone "
318,3,"I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD, and lately I’ve been going through regular emotional breakdowns — intense, exhausting, and overwhelming. And every time it happens, I feel this deep, raw anger toward my parents.

I always believed we had a good relationship. We didn’t argue much. Our conversations were polite and calm. But now I realize — they were never really there for me in the way I needed them to be.

They never engaged emotionally. It was always “do your homework,” “get into university,” “get off the couch,” “try harder.” Not because they were cruel — they just didn’t know how to do anything else.

And now that things are falling apart for me, I feel this awful mix of love and hatred. I think: “Why didn’t you see that I was struggling? That I wasn’t lazy — I just couldn’t manage it?”
After I got expelled from university, they suddenly started worrying about my future. But I still can’t talk to them. They don’t ask how I feel. They ask: “What are you going to do next?”

I’m supposed to visit them in July, and I feel sick just thinking about it. I know how it’ll go — small talk, news, surface-level stuff. No mention of ADHD. No space to talk about what’s actually happening to me.

I don’t wish them harm. I probably love them. But I also hate them — for leaving me alone with this for so many years. For never being the kind of parents who really see their kid.

Has anyone else dealt with this?
How do you handle these conflicting feelings toward your parents — when they weren’t abusive, but they also weren’t really there for you either?"
319,1,"No questions. Just wanted to vent.

This disease is so horrible. It makes even the some of the smartest people seem dumb. 

I would consider myself and my son smarter than average. I had amazing grades through school, got a bachelors and a masters in engineering with very little effort. Done pretty well at work. Moved up quickly. Have multiple patents.

My son, currently in grade school, constantly ranks in the 95% to 99% percentile in math and reading standardized tests.

But, this disease is such a drain on self confidence. I have seen that in myself. And I’m starting to see that in my son.

The constant clumsiness, forgetfulness, indecisiveness, zoning out, etc, takes such a mental toll on self confidence and self worth.

I wish I could find ways to help my son with this disease but I need to figure out how to help myself first to show him the way.

Again, no question. Just wanting to vent. Thanks for reading."
320,2,"Hey everyone,
I've been on Medikinet for three weeks and don't feel anything. My doctor said to up the dose to 30mg. So I took 30mg this morning and had a cup of coffee and I just fell asleep for two hours ( after already having 9,5 hours of sleep).
I am really wondering what's going on.
Anyone else fall asleep on Medikinet right after taking it? "
321,1,"Hello everyone! I’m on Focalin XR, which last me about 8 hours. After the medication wears off, I get really really sad. Any way I can avoid this from happening? Are there any strategies, lifestyle changes, or medication adjustments that might help. Thanks in advance, I appreciate it!"

Had a bad work meeting. Now I am unable to have people look at me. Unless they’re children or young people. 

As in at all. If I know someone can see my I feel sick and intense pain. New to me.

I feel so much better though. Now I don’t have to have people see me. I feel new oddly?"

Can anyone also give me an idea of the questions they ask I’m feeling quite anxious in general about the call.

324,0,"Hi, I have ADHD and i struggle with the basic to-do list, but fortunately i'm a programmer too. so i developed my own **gamified** to-do list extension on google chrome, i've been using it for 2 weeks but didn't upload it yet.

325,2,"Hi everyone,
I’ve been on escitalopram (10 mg) and clonazepam (0.5 mg ,for sleep) for the past 3 months to manage PSTD, OCD, depression, sleep issues, and social anxiety.

Thankfully, I’ve been doing much better,  my OCD and depressive symptoms have improved a lot, I feel more emotionally stable, and my motivation and daily routine are stronger. Sleep’s also okay, with help from clonazepam.

However, I mentioned to my psychiatrist that I still struggle with forgetfulness and brain fog, even though my mood is fine.

He’s now added an SNRI (desvenlafaxine, 50 mg extended-release), saying it might help with memory, and focus.

I’m a bit hesitant. I don’t want to overmedicate or mess with the stability I’ve found. But I also know SNRIs can support executive function and my forgetfulness.

So my questions:

Has anyone taken an SNRI along with an SSRI?

Did it actually help with focus, memory, or energy?

Any side effects or emotional flattening?

Would you suggest starting it now or waiting longer before adding it?

"
326,2,I normally take 50mg-60mg of Ritalin IR in 10mg doses throughout the day. Psychiatrist wants to switch me to adderall IR 20mg per day. Does anyone have any experience with switching from Ritalin to adderall? I get medication anxiety when switching due to having a bad reaction to strattera. 
327,1,"It hit me today, I keep thinking of people as friends and I do all I can for them. I know my rejection sensitivity is bad but I was just at a company divisional meeting and I felt excluded. People I thought were friends kind of just ignored me. Normally this isn’t a big deal I know I can’t be the center of attention and people are better friends with other people. The thing that really triggered me and makes me know just how little I really matter is this was my birthday and no one really did anything to acknowledge it or be nice to me. I had to leave the hotel to h]get a cupcake and candle (none on site) to sing myself happy birthday. they announced other peoples b-days and stuff hell mine is even on shared calendar. I have done so much for so many people at this company and I remind myself that people have lives but this still hurts and it’s been 3 weeks. 

I guess what my tip is that this is something we do. We get hurt and we’re afraid to say something worried to lose a friend but we never were even that. We were just an acquaintance and they never cared. We need to keep hopes and people accountable that are actually friends because if now]t we just keep cutting people off that hurt us and we end up with nobody real or fake. Hell I’m thinking of quitting a Job I like and need because of this. Worst part is all of this is my fault because I just assumed we were friends. "
328,2,"So I haven't taken an ADHD diagnosis with a good doctor yet but thought a kinda good octor would help. He asked me some stuff about my family and age then immediately studies. I am considered a good student and expect 3.9 GPA is my finals. I told him how I had a hard time being focused, starting my tasks, and couldn't do stuff that I really could and started to do. I still am unsure that I do have ADHD cause I used to do stuff related to my studies extensively even when i didn't need to when I got around to it or something- I don't know what would happen. 

I am sure I am not  making excuses but as a logical minded person his reasoning seems really off to me."
329,1,"So I (male) got diagnosed back when I was 6 (now 34)
And took medication up untill early teens and then I stopped as I refused to take it.

Only in the last year or so I don't know what's happened but I just struggle to find joy in life anymore.

I've got a beautiful wife for 8 years, a 2 year old and 3 month old.

Now I wake up most days already annoyed, the slightest think makes me feel angry (Ive learnt to control the anger from outbursts though)

Now from what I remember I hated the way the medication used to make me feel.
Is there something over the counter or natural I can try in Australia that might help out in any way, shape or form or should I really just go and chat to a dr about this.

I feel lost and my wife want me to go to the drs for depression as I'm just permanently down.

I don't have any friends at all so I'm kinda just reaching out in the only way I know how."
330,2,"I was in Indonesia 2 weeks ago.

I met a girl in Tinder.

I did go in her home.

I asked for some water.

She brang a bottle.

I sipped...it looked like tap water, not natural water.

I didn't mind and i sipped again.

2 weeks later i did a stool test and i discovered that i catched h pylori, a nasty bacteria that in Indonesia is more risky and should be treated immediately.

I discovered then than tap water in Indonesia is not safe to drink ann can bring you h pylori.

I never drink tap water anyway but if i  didn't have ADHD i may had questioned the girl because the water didn't look natural...

I felt so dumb for this silly mistake!

Doctor told me that placque in teeth can contribute and i postponed my dental cleaning for months!

And now i am in home taking 4 meds with 2 antibiotics with their side effects and this therapy mail fail...


My impulsivity made me risk financial ruin, losing lot of money, risking my eye health, and many other things.

I'm quite rational most of the times, but when i'm stressed, overwhelmed, tired or feel social anxiety i tend to be impulsive.

Did you feel the same?

How do you fight your impulsivity?

"
331,0,"I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 12. At the time, I took Ritalin for about a year, but I honestly can’t remember if it helped or not. Back then, I had a lot of trouble with school—things like forgetting homework, missing test dates, or just zoning out in class.

Later in my 15, I saw a psychologist and went through a bunch of tests. She told me I didn’t actually have ADHD, but instead had signs of high cognitive abilities.

Today i have 25, I’m very organized. I remember where I put things, I plan my day well, and I work in a very systematic way. But I still struggle to focus on simple things like studying, or even avoiding habits I know I’ll regret (like binge eating junk food).

I know ADHD isn’t something you just “grow out of,” but do I really need to see a doctor again? I’m confused about how accurate these labels really are. What if it’s just part of the pharma industry pushing meds?

Has anyone here gone through something similar any advice?"
332,2,"We know what 3D is. It's often surmised that the 4th dimension is time.

I despise my time-blindness. I feel like I don't sense time passing, and in turn, I don't experience changes in that fourth dimension. As I go down memory lane, looking at old photos and letters... I realise: It doesn't feel like these are things that happened in my past.

**It feels like I stood in place while the world changed around me.** I'm definitely a more mature person than I was 10 years ago, but it feels like it isn't because I changed, but it's because I'm just making conscious efforts not to repeat past mistakes. **It feels that I'm still the same person, fully capable of making the same mistakes and regrets unless I police myself and make sure I don't make them again.**

The me that these letters are directed to, that's not a me of the past. It's still the same me, trying desperately to behave differently so people don't hate me. I didn't grow older, time didn't pass. The world just changed and aged around me.

When people talk about things they let go in the past, it seems super easy for them to let go. I nod in solidarity. I say things like **""Look at us now""** or **""Back then""** but *it's all performative, really*. I don't actually feel that things are in the past. I feel like they're just things a bit further back in the list of things I've done, next to the poop I did in the morning and the lunch I ate yesterday. *It's like looking at the History window in Photoshop.*

I don't know if others who are time-blind feel the same way as I do. It's just... such a strange feeling, to be mentally a constant in an ever-changing universe. Does this analogy make sense to anyone else? Fellow time blindees?"
333,2,"I want to preface this that I don’t eat over 1200 calories and I count them carefully. No “hidden” calories.

I was losing weight consistently and was prescribed elvanse for adhd. Thing is that since I’ve been taking it my weight started increasing. After two weeks I’m up 1kg. But more importantly I’m not LOSING any weight.

I’m just wondering why because it gives me so much anxiety "
334,2,"I had my first ritalin today. 10mg Immediate release.

Even though it was my day off and had a good sleep(10hr) last night, + good breakfast.

About 40mins after taking it, I felt slightly “high” then I started cleaning my room but also anxious and restless while my mood was happy and motivated.

But then 20mins later, i felt going flat.
Not motivated anymore and wanted to rest that quickly!
For some reason i was already tired, sleepy.
So i had to sleep for like 2 hours, there’s no way I could not sleep…!!

So today, all i did was woke up> had breakfast > ritalin 10mg > high for 20mins > nap… 

Wtf. 

My first medication was vyvanse 20mg and it lasted too short so my GP gave me a different option to try which was Ritalin so that I could have the option to take more or not through out the day.

But not sure if it’s right meds for me. My first Ritalin experience was pretty intense even when it was “working” it felt too fake and obvious…

Will it go away or does it sound just not for me?

335,3,"I (26f) am yet to be diagnosed with adhd , (appointment with psych in a few weeks UK) but really think I have it and struggle often. But one thing I’m not sure is normal / others deal with is , sometimes it’s like I’m on top of everything and i can cope with life and washing (albeit I’m still scatty and can’t get my thoughts ordered etc). And then it’s like a flipped switch has happened and I can’t do a single thing I had done the day before and bed rot all day for days. It’s almost like I flip from perfectly normal where I an a non Stop talking moving energetic kid to the next not being able to even get up to make a drink. 
Is this normal? 
I do always wonder how maybe my menstrual cycle might affect me , or is this adhd or is this just something else or is this nothing.

336,1,"Hi. This is difficult to write. I never had a safe space to say this, and I am happy I found this sub, so maybe I can finally get this out of my chest. 
I’m 19. Recently diagnosed, with a mother from an older generation who doesn’t understand. 
One of my biggest difficulties is keeping my room clean. I don’t know if y’all will understand this but I try to explain: when I see the mess in my room, it’s like my brain freezes. I get incredibly anxious, it gets even hard to breathe, and I can’t bring myself to start cleaning it. 
I try to explain it to my mother, I really do, but that just makes things worse. 
Today she yelled at me a lot because of my room. And she says: 
“Don’t even try to justify this with the ADHD. If it’s hard for you to have it, it’s even harder for me to live with a daughter who has it.”

That just hurt at a different place of my heart. 
I’m crying. And I’m hiding because I know, if she sees me crying she’ll say:
“You’re the one who messes up and now you’re crying?” 
And she’ll yell more. 

She never tries to understand me. And if I even try to begin explaining, that just makes her more angry.

I’m so, so tired. She never thinks she’s wrong. She never apologizes. All I wanted was just a tiny bit of understanding and empathy. 

I also have depression. So keeping my room clean gets even extra hard. 

I am sorry for ranting. I just needed to get this out of my chest, and I have no safe space in this household."
337,1,"Today I defended a research project I’ve been working on for the last eight months. It was one of the hardest topics I’ve ever touched — incredibly technical, emotionally draining, and made worse by having one of the three supervisors who, frankly, made me feel like I wasn’t good enough in every single meeting. Not once did I feel supported or reassured except my mentor.

I hate public speaking. I forget words. I hyper-focus on audience reactions. One glance at a bored or confused face is enough to spiral me into self-doubt mid-sentence. But I practiced. I prepped. I tried to overcome it.

And somehow, I did it. I didn’t break. I kept talking. I answered questions. I made it through.

So why do I feel so empty?

I got a 1.7 (which is considered “very good” in Germany), and everyone keeps saying “you should be happy”. But I’m not. I’m just… tired. And sad. And stuck in a loop of every critical word that was said after the presentation. All I can think about is what I could’ve done better. 

It hurts even more because I’m already diagnosed with ADHD, and I’ve started suspecting after getting medicated that I might also be autistic. But when I brought that up with my therapist, she dismissed it as probably just “confusing it with social anxiety.” That crushed me. I feel like I’m constantly trying to figure myself out while the world tells me I’m wrong or exaggerating.

Honestly, I’m not even sure why I’m posting. Maybe I just needed to say all this out loud in a space that won’t ask me to “look on the bright side.” I’m not looking for advice. I’m just tired of masking. Tired of perfectionism. Tired of this world expecting so much and giving so little room to just be soft, sensitive, and human."
338,2,"**Hi all, could you please tell me how your journey with being diagnosed with ADHD has been?**  
  
I'm quite frustrated about my mental health journey in general.  
  
Started seeing psychiatrist back in autumn last year and so far no progress. I brought up ADHD several times, but he first wanted to try to tackle anxiety/depression. Antidepressants (3 different ones) didn't do anything, except giving me some side effects; anti-anxiety one... can't really tell, to be honest (still on it) but I don't think so, and now that I've been on Atomoxetine for some time, I'm YET AGAIN not sure if it's doing anything. It's always frustrating when I have checkups and he asks me how I feel - I can't say I feel better (perhaps it's important to note that I live in a toxic environment, so every day is stressful at least to some degree - you never know when smth will escalate; and to be honest, don't think I ever brought that up to him, which is something I definitely should).  
  
I was first on a very low dose due to my height/weight, and now that we've doubled the dose (50 mg), which he says is a starting dose for 'regular' people, I'm still not sure if I see any progress. It's been about 10 days.

Before it was even prescribed to me, he did a quick 5-minute test, and based on it, he was quite sure I have ADHD (gosh, I recognized myself in most of those things, except for impulsiveness), but said if I react well to Atomoxetine, it will prove the diagnosis.  
**I know there are some of you who didn't benefit from Strattera/Atomoxetine but are quite sure you have ADHD, so I'm also curious what else have you tried, if anything?**

Thank you in advance!"
339,2,"I recenetly went to get diagnosed with ADHD but was sent away they blamed my phone usage. They pointed me at a few coursera courses but no actual help, I plan to retake this test as I am going to my grandparents house with no phone service for a few weeks, I hope that will reset my focus. I would like to also point out that this also the worst I performed in a test, I have gotten low 130 in the two mensa workouts, So maybe this is just a bad day. Would it be worth getting retested for ADHD?

EDIT: got 38/48 on a ADHD test, ""It is higly likely you have ADHD"""
340,2,"so im 19 in aus and recently got a refferral from my doctor towards potentially getting a diagnosis, however issue is that she said minimum im probably looking at 2000+ out of pocket just for the initial consult and testing without taking into account for follow ups. Is this a normal amount, because im only seeking it out now cause my academics at uni are kind of tanking as a result of my presumed ADHD. (after a quick scroll on here alot of the posts resonate). like i have the money but it might end up taking out a decent chunk of my savings. honestly im worried Id spend all that money just for the psychiatrist to tell my im figitty and lazy :/. 

anyways just advice on what i should try to do moving forward?"
341,2,"I have a genuine problem. I tend to confuse information a lot and it has put me in really embarrassing positions. For example, I will book a movie slot and then end up at the wrong cinema hall altogether. I have been studying for an exam and 90% of my mistakes happen because I miss words while reading questions. Today my friend told me where to meet him but I ended up reaching a mall with a similar sounding name, despite him mentioning very clearly where I need to come. It’s embarrassing and I want to stop doing it, and I hate this problem because I don’t even know when it’s happening, so how do I even fix it?"
342,1,"(also have untreated sleep ap, tried sleep with mask once, never tried it again) I think the last time I felt truly happy was middle school. Sure it wasn't perfect, I had a cheap phone and a crappy game console with like 3 games on it, I hated P.E., among a few other things. 

But I had good grades, even got honor roll, was really good at math, and best of all, friends. Sure it wasn't many, but I least I had them. Unfortunately that wouldn't last, since last time I had an actual physical conversation with them was maybe 5 years ago?

Years later, I have a decent PC, a console with a hundred games (3/4 of them never played) and a nice phone. But my friend count is honestly lower than ever, though can you really call them friends if they hardly bother to call you, or at the very least check up on you? I mean sure I'm a bit guilty of this too, but still.

Right now, some months ago I made the decision to temporarily drop out of college, so far I've been doing Jack shit, no job, living off of my parents' cash, now I just don't wanna do anything.

I mean yeah I do wanna do something, make games for a living or maybe even do voice acting, tho unfortunately I made a really stupid fucking decision of instead of actually learning computer skills and stuff needed to make games, instead the closest I've gotten is drawing concepts and notes on a notebook and brainstorming ideas in high school (during COVID).

And I know what some are going to say, just try learning it now, and well I did, less than a year ago I studied Unreal 5 months before I guess I just gave up, maybe it was frustration or burnout. And I suppose I could try again, if only my memory retention hadn't gotten so fucking bad that I honestly can't study a damn textbook to save my life.

Let alone remember the first 10 pages, and I'm in my fucking late 20s so it can't be dementia. Can't even remember the last time I've slept a full 8 hours uninterrupted. I don't even know how to end this stupid ass story, so bye."
343,3,"Diagnosed last year and been on and off Vyvance 30mg.  (Tried 40mg, too strong for me) They kind of did work in the beginning but now I just feel awful when I take it.  A little speedy, empty, a little anxious and a shell of myself, almost robotic, and big afternoon crash.  Anyone else felt this and did you try another type or find a good natural alternative that works? I used to cope absolutely fine throughout my life, did amazing things with my work, raised my kids no problem at all, a little chaotic sometimes but absolutely all fine, then peri hit and my mind went loopy- poor memory, prolonged procrastination, could not concentrate, felt like I was going crazy.  I’m on hrt too.  Got a diagnosis (I know the link between peri and add) and started meds but they make me feel like crap?  Not really sure where to turn now.  Anyone else gone through this?"
344,3,"I recently switched pharmacies because mine is closing soon. It's been a two week long struggle to get my Concerta filled, I called and went to the new pharmacy multiple times to try and solve it. It turned out to be combined employee and my own error in making two separate accounts under my name (one under my nickname and one under my real name), now I'm being treated like a druggie, I guess?

The pharmacist today held my medicine back and asked me a lot of random questions, because my provider is out of state because she's telehealth??? She told me my medicine is being flagged in their system. I was honestly kind of rude because this has been such a mess and I'm fucking stressed, and told her really shortly and angrily ""I don't know why it's being flagged, I've been on this since last year."" Before she finally gave me the medicine I've been prescribed?

What am I supposed to do in this situation, exactly, will it eventually bar me from getting my medicine?  Or was this lady just an asshole? 

"
345,3,"Cleaning all in all is really boring, but I can at least do the bare minimum if it comes to every other room that isn’t the kitchen. Which isn’t ideal, especially in summer. I love cooking, but cleaning up? Nah. It’s not just boring, it’s sensory hell too. I don’t know what it is, I’ve worked at a retirement home and even cleaning up the mess some people made wasn’t really hard to do, but touching warm water and smelling and touching old food I literally put in my mouth and enjoyed before? Horrible! I already wear gloves, but I’m looking for a way to not use them bc I wanna reduce microplastics. Also, the water stream is too loud so I cannot hear what they say when I’m watching a video which I need bc washing the dishes is boring. Does anyone know how I could treat the situation?"
346,2,"When the ads are over, you end up watching some of it over and over again because you keep getting distracted by your phone or something else as soon as the ads come on again.

I had the hardest time getting through Fallout because of all the ads. It's a really good show but the ads seem to interrupt the vibe of the movie. 

I have several different paid streaming services that are ad free.  However, occasionally there's a great series or a movie on a service that has ads and you don't want to pay for another streaming service. 

I can't even imagine how difficult it would be for me if I watched network TV."
347,2,"I have an appointment for my 12 year old to be evaluated for ADHD next week. She has been diagnosed with anxiety for several years and takes medication for it. Starting it certainly reduced some of her challenges with sleeping, clinginess, etc. She still struggles with emotional regulation, perfectionism, friendships, moodiness—which I feel like are all areas that can overlap with depression/anxiety. She also has a hard time with organization,  task completion and time management. All those factors together are leading me to pursue an evaluation. Obviously, I don’t know what the doctor will conclude, but I feel like it could be ADHD. 

My 11 yo son is diagnosed with ADHD - more “textbook” high energy, sensitive to sounds, time management, organization challenges etc., and has been for three years. He was/can be very anxious, but his therapist at the time discouraged me from looking into medication for him when it was really bad.  He has since gotten a lot better, which leads me to my question, finally:
I know anxiety/depression can be comorbid with ADHD, but I am wondering if anyone has experienced “not needing” an antidepressant after being prescribed medication to treat their ADHD? "
348,1,"The driving force behind the ability to do anything is willpower. It may come from your own body (thirsty -> go grab water), it might come from someone else (promises or yelling), or it might come from necessity (I have no clean dishes, I must wash to eat on). 

There are also a few more abstract ones: social pressure, responsibilities, goals or dissatisfaction.

Take a job for example.

My current job is wimpy, it’s easy— but I get some cash to screw around with.

I *want * to leave the small place I live, I *want* to leave my parent’s house and become something.

But how??? I know the rough end goal, I understand the steps to an extent, and I have the capacity to do it. So why don’t I?

How do you get motivation for more abstract goals? The idea of a job and apartment somewhere else is complete realistic, and yet it feels so far away.

I have deducted that while I have these wants, somehow they don’t override the “content” I feel just existing in my current form.

So what do I do? How do I care enough to get going? If anyone has gone through a similar experience I’d gladly listen to any advice."
349,1,"I need to get something off my chest that many people with ADHD might relate to. For me, reading isn't a joy; it's an uphill battle, and it's incredibly frustrating. I genuinely envy those who can get lost in a book.
It's not that I don't want to read. I have shelves full of unfinished books. My brain, however, is constantly multitasking. I'll read sentences, even paragraphs, only to realize I have no idea what I just read. The words pass through my eyes without truly registering.
This leads to constant rereading, sometimes multiple times, just for the information to click. Even then, I often forget details moments later. This continuous re-focusing is mentally exhausting. What should be relaxing becomes a chore, and I lose the plot because I can't retain the information.
"
350,0,"Hey everyone,

  
I was just wondering — do you do anything specific with your phone to help manage ADHD? Like customizing your homescreen, using specific launchers, organizing apps a certain way, or tweaking your notifications?

Do you use any apps that help with focus, reminders, routines, or blocking distractions? Or using it for listening to audiobooks, Or maybe you've set up your phone to be *less* overwhelming — minimal icons, grayscale, no notifications, etc?

351,1,"So I’m still new to my diagnosis and I am trialling Ritalin. It’s been really good, but tbh I didn’t think I noticed much difference. That was until I took two days off, one because I forgot and the second day because I went away and forgot to bring my meds with me. 
These were two days in a row and then day three, I woke up in an emotional downward spiral. 

Before I started medication, I would go through such an emotional roller coaster on a daily basis and hadn’t realised until now that Ritalin actually calms that’s part of my brain. One because I think it structures the thoughts that I spiral with and stops the overthinking and the million voices in my head making those emotions worse/more intense. Like yes I still feel the emotions but just don’t feel them so intensely or messy I guess. The chaos is gone…

After I took my Ritalin today, my spiral Disappeared. But now I’m left feeling a bit meh… because all these years that I’ve struggled through my emotional deregulation and roller coasters it was because of my undiagnosed and unsupported adhd. Guess I’m just now left dealing with the grief and realisation of that… what could my life have been like if I had been diagnosed earlier?"
352,2,"Hello my fellow ADHD-humans,

I tried out one of these minimalist phone apps.
They have a 7 day trial and I really enjoyed it.

But now my trial is over and I don't know if I should pay 60€ ( ~ 69,33 US Dollars) for the lifetime full version because it is so expensive.

I would invest in that if it would give me more quality of life... but I know that it's possible that at one point I will ""hack"" this app and find ways to mindlessly scroll.

Does anyone have experience that is longer than 7 days?
Did you buy the Lifetime-Version? Or one month? Or one year?

Are there any other things you do to avoid being on your phone so much (e.g. have a life)?

Thank you very much!!
"
353,2,"It’s my own fault, slipped through the cracks this past month but I didn’t think it would be an issue. My PCP said it’s a quick thing I just walk in and complete, sign the annual controlled substance agreement and provide an updated urine test. This isn’t the case. For some reason, they don’t have availability for this until July 7th. The side effects are not fun but ultimately not a huge deal to baseline it for a few weeks.

My concern is reading the point of that urine testing, which would reflect the prescribed use of my medication. I have one pill left and I’m not sure if I should save it until the day of? It seems that 3 weeks without the medication, it’s going to defeat the entire purpose of it. 

My PCP is through a very large/notable medical network, I’m going to see if there is a workaround for this or if it just is what it is come Monday. Not sure if anyone has had issues with their urine testing and results similar to this scenario. "
354,3,"i’m an hour late to class. i’m trying so hard to be there on time but my time blindness is so bad plus i’ve been working + in school and it’s been so much. everyone else can handle it but apparently i can’t. i haven’t had a day off since june 3rd and won’t until this tuesday. (i had one day off actually but it was my brother’s bday and friend’s bday as well so i was busy all day and couldn’t do homework.)

i keep ending up late to this class and explaining why but i’m sure it all sounds like lies and excuses. i’m trying so hard to keep up with everything but i keep falling short. i had to ask for an extension for my assignment. i forgot to put the lunch i bought yesterday for today in the fridge so it went bad overnight and i wasted $11. i also moved a couple weeks ago and i still don’t have wifi so doing homework has been rly hard. i passed out from stress and ended up in the er in May. also i didn’t have time to shower this morning so i look like a disgusting greasy rat

anyway, i’m trying really hard but it’s not enough apparently. no matter how hard i try im never good enough. because i always fall short. i got in trouble for being late too much at work the other day. my time blindness is so bad and an issue i’ve been trying to improve. it’s been improving slowly but bosses don’t care they want instant improvement. i also fucking hate my job but that’s another story

i’m just so stressed and guilty i wanna cry i promise i mean well and i want my teacher to know that"
355,0,"I’m interested in hearing about whether this medication has had an impact on your creativity, for better or worse. 

For context, I work in the arts and am also a practicing artist. Since I started Strattera (now at 60mg) around 2 months ago, I’ve noticed that my drive to make work, and spend time in the studio generally, is diminished. 

Conversely, at my day job and around the home, I am now more productive and emotionally stable.

Wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences? Hoping this will pass, as the medication has been such a positive force overall, but it also feels like something is missing now… "
356,1,"⚠️Trigger Warning 
⚠️ Sorry about the rant


I’ve tried everything. Therapy, coping mechanisms, communities, medications, body doubling, creating a routine, creating simulated scenarios where I try to stimulate myself. Games, emotion labeling, meditation. Hell, even alcohol and other unhealthy substances. I’ve tried reaching out, connected with my families, friends, attending group therapy, CBT and ACT, healthy diets, exercise. Still. Nothing seems to work. Nothing seems to improve my status and I am still a hollow husk of being. Guess I’m really not seeing a second way out other than I am just supposed to be doomed in life. 

It is so hard to make improvements, literally and figuratively, and I have given up on hope. Perhaps I am rather doomed to be existed. Perhaps I am just created to cause pain in other peoples lives. Sorry for the dump. Cause I really don’t see a second way out. 

(And sorry for my crappy English. English is not my first language and I am not in a proper state of mind. I know this is gonna be a last stretch and I am really sorry about absolute everything. I don’t know what I am sorry for but I am just sorry.)
"
357,0,I have a pretty long drive (10 hr) coming up in the coming weeks. It is one that I am very comfortable with doing as  I've been making the drive my entire life. This is the first time i'll be doing it on ADHD medication though. I was just curious if it's a better experience driving the whole time while on or off meds. Thanks.
358,2,"As the title says, since covid I've had a lot of problems waking up normally at decent hours, if someone doesn't talk to me usually i can still be asleep at 2pm. I've recieved my diagnosis like a year ago and i think is related.

I tried melatonin, going to sleep early, etc, and still sleep through my morning alarms (plural), specially when i dont have any urgent thing. Im currently mostly at home finishing my degree, and being self-employed it's horrible, because i dont have any urgent time related matter that force me to wake up. 

Is this an adhd thing? Or maybe could be a depressive episode?
Anyway, im looking for tips that could help me wake up at a normal hour, maybe an app with specially loud alarms, or something that did work for you.

Any advice is welcome!"
359,2,"I was diagnosed last year and have been medicated- when I remember to take them. I was prescribed amphetamine salts and started taking half as I adjusted to a full dose. I’m only on 10mg but I’m weird with meds so I usually do this (unless it’s antibiotics). I never had a problem with the salt version, no withdrawal, irritability, maybe sometimes a little tired after taking it, but that’s it. 

My pharmacy gave me dextroamphetamine this time and I took the first dose today. Everything was fine until tonight. It’s now midnight and I noticed myself getting unusually irritated, followed by a 5min headache. I’m denoting it to a comedown due to the time since the last dose and the headache, but I don’t think I’ve ever experienced one to use as a comparative value. From what I can tell, dextro is a single isomer and salts is multiple. I dont know how that would make me angry, but I’m wondering you’ve been prescribed this version and had the same side effect? "
360,2,"For as long as I’ve had online messaging services I’ve been an awful replier. It can take me days or weeks to respond to most messages, by which point I usually feel like I’ve left it too long and decide not to reply at all.

Because I moved away from home for university, then moved university again to study another degree, most of my friends are spread across the country and maintaining those friendships depends on my ability to keep in touch with them via calls and messages. 

As you can probably guess, I’ve lost or fallen out of touch with many friends because of this :(

I haven’t officially been diagnosed with ADHD but I’m currently waiting for assessment and there’s not much doubt about it. I’m a medical student (almost doctor) and have worked with loads of people with ADHD, I basically just felt like I was talking to myself half the time. Plus 3 doctors (including 2 psychiatrists) I’ve worked with have asked me unprompted whether I have ADHD lol

I think I generally just forget to respond because there’s so much going on in my brain, but even when I do remember to respond there’s also the issue of people pleasing/sensitivity to rejection/low self-esteem. You’d think it would make me more likely to reply, and it definitely does if they need me to reply for some reason, but if someone is just trying to have a casual conversation I start to overthink my response. Is it funny enough? Interesting enough? Good enough? Then I put off responding until I can think of something good to say, which usually means I’ll end up forgetting about it or leaving it too long to reply.

I guess what makes it harder is that I don’t have an official diagnosis of ADHD to explain it to anyone I’m not close with, and obviously it sounds a bit silly/trauma dumpy to say that I worry my replies aren’t good enough so people just end up thinking I can’t be bothered, don’t want to talk to them, don’t care about them etc

If you struggle with this too, how have you learned to cope with it?"
361,3,"Anyone else struggles with this and can explain why this is happening and how to fix? When I used to work I was a very good employee, I was often promoted rewarded and was leaving a place better that I found it. At home though I tend to procrastinate. Why? I do have chronic pain now (and not working) but I feel like I definitely can do more on my good days. I know I was better before chronic pain, but it was always a problem to motivate myself doing chores at home. Help!"
362,0,"I just want to say, I’m proud of myself. I’ve overcome so much. I earned my master’s degree. I landed two jobs completely on my own, and I’m truly proud of that. One of them came out of nowhere, totally unexpected, and I couldn’t be more grateful and proud to have it.

So here’s what I want to say: Don’t let ADHD stand in the way of your success. Yes, it’s hard. I struggle with it every single day. But you know what? Prove them wrong, anyone who ever said you couldn’t do it. Because you can. That belief has carried me through my entire life, and it’s what keeps me going.

363,2,"Been on Concerta, which has been very helpful for me. However, the last 2-3 hours of it are when the side effects come into full force for me. Nothing too severe, but I have an elevated heartrate, a feeling like anxiety, and fatigue (but not enough to fall asleep). If you experience this stage on your meds, is there anything you do to make it suck less for you?"
364,3,"I'm not talking about at the end of the day when your meds wear off, but moreso like a day or two every now and again where your body is just like, ""Nah, fam.""

I'm medicated with a Vyvanse/Adderall combo, mid range for both. I've noticed that once every two months or so, I will feel myself start to get *exhausted*. Then, come the weekend, I will sleep through basically the whole thing. Like for instance, I slept 10 hours last night, only to take a 6 hour nap today, and now I've only been awake for 3 hours and truly could go to sleep for the night no problem. I'm wondering if it has to do with the fact that my body is constantly medicated into a ""Go! Go! Go!"" mode, so I wanted to see if my fellow stimmy medicated people have had this experience."
365,2,"I got diagnosed recently and started vyvanse 20mg today. I’ve never taken stimulants, but when I did today I barely felt a difference. My mind was the slightest bit more quiet, but I zoned out even more than usual(?). I was way less hyper tho, my doctor said I’m mostly inattentive so I expected the change in impulsiveness/ hyperness to be the last thing I noticed. Is this normal? I was sleep deprived today so I didn’t expect a huge difference but I read a lot of people talking about this euphoric new feeling when they started meds which I didn’t feel at all. "
366,3,"Hey y'all (sorry if this post is a bit disorganized, as you'll come to read my meds kinda arent working so my brain is a bit all over the place), I'm 19F, I was finally diagnosed in January after long suspecting I have ADHD(Family history + showing all the signs lol). I started my meds journey with Aderall XR in February, working my way up the dosage ladder, and have now been on a 30mg in the morning dosage for a month. However, the 30 is now not working, or at least not efficiently enough for me to feel as if it's worth taking it. 

  
When my meds work, life is good. I'm no longer chronically fatigued, my brain fog majorly dissipates, and my executive functioning improves. But when they're not working, I'm once again stuck in my zombie-like, exhausted, unable to pull myself away from meaningless brain-rotting tasks, burnt-out self. Consistently yearning to just go home and sleep, I'm basically unable to complete my kind of really important readings for classes because my brain just won't process the words, or I can't even get myself to start the task.  

  
All this to say, since I've hit the dose ceiling for Aderall, and some of the side effects are already concerning me to the point of not wanting to continue to increase the dosage(Hair loss, acne, possibly dysautonomia??, dry mouth)  I'd love to hear others' experiences figuring out which medication works, or perhaps other experiences with finding the right dosage on other meds/Aderall XR after having a similar situation to mine. "
367,3,"I was on a diff methylphenidate for a year on the same dose and it worked good but i wanted to try concerta, 54mg was a good dose for me and after about 3 weeks its stopped working completely. I noticed it raised my blood pressure a little bit but the second i stopped getting good effects from it (or any at all) it was the same time my blood pressure stopped getting changed by it. 72mg didnt make me feel any different, has this happened to anyone else before?

Nothing has changed and im drinking water and taking the pill properly to maximize its effects, im so exausted constantly my executive function is so bad typing this message almost feels painful i feel like im defeated"
368,1,"I felt so flat that even listening to music that would normally energize me had no effect. It was just noise to me.

I couldn't even bring myself to do things I usually enjoy, like reading, playing the piano, or hanging out with friends.

I guess my body responds best to the amp family of medications, as I felt like myself, but with the added ability to focus."
369,2,"I am planning to travel next month. However, I realized that I will run out of my medications while on vacation. I have never been in this situation before, I am not sure what to do. I take a controlled substance, so normally I can't even refil my perscription until the day before I am going to run out. I plan to contact my psychiatrist on Monday so that I can get on top of this before I go, but I am feeling anxious. Have you ever been in a situation like this, and if so what did you do? "
370,3,"So I don't know what happen to me??
I came home from temple so I  think on way from temple to home that why I am always looking for people .when I am doing my pooja instead of doing pooja I am looking to the people around me .I am not fully focused on my work ...it happen me on dailybasis ...first I thought it happen because I am new but I am going on dailybasis. I know people .I even done friendship with them after also happen to me everyday . when someone came there my face totally expression less whyy now I am comfortable still

373,3,"Hi there

My bedroom is - something I am not proud of. It’s a mix between depression, laziness, being overwhelmed so choosing to ignore it, hoarding…all of the above and more.

I can’t seem to find a way to get this done without shutting down within 30 minutes. Ive tried the reward system I’ve tried writing detail todo lists. Body doubling helps but my dog doesn’t count 🙄

It’s mostly clothes clean and dirty. Which is which? God knows. That seems to be the most overwhelming part to this. 

Any suggestions or advice or words of encouragement would be incredibly appreciated!!"
374,3,"I've been going to the library almost everyday for the last year to study(than strattera for this or Im not even able to leave my bed) I've tried everything from going early, going late, coffee, tea, no caffeine, 53minutes study 17m rest routine, 30m study 10m rest 40 20 20 40 everything but I just get burnout extremely quick, after an hour I just can't even read well, I skip words or they just fly by my head no matter how many times I repeat the same phrase or when I'm doing math it starts off really good but then boom and i can't do the simplest things I've been able to for years I understand the mistakes and everything but it just doesn't work and if i get a long rest then I can't get/continue studying altogether.

I've been studying everyday for a year and I'm barely above average in grades and too far away from my dreams. I can't change medication either because only Atomoxetine and Methylphenidate is allowed in my country and the latter just doesn't work for me(have tried everything with my psychiatrist for a long time).

I don't know what to do or how to cope with it I know it's not my mistake but my family doesn't think so, to them im just lazy and careless. I need to study like 4 times harder for college too. "
375,2,"I wish I could add multiple flairs because I could use a bit of advice too 😔. Anyways. 

I’ve been on adderall 20mg XR for a month now. I fortunately haven’t felt many side effects, but unfortunately this means I also haven’t felt much symptom reduction. 

However, I have noticed I have been more sensitive and emotional lately. Before medication, I was still a very sensitive person. I was an overthinker, a person who cried over the small things, and just an anxious person in general. But for some reason I am more aware of my emotions if that makes sense? Before being medicating I would just react and be a little confused about where all my emotions were coming from. Now, when I’m sad or upset or angry, I am aware of the why in the moment instead of the confusion and the need to reflect later when I am calm. I have considered that it may not be the fact that I am more emotional, but I am actually just more aware of them and my brain/body is letting me feel them and comprehend them. 

But, I am anxious that when I tell my provider these things, he will assume it is worsening my depression and anxiety which I am also diagnosed with, but not medicated for. But that is all I’m thinking about right now. 

I sound like I’m complaining about being emotional, but I am actually kind of happy in a way about understanding my emotions as they come out instead of having to figure them out later. I will say it’s a learning curve and an unusual sensation and process. "
376,3,"It’s been a rough week. I’m trying sooo hard. I’m taking my meds, going to therapy, exercising every day, getting to work (and sleep) on time; but I can’t seem to escape my stupid stupid ADHD brain. I lost things, couldn’t focus at work, and spent the week spinning in a thousand different directions. I’m tired and so so sick of my brain. "
377,3,"I was never been able to do meaningful activity and just focused without getting distracted, like playing piano, etc.

my problem is every time I try to do something, starts off okay by then eventually, I end up just giving up, lose track of everything due to my inability to start simple tasks. it's super damn frustrating....

I'm wasting so much time on doing nothing but just switch task to task on internet... and unable to focus on my studies due to me being an air head."
378,1,"I have been diagnosed and medicated for 7 months now and i have been trying to develop a reading habit for years now but i always start and cant continue it the next day. However i read two science fiction books and completed them in less than a week.
How do you guys stick to a habit like this"
379,0,"I was diagnosed with Autism at 3 (differential dx), and later Anxiety, Auditory Processing Disorder, and Sensory Processing Disorder. I'm 22 now and have been rethinking these. My parents did a lot early on: Sensory OT (6-7), Executive Function Coaching (17), Writing Coaching (15), etc.

They say I had trouble with social cues and semantics as a kid (1st percentile). As an adult, though, I don’t really fit the Autism profile anymore, aside from overlap with ADHD traits. I read people fine — I notice emotions, body language, etc. The struggle is more working memory: I’ll have thoughts during conversations but lose track of them before responding.

I don’t really experience anxiety either. But I do deal with procrastination, executive dysfunction, attention regulation issues, and a lot of reward-based motivation struggles. If I’m interested, I hyperfocus, but boring tasks feel almost impossible.

Lately, I’ve been strongly wondering if my current symptoms line up more with ADHD (inattentive type). The Autism diagnosis helped early, but I wonder if ADHD-specific tools might fit my needs better today.

For those who were diagnosed with Autism young but later identified more with ADHD traits as adults — what helped you figure it out? How did you approach finding strategies that worked better for your current situation? I’m interested in hearing others’ experiences navigating this."
380,0,"So having adhd, I have a terrible time checking work or looking things over. In my head, once I’ve finished, it’s done and I don’t need to look back. This obviously is a terrible mindset and habit but it is what it is. Yea I’ve been bit in the ass so many times by this but I try to laugh and move on. 


This becomes funny with text messages as I often send texts that make no sense thanks to auto correct. I’ve told people hairy birthday, switched duck and fuck interchangeably. Anyone have any funny texts they sent? I’d love to have a good laugh. "
381,1,"So for context, I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD as a child, but never really thought much of it, the only noticeable things that were told to me, were the fidgeting and not being to stand still, and trouble in school, but other than that, it hasn’t really been on my mind that much, but back in 2017, I started developing extreme anxiety and depression, and I never knew what was wrong, right after my school years, everything just crashed and devolved into chaos, fast forward 8 years later, and I’m still picking up the pieces, I got on Zoloft like 4 years ago, and it hasn’t helped to some degree, but I kept having these emotional problems when I started making new connections, (I’ve never been in a relationship and have not had any sexual and romantic experiences) so being rejected felt so harsh, and I had a hard time with coping with that, that’s when I thought that I may have BPD, and have started a mood stabilizer, and although that does help, I’m realizing that a lot of these symptoms are related to ADHD, I just didn’t know how serious the symptoms could actually be."
382,2,"I am prescribed 15mg IR Adderall. But, I am going on a flight soon and will be taking an old prescription (with my maiden name on it from years ago) of Xanax for the flights because ✨flying terrifies me ✨! Anyway, the day after I get back I have a check up appointment with my doc to possibly up dosage of Adderall and if I get drug tested (they did my first appointment) and it shows up Benzos will my Adderall script be permanently cancelled, even though I used to be prescribed Xanax and have the bottle still? "
383,0,"At home my sleep is pretty disordered. While I don't typically have problems getting to bed at a set time, waking up always requires ~~satan's music box~~ the alarm and I'm typically big mad about it. It's hard to get stay awake and I never feel totally rested.

At the moment I'm on vacation in Japan, a country I've been to dozens of times, whose timezone is effectively the same as home (Australia's east coast is 1 hour ahead and I've no fixed schedule here so I can just sleep and wake when I want).

And I'm waking like clockwork. Regardless of when I go to sleep, be it 11pm, 2am or 6am, I wake up on or around 9am without any issue. The 6am night I wanted to sleep in and couldn't go back to sleep. I'm accumulating a bit of general drowsiness because I've missed a few full nights but it just does not seem to matter; every day I'm up at 9am.

To be clear, although it's frustrating it's kind of great. Mostly I wish I knew how to replicate it at home or, at least, why it's happening. Anyone got any ideas? 

It seems unlikely to be related to novelty; many previous trips to Japan haven't been like this. I also don't think it's about the bed because we've slept in a range of comfortable and uncomfortable beds, and staying in hotels in Australia doesn't do the same thing."
384,3,"Hi everyone! I am 19F and recently got diagnosed with ADHD combined and I have started treatment with Vyvanse (brand name) 20 mg once daily. I am glad to finally get the medication I need to help me in college; however, it is making me extremely tired no matter how I take it. I have tried taking it in the morning 30 minutes to 1 hour before eating. I just feel so tired and sleepy once I take it. I feel like I can't get anything done because that.

Has anyone else ever felt so deeply moved by a movie that you wished you could actually live in its world? For me, it’s Arrival, the idea of meeting the heptapodes and being immersed in their universe feels incredibly real, almost like something I’ve been waiting for my whole life. I’m still emotionally affected years later, and sometimes it’s painful to realize I can’t really be part of that story. I struggle to explain this to people around me, and I wonder if anyone else here feels the same way.

386,3,"I have spent the last three years working as a software engineer. The last couple years I have been really struggling mentally. I thought it was sleep related, but after exhausting any physical causes it has become extremely evident that I am mentally exhausting myself constantly. ADHD is making me use way too much mental energy where I can't even last half of the week. I'm not sure what to do anymore and about ready to just give up on being an engineer altogether. I am not in a position to just quit, but I can't take living like this either. What are my options besides giving up, and what accommodations could I ask for that would help? Am I just SOL and going to have to quit being an engineer?"

On the plus side I was asked to donate half of it so there's that. This is gonna take days and I'm just really intimidated. I usually just throw on a youtube video but this gonna take super long so I think I'll need reinforcements. Any advice at all is SO soooo appreciated 🙏"
388,2,"Since going on stimulant meds four years ago, I have seen significant changes in my social personality - how I interact with others. Let me preface with- 1. the meds work - I am focused, centered, emotionally regulated, organized, and have very few issues with executive dysfunction. 2. I have cycled through several different meds (for other reasons) and all have the same effect. 

Previously, I was in HR and was curious, engaged, inquisitive, social, and observant of people. Now, I am shy, don’t care to ask questions (I don’t care enough to ask), more self conscious, and feel like I have traits related to autism - challenges understanding social cues, engaging in reciprocal conversations, and making and maintaining friendships.
Has anyone else experienced similar changes? I am wondering if this is common. I am wondering if it is not my meds but something else perhaps. I am wondering if my active ADHD masked my high functioning autism. I am curious to know if others have experienced anything similar. Thoughts? Experiences? Thank you! "
389,0,"Concerta helps a bit with clarity, focus and etc for me (not as much as I wanted) . But it doesn’t help with things like behavior and executive dysfunction.

391,0,I've had sleeping issues and keeping my room clean. I finally went to the doctor and got screened for adhd turns out I've had it my whole life and finally trying to get it under control. Anybody that has tips on handling adhd that would be greatly appreciated. Please and thank you.
392,2,"I‘ve always had kind of a messed up sleep schedule, never had fixed bed time or wake up hours, went to bed too late even if I have to get up early the next day… It wasn‘t until I bought a fitness watch to track my pulse a few weeks ago that I got some insights concerning my sleep. However, always worked fine for me, even with little sleep I had enough energy.

Now for some months, I noticed something strange, like a strange new pattern: It occurs that I don‘t sleep at all because I‘m so invested in projects that have to be finished the next day – when I was younger, I worked on stuff like that until 4/5/6 and then went to bed, sure, but now I‘m awake doing that stuff and don’t find the time to sleep. The next day I in general feel refreshed because I‘m in a kind of trance, like really long intense flow, that makes me forget everything. For sure it‘s not exactly the same as having had a night of sleep – eyes burning a bit and having this specific kind of feeling in your head that you get when you lack a night of sleep.

At the moment, it occurs once a week that I just don‘t sleep. I am a bit concerned because I guess that won’t be healthy on the long run, but I was just wondering if some of you maybe can relate."

- i feel like i am zoned out for my whole shift and on autopilot.

- i make careless mistakes without realising which makes my manager annoyed with me. 

- when one of my managers ask me a question about one of my tables i always have forgotten and just stare at them in silence because my brain refuses to function?

- i zone out really easily when working.

- I forget some tasks that i have to do right after i get asked to do them.

- Sometiems things my manager says to me goes in one ear and out the other. 

- i feel like im everywhere all at once but my brain is a step behind. 

- my manager tells me i need to be faster but i doubt my brain is able to keep up.

- i stop in my tracks a lot throughout the day trying to remember what i was about to do (brain lag) 

- i am very unaware of how loud i can be and accidentally shout when greeting customers. (embarrassing)

- sometimes i am so into doing the task im doing that i zone into it and forget about everything around me for a few minutes until someone zones me back in

394,2,"Hey everyone,

I’m hoping to get some insight or shared experiences.

I’ve been on 75mg of Venlafaxine for a while, along with 40mg of Vyvanse. About two weeks ago, my provider increased my doses to 150mg Venlafaxine and 50mg Vyvanse. I’ve been on 150mg of Venlafaxine in the past without major issues (just some night sweats), so I wasn’t expecting much change.

But ever since the dosage increase, I’ve been experiencing this constant pressure in my head. It feels like it’s centered behind my temples, eyes, or sometimes at the base of my skull. It’s not exactly painful, but it’s very uncomfortable—enough that I don’t want to move my head much. It almost feels like vertigo or some kind of inner pressure.

My blood pressure has been fluctuating a bit (sometimes slightly low, sometimes slightly high, sometimes normal), but nothing alarming according to my readings. My resting heart rate has been hovering between 80 and 110.

I’ve spoken with my healthcare provider, and we’re looking into whether blood pressure might be playing a role. But I’m not sure the numbers explain the full picture.

Has anyone else experienced something similar with these medications or dosage changes? How did you handle it? Did it go away with time or require an adjustment?

Thanks in advance for any thoughts or experiences you’re willing to share."
395,3,"So a university med school student here! My daily classes usually go on from 9-5 and it can be exhausting! 
I see other students my fellow classmates getting shit done after going back from the classes and I just can't seem to! Be it my hobbies or going to the gym? I tried regularly going to the gym in the evening for a while but then the tests and exams came up so I had to focus on studying more.
I feel so helpless seeing my classmates actively stay back or go home and actually start studying again because even though I really want to I just get frustrated and overwhelmed!
In the mornings I come up with a plan to stay back at the library to maybe get a study sesh but as the classes go on I feel so overwhelmed i just end up coming back home.
Yea a few days before any major exams , my anxiety peaks enough for me to start studying but that peak is like a drug high and when the test gets done, i just come crashing down back to zero productivity which isn't really good for long-term exams and schedules.
It's come to a point where even on weekends when I'm supposed to enjoy and have time to do stuff i actually want to? I'm so exhausted I just lay in bed all day?? But end up feeling guilty about it.
Making plans with friends at 4 pm seems so overwhelming cause for me the day seems done by then!

I already take anxiety medicine and melatonin time release supplements as recommended by my psychiatrist, but I never feel rested.

404,1,Ive been sitting back wandering if ADHD is worser for those who have a different kind of personality trait such as a pessimistic person.

405,0,"this post is especially about **inattentive adhd in females**, but if anything here resonates with you, please feel free to interact regardless of gender or subtype.

i’ve been in the system for years, but only recently received a diagnosis. i really want to challenge the stigma and misunderstanding around adhd. the stereotype often revolves around being loud, hyperactive, or disruptive — i’ve even heard someone call it ""naughty boy syndrome,"" which couldn’t be more inaccurate or dismissive.

there’s also the casual ""i’m so adhd"" comments people make when they can’t sit still for a moment — it’s incredibly invalidating, especially when you’ve spent your whole life struggling in ways that aren’t visible to others.

here are some parts of my experience that i feel rarely get discussed, even within adhd spaces:

* **emotional dysregulation** – for me, this is a big one. things like overstimulation (even heat or noise) can cause serious mood swings. it’s not just “being sensitive,” it’s a real neurological overload.

* **executive dysfunction** – this impacts everything: being late, struggling to start tasks, organizing plans, and keeping up with basic routines. it’s not laziness — it’s how our brains are wired.

* **rejection sensitivity** – a deep, intense reaction to perceived rejection or criticism. i hadn’t heard this talked about much, but it’s been a huge part of my experience and has really shaped my self-esteem.

if you relate to any of this, especially if your adhd experience doesn’t fit the stereotypes, i’d love to hear your thoughts or stories. the more we talk about the *real* experiences, the more we can help change the narrative.

406,3,"Unmedicated British young adult here.  

Recently graduated and pushed to get a menial job to pay the bills, last month I started working at a clothing store. It's probably objectively quite an easy job. It's a small place, I'm working one or two days a week and only for four hours a day. 

You know how it is - I'm just about coping. I can work well enough to not be immediately fired, but I'm clearly probably coming off like a total idiot to the managers. I forget where everything is, I have a scatterbrain, I'm nervous talking to customers and I make small mistakes frequently.  
A lot of this gets easier as I get more familiar with the job, but a lot remains, especially things like object permanence and terrible memory. 

The job is made hell by one particular manager. She is stressful, irritating and she belittles me. She makes me dread coming in and gives me anxiety.  

Today I had my one month review. She didn't totally trash me, there were areas where I'd improved, but it was clear that I was not doing good enough. Over an hour she basically needled every personal flaw that I have - I can't remember where things are, bad memory, questionable customer service skills, etc. 
While she didn't directly fire me, she made it clear that unless significant improvement is seen next month she'll have to decide whether to fire me or not.   

I walked out feeling terrible. That I might not be able to pay the rent. That I'm letting myself and my partner down. That I can't even competently do one simple job. That I'm just a mental wreck.  
I feel almost completely done with adult life already. If this is the mental struggle I have to deal with when working, I don't know if I can handle that. I'm not new to work, I've had some jobs before, but every single one I'm facing the same issues.


Can anyone else relate to this or maybe give me some kind of reassurance?"
407,2,"Hi all. 

Following a discussion and reflection I have a thought/idea/understanding I did not have on my own behavioural traits. 

Do you guys roll this way?

When I see/feel my real self. Or my shards of self as I refer to them. Each part is and is not me???

I Immediately and completely blanket my mind in an ocean of self denial and emotional agony. 

My concern is that this is a sort of pleasant/unpleasant feel to me (if that makes sense?) and I’m pushing against people saying this isn’t the correct way. 

However this is me doing what I need to not display behaviours or emotions that may upset/distress others. 

Do you peeps have any of the same or is this more likely a poor interpretation of my emotional landscape?"

410,2,"Hi there. 

I have been referred to be assessed for adhd. Other than having an existential crisis because everything I thought was me being normal and quirky is in fact something else. Anyway… work has referred me to access to work (UK) and at the end of the application because all I want is mental health support it says to apply to able futures. They replied to application really quick but they said don’t expect actual adhd support it will be generic mental health support which I can only guess will be things like eating healthy and exercising and breathing and such? 
Does anyone else have experience with them? My original request to work was specific coaching but because of the cost they referred to this which doesn’t seem like it will help. 
Would appreciate anyone else’s experience. 
Thanks

411,3,"Reading has always been a struggle for me as an adult. Its not that I dont know how to read, somehow I have a college degree, but more so I struggle a lot with sitting down and just reading without being distracted by all the thoughts swimming in my mind, even if what im reading is a topic im interested in. I listen with meditation music in the background, and in my room alone typically, and usually am only able to read for ten minutes or so before either I come upon a word that reminds me of something else, or I have to Google something for clarification and get lost in doom scrolling on my phone.

Another habit that im sure im not alone with is having to continuously go back and re-read what I just read. I kind of picture it like there's a giant eraser in my mind going behind what I just read. And so when I am intentionally reading not just for entertainment but to learn (i.e. self-help books) I find that im thinking too much about every word I read and get frustrated that the info is not sinking in, and also end up forgetting the next day.. 

For those of you who DO enjoy reading, and have found ways around ADHD mental blocks, are there any tips you may have to just sit back and read for both enjoyment, focus and comprehension?"

416,0,"first of all remember what our mods say: Just because someone experienced something from treatment or medication does not guarantee that you will as well.


*Personal experience*

I'm 49 and was diagnosed with ADHD at 48.5 — in November 2024.

I’m currently on 54mg of Methyl…te.

Before the diagnosis and treatment, my mind used to get stuck in ruminative thoughts — repetitive, negative, and persistent. It felt like once they settled in, there was no way out. I’d get trapped in mental loops, unable to move forward.

Now, I feel like my brain when i take my meds on time (for me 6am) catches during the day those ruminative thoughts *as they arrive*, and in those moments, I can consciously decide not to follow them. It's like I have a small window of awareness that wasn’t there before.

Even better, my brain now picks up on when someone is in a bad mood and seems to be looking for a fight — and I feel in control of myself, able to choose how to respond and de-escalate the situation.

Some days, like yesterday, I take my meds later than usual (7am instead of my usual 6am), and on those days I misinterpret what people say or I just don't pay attention or my answer its not the best. I struggle more — but thankfully, those days are becoming less frequent.

Just wanted to share this progress"
417,2,"Hey guys, looking for some advice, i understand you are not medical proff and or shrinks but I would like some advice based on your personal experience on your adhd diagnosis and experience. I have always had my head in the cloud unable to concentrate, constantly forgetting everything and just in general a little bit scatty. Recently I have started getting major anxiety (physical) like health anxiety, I am perfectly healthy I have had a good year so far I’ve lost around 15kgs in weight through good diet and exercise, I am looking forward to marrying the love of my life in September and frankly my personal life hasn’t been better in my adult life. However, am currently back and forward to the GP, I have been having physical anxiety symptoms like gastrointestinal issues, heart racing dizziness, it’s happening a lot, every time I get a strange feeling I need to come to reddit to hear about other experiences to calm me down that I am actually okay, these instances are happening more and more often now and after speaking to a friend who had similar experience this was all relieved for her when prescribed Elvanse and adhd medication, I don’t believe I am actually anxious I’m certainly not depressed, maybe slightly stressed ( but who isn’t). I feel like the underlying cause may be adhd that’s gone completely out of control, I have access to private healthcare thru my employer, do you think it’s worth trying to speak to a shrink regarding diagnosis of adhd as nothing I take for anxiety helps and everything seems to be spiralling out of control in my mind, my brain feels like a washing machine ;/"
418,0,"I thought I would ask here to see if anyone had any ideas.

A few weeks ago I started playing a solitaire game. It is just not a regular game but it gives prizes and money if you win. For some reason this game has me hyper fixated and I can play it for hours. I don’t even want to add up the amount of money I have spent on it. 

I don’t know why I have been so addicted to this game but I need to stop so I thought finding a new game would be the answer. 

Any suggestions for a game that can be picked up and put down randomly, works on Apple products and does not have any micro transactions to progress in the game. 

Also I am curious why this game would keep me playing for hours. It is not like there is a grand master solitaire title.  "
419,3,"I’m a single male in my mid 20s. For the past 6-9 months I’ve been on a burnout cycle. I’ve been pulling overtime at the office, and barely making it on time most days. I love my job but between normal job stress and everything that has been going on in my personal life I have just been completely drained.

Lately, I have had a hard time regulating my anger. So much so, that my friends have all noticed and asked me about my mental health multiple times. I always answer with the obligatory “I’m fine, I’m just tired”. But I feel like I’ve become completely numb to any emotion other than anger most days. I had started dating someone and found out a week later that they had already cheated on me. It was my first time even wanting to date in a while, and it was the first time I’d felt even the slightest bit of happiness in years. I knew I was burnt out before I started seeing her, but after it got way worse. I feel like I don’t have the energy to mask my ADHD symptoms by the time I get to work. And, I have averaged 2-4 hours of sleep per night for months at this point.

I realized this week when a friend gave me a hug that was longer than usual, that I was finally able to take 5 seconds and not think about my ADHD, the stress in my personal life, and all the stuff that I’ve let pile up around me. I’ve also realized that this was probably the only physical contact with anyone that I’ve had with anyone in a while. I used to always be the happy friend that gave my friends a hug when we were leaving, and always tried to see the best in people. Now it’s like I don’t ever hug anyone anymore, I’m angry all the time, I’m exhausted when I wake up but wide awake at night, and I don’t feel like I can trust anyone enough to tell them what I’m going through. I feel like I’m a complexly different person than i was a few years ago, and I don’t know what to do about it."
420,2,"I don't know if it happens to you or not, but I struggle A LOT with sensory issues (26F, ADHD-C). When I get the heavy sweat on the subway, I become nauseous and dizzy. Sometimes I have to get off to change trains. At work or class, when somebody GULPS their drink, I get shivers down my spine and stabbing pains in my chest. I also become very, very frustrated that I even wanna choke or slap those people, and because I feel like that, I also feel guilty, like the most terrible human on earth, because they’re just drinking something.

Last night, I woke up in the middle of the night because my boyfriend was hugging me, and his face was so close to mine that I was constantly hearing his breathing. It annoyed me like hell. I hated feeling his body weight; even toe-touching, I could barely stand. I felt like somebody was ripping off my skin with every breath he took, every little movement he made, and just from feeling his body weight.

I get dizzy, nauseous, and start to feel pain, mainly in my chest, and an ache as if someone is sticking needles in my head. Sometimes my hands and fingers curl and twitch automatically, or I clench my jaw and fists. Even my eyes twitch. These are the examples caused by only external factors. If my hyperactive mind’s overstimulation joins the game, I completely shut down, and it takes a while for me to recover. Even when I'm outside, I have to create a safe space by accommodating myself because the influence of external factors triples the experience.

Is it normal? Does anyone experience this? If so, how do you manage it? I'm still in the middle of my ADHD journey as a late-diagnosed woman with ADHD, so I appreciate guidance.

The past two days, I’ve been perfectly fine, but this morning my period cramps woke me up ~5 hours after taking it. I was sweating profusely and incredibly tired. When I stood up, I passed out twice. This resulted in me needing to visit the emergency room, as I managed to slice part of my chin open during this spell. I’m thinking that the fainting is probably due to the increase in dosage.

424,0,"Prescribed Ritalin (IR) 20mg, been using it daily for a couple months now. I feel like 20mg may be slightly low so I tried 30mg today and it was much better. I do not do it to ‘feel’ it, I adjusted the dose because my general symptoms began to come back (distracted and couldn’t focus much on work, restless and forgetful). I was wondering and thinking of a few things. 
1. Is it recommended to continue taking 30mg or keep to 20 until I see my psychiatrist in a few days? 
2. Maximum dose (generally safe) in a day, usually take 20mg 3 times a day, don’t know if 30mg 3 times is too much (90mg a day which in about 10mg over what doctor told me was ‘rough’ maximum (5’6, male, 18, skinny (assuming i have fast metabolism) 
3. Latest time to take last dose and effect on sleep (if I take my dose at 8pm would i be able to sleep by 12-1:30?)  
4. Could I have coffee with it, have in the past without issues and regularly drink it but been told that there are some issues surrounding that topic. 
Thanks in advance and no I will not take this as straight ‘medical advice’ just general suggestions and advice until I see my doctor in a few days (have exams in a week so need to get work done and don’t really have time to wait to talk to them).

Right now, it works with things like YouTube links, websites, and product pages. Nothing fancy, just a way to help me actually revisit the stuff I save.

Enough is enough 


Time management is a skill like driving it requires a lot of stuff and it's an executive function and not everyone is good at it  and there's levels to it 

Also using calendar isn't time management it's just offset your brain storage that's it

There is a Harvard business review article about it too you can read it .. it's called: time management is more than life hacks 

Sone people including me using a calendar to them is actually inefficient because I don't have a routine simply or certain tasks to do my day is consistent prioritizing and researching and thinking what is the mext step and remove or add tasks and many others do

Despite the countless videos, content creators, books

They are talking surface level.. do you really think a president or like a high level worker can use calendar and all of his stuff is solved!?

Those people every second to them cost lives, dreams ,money 

And using a tool might help but reality is notion alone won't make you productive neither using calendar is .. that's like saying driving McLaren make me drive better ... If you know how to drive you would drive anything at least well enough "

So since its sure I will also attend, everyone is basically speaking 70% of the time of crete, how beautiful it is, how amazing everything is etc. My partner even showed me walking vlogs of the City we gonna be and explained everything to me, what everything is and all that stuff.

So you get it that everyone is *very very* excited, meanwhile I don't feel anything bc its in 77 days thats a lot of time and so far in the future.

I have both inattentive and hyperactive ADHD. 
I also have almost 8 year old son, who is awaiting his assessment. I am fairly certain he has ADHD and perhaps autism/OCD too.  
He struggles with emotional regulation (as do I) and the smallest things can lead to tantrum. When he was smaller, one time he had full breakdown as I opened his chocolate bar from the wrong side and the other time he cried because 'bath was too wet'. I know it may have seem amusing/funny to others, but he really struggled. As did I- I became very reluctant to do any activities/ see my friends/ even do grocery shopping as anything other than place catered specifically to kids felt like a risk. 
He is wonderful, inquisitive, weird in a very cool way human (sometimes he brings up dark questions 'if I was an orphan would you have adopted me' and I told him that lol had he been an orphan I probably would not be around to adopt him, but if I was a stranger yes I would 'choose' him since he is absolutely fascinating human being. 
He had a brief assessment with psychologist when he was five and has presented with challenging behaviour, but as he loves puzzles/ construction/ colouring he was very focused during that assessment and no diagnosis was made at the time. Another assessment should happen in few months, almost three years later.  
He attended self- regulation classes with OT (side note- wish they were available in this country for adults too lol they seemed cool). 
I feel bad quite often as because of my own difficulties, I am worried I may not appropriately equip and raise him for life as he becomes older.

435,3,"Hey folks,

I’m currently running a small startup with a few products I genuinely love working on. Being a founder really suits me, I get to bounce between ideas, build stuff I care about, and have full control over my schedule (aka chaos, but my chaos). It’s not exactly profitable yet though, and realistically, I may need to get a paying job soon just to sustain myself.

Here’s the struggle:

I have ADHD, and the idea of working a full-time 9–5 job as a developer for someone else while also trying to keep my startup alive on the side? It feels mentally and emotionally impossible. Like, my executive function starts glitching just imagining the rigid schedule, context switching, and burnout eventually.

Has anyone here managed a balance like this? Or found a role or type of work that:

Pays decently enough to stay afloat

Leaves some mental bandwidth to still work on your own stuff

Doesn’t completely crush your soul with meetings and routine?

Freelancing? Contract work? Part-time PM roles? Something else I haven’t thought of?

Would love any thoughts, especially from others with ADHD who’ve had to juggle stability and passion projects. 

Thanks in advance 🙏"

I don’t do med breaks. Unless I’m super sick and non functioning and I can’t even get up. I just always take my meds. I had surgery last week, and it was strongly urged to stop for a few days. Which has been fine. I’ve mostly slept and haven’t needed to do anything that requires any level of functioning. 

Today there was an end of year school event for my kid so I took my meds so I could function. 

I received my DX 25 years ago but haven’t had medication as a tool until a couple years ago. 

I tend to underestimate the value of medications since I don’t take breaks. I’ve missed 2-3 days because of pharmacy issues, but my anxiety is high I’m not at a baseline to evaluate anything. 

I am so less weird on my meds 😂 My impulsivity, ability to self regulate, and formulate logical thought processes is mostly in tact. Which makes it so much easier to function in social situations. 

Now I’m just disappointed. I could’ve been so much less of the weird kid growing up if I had just gotten the proper treatments. Like, I’ve know things would’ve been better, which is why I never hesitated to give my kid the tools (medication, OT, therapies, etc) when he was diagnosed. If he’s going to be the weird kid, it won’t be because I didn’t do my best to get him the support he needs. 

I also appreciate my medication more today. I go through periods of wondering what exactly it’s doing for me. 8 days without and I can really make an accurate list of the areas it improves, and I’m thankful I have it. "
437,0,"i'm 19F, and ever since high school i've been OBSESSED with finding what ""actually matters"" to me. i tailor every single facet of my life (my uni degree, my extracurricular pursuits, the people with whom and the way in which i conduct my relationships) to what i believe inherently matters (right now this inherence is rooted in self-transcendence: art/creation, connection, truth-seeking, play).

here's the thing though: if it doesn't ""matter"" to me in a way that makes sense based on what i believe in, i can't bring myself to do it AT ALL. i can't tolerate something whose end i do not believe in. however, for things i do believe in, people clock me as ""passionate"" and i'm actually quite successful in them.

i used to think i was just mature or existentially oriented but my sister recently got diagnosed with ADHD and i realized -- the only reason i am the way i am is that i cannot be motivated to do something i'm not intrinsically motivated to do (the one exception being fear of disappointing others or of, like, committing a crime) -- so my workaround is to discover the intrinsic motivation behind literally everything i do.

for instance i'm in Psychology because i believe that understanding/empathizing with our collective human experience to be one of the only worthwhile pursuits blahblahblah, and i had a massive crisis about my degree last month because i realized it was a lot less enlightening to that end than i had hoped, and for a couple days (until i regained footing in terms of feeling like i was doing something important) my motivation to go to class evaporated. it was terrifying.

my biggest struggles, then, are life admin/chores and sleeping on time -- but i'm sure if i came up with some beautiful life philosophy around it i would feel much better about them LOL.

442,2,"Hey guys I’ve always been a long sleeper but I’m wondering if it’s the adhd ?! I’m not formally diagnosed and the GP gave me modafinil last year. It really helps in keeping me awake and not drowsy. 

Not sure if it’s because of the wakefulness it provides that’s helping me with my everyday tasks or the medication is actually doing something to the adhd to keep me going. 

Anyway every weekend I don’t take my modafinil as I’m not working and I can sometimes sleep 12 hours easy, nap etc. Unless I got chores or shopping to do then I may take one to keep me motivated. My husband even asked why I don’t bother just going back to bed as he sees me have my breakfast, tea and ciggy then knocked out completely on the couch 10 minutes later when I could have just stayed in the comfy bed. 

I’m speaking to a ADHD nurse on Monday and the psychiatrist next week to get properly evaluated and medicated if needed. As I’m preparing for that this question popped into my head so I thought I’d get some more info or insight if anyone else is like this. 

Any help much appreciated.

I've heard of stimulants making it difficult for people to sleep, but I seem to experience the opposite. I will stay up until early hours of the morning or even later doing some random thing on my phone if I haven't taken my meds that day. If I have, even though they're sometimes or often worn off by the time I go to sleep, I don't tend to get stuck in the cycle of doing something, realizing the time, then continuing doing that thing and setting progressively later and later cut offs. Does this happen to other people (meds helping the problem even though they're worn off by that point)? Does anyone know why? "
444,3,"

It's 12pm I just woke up:
Wow I got a lot of work to do and I have to learn stuff... Just let me check reddit real quick 



Wow it's 1 am  suddenly and I have to sleep .. I didn't do much maybe tomorrow 


And repeat 🔁

Anyone got intake or feel similar what you tried so far? Time tracking don't do much "
445,1,Diagnosed with adhd ( and heavy CDS symptoms) recently after talking to my dr. I was diagnosed with “ADD” as a kid because there was nothing hyper about me but quit taking meds for it in my early 20s. For the past 12 years I’ve been treated for bipolar 2 with every med in the book. None worked well and some really hurt me. After doing an extensive couple month deep dive on adhd because of my sons diagnosis I realized I fit almost every symptom and was put on adderall. It’s been such a game changer. I legit feel like a part of my brain has been cut on for the first time in a long time. I’ve been on lexapro for 12 years and went through a 3 week taper to get off it but after a couple of days off it completely I had to go back to taking the smallest dose possible at night to keep the brain and body zaps tolerable (I drive and operate heavy machinery I can’t have that going on) I’m also on 200mg of lamictal a day. I’m wondering if I can find a way to discontinue both the lexapro and lamictal if it will further improve my mental health. Which tbh is better than it’s been in a long time I just don’t like still being on meds for bipolar when quite frankly I don’t think I have it. I think I’ve been misdiagnosed and actually have severe adhd with CDS symptoms. Anyone else have any experience with this? I’d love to hear about it. Hope this message finds you all well. 
446,2,"I know I have adhd. I’m sure of it. I’ve been told so many times and there’s just too many symptoms that I have for it to not be. I’m a girl, so I feel like it often got confused with anxiety but the older I get the more I’m sure it’s adhd. I feel so odd about going to get a diagnosis. Anyways, I have an issue. I am married. I love my husband. He is everything to me. But every once in a while, I get hyper fixations on random things, topics, and even people. And it makes me feel insane. I feel so disconnected from the world when it happens. I’ve randomly just become obsessed with a coworker. There is no reason. He isn’t special. Hes a nice guy but so many people are. He isn’t even my type. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. And it’s just a cycle but it makes me feel so alone. Does this happen to anyone? I’ve seen some people complain about hyper fixation on people but none of them have said they’re already in a relationship so I just feel even more disgusted at myself. I feel like I can’t stop my hyper fixation until I know enough about a person or a thing and then I let it go. It’s so weird. "
447,1,"I (23M) read somewhere that people with ADHD tend to achieve milestones at a later age. I can relate to that sadly. I feel self-conscious about being behind on milestones. 

I don't know how to tie my shoes (thank God for Sketchers), have yet to learn how how to drive, have never had sex or a real kiss before, have yet to be in a relationship, didn't enter a university until I was 21, and didn't get my first job until I was 22.

I know I shouldn't be comparing myself to others. But it's hard when you're on a campus surrounded by people younger than you who are more independent and experienced. I hate having to ask others for help or information. I associate self-sufficiency with masculinity. 

I'm working towards becoming more independent. I landed a well-paid internship with a prominent non-profit. I'm tucking most of what I earn away. I also plan to take driver's ed this winter.

I'm especially concerned about my lack of romantic and sexual experiences. I know the older I get, the more of a red flag it'll be to [most] women. I'm usually too socially awkward to flirt confidently. And the one time I did confidently flirt with a woman (19F) that I liked, she only flirted back with me because she thought I was gay. 

I don't want to have sex with a woman unless I'm in a committed relationship with her. I don't like hookup culture. Yet I have a thirst for sex and intimacy that needs quenching. I'm touch starved a lot of the time. Ironically enough, I have six women on campus whom I'm friends with. I have no guy friends on campus, nor do I even feel comfortable around most men in general.

Being a late bloomer makes me feel like a man child. I don't feel like a grown adult. I also feel less masculine for my lack of self-sufficiency, lack of romantic prowess, and my adoption of ""feminine quirks"" (e.g. agreeableness, being emotionally expressive, and regularly dressing flamboyantly). "
448,0,"Was very nervous to try my Ritalin 10mg but I felt good yesterday morning and decided to start it. At first it was a weird mix of calm and perhaps irritability because I was anxious. Then by my second dose it levelled out a bit more and today I feel very level! I have a bit of a warm, fuzzy but comfortable feeling and I just feel content. I’ve been studying for my exam and I haven’t felt the urge to get up several times and start something else or distract myself with short term rewards. I also feel like I don’t have multiple conversations going on in my head and I’m not beating myself up anymore for my inconsistencies. 

I wonder how it will feel for me in a few weeks when I’m back at uni for semester 2. Hoping it will make sitting through lectures and labs a little less stressful. "
449,2,"40s, female. I feel ""normal"": sometimes I spot things others don't, sometimes I don't. Sometimes I'm forgetful, sometimes I'm not. I see others as the same. I've never called anyone out for these human foibles in public. Or in private. 

However a number of coworkers have been doing that to me publicly. And I noticed they don't do it to other people who, like I said, don't think deeply, get paranoid or think in an unstructured manner. 

At the same time, like I said, I have the capability to see gaps and needs. This week, my manager kept saying I'm overthinking. But when we consulted someone who actually did the project - she said exactly what I said we needed to prepare for. And he took her words as is.

When I asked for details about something from a meeting, he asked,  ""Weren't you there at the meeting?"" When another colleague did, he just answered her qn straight. 

Is there something about me that does look additionally chaotic? Or my warmth and sense of humour make them think I'll roll over for them?

FYI: I've been setting boundaries with these people as early as I deem fit. With my manager, after it happened on 3 occasions, I told him how he treated me differently. If he has evidence Im overthinking rather than thinking at an acceptable level, please supply it. Do not call me out in public. If he has feedback, make it actionable."
450,0,"Read my previous post if you haven’t, but basically I’ve always struggled with a hardcore food addiction as well as food noise. My day used to revolve around food, I was always thinking about what my next meal would be, constantly checking the fridge, etc. 

Dr put me on 20mg of vyvanse and that’s just… gone. I still find myself thinking about food but I no longer have the urge to go out and get it, I think it’s more out of habit than actually being hungry. I have a bag of my favorite chips right next to me and I have no desire to eat them. Holy shit. 

EDIT: I ate one of the chips… and that’s it. I enjoyed it in the moment but didn’t feel the need to grab more or binge. This is so weird.

For the first time in my life I can enjoy a treat without this insatiable ravenous hunger for more. I feel… free. 

"
451,3,"I used to be on this med at 300 mg for maybe 2 years? It was great for me, no side effects. But then I took a break for a year, and I’m only on 150 mg now. It makes me YAWN NON. STOP. Does anyone have this experience??? My psychiatrist suggested I increase the dose and after a week, it became unbearable. It was so irritating, all day long. Maybe every 2-5 minutes. Now i think I gave myself TMJ dysfunction because my jaw is locking and it hurts like a bitch. I also grind my teeth.
I hope someone can relate to this, but the feeling of getting a FULL breath (which you usually get when you yawn) is super satisfying. And because I’m yawning so much, I rarely get that satisfaction, and that bothers me the most because now I’m practically obsessed with the feeling of it. I don’t know why. And I never thought this would be an issue I would have. I know I should just go off bupropion but it helps me so so much so I don’t really want to explore that option unless it’s necessary. I don’t see this as a common symptom for this drug, only for SSRIs, so let me know if I’m the only one"
452,2,"Today I finally got a diagnosis (combined type), and I thought it would be almost cathartic, but I'm worried more than anything. I'm worried that the meds won't really help. I've suspected I had ADHD since early high-school, and I relate to a lot of the struggles we have, but I don't know right now. During my screening I answered a lot of my questions almost on guesswork. I wasn't really a disruptive kid, and I don't remember lots of my childhood anyways so those questions were really hard to answer. I thought hey, maybe with the diagnosis I'll actually have an answer and something to work with, but I'm anxious about how the meds will affect me. I don't really know, can you really judge a person based on a 1 hour consultation? I just wanna be productive. I've been trying to be productive for years with little results. I've read lots of books, even two about ADHD, and I've tried lots of tactics. Even doing the things I want to do is tough. I'm just tired of constantly searching for something to stimulate myself with. I don't know, it feels like I'm finally at the finish line and I'm worried about what comes after. we'll just have to see when I start taking the meds tomorrow. "
453,2,"The only part of getting diagnosed and getting medication and professional help that i keep thinking about which is delaying me from proceeding is that it could dampen my personality and wit. 

Ive read a lot of anecdotes of this too, even going so far as to say of a story of a guy who's friends could tell when he hadn't taken his medication when he was being funny. I am funny, I dont want to not be funny. Although I do recognise that there are times I could be less funny and more serious as im known to be very casual and not a serious person. 

Because im not serious though is why I feel like im 5 years behind my peers, im 27 and feel like im where my peers were when they were 22. 

Wondering what your experiences have been in regards to personality and how it played out. Im a bit worried itll effect my dating and friendships because ill be too serious and people won't want to hang out with me because im no longer as I was "
454,0,"Today (29F) I had my first car accident as a driver. It was the fault of the other driver, who was driving a lorry. Basically, it was a two-lane road and I was on the right to go to the first exit and he was on the left, and when I got to the roundabout he cut me off and hit me. 

My girlfriend (29F) started screaming in panic as we were being ‘crushed’ by the lorry, while I did nothing (I couldn't do much) and remained calm. 
In other more ‘minor’ situations, I tend to spiral out of control of my emotions, but I feel that in these situations where you'd expect more nervousness or panic, I stay calm.

Can anyone relate to this feeling?
Thank you! 
"
455,2,"I’m a 48 year old gal who was just diagnosed with ADHD.  I’m taking 30mg Adderall instant release twice daily.  When my last dose is starting to wear off I get a pretty intense desire to take more.  It’s not because I wish to be able to keep on being productive, but more because my body feels anxious that this good thing is leaving.  The craving lasts about 30-45 min and then it’s gone, there’s no yearning for more.  

I have no intention of taking more.  It would be problematic for a number of different reasons. I’m already at the max dose as it is.  My sleep would be screwed.  …

Honestly it kind of makes me worried, feeling like an addict.  I want to know if other folks experience this and to know if I’m developing  a problematic need for the stimulant.  I’d also like to hear how others handle the craving.   I’m not too concerned at this point that I’ll give in but I can’t predict what would happen if the desire increases.  

And just for an FYI, due to an intestinal surgery I can’t take extended release meds.  I had considered that briefly as I’m sure the Adderall leaves the body more slowly and that transition wouldn’t be so drastic.  



Added Note:
A lot of folks are mentioning the high dose. 
I need to add that a few years ago I was diagnosed with narcolepsy. I was prescribed modafinal (a milder stimulant) but it made my heart feel like it was going to beat out my chest so I stopped the med.  
Adderall can be used to treat narcolepsy with 60mg/day as a common dosage.  It definitely helps keep me awake and alert.  
Also, I had part of my small intestine removed so don’t fully absorb foods/meds and it’s hard to know how much of the 30mg dosage gets absorbed into my system.  
But maybe it’d good to pull back on it for a while and see how that goes.  "
456,3,"Did anyone else not pay attention and run onto the road as a child? 

My AuDHD 7yo has no concept of personal safety. He stumbles backwards onto escalators, bolts across roads, leans into traffic when I'm holding his hand at the lights. He walks like he's always about to hit fences/signs/light posts and mostly veers away at the last second but sometimes doesn't.

Every walk is almost painfully like training a puppy... stop at the driveway, look for cars, check where our body is in space and where the danger is. With life threatening allergies as well it seems very hard to keep him alive. 

He drapes himself off the couch to land on his head. 

I can't keep holding his hand until he's 40.

How did you all stay alive/learn the safety basics? 





"
457,0,"So I did the whole trial & error with different medication for almost 1 year. 
The side effects (anxiety, sleep, loss of appetite, feeling like im on drugs) made me wanted to stop using medication so bad but I kept trying because my adhd was making my life a big mess. Since 1 week I think I finally found out how to make my medication work with almost zero side effects other then the usual tiredness after it stops working. 
The key is to EAT YOUR BREAKFAST. It was a game changer. Im not a breakfast person so I have to force myself to eat in the morning, but it really is worth it. What I also found out, it can NOT be an all carb breakfast (like oatmeal), but it needs to contain more proteins and fats then carbs. Someone on a reddit post mentioned that my medication (Vyvanse/Elvanse) works much better with protein (if someone has a scientific explanation please share it).
Take ur medication immediately after you finished breakfast and drink water during breakfast and ur day.
Also your breakfast can not be a protein shake, I tried this and it does not work for me, I think because it needs to be digested slow. My breakfast now is 2/3 eggs, and a portion of greek yoghurt (high fat). The result is:
- Without my breakfast: ton of anxiety, medication feels like im on xtc for 2 hours, crashing hard, loss of appetite during day.
- With my breakfast: no anxiety, feeling very calm and focused, get my things done without feeling like im on drugs, have an appetite, no hard crash, am normal human  

So yes something as simple as breakfast changed my life, now that I finally got my medication to work. I regret doing this not sooner, maybe this would help other medication that I tried work better. If you are in the same situation and try/tried this please share your experience!"
458,2,"I want to compare with you guys to see if it's just me or not. 

1. Buy a new game, stuck at New Game screen because you keep having this uneasy feeling to changing to play something else first "" I will play this game after few matches of Counter Strike "" then it been a years and you never really start that game.

2. Listen to music all the time, thinking it's normal but when you think about it people around you don't wear headphones as much as you do. 

3. Reading new book, skip few pages then come back, many times you feel annoyed by how you keep spoiling yourself. 

4. Write/speak too long, too detailed. 

5. Someone being nice to you and asking some questions so you over sharing by telling everything from thousands years ago to explain why everything lead to this moments. 

6. Find movies is too long but watching many episodes of series which equal to 8 hours movies is okay. 

7. People speak half sentence and you already guess what they're trying to say by judging from their emotions, facial expressions, context, what they're saying, their personalities so you cut them mid sentence and now wonder why people don't like you. 

8. Procrastinating medical appointment, for months.

9. I have to go there at 12:00 

Travel 30 mins, shower 20 mins, wating bus 10 mins 

So if I start taking a shower at 10:50 I will have free 10 mins in case something go wrong. 

It's 10:50... I'm gonna rest for 5 more minutes.

It's 11:00 now but if I take a shower really quick I can just start at 11:05

I'm taking a shower but now I have to poo. 

I'm late.

10. Dirty room, if I have to clean I will have to do this then walk to that then this then that, it's so many steps! I'm going to do it tomorrow! 

That tomorrow never comes.

Then someone says

""I'm going to your house tomorrow"" 

And I cleaned the entire house in one day.

459,2,"I've always been obsessed with food, far more than any of my peers. Ever since I was a kid, I remember going to those little bowls of candy at restaurants and taking 5 or more, where everyone else just took one and ate it and was happy with that. I could never just enjoy a sweet treat without feeling the intense need to binge, and boredom eating was insane.

I think I finally realized how bad it was when I was watching the movie ""Good Will Hunting"", watching the scene where Will brings up eating a bunch of caramels as a potential first date (something about it being just as arbitrary as going out for coffee), and immediately finding myself thinking ""Wow I could really go for some caramels right now."" I did unfortunately think about caramel for the entire rest of the movie.

By some miracle, I've never been overweight, even though my appetite is never ending and my metabolism is absolutely shit. Wondering if anyone else here has struggled with the same thing, and what helped? Medication, therapy, etc? :,)"
460,3,"This is probably a very newly diagnosed question, so bear with me here. I'm in my 30's and beginning treatment and meds and it's going fine, I guess. I know there's plenty of stuff to work on, but I don't particularly struggle with work, and I think meds are beneficial. If anything, I've found I have more energy in the evennings, which I was *hoping* would be a good thing, and yet I'm still struggling to actually use that energy effectively.

If anything, I think one of my biggest challenges at this point is allowing myself to relax and unwind at the end of the day. I think part of it is that now that I'm diagnosed, I feel a drive to be ""productive"" at all times, but the flip side is I'm the same person with ADHD and I just don't concentrate that well, espescially once my meds wear off. There are many nights when I *want* to watch a movie or play a video game and I can't muster the concentration it would take to actually start it or enjoy it. 

Are there any tips for this? I do all the classic things - scrolling Youtube for 30 minutes looking for stuff to watch, endlessly switching between games looking for something to play, and all the thinking of all the other stuff I can or should be doing instead. 

I just want to relax, damnit."
461,2,"i took 20mg of vyvanse at around 7 this morning and i think it wore off a couple of hours ago. the only problem is that i absolutely can’t sleep: i’ve tried calming phone games, white noise, earplugs, you name it. i also don’t have melatonin or anything like it to take 😭

does anyone have any tips?"
462,2,"I just can’t afford now but I was wondering if I starting working on building alternative strategies for improvement. I feel like with ADHD you have to do like as twice of self  therapy and analysis, in the sense that you have to constantly challenge not only negative thoughts (we can be too harsh to ourselves), patterns like scattered thinking too and overthinking life goals which makes it a bit tough to stick to them. 
I honestly don’t know how on earth I’ve managed a full master degree abroad without meds and no strategies. It wasn’t until the internship that I started investigating more about how to reframe habits, how to work with adhd, how to see strengths in it, how to address the difficulties without judgment. It’s been a road. I’ve noticed that’s why I am so analytical and I tend to dwell on deep reflection- but I think most of the people with adhd are like that too? (I mean anyone can be deeply insightful, but well deep reflection is a broad term… I don’t know, like hyper-awareness?)
ADHD made me find out about my strengths lately, but also weaknesses… sometimes…, even with the strategies I’ve found… I don’t have it any easier. Anyway, I’m missing the subject. 
My question is, how do you feel without meds? Like… is it doable? "
463,2,"Never knew this was an adhd thing until recently! Or often associated with anxious-type adhd anyway. My fingers are an absolute bloody mess right now after a particularly stressful week of work. I don’t really notice I’m doing it until I feel a sting of pain or make myself bleed. I’ve done this since I was a little kid. 

Here are some things I’ve tried that did NOT work:

- wearing gloves (very uncomfortable, felt like a weirdo)
- bandaids (just ended up subconsciously picking those off too) 
- fidget toys (I just forget they’re there and end up picking anyway) 



Any tips or tricks from other skin pickers? 

EDIT* sharing top suggestions: 
- Get gel/acrylic or press on nails (dulls the edge, can’t do much damage) 
- Look into other medication options (stimulants can worsen symptoms) 
- Practice mindfulness/meditation 
- Keep skin around nails moisturized.

464,1,"Hi everybody, I (17F) was diagnosed with a mix of ADD/ADHD around 2 months ago, and I feel like I’ve been thrown into the dark. 
I don’t know much about ADD, so being told I have it makes me very confused about myself. My initial meeting with my psychiatrist wasn’t even about possible ADD, it was to discuss my depression and possible medications, but something about me just screamed ADHD to him (maybe cuz I was fidgeting a lot), then after doing the assessments it was confirmed that I do have it. 
I don’t want this to be taken the wrong way, this might be internalized ableism? idk? But I felt so abnormal, I always thought of myself as weird and eccentric but not disordered, with my depression I knew what it meant and was able to identify even at a young age but with ADD/ADHD I feel so confused, I guess that’s why having that label feels so daunting.
I guess that why I’m here, to try to understand it better. Leave me advice or tips, what are things you wish you knew when you were first diagnosed? How do you manage depression and ADD/ADHD? Any tips on foggy brain and struggle with focus? "
465,3,"Hi everyone! I'm in an accelerated BSN program for nursing. I'm struggling a lot to focus with my ADHD. I feel like I've tried everything and the information doesn't stick.

466,3,"Hello friends! Seeking your wisdom, advice and stories of all types about the horror that is doing a major move with ye olde ADHD.

Anyway, I would love your move stories and advice! Please give me advice and please also just make me laugh and help me feel less alone in being BAD at this and finding it really confusing and hard!"
467,2,"I am a woman in my 40's who was diagnosed only a few years back with ADHD. I started medication for it (mostly Adderall) and it has made a huge difference in my productivity and general well-being.

However, recently, I started seeing a new therapist (due to stress from life, elderly parents) and after only two or three sessions, she suggested that I may actually have autism or ASD either along with or instead of ADHD.

I took an online autism quiz and came out completely non-autistic (about 11 of 40 was my score, when the autism cutoff was 25), and honestly don't think I have any autism traits, other than the few that are shared with ADHD (like having a hard time starting/stopping a task). Could my therapist be wrong? Have any of you been diagnosed (or misdiagnosed) with ASD along with ADHD?"
468,1,"Diagnosed inattentive 15 years ago and have been off and on meds since then. In the last few years, it’s like 5 o’clock hits, work is over and then immediately I put the AirPods in, put a podcast on or some kind of YouTube show while cooking dinner, playing with the dog or doing chores around the house. 

I know it has to drive my wife nuts. I’m basically zoned out doing whatever the hell pops into my mind and a majority of the time it’s hard to catch when she says something to me. But I find it crippling to just sit there and cook or whatever in silence with just the occasional back and forth between the two of us. 
Obviously in any sort of real/detailed conversation, I’m not listening to anything else. 

Anyone else? "
469,2,"My regular pharmacy is the Walgreens down the street, but I fucking hate Walgreens (I used to work there many moons ago, so I have it in good authority that the company totally blows). After about 9 long months and a nightmare of red tape and insurance hoops I finally got my first month prescription for Methylphenidate sent in but of course (of course!) my pharmacy is “temporarily closed” due to staffing shortages. I can’t transfer it because it’s a controlled substance so I’m just going to wait it out, but based on what I’ve seen I don’t think this is an unusual situation so I’m looking to switch to somewhere better for next month. 




There’s a local new-agey pharmacy that has more limited hours and is farther away, but other options also include Pick-N-Save, Hyvee, and Walmart (🤢). I haven’t had a regular, reoccurring prescription in a long time and I’m beginning to see that an unreliable pharmacy can really affect your quality of life (dramatic, maybe but I think it’s true). I’m curious what your experience has been like at your chosen pharmacy. 





"
470,1,"I can’t tell if people like me. I don’t know what to say to people that I enjoy seeing at work. Obviously since I’m ADHD/autistic my mind thinks just say “hi I enjoy talking to you and it’s nice to see you.” But then I don’t have anything else to say. It strikes me when I see other people talk to the same person and they can just jump into topics of conversation that seem almost pre planned. Maybe cause they have known each other longer? But I feel like even certain people I see every shift I make little to no progress with but overall I would think they like me or our communication is so benign it’s not like I’ve said anything bad to offend them.

I really don’t understand how to form platonic relationships. I don’t get how people have a circle of friends. Even when I was I was younger, I was always on the outskirts of friend groups. I was never a “core friend”. Or at least never felt like one.

Now admittedly almost 100% of my social interaction is based at work but there’s a lot of people and many of them mingle outside of work. But I feel like I can work with someone and have an amazing talk but at the end I really can’t tell if we’re like friends or not, or back to the subject: I can’t tell if they like me.

I am invited to a hang out next Friday. But I’m already nervous about it. I feel like I’m going to get blown off or it’s going to get canceled or something. I haven’t been invited to any sort of hang out in years. On my days off of work I don’t talk to anyone other than family. I spend all my time with my dog. I go to the gym. I sleep and wait for work again. 

I think it’s good to enjoy my work. I just can’t tell if people like me. "
471,1,"Hi, I was recently diagnosed as a 44 year old adult (long overdue tbh) and am starting to try to figure out how to navigate my brain a bit better. Something I’ve been struggling with a lot lately is boredom. The only time I don’t feel bored is when I’m doing something active like running, hiking, cycling, yoga, or walking my dogs. I have other hobbies and interests, but if they require me to sit still I have a really hard time being interested. Is this common for other folks? Has anyone had a positive experience with medication helping to ease the boredom? "
472,2,"It happens to me many times that I want to say something but I can't. It's like I have so many things to say and I don't really know where to start.    
I don't know if this could be directly related to my ADHD, but the thing is that when I try to express a concept, it's like it's divided into many smaller concepts.   
It's like I think about these segments of concepts so quickly that they overlap with each other. Even though they have an order in my head, when I try to say it, I can't.   
As I think about how to say one, my brain automatically thinks of another, and as I try to go back to thinking only about the first one, it's as if I have a block that confuses me and throws the structure of my thoughts out of order.   

To make a long story short: it's as if, while I'm thinking about segment one, segment two arrives and ""knocks""; I look at it quickly, think about it quickly, and then go back to the first segment. If I'm lucky I can pick up where I left off, otherwise I get lost, I get stuck and I have to start over.    

This doesn't always happen, for a post like this that continues to focus on the same topic, simply seen from different points of view, this doesn't happen, but if I had to add even just one piece of information (for example a simple introduction) I would really struggle.

473,2,"Has anyone ever gone to a retreat or even rehab specifically for ADHD and related issues?  

Diagnosed at 10 with ADHD. Confirmed by many second opinions. Tried many medications and therapies through the years.  Now 31.  Eight years ago, started taking a medication that worked and got me through university. I have extreme anxiety when under pressure and last week, abused my medication.  I have now gone upside down on the medication and must reset my system.  I am looking for a retreat that might help me work on coping skills rather than being drug dependent.  I am finding that all the rehab places say sure we treat that but when you press them, the rehabs are more about alcohol and opiods and no ADHD expertise.  Does anyone know of a yoga retreat for ADHD adults???  I will consider a rehab if ADHD is a specialty, but so far I haven’t found one.  I want in person, no virtual.  Could be mountain climbing or basket weaving as long as it is put together for ADHDers.  Any thoughts?"
474,0,"Was at work today and got a call from a customer. He was asking some questions and I was chatting answering them. I often overexplain and go on and on because well I never shut up when I am interested in something. Was about to let him go and said, ""If you have any more questions feel free to call back!"" He responded, ""Say less."" I'm a millennial but had heard the term before but no one had ever said it to me. I know it usually means agreement but the timing was funny. Got off the phone and cracked up. Like you know more people should probably tell me that. Made my day.

Im constantly discriminated against and im just building up debt. I even took adhd meds, and even that wasnt enough. Did I even have a chance at this life?

483,0,"First, I'm not a native English speaker, so I appreciate your understanding. 

Currently, my exercise schedule consists of running 2 to 3 days a week and doing CrossFit weight training once a week (my goal is to increase it to two days a week). Typically, I exercise three times a week  plus I walk 10,000 steps. 

I'm considering adding a new activity: community soccer, which I expect to participate in once a week. The main reason I want to start playing soccer is for the fun of it. I enjoy running and doing CrossFit, but those feel more like training rather than sports. There’s a bit of pressure to improve each day, but I don’t feel that pressure when it comes to soccer. I've played before, and it was a lot of fun. Lately, I’ve been struggling with stress relief, and I hope that the enjoyment of soccer and the camaraderie of the community members will help with that.

However, I'm uncertain if adding this new activity is good for my mental health. Should I focus on the two exercises that I can manage? Are three activities too much? Time and finances are not an issue; my health is my top priority."
484,0,"i kinda feel like my brain and my body and seperate but intertwined entities. like for as long as i can remember i have viewed things both in first person and third person simultaneously. like my body is experiencing it in first person and then my brain has a live video feed of myself in third person at the same time. but it’s not like the out of body third person feeling you get when you’re dissociating. i’ve experience that when my mental health is particularly bad and it’s distinctly different. 

rather than a disconnect from my body and sensations and stuff it’s almost like *extreme* awareness of my body maybe? i’m thinking maybe it’s a adhd thing sort of? like i’m so sensitive/aware of stimuli that to try and process it all i end up viewing things in third person simultaneously as first or something. i feel like the only time i don’t view things in third person is when i’m super hyper focused on something that all external stuff just like disappears and all the sudden ive been focussing on something for 5 hours and it’s felt like 2 minutes have passed. 

i’m curious, does anyone else have this kinda experience? i don’t really know how to explain it or what to call it. "

I recently got a pretty serious hip surgery, as a result I have to stay in bed for the next 45 days at least 😭😭 I also can’t sit down. It’s only been a week but I am back on my feet (haha see what I did there?!) in the way that I am myself again and my adhd is hitting me full power. I’m currently writing this at 2:30 am after I have been trying to sleep since 10:30pm! I take adhd pills every morning and melatonin at night to help me sleep. But this won’t be enough!! Two days ago I was going to sleep like a baby at 9:00pm and now here I am! I am looking for advice for how sleep better ( I have tried everything I have found online already; the military method the breathing method, meditation, counting forward AND backwards, I have tried to pour all  my thoughts out of my head but I had to stop because I got a book idea (I DON’T EVEN WRITE BOOKS😭) and way more) 

sorry for the bad formatting I am on my phone, I will take anything you will do to sleep for now. Oh yes because did I mention that the beautiful part of staying at the hospital is that they wake you up at 6 am everyday for check ins and whatsoever 😭 so I need to sleep!

And then further on, things to keep me occupied during the day!!!

Thank you all in advance 🙏🙏🙏🙏

491,2,"Hey y’all 26 F 

I’m a very talkative person. I love chatting, making friends, and connecting with people. I’ve always been this way, even as a kid, though I’ve learned to hold back a bit as an adult and am now medicated. I have ADHD (combined type), and while I can talk for hours about almost anything, I completely shut down when it comes to discussing my emotions, especially if I’m sad or upset. Even as a child, if an adult or friend noticed I was crying, I’d go silent. I’m curious: is this difficulty expressing emotions common with ADHD, or is it just a personal thing? My mind goes totally blank, like complete blackness, especially if someone presses me about it. I don’t know why this happens. 

Is there any science behind this “phenomenon” (only using that word because idk what else to call it), if so someone please explain. And if anyone else is like this who also has adhd I’d be so happy to know how y’all move through this or if you’ve got any ways to improve your ability to articulate your feeling without shutting down.

492,3,"Has anyone had any personal experience with memory recall involving recurring things? Especially when stressed? I have a good handle on this when it comes to work tasks because I write everything down either on a list or I put everything on my Outlook calendar. Unfortunately, my memory is causing issues in my relationship - my partner will tell me the same thing over and over again and I won’t remember until she gets upset and then I feel horrible. I listen to her but I don’t retain the information for later and then i will forget and do the same thing the next day and the day after that etc and won’t remember until she gets upset with me. I try really hard to remember the things that are important to her but it feels impossible sometimes especially because my life is so jam packed and busy as it is. For example, we have a dog boarding business - she has told me countless times that after a specific dog goes outside, to spray the concrete with the hose because the dog pees on the concrete. I swear she has told me ten times in general and I even wrote it down on a white board and still forget every time. Or she has told me 10 times to put the tweezers back in a specific spot but I cannot ever remember. Small things that are important to her and make her feel heard. I genuinely don’t know what to do. I am medicated for ADHD and have been for 4 years. While it’s done great things for every other area of my ADHD, it has not helped me in the area of memory. Has anyone else had similar issues to these and if so, what have you done to improve my memory? Whether that be digital tools, apps, habits, tricks, supplements, etc. I’m desperate. "
493,3,"I used to be pretty good at keeping my phone organized and it helped me stay on top of my to do list. I've always used daily checklists and reminders in combination with my calendar to remind myself of tasks and events. However lately I'm really struggling to stay organized. One big change was when I switched to an iPhone last year, which doesn't have a notification banner like my old pixel did. The banner was great because I would see that I had notifications without having to do anything, then I'd scroll through them and delete unnecessary things.  When I reopened my phone if there was a new icon in the banner that triggered my brain to look through my notifications again. 

Now I have to swipe to see my notifications which I won't remember to do without a visual queue. They're on my Lock Screen but I usually am only there for a split second, and they're stacked in a weird way and it feels overwhelming to go through them all. Even though I have the same reminders/calendar events in my phone, I pretty much never see them when they pop up. I frequently miss daily tasks and even appointments because I don't have a consistent way to alert myself of things. 

I also find that so many apps send me notifications, and I don't have much control over the type of notifications I get, so the stuff I want to see gets buried. 

Not to mention I have an issue with silencing my phone or putting it in do not disturb and then forgetting so I miss tons of calls/texts/reminders/etc. 

Can anyone else with ADHD and an iPhone give me pointers/best practices on how best to adjust settings to make me not miss so many things. I'm not trying to make this an Android/iPhone debate, I'd like to make it work with the phone I have if at all possible. "
494,2,Idk if this is an adhd thing or meds making things weird but ive been taken out by loud events recently and honestly I don't understand it much. I haven't felt this bad about them before taking meds (im on 20mg of vyanese) and its manageable but quite a lot. I was wondering if anyone else has gone through this and could help guide me through these sensory issues im dealing with. 
495,1,"Has anyone experienced this?

This was inspired by the post about terrible jobs for ADHD because it made me take a look back over the string of jobs I had over the course of 11 years before I found my THING™️.

I bounced between jobs every 3-6 months for YEARS. The longest I held a job before finding my forever career was 18 months, and that one broke me to the point that I was unemployed/self-employed with a small ""side hustle,"" in burnout for almost 2 years.

Looking back, I'm seeing the pattern of why I bounced around so much. In retail and food service, I trained quickly, excelled easily, and out performed other employees without added compensation or recognition. (Yes I realize NOW that it was unrealistic to expect those things.) Then, because I was doubling and sometimes tripling the productivity of those around me because of my constant need to keep busy and volunteering for extra tasks trying to climb the ladder,  more expectation would be put on me, but I'd then be passed over for promotions.

I didn't understand that the corporate machine wants to keep high productivity employees where they are at, because promoting the ""hard workers,"" to management ultimately means there is a reduction in productivity over all. Queue rejection sensitivy, caused by lack of reward for my efforts and not understanding why the system of climbing the ladder didn't work. So I'd move on to the next thing, thinking the flaw was with the company/management, not that the system was working exactly as intended. It took being no. 1 in metrics for a finance company for over a year and being passed over for a training position for my light bulb moment of understanding. 

The best thing that ever happened to me was getting fired from that job after 18 months when my grandmother died (I was PoA and EoE and they wouldn't approve FMLA because she wasn't immediate family.) After an almost 2 year break, I was able to find my Thing™️ 

Oof this got long. Sorry."

He is super smart and did very well in a middle school that is known for being ultra competitive.

We are less worried at school because he does a great job in-class where he can interact with teacher and students while he is also allowed his various fidgets. He basically got straight A's across the board EXCEPT in language arts! 

For a child that is incredibly well-spoken, presents well, and can easily hold any conversation with an adult, he HATES reading! We are very concerned that for the SATs, when the time comes, he will perform real poorly because he may not have built up the vocabulary necessary to be successful or understand/interpret reading comprehension because boring topics are extremely painful for him to get through.

So I’ve been using vyvanse (30mg taken daily) for about 1.5 years now, and it’s been great. When I forget to take my meds, I tend to get a horrible headache. 

However these past three days I’ve been getting a headache like that at the same point in the day even though I’ve been taking my meds. I’m not on any other medication and I always take my meds round the same time (8am ~ 10am). 

I’m incredibly confused as to what’s going on. I’ve been on top of my hydration game and I’m a big juice drinker, so I don’t think I’m low on any vitamins. I’m really at a total loss as to what’s happening with me to have headaches back to back with each day.

We were on a discord call with some friends and someone suggested we palythe new york times connections game. I was unbelievably good at it. English isn't even my first language.  It was like seeing the whole board without having to look at each word individually.  I was making connections even before the others had seen everything.

504,3,"Hey everyone,
I know everyone’s meds journey is very unique and personal, and not a one-size fits all thing, but I’m struggling to understand my situation. I’ve taken Focalin for some days/stretches of time in the past 2 years or so for ADHD. I’ve tried out both the instant release and the extended release. I’ve always assumed my meds and dosing work well for me because I can always get exponentially more done in a few hours compared to basically nothing without them. However, I’m starting to question if I’m actually benefitting properly from them. I hear people say that they benefit from their meds the whole day, especially when they take extended release. However, I’ve always felt like the drug is only in my system for maybe 4 hours max, and these days it feels like 2-3 solid hours. I get a bunch done in the morning during that time, and then I’ll either get distracted by something or choose to take a short break, and I can’t come back to my previously focused state. Moreover, I get anxious and start feeling depressed because I can’t seem to force myself back into focus. I feel really bad about myself and I can’t even think of one thing I want to do with my time—even things that are normally fun for me. Nothing sounds enjoyable. And then I feel like the rest of my day is wasted. I feel like this can’t be normal for an extended release drug, right? I remember in the early days of trying my meds, I tried a higher dose, but it made me way too jittery and anxious and more distractible, if anything. If also tried having protein-rich breakfasts and snacks, but in not sure I notice a difference in sustained energy/focus. What are your thoughts on this? I will definitely bring it up with my psychiatrist during my appointment next week, but I don’t know what to do in the meantime. I feel like I just end up wasting a lot of my free time by doing nothing and I start getting sucked into my depressive thoughts."
505,3,"So I'm 15F and I got prescribed 18mg Concerta last August, used it inconsinstently for a while (didn't take every day), and it caused me some really scary side effects like dizziness, heart pains, nausea, and complete loss of appetite. 18mg helped a little with my focus at first, but then the effect waned, and I got put on 36mg. Unfortunately then I had to stop because the 36mg already gave me such bad side effects. (Including one very violent vertigo attack that wound me up in the ER.)

But now, in August this year, it's gonna be the most important school year of my life cuz after this we'll be applying to other schools. Kind of like in the US how you apply to college after high school. So I really, really need to focus. And my adhd won't allow that. I currently have a 5 (almost an F) from maths because I only daydream in class and get absolutely NOTHING DONE. Like nothing. I have an appointment with my doctor next week and I'm really hoping she'll prescribe me something. I feel so hopeless..

So what is the best or ""safest"" medication, especially considering that I'm underage? If you have any experiences or advice you'd like to share, I'd love to hear."

I'm F and rather introverted, but I have anxiety and overwhelm and I feel after motherhood everything has unraveled like a blooming onion. 

I've always been messy my entire life (and even to this day I can't get myself together and cleaning feels like I have this heavy Rock that I'm trying to push up a mountain, especially when it comes to the dishes I would rather do anything else than that) and have piles of stuff all over the house.. I'm also very forgetful and scatterbrained. I did well in school because I forced myself to do so but learning things that I wasn't a fan of really put me in overwhelm and I would break down.

Even though as I'm trying to get through cleaning and decluttering I feel like my brain is pulling me in different directions with should I do this should I do that what about this? It's almost like a desperate feeling of these thoughts pulling at me. 
Every time I try to explain this other people they're like no I don't have that problem....  (I also thoroughly enjoy doing the laundry and a lot of times I would much rather be doing that than other chores so I guess I have a bit of avoidance..)

Anyone have any tips on how to better declutter clean and organize that would be helpful because I literally feel like a salmon swimming upstream half the time. 

Thanks!

I’m a 23-year-old man seriously considering getting diagnosed with ADHD, most likely the inattentive type. I relate heavily to the symptoms — restlessness, focus issues, inconsistent motivation, and mental fatigue — and I see the impact daily.

On the one hand I (M25) have this girlfriend (F24) who I know I love very much. Every so often though I do get hyper fixated on other women. I just crave them. I have to tell myself it will pass & usually it does. I have not nor ever plan on cheating but it’s just the “what if” for me. 

The on the other hand. I come home and I fixate over her. How can I make her happy? I will clean, cook, put on her favorite shows, etc. but when it comes to one on one time and or dates it just drains me. 

Has anyone ever felt this way and know some way of combating it? Besides medication. 
I haven’t taken that since I was 15 and would prefer not to. But, I feel myself gravitating towards it. "
513,2,"I’m on my first day of taking Vyvanse 30mg and I’m instructed to check my blood pressure and heart rate. I’m on blood pressure medication and my heart rate at resting sits in the 90’s. My NP told me if my heart rate gets above 100 BPM I can’t take the medication. I’ve tried non stimulants like strattera and it did nothing to help me. 

I checked my BP and BPM and it’s elevated. BPM is 114. I’m worried she’ll take me off. I use to be on Adderall with a different provider with no problem but wasn’t on blood pressure medication either. I really can’t function without stimulants so I’m here asking your experiences. Has your BPM improved over time? Is there anyone who suffers from a naturally fast heart rate and high blood pressure that is taking stimulants while not risking your heart health? Hoping this isn’t it for me. I meet with her in a week to see how I’m doing on the medication. "
514,0,"It occurred to me in the past couple years that some of my regular earworms, or short things I hum basically to stim, were so insanely old that I'd all but forgotten where they came from.

Do you have any that have stuck with you through the ages?"
515,3,"Living with combined ADHD isn’t just about being distracted or fidgety. It’s a constant and often invisible struggle that affects how I function daily—mentally, emotionally, and physically. And it’s not just about forgetting things either. It’s the entire cycle that starts with:

* Making a plan
* Wanting to follow through
* Getting mentally stuck
* Feeling overwhelmed
* Freezing
* Missing the deadline
* And then feeling awful for it

The worst part is, people often assume it’s laziness or poor time management. They say things like “just try harder” or “you need more discipline.” Or a new favourite line of theirs: ""You're not just being inconsiderate but you're also saying you don't want to change the pattern.""  
  
But ADHD, especially the combined type which is what I am diagnosed with, impacts executive function, emotional regulation, and working memory all at once. It’s like trying to run a race with tangled shoelaces and a 30kg backpack, while being told you're still not trying hard enough.

Most of us aren’t careless. We care deeply. Sometimes too much. But the way our brains process time, stress, or even simple tasks can completely shut us down *especially when pressure is involved.*

What makes it harder is how often people misread our struggles as inconsideration or lack of effort. But the truth is, we’re often putting in *more* effort than people realise just to reach a baseline that others take for granted.

I’m not writing this to vent (okay, maybe a little). But mostly to say if you’ve experienced this too, you’re not alone. Combined ADHD can be incredibly frustrating. Not only because of the symptoms themselves, but because of how misunderstood they are.

If you relate to this, how do you manage the disconnect between your internal effort and how others perceive you? Would love to hear how others deal with it."
516,0,"We all struggle hydration in this group right? I'm a breastfeeding mother so now I am hyper aware that if I forget to drink enough it effects more than just me. I keep getting targeted adds for the Buoy hydration drops. But since they are still a small company you have to buy in bulk. Have you tried it? How did it taste? They also have ones aimed at digestive health, immunity, and brain function. If you have tried any of those I would also love to hear of you felt they had any impact. Thanks fellow ADHDers. <3"
517,2,"I'm unfortunately not medically diagnosed with ADHD (Never had it checked) but I have had many daily incidents (for a long time) which leads me to believe that I have it.

I just want to know what helps you stay focused. There are many inconvenient caveats to my solution (which is just putting on edm or white noise)

This doesn't help in the long term and I find myself on a Chess app (I am certain I dont play chess because I want to improve but rather I play chess because the pieces moves and I can fidget with them? I hope it makes sense)

Point is I want to know how do I avoid myself from getting ""distracted"" per say. Should I get it checked? I am in the US, but idk how I could get it checked.

- From my understanding this followed the rules of the subreddit but if it doesn't I am willing to take it down (or the mods can as well)

518,2,"When I go out my house and interact with people, even those I know, it feels like a battlefield. 

I always tend to overthink what to say. I get drained fast cause its like my mind is a desktop with 100 tasks, running in the background. 

But, Then when I went home. 

My brain hits me with,

“Why did you say that?”

“Did you just laugh a little too much?""

“were you interrupting too much again?”

“Did you talk too fast? Too loud?”

“Wait... did you trauma dump a little?”

It’s like my memory becomes a judgement room, and I’m both the judge and the defendant, cross-examining my every sentence, tone, and micro-expression like my entire identity depends on it.

And it’s not even big stuff. Sometimes it’s like,

""Did I greeted them with my eyebrows? Would I appear rude""

“Was my laugh annoying?”

“Why did I they not laugh when I was clearly joking?”

“Did I smile too much? Or was it not enough?”

“Do they think I’m faking? Trying too hard to fit in?”

So I want to seem normal. But instead, I leave the convo feeling like I’m a glitchy NPC pretending to socialize. 

I know, I should just accept it. Not all people will resonate with me. Thats why I should pick the right ones where I don't overthink too much when I'm talking to them. My intuition knows who those people are. Is that magic?

And yeah, they probably didn’t even notice half of what I said. People just forget even embarassing things a day later. 

But my brain? 

My brain is still reviewing the footage, adding details, and giving me thoughts to ruminate even when I'm just brushing my teeth, eating, or when laying in bed. 

When will my brian go silence?  

Oh, it gets worse when I take coffee. But i need it for my tasks and work

519,3,"disclaimer, i haven't been diagnosed with adhd or anything, but what I'm experiencing is similar to the posts on here so i hope someone can give me some advice because im desperate. I had a 1500 essay due for uni 3 days ago which is worth 40%, but I've dropped the ball with it. I didn't start it earlier since i was busy trying to finish an overdue essay for a different class, and i physically couldn't focus on anything else while trying to finish that. Now after submitting that i was so exhausted that i took a few days off not doing any work, but then the due date got closer, and i still had no motivation whatsoever to start. I got a 2-day extension for the essay, which gave me some relief, and i told myself i didn't need to worry about the essay for another 2 days. Now i am actually interested in the content in this class, part of the reason i have no motivation to start it is dreading it being graded, as i find the lecturer who marks my papers for this class to be much harsher than the rest of my lecturers. But now that i've let it go past the due date and i'm getting a late penalty if i submit it now, i just feel no pressure whatsoever to start. It's currently 4.30am 3 days past the due date, -15% off of my mark if i were to submit it now, and I'm telling myself that I can't go to sleep until i finish it. I haven't even started it. I've just been scrolling on my laptop, telling myself 10 more minutes. even if i used an app to get rid of distractions i feel like id just be staring at the blank document, get bored, and then get up and do something else. My brain is screaming at myself for my laziness, but my body has given up. I feel no sense of panic or urgency. The impending deadlines don't even give me the adrenaline i need to finish the work i need to do, i just feel nothing. 

I fear my grade is plummeting and theres nothing i can do, ive just dug a big hole for myself. If theres any advice anyone can give me pls i beg, just so i can submit it at least.."

521,3,"I have been labled ""gifted"" for as long as I can remember, and I can't take it off me. Everytime there is a major academic exam, I just brush it off as 'I am smart enough, I'll just study the last week' which turns into last day to last hour. I have failed in my exams numerous times and have got 0.5% more than the passing marks last time. Everytime I get this desperation of 'I have learned my lesson, I will do better next time' but I never do. I might do for a couple of weeks, a month if I am lucky, but then I am back at the start. The field I am studying is already hard itself but I also want to write research papers. Everytime I get inadequate grades everyone says 'he has potential, just lazy'. I feel like let everyone down who supports me. I can't ask for help to anyone because I have no one close enough and my parents don't understand. Its been more than 1 year since I have started medication and it certainly has helped with anxiety , but its not enough. What should I do?. I have done self harm as punishment or as a reminder, but that didn't work either"
522,0,"(written on mob so apologies if the formatting is bad. I have tried to make separate paragraphs)

I was just reading something and it had the name Griff that was misspelled as 'Gruff' and I heard a voice in my head say ""hi my name's... "" in the way that I would jokingly say ""hi my name's 'Gruff'"" (I'm a laugh riot). 

This happens often, I'll hear a voice comment on something that's happening or that I'm looking at. 

For example, I was once looking at a picture of Mary Queen of Scots and I heard the sentence ""all about you are renegades"". Another time, I was thinking about a friend who has a lot of tattoos and heard ""commit murder in spaces under the skin"" which I thought was funnily fitting. Other times I can hear voices in conversation but can't make out what they're saying. 

I notice it more often when I've been drinking. 

I've been told by an ADHD coach that hearing voices is not uncommon, something about these being your unconscious thoughts that are occasionally audible due to something something ADHD brain something. If that's the case, I think it's so cool to have a glimpse into the mad stuff that the unconscious brain comes up with. Like watching the script to a dream being written. 

Wondering how common this is and what, if any, wild or funny thoughts you've 'heard'"
523,2,"I (24f) was diagnosed with ADHD a couple of years ago. Since I was about 14, I've been on some sort of psychiatric medication. The only thing that I have ever actually felt better on is Adderall. However, since I have also been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, my psychiatrist is really pushing me to keep trying other antidepressants or similar alongside the Adderall. I'm tired of being on a different medication every two months (which is an exaggeration but not by much). At this point I've tried all the generic brands, and so I'm paying too much money for the new name-brand type medications (Aplenzin, Auvelity, Rexulti, etc.).

There have been a few that have seemed to help, but they all came along with side effects that I couldn't handle. And sometimes the solution to that was just to add another medication. So, then I'm taking like four+ pills a night (including non-psych meds). And I hate taking pills. 

  
I like the Adderall because it helps, I am not required to take it every day, and it also has really helped stop the ""food noise"" in my head and I'm losing weight (I am overweight) which is also making me feel better. So, I really just want to only be on Adderall and not anything else. Is it ""normal"" to only be on Adderall? And not have any other psychiatry meds? Can Adderall work on its own? "
524,2,"I’m 34M. Around ten years ago I was buying clothes freely, traveling and just starting things when I just felt I should.

Now getting new shoes is a chore. Back then if something resonated with me, I just bought it. Now simply nothing resonates. In the plus side it is a fruit of me working in my recklessness. I’m much more reliable person. Back then I couldn’t keep a steady relationship. Now I’m happy husband and father of two. But there’s this downside, that not only it’s hard to chose something for me, I even feel that I shouldn’t buy myself anything, if it’s not necessary. 

And don’t get me started on traveling… I love traveling, but the love starts only when I cross my door. And to this point it is terrifying, especially packing and planning. Younger me was like “que sera, sera, whatever will be, will be”. Now I’m afraid of forgetting something minutest, like it would end my world. As if anything should be hyper planned.

I feel it is me reminiscing on younger mistakes, but turning the lever too much to the other side… it is also concerning, since it comes with much anxiety, and severe anxiety and depression is what I have overcome, with help of medication and long therapy.

Now I’m on methylphenidate, which helps with so many daily stuff, but those things above seem unaffected.

Does anyone feel the same? Maybe you can share some advices?"
525,1,"For a couple of months I used to ride a thrifted bike with broken brakes to work every morning and night. Going up the hills with my lungs bursting and then just speeding down the steepest slopes was heaven on earth. Being drenched in sweat with wobbly legs afterwards was extremely refreshing at the end of the day. Got me to stop on other very self-sabotaging habits while reaping the health benefits, both of which gave me amazing productivity. 


Now im at college in the middle of nowhere with nothing much but factories and industrial complexes. The roads are impossible to cycle on. And I desperately need a physical outlet to release everything. The bad habits have come back full force and are taking over my life again. Please help out a broke college kid. Any and every suggestion is appreciated. Any (healthy) physical outlet."
526,1,"Following a late-life diagnosis of ADHD, my PCP had me try Adderall; doesn't seem to work.  We're moving on to a trial of methylphenidate.  
That diagnosis came concurrent with several other life crises, including - last and worst - a rough breakup with a partner of ten years.    
For months I've been sunk in depression, constantly immiserating myself with thoughts of her and how she's moved on with her life.  
Researching non-prescription solutions, I found some evidence suggesting that SAM-e might be helpful.  
  
Holy shit.  
  
One day of SAM-e and all is right in the world.  Sure, I still miss her, think the breakup was a mistake, and want her back - but it's not the only thing in my world anymore.  I'm not heartbroken.    
SAM-e shattered my hyperfocus on the past and freed me to live my life again.

Good luck out there."

528,2,"I think I'm pretty capable and smart. I can manage a lot of information and I'm good at problem-solving and deep thinking. But, I'm not ""quick"", especially with verbal/auditory communication.

I think this gives the impression that I'm not very bright. I just need a second to think before I respond and I can't process more than one person talking to me at once.

When I'm in a group and other people are talking, I have a hard time figuring out timing and when to jump in. I feel like I'm always off and adding input after the conversation is turning another direction. So, a lot of the time I just listen and don't talk much.

It is what it is. But also, I'm tired of feeling like I don't fit in and like I'm awkeard. I do ok with 1:1 conversation but groups are SO hard.

So if your adderall is backordered for say, 5 days. When you get your medication, do you ""bank"" those 5 missed doses into your backup stash, and it's just assumed that you began your prescription on the date on the bottle?

However - I recently got an apple watch and keep getting notifications that my resting heart rate has been around 120/130bpm while being completely inactive (like just lying in bed). I know this isn’t a sign of a heart attack or anything though, but it’s obviously too high for a resting heart rate. I’m in two minds if I should speak to my doctor about this since i’m worried that they’ll take me off the medication if they think its causing me internal damage or whatever and it’s not something I really want to go through at the moment since i’m studying for my degree and the thought of going without my medication during this is my actual worst nightmare. I’m aware that Ritalin does usually cause an increased heart rate but my BPM seems a bit extreme for laying in bed.

538,1,"So growing up as a kid I actually used to love to read. I loved it to the point where every single place that I would go between school , home , bus , you name it.  I had a book glued to my hand at all times. 

….


Now fast forward to a grown adult whose ADHD and horrible memory has digressed to the point where a squirrel has a better attention span than I -
I genuinely cannot get back into reading. And it hurts to the core. My short term memory is so bad that I can read a page or two and I have no clue where I’m at in what I’m reading. I can’t indulge and get lost in a book anymore like I want to… and I really really want to… and then I become frustrated and this venture of trying to read as a calming hobby now turns into a reminder that my ADHD is debilitating and I can’t even read for leisure….

539,2,"I’ve (53m, diagnosed last spring) been taking generic concerta since last November or so, and 54mg seemed to be working, so we decided to bump it to 72 to see if I could get any additional help from it. By early January, I was having some heavy nighttime anxiety, mainly centered around our new bed, which has a softer mattress; this was making it more difficult for me to get to sleep, and coupled with the anxiety, my brain connected the two, as best I can describe it. That and the existential dread I was feeling during the crash made us reduce the concerta back to 54, and things seemed better, although the anxiety about the bed never completely went away. Now, it seems that the nighttime issues are returning, as the last few nights have been plagued with anxiety, sleep issues, and the dread feels like it might be creeping back in. I also feel like the concerta might not be helping as much during the day as it used to.

I’m not even sure what I’m asking, it’s just really frustrating and unnerving dealing with the nighttime issues. I assume I’ll need to get off the concerta, but I’m not sure what will be the next thing to try. I had success with adderall, but the difficulty in getting it led to the switch to concerta. I just want to be able to sleep (which was never a problem until the concerta issues) without this additional baggage."
