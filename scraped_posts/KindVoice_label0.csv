Maybe he thought I wasn't worth breaking up with in person. I put time, money, gas, and miles on my car into him. He was the first person I took home to meet my parents. I love him and he won't even text me back. Someone tell me I'm gonna be ok please. "
2,1,"Im doing pretty badly rn.
My life feels like an endless series of well, entering and exiting the psych ward :(
Idk it feels disgusting at times
Im not even hopeless anymore, not even given up, not even broken, just.. nothing. 
And I hate the people in the psych ward. They tell you to get up, to talk to others. People make me anxious. I dont want to get up anymore. Its a complete inability to continue. What for? I dont need answers from you. But I guess it would help to talk a lil"

4,1,"I’ve gone through a lot that I’ve never really been able to talk about properly. When I was in 5th grade, my parents started constantly fighting. I was always the one stuck in the middle, trying to keep peace. I’m the eldest daughter, and I’ve always felt like I had to stay strong and hold everything together — even when I was breaking inside.

Two years ago, my mom took her own life because of the years of fighting and emotional pain. I still think about it every day. A part of me feels like I could’ve stopped it if I had just done something differently. I know that’s not fair to myself, but the guilt is always there.

Since then, I’ve felt extremely alone. I don’t have close friends to talk to, and my brother doesn’t really understand me — he just gives me advice instead of actually listening. I keep everything to myself because I don’t know where else to put these emotions. I feel too much, and at the same time, I feel numb.

I’m not looking for surface-level chats or short distractions. I want to find someone who really wants to talk — about life, emotions, pain, anything real. I’m an introvert, so it might take me a little time to open up fully, but if you’re patient and kind, I will.

If anyone else is going through something similar — grief, family struggles, feeling like you’ve had to be the strong one for too long — maybe we can be there for each other. Just one person who truly listens can make a big difference.

If you read all this, thank you. That already means something..

5,0,"# Hey everyone,

I’m working on something really close to my heart — and I could use your insight.

I’ve been through periods of deep emotional pain where I felt alone, misunderstood, or just… invisible. I remember wishing I had someone — not to fix me, not to give advice, but just to *stay*. To *listen*. To *be there* in a consistent and caring way.

I’m exploring an idea for something that might provide that kind of emotional presence for people — especially for those who don’t always have access to therapy, or who just need a gentle check-in at 2 a.m. when everything feels heavy.

If you’re open to it, I’d love to hear:

* What has helped you the most during your lowest times?
* Have you ever used mental health apps or chatbots? What worked? What didn’t?
* What do you *wish* existed to support your mental and emotional health?

You can comment here or DM me if that feels safer. No pressure either way — just grateful to learn from your experience.

Thank you for reading. You matter."
6,1,"Hi (18m) 
This is was my first real relationship and they were my first real love. We were together for 9 months until we both decided that it was best to cut ties. Towards the end of the relationship, we had conversations about what we both needed from each other. They wanted more emotional affection and I wanted more physical affection. I of course respected them for what they wanted and I tried to change. But it seemed like they didn't for me. 

At the beginning of the relationship, it was like the honeymoon phase. We both were exited and couldn't get off each other. It was amazing. But as I said, that was my first real relationship, so I messed up a bunch with in the relationship, but we made sure we communicated and figured out some common ground for both of us. I know where I went wrong, and I changed that. But it's not like we both were changing. My partner struggle with helping me do simple tasks. The thing is, they are disabled with POTS (Postural orthistatic tachycardia syndrome) which makes it hard todo tasks and it takes time. So, I was basically doing all the work, all the time. 

We both talked about marrying each other, and having kids one day, which made me a little scared since this was my first relationship, but we ball. My friends said that they would treat me like a baby and boss me around like they were my mom or something, but I just ignored them. 

I'm not starting to have dreams about them, and it's just messing with me. Days where I have distractions help me because I don't have to feel. But days where I don't have anything, those are the hardest. 

I have no support. I feel like my family is disappointed in me because I couldn't find a stable enough job. I don't have any friends that I can talk to, so I truly feel alone. Luckily I did find something, job wise to help and it has been helpful, but finding good friends has been rough. 

I hope whoever reads this can help and give some goof advice for me or just wants to talk. Some things about me are: I like to listen to music, I like to dance, I like to laugh (though I haven't In a while) I like to play minecraft and roblox, I like to watch caseoh, and I like to go to the gym. 

Thank you for reading"
7,3,"It's like the title suggests... There's a number of things on my mind that I can't really put a finger on so I'm just going to write whatever comes to mind. Idk i just need company and reassurance and to feel like... nothing is wrong with me.

So there's a lot happening rn. I'm running around my uni and dealing with extremely rude and difficult admin, trying to fast track getting my papers so I can apply for a student visa. I have to decide between two universities and it's driving me nuts. I'm working out, I'm also learning how to drive and i need to learn how to cook... Basically Indian food. I know enough cooking to survive but not much of _our_ cooking if that makes sense. I finished my finals less than a month ago, and my dad got dengue and i spent a week taking him to the hospital and then I had a few days to breathe (i was still working out) and then I dove into the insane routine i have now. 

To top it off... My mom is... She has bipolar disorder and she had an extremely long manic episode that's only under control now because she's on some pretty heavy duty medication and... Now she's a shadow of her former self. And... Because I have so much to do I'm forced to put myself first so often and I just... I can't even bring myself to be very affectionate towards her because it hurts... Every time I hug her, i can feel her leaning on me as if it's the most comforting thing in the world and that's terrifying because... I'm losing my mind trying to take care of myself and get things done, and i just feel so horribly guilty because I'm leaving her to study elsewhere. 

It's just... Too much.... Why did no one tell me how hard it is to think about yourself and put yourself first and just... Take care of yourself? Taking care of mom and others... Used to feel effortless but now I can't even do that... But... It was so simple before: just do what makes other people happy. Do what keeps mom and dad happy. Keep the peace at home. Be selfless. It didn't work out long term of course. It chipped at me bit by bit and then my grandma dying took out a particularly large piece and I've just never been the same. I used to be able to handle a LOT. Now the smallest things overwhelm me. But I still find anticipating other's needs and contributing to them easier than doing anything for myself. I just... Having to think about what makes me happy and what I want to do is just... So horribly difficult. Every thought I do have is tainted by how it might make other people unhappy and I find myself scrambling to do what I think is best for me... Which i honestly don't know if it is because God knows I've never given it any thought until... Idk a year ago? While also trying to keep everyone happy because... I just feel terrible if I don't. Why is it so exhausting to just... Take care of myself? It seems to come so effortlessly to others but... It's just too much for me. Even when I do manage to separate what I want to do from what makes other people happy... It's always such a long and arduous process trying to even get to that point. 

I guess this explains why... I just constantly feel this... Need? Desire? Longing? All of the above? For having someone who just... Loves me and takes care of me. Like really takes care of me. Someone who just... Loves me and lets me lean on them because... I don't really have anyone i can do that with rn. Most people in my life lean on me. It's honestly kind of sad but... It doesn't much to make me really happy. Quality time, just existing with someone else, a meaningful compliment a small act of kindness towards me. That's all I really need. I can think of only one person who actually does these things for me and... It's infrequent. I'm always taken by surprise and often question what they really meant to say or do, because it just... Feels too good to be true. 

 I just... I wish I had someone who really loved me... And showed me that they loved me for myself and... even if I put myself first because... My family kinda doesn't do that. Someone who'll acknowledge and praise my hard work and appreciate it when I do things for them. Someone who I can bounce ideas off of and talk to when I'm extremely overwhelmed so they can quiet the thoughts in my head. Someone who'll just do little things for me and spend time with me when I'm utterly burnt out and feeling down in the dumps... With the few people I feel like i can lean on it always feels like something is missing... It may be because in my mind that's always been a romantic partner. Even though... My exes have all been horrible and abusive to me, I can't help but crave the kind of love and comfort a relationship offers.

Crave might be a severe understatement. It's honestly kind of insane how much I want that kind of relationship. I find myself daydreaming about it constantly. Sometimes it's the only thing that gives me comfort. Like... God the amount of time i spend thinking about just... Being held and... Being able to cry in someone's arms or rest my head on their chest when I'm tired and have my hair stroked and my back rubbed and just... Sweet nothings murmured into my ears. I swear it's all i think about the majority of the time I'm awake. I don't remember my dreams but I'm sure i dream of it too. I want to be held so bad it almost hurts. Like... Sometimes I feel an almost physical pain that feels like it will only go away if I have the arms of a non existent partner wrapped around me. 

It doesn't feel... Normal... How much I need something like that. Other people seem to be perfectly fine without it. But... Idk. Idk where I'm going with this long post tbh. I just feel so horribly overwhelmed and that... Craving has been stronger than ever and i don't know what to do with myself. Uhm... If you made it so far... Thank you for listening. I appreciate it"
8,1," I (40) became completely unaware when things were not going right and i was blindfolded, i dont need advice,i just pretend i am okay, but i am not."
9,1,"EDIT: Still looking. 8 hours later, no replies yet.

I feel lifeless...like a man without his soul.

Last year, around this time. I met a girl who walked into my life like my guardian angel. Someone who was there for me day and night. Who made me a better Muslim and human being every single day. Someone who was there to not judge me and listen to me, stuck by my side through my pain and trauma, and helped me heal. She turned me from the sad guy who had panic attacks to the guy who loved to smile and make her smile. She barely smiled or talked positive things about life, and soon enough I found a purpose. Her happiness meant the whole world to me, by being the funny me. If I was able to make her smile, it would make my day as I would smile.

I used to tell her, ""If I ever get married, I want my wife to be just like you. Always looking out for me."" Because that's how much she changed my life and talked to me for hours and hours.

Often at times I was so naiveee and innocent. And she would protect me and teach me things about life and people when I didn't know things about how people even are in this world as a 25 year old man who had spent the majority of his life in an abusive home until he made it out at 24 and half.

Everything was perfect. Except the fact that she never talked much about herself, was always so reserved and closed off even after 8 months of being friends. She barely even showed me how she looked like but knew how I looked like. But  did know her voice from her singing and smule profile. Took her 7 months to tell me she was from Canada and until then she'd not even tell me that. I live in the United States and she knew that all along.

Around the 8th month mark, I was dealing with so much worse in my college life. I didn't tell her that. At the same time I felt so disconnected from her and humiliated and insulted that I barely even know a thing about her and every single conversation of ours everyday was all about me. Nothing about her. So I confronted her and she again like always said she is not comfortable talking about herself to me and still wants to stay private. I told her I cannot function like this.

We had a short argument that built up for a week at that point and I tried to ease it up but then I realized I just can't do this anymore. I have to walk out respectfully for my own self esteem and self respect. So I nuked all the messages on discord using a bot in our chat to show her that if she can't trust me after 8 months, I take my trust back with me too on my way out. I unfriended her. 

And guess what? She moved on as if I meant nothing to her....barely even tried to get in touch. A week later I sent her a request again for closure. She accepted it and then immediately blocked me without saying anyhing, so I blocked her back.

Life had been so messed up and busy since then so I never had enough time to grieve. But I did at times. But more recently now since its summer and I have a lot of time, 5 months later and I'm back into my Summer house, where last year I met her online around the same time, every little thing here reminds me of her and I can't seem to stop crying at times.

I even dream of our conversations at times or reuniting because that's how badly I miss her. Although I may not forgive her for the way she treated me but I still hold respect for her being there for me last year at my worst. Once again I'm at my worst now, but because of her....

I think I realized that I was in love with her and I've never had this deep respect, care, affection and strong feeling for anybody in my life but her because of how much she cared.....or pretended to....

At this point, I even question if it was even real....or was I just a tool for her to pass time or saw me as her personal project to guide me back to religion like any religious person would try to do....

A few days back, I met this old woman online who is my self appointed online mom at times lol. She is trying to get me out as she says I need to get out. I can't give up like this. I have to go out, dance, meet people, even if people may be racist, not give a f about me or treat me worse, or I go through a heartbreak, I got to put myself out there and not give a damn, go out dancing even if I got to dance by myself, I got to go do it. Even if I have to go eat out alone, I got to do it.

She said I can't stop living my life worrying about what others may think of me because of my race or that I may go through another heartbreak if I try. Trying for love is not a waste of time as what my mind is making me think. But all of this is only going to make me stronger. And only if I keep trying, I will find my person....because you never know who might be the one to hold my hand tight and never let go.

I think of it this way and for a short time it makes me feel good to think that way. Even right now....but then I forget it all moments later and and I'm back to grieving again...

This week alone I've woken up crying as my dreams were about her....

I think as a hopeless romantic, I love too hard.....My new  online Mom told me I need to learn how to not love someone more than I love myself so that I don't forget how to live without them when that person is not by my side. And in my case, I never learned how to be by myself. I got so used to this girl being around me so much that I forgot how to even be alone and my loneliness hurts....

10,3,"I don't know what to do.

(18f). Okay.. so now that my gap year is almost coming to an end and its time to choose colleges, I'm devastated. I'm overwhelmed.. there's not much choices.. i couldn't get into my dream colleges.. (i BEGGED for a gap year to get into these colleges) But you know, I'm Indian.. And the top colleges have extremely high competition. I'm tired. 

Now i feel like every little anger my parents show it's because I haven't been a good daughter.. for little things.. chores, laundry.. My dad has never been emotionally involved with us, but now he's.. too far away, and i feel like i can't get to him.

I've never had friends.. i only have one friend, and well, she has her own life and is busy so I don't want to dosturb her.. I've spent this year isolated at home.. barely going out with my one friend (because, Indian Parents.). And now, i need help.. I need help so bad.. I've always been a cheerful person.. never had Self harming thoughts.. but i do now.. and i don't recognise myself anymore.

The void in my heart is getting bigger and bigger and i spend most nights crying because of those small moments of anger from my parents.. I've never felt like I'm enough.. always felt like i have to earn their love.. but I'm tired of trying and not achieving anything.. I'm tired.. and i need help.. please.."
11,2,"I’m 14 and just moved in with my Nana today. My mom didn’t say a word to me before I left. No goodbye. No hug. I cried on the drive.

She started treating me like I was nothing — even told lies about me sneaking out and doing things I’ve never done.

I’ve always been a momma’s boy, and this is tearing me up. I feel like I’m losing her forever. I didn’t want to leave. I just wanted to be loved. My Nana loves me and is taking care of me, but this pain is real.

I don’t even know if she cares that I’m gone. No text. No call. Just silence."

19,3,"I (23M) am a foreign student in US, working on my master degree.

I always feel unmotivated and alone. I have been here for a year now. I have only two fairly close friends here and we only hang out about twice a month. At school, all I do is just get by and meet the deadlines. I never make plans ahead. I have nothing to do in this summer break. I do know I should have gotten into some research groups in school. But I don’t know where to start. At first I did try to fit in by attending some international student meetings but I have trouble starting a conversation with strangers and stuttering. The passion soon faded. After that, I rather preferred hanging out with my books, TV shows and games. It is always like this and it probably has something to do with my procrastination and anxiety.

Why did I come abroad to study in US in the first place? I don’t really know. My life is a circle of starting over and failing. Every time I feel like I’ve lost at one stage of life, I choose to start again in another. Whenever I started middle school, high school or undergrad, I never had any classmates I already knew. I basically moved somewhere new each time. But I don’t see any of those as a successful new beginning. My undergrad college experience was the worst. My grades were mediocre and only one friend still keeps in touch with me. I guess that’s partly why I came here, along with hoping to find a decent job here in US. Still, I haven’t seen any difference here compared to my undergrad college.

Seeing all those stories posted online (such as Reddit) gives me complicated feelings. People experience youthful love. People prank their partners. People get betrayed by their partners. Some people leave this world in their partners’ arms. People are driven crazy by their asshole teenage children. I can feel the void inside me become increasingly more noticeable. People experience all sorts of things, but there’re no stories within me. I have never dated a female, let alone had any wonderful experiences worth sharing. The contrast drives me crazy.

I started making up stories and posting them online to seek attentions. Sometimes I just DM people who share their stories, and I make up a similar story to get their attention. They talked to me, shared their genuine stories and feelings with me and gave me their sincere advice. Feeling guilty for lying, I confessed to some of them, though not completely. They showed genuine care and told me to accept who I truly am.

My parents encourage me to take the civil service exam after I get my degree, but it is not what I want. My few friends back in my country keep telling me how much they struggle to find a job in this economy. My family is not poor. They can support me while I work on my master’s degree but they are not wealthy enough for me to afford having a car here. I know I should get back on my feet soon before it is too late. I should at least try finding a job here in US.

I don’t know whether my dull life story is relatable for you. I think I want to work on myself in the right direction and I am here trying to kind of sort this out. I don’t expect to eventually find a job here and but I do want to feel motivated and not lonely. I want to have purpose and meaning in my life.

Should I try a therapist? I have never talked to a therapist. I don’t know whether my problems are serious enough for therapy and I don’t know how to find one yet.

I apologize if my phrasing seems unnatural. English is not my first language. I appreciate any comments, whether they are judgments or advice.

**TL;DR:** I don’t have much company and I am struggling with schoolwork. I feel lost in life. I am seeking advice on how to improve my situation."
20,3,"i usually just write to chtgpt to express my frustrations but i guess this is my seg-way to communicating with people again.

my entire life has been pain, and i wish i were exaggerating. i was a healthy kid with incredibly good memory. like photographic. i could remember conversations word for word, and the reason i came top some exams is because i had picture perfect memory. growing up in an asian household is like trauma from birth, and i had an incredibly strict uncle who was a tuition teacher. i spent a lot of time at my uncles house, and it was miserable. since i was a shy kid i was bullied by my cousin, and my cousins brother (who's the same age as me) basically followed that and we never spoke. i'd sit through the car ride in silence even when i got hurt, same with at the house. just watched whatever my cousin put on and after he'd leave i'd sit in silence in the other room. going to change for tuition often involved being scared my other cousin was around. to be frank everyone was scared of my uncle, as he was known to be a strict teacher who sometimes used violence, and at the time a lot of parents thought it was good to instil fear in their children? i'd never got hit by him, but i recall being hit when i was 6/7, and that was because i was too slow doing the paper. i remember i was already wearing an uncomfortable traditional outfit and i had to sit an exam with the year older. this exam preparation doesn't usually start till you're 9. in the end i got close to his sons mark, even through getting smacked. don't get me wrong my uncle did a lot for me, i wasn't entirely happy but he would be the only person i'd talk to whilst eating. mostly him saying the same talk, and me responding with just a smile. my aunt would nag at me to talk more saying i should be 'more like my sister' and ofc that just made it harder. for some reason i could be myself at home but not around my relatives. its like my brain shut off and i couldn't think of words. like many my aunt stereotyped a bit giving more food to my cousins 'because they were boys'. you'd think it should be like my second home and i should just be able to open snack drawers and take what i want but that was like committing a crime. every-time my other relatives would do that i believed i just 'wasn't allowed' or my cousin would murder me.

you'd think i had at least friends right? wrong. i could be more free at school but i don't remember having friends before the age of like 6. there was one girl who basically ruined my whole primary school for me. in year 3 she accused me of pinching her when i wasn't even near her. we have traffic light systems in school, where you basically go down the traffic lights if you get in trouble. because we weren't getting to a conclusion we both kept going down the lights until we were almost at red. i didn't want it to escalate further so i lied and said i did it. i was merely 6 years old. even my mum didn't believe me at first. primary school is a weird place because i feel like no one really makes true friends. people would be nice to me one on one and then turn on me or i had to try incredibly hard to try and be friends with them. that girl who i should really refer to as b\*tch kept doing things. can you imagine having to survive a terrible day everyday and looking forward to lunch but having your lunch stolen. or if she didn't have time to steal my lunch she'd call the lunch lady and start accusing me. like let me eat my lunch in peace. in year 5 we had an eco friendly club where we were altering lyrics from pop songs about animal cruelty. i had proudly made some lyrics shared it, then went to lunch, came back & found out another girl had taken credit for what i'd made, and was being praised by the teachers for it. in year 6 i was invited to a birthday party by someone and her friend had convinced her to give me a fake location. i cried, and for some reason decided to go the party sacrificing my new birthday gift i'd recieved. honestly i don't remember how it went. on the last day of school i could not wait to get out but felt emotional looking at the pics?? the girls were treating me like vermin and i asked my 'friend' for her contact info to stay in touch but she kept avoiding. then when my cousin came to take a picture they all came running to smile for the camera. children can be fucking evil.

i passed the exam to get into an all- girls grammar school (my rank wasn't as high as my family expected because my uncle was telling everyone i'd be top ten but the pressure was so high i wet myself right before the exam). i was so excited. new uniform, new people, new start. there were few ppl from my primary school in my school, even my class.

first month or two went great. made friends, felt happy. then shit went downhill. i still don't know how or why, think it was a rumour of headlice but everyone turned against me. the most popular girl in class was choosing her 'clique' and between my 'friend' and i she chose her. i was treated like walking vermin. going to assemblies was my biggest fear. everyday for 5 years. they would run around the line to avoid sitting next to me. brushing their hair every-time they were near me. getting me for secret santa? the whole class would know who they got. put in the same group? near me in seating plan? same reaction. the person would make it so obvious and the class would all make a 'i feel so sorry for you' reaction. they probably talked shit about me in the class gc i wanted be part of so badly. i wanted to be hugged so badly on the last day before break. the worst part is one on one they'd actually be nice but as a group they switched to demons almost like it was a crime to not be part of the joke. there were bystanders who are the people who often 'sacrificed' themselves to sit near me in assemblies.

now i was incredibly athletic. good at running, insanely good reflexes, and just really quick. i was a natural at shooting balls, catching balls from long distances without even realising, a skilled batter, and good stamina. we were split by houses and we had house competitions often. i was never picked because it was chosen by the class, and entirely based on popularity. even if they couldn't throw a ball. they'd rather that than dare to put me in. same with house dance, i wasn't the best dancer at the time but better than most of the 'popular ' people. i think the worst part was actually loving how the whole class felt like a family, but i wasn't a part of that and i wanted to be part of it more than anything. my social anxiety said hell no. when the entire year or 'grade' treats you the same it was hard to be more myself. only me against all these people. if i had just one friend it would've been so much easier. i think i've had anxiety since a very young age but it obviously got worse. i also had ocd and starting doing rituals to 'make them like me'. i was a smart kid but obviously my academics would be affected by just having to survive all day. honestly the whole five years is just a blur. i spent my time alone or in the library, at first i went home sick because i was dreading assemblies and my parents would get mad. there was this one girl who i felt had similar personalities with and everyone loved her. i wanted to be her so bad. should also mention that the most 'popular' girl who i believed was the cause of people hating me, i had a friend crush on her. i wanted to be her friend so so so badly it was genuinely like having a crush. the class basically worshipped her at the time. in year 8 i talked to her over snapchat and we had a good conversation. she said i should be more open irl. we were sitting next to each other at the time (a dream for me at the time) and i guess she was kinda looking forward to me being me. i couldn't do it because my social anxiety was just that bad. every single day i went into school with a mission, every single day i came back feeling i failed and hating myself. i'll mention here that i wasn't just hated by my year but even other years. my only and best friend of 13 years since babies who i was so excited to know got into the school sided with those bullies.

the school was absolutely useless. i told my teacher in year 7 and she was scared of the class herself. i remember telling someone again in year 7 and when i went back into the class i could tell people were snickering and judging me. went to peer support about it was told 'oh you've dealt with it all this time not much long till you leave'. genuinely sickening. told someone again a few years later and when she asked to pick out people i couldn't pick the entire class/year so i just picked out ppl who i had on my mind. it was so uncomfortable because they were sickeningly nice and offered me to sit with them, then back to normal the next day. now i did tell my close cousin about it and idk why tf she didn't speak to my mum for me. in an old journal it says i tried telling my parents but they don't understand? so i just dealt with it. survived it like i always do.

music was my one solace. it always had been. going on youtube ever since childhood was my way of escaping. i also got into kpop around 2016 through exo and fell in love with bts a bit later and i genuinely loved them to death. started a fanpage in 2019 where i made some friends and that was the only place i feel i can say i felt happy. it was exhausting though because i spent hours and hours screenshotting, cropping, screen recording, posting content for every member even though i started as a jungkook fp. i think i only had max 300 followers but i loved it anyways. forgot to mention i had my first bout of insomnia in 2018 but im sure i had trouble sleeping before that because i would dread the next day of school for years. i also would masturbate excessively before bed often going to a 100 or more, and this problem continued over time. my insomnia worsened like early 2019 and although i was watching bts concert i missed online during my exams i managed to get surprisingly good results. i didn't do any revision except half bio (which i loved) and half of rs (also loved). who knows what i could've got if i actually studied.

anyways i was so into the fan page thing that into sixth form (decided to stay at the same school for some reason??) i wasn't focusing on school. like i mentioned in my previous post im 99.9% certain i've had ADHD since childhood because i could never be consistent with anything. i couldn't study but at school i did like learning. i think? even through the bullying i was someone who always asked teachers questions and i believe this increased through sixth form. same at chem tuition, where i was going with the old 'popular' friend crush and another girl from my old class (who's actually my relative). its funny because here i was the funny one and in class i was the main character. i've also had this weird ability to understand difficult topics, so my chem teacher kinda loved me.

i wasn't getting bullied in sixth form but i did experience my friend being stolen, isolation but i did make some friends yet i wasn't really happy. because one i wanted to be friends with people that i felt similar to like kpop fans and wanted to feel accepted. i actually did reach out to this girl who also had a kpop fanpage from my main insta and that took a lot of fucking courage through anxiety. she was nice about it but when i kept talking it was clear she was just being vague so i stopped.

i think im getting side tracked a lot and im exhausted so i'll just write the key stuff. back to the insomnia. i was sleeping like 6-7 hrs i think on average worst could be like 4? not sure. which is a dream rn but at 16 years old its not ideal. i think during my fanpage era i was sleeping 9 hrs for a bit till it went downhill. im not sure what caused it but it i think a factor was my sister changing my phone password and me losing all my content. so my insomnia got worse. soon after covid happened which was even worsening, and i started to get intrusive suicidal and obsessive thoughts. my house isnt super big so staying caged and not sleeping was not ideal. i always thought 'why the hell could covid not have happened earlier' because staying at home and not going school would've been a dream before. i had major sleep anxiety and was obsessed with the moment i fell asleep ik its weird. the suicidal thoughts plagued my head. i had no choice but to off myself. when i told my parents they got angry, yelled and threatened to kill me. all i wanted was for them to tell me its going to be okay. i genuinely have no idea how the hell i fought through that. i guess i clinged onto the fact i didn't really want to die. i did seek out therapy but that wasn't till the end of 2020 and it was like counselling so shit for insomnia. it affected my entire life, even bts i couldn't fully connect with.

my grades were falling because consistency and actual notes are the key to getting through a-levels and throw insomnia on top of that? i'd always wanted to become a doctor because of my love for bio and just how it all made sense but ofc you need good grades for that and it wasn't that i wasn't capable its just i was fucking exhausted. i think this is a feeder for ADHD, add anxiety, depression and OCD and its just chaos. i firmly believe i've been on the extreme scale for everything i've been through. even my problems were all or nothing ffs. the day of a-levels i decided to study the entire content ON the morning of the exam which is impossible, whilst almost collapsing on my exams. but my mom said i just had to 'sit through it'. they thought the same miracle with GCSEs would happen but i obviously flunked. im honestly surprised i even passed tbh.

retaking exams wasn't even an option because i just had to get out of my city, so i went and did a foundation year course in a pre-dominantly white area where i had racial insecurity for the first time in my life. i was doing a course i was convinced to take for 'future sake' because i couldn't do what i wanted. ofc the lifestyle of university is not ideal for an insomniac, especially being right in front of the kitchen door with flatmates who partied every damn day. because i was so used to surviving and just pushing through i just dealt with it. my room became a pig sty over time. i made friends for the first time and because i felt so tired i couldn't go out or even go to lessons. after all these years i've had to realise myself that it was my all or nothing principle that stopped me. yes i was exhausted but it seems like a privilege now to just go outside. i had such high expectations and need that i had to 'fully' enjoy it and now looking back that was a mistake. i wish i hadn't had to realise this all myself after years and that i actually had a good therapist to tell me but moving on. i was basically depressed and resorted to speaking to people online. it was fun at first, thrilling actually but overtime as my insomnia became worse, the online talking was more frequent. my friendships i made were getting affected, and there were also new people in the friend group and from past experience i felt like i was being 'replaced' and isolated.

all the assignments were done the night before no matter how big and i was surviving on adrenaline rushes. this was obviously horrible for my insomnia. somehow i was still kinda living on my own through the exhaustion, and returning home frequently and going out. anyways passed the year, got into the next and moved in with these mutual friends into a house. on top of a hill. worst idea ik but the roads in that city are mostly uphill. then i found another talking app but here i made friends and it was really fun at the time but i stayed up talking to these friends are surprise surprise worse insomnia. then i had to stop school go back home and i had to deal with all the tenant, uni, everything myself. i've never had help before. ever. my dad just makes money, he's never there emotionally and he doesn't know how to do anything. growing up he always spoke for me and was just condescending. 'she's this and that' just yelled and hit me, and would tell me to hit him and just a horrible parent in general. my mom has made a lot of mistakes but she was the reason i survived. i was living for her for years. she has given me trauma including making me push through something even though there is an alternative. i feel like because she's been in survival mode that was projecting onto me, except i literally was on survival mode with the sleep issues. my sister was my bestie growing up, we shared rooms and she loved me the most. because of what was going on at school i kinda took it out on her and was mean but she was still sweet to me. eventually she became quiet and i started blaming myself.

i moved back home in late 2022 and then i spent all my time speaking to strangers online. ive realised now that i only sought online connection because i couldnt get it irl. im surrounded by family but i'd never felt comfortable with family and i felt had had to be 'at my best' to hang out with them, so i missed out on all the connecting there. anyways my whole day was spent on screens. it was omegle, then another app last year. now i had no energy but i poured my soul out to these strangers helping them, dealing with them even though omegle has the most wild people on it. i was pouring my soul to strangers for hours, having the same conversation over and over again. i was so depressed my parents nagging was basically invisible to me. i also did this with other people especially my sister, and i think that's bc of guilt that i made her quiet & distant. i begged my sister to connect with me and when she wouldn't i'd get really really upset. my parents both work and with my sister at school i was at home all the time. connecting with people was what i thought made life worth living, i loved human interactions so much but after speaking to like over 10k people on zero energy for years, ignoring my bodys signals because the temporary dopamine was more convincing. even as i couldn't breathe i just pushed through talking maybe bc i was scared to go to bed. i was taking anti-depressant meds and i took them at random times, so my body has never known regularity.

as an asian, weddings are the most extra and long especially in my family so it was something i actually liked but fed the insomnia & anxiety which made it a nightmare. i felt even more distant from the family when i couldnt help out even though i really wanted to. like i'd disappointed them. i feel like as im writing each point im thinking of another traumatic event and its awful but just want this out. the cousin that bullied me during his brothers wedding was telling everyone i was his gf and he is my FIRST cousin. my cousins just said nothing. i was 15. on the same wedding day i got told by someone twice my age that i was the most attractive girl at the event, and fyi he had a gf. also every time someone complimented me i want to gauge my eyes out and cried. because i looked 'great' on the outside.

anyways i've never known consistency. i was at home 24/7, self-sabotaging and killing myself slowly. this is the purest form of torture for sure. after my 'gap year' i changed my degree to something i still didn't really want to do but was a better choice. it was a huge upgrade of unis but still by my standards and family standards it wasn't a smart people university (i've realised that uni doesn't mean anything if you're a shit person). i still wasn't sleeping, and every-time there was a bit of hope i'd self-sabotage. i dreamed of going out clubbing, socialising, basically living a thriving and average university life. i'd also become the person i wanted to be since childhood but at what cost? my body and mind had failed me.

eventually i hit burnout and system shutdown last september and ever since i can't walk or talk properly. i won't get into the details of insomnia but just imagine not sleeping for 8 years and pushing yourself always throughout.

i've learnt all these lessons through all this but i hate that i've had to go through all this just to learn what i could've been told, and i've had to learn through hyperawareness which is a weird symptom of severe sleep deprivation. ever since i've hit burnout i can't even enjoy music anymore. i can't watch anything because the visual movement is too much. i cannot walk down the road without almost collapsing. meanwhile the people that bullied me are getting successful and living. i saw some of them last year at an event i almost collapsed right before and i smiled at them??? also i've had to just deal with the trauma family has caused. my sister doesn't even talk to me anymore, and i don't think i can rely on her. my dad and sister never changed their behaviour to help me. they just do what they want. and i still think 'if only i was living' my relationship with my sister would've been better. my mom has changed but i've had to teach her a lot of lessons. i understand its her first life also. i would listen to music and dream of a better life and get so excited but never did i imagine it getting this bad. i've hit dissociation to a point where i don't even think getting better would be worth it anymore. the world seems too trivial, especially because i've tasted insanity from breaking down. i still get instrusive thoughts to hurt my family like i have in the past. i was an excellent runner now i can't walk. i cannot WALK. its fucking insane. my memory once way too good is non-existent. my hair once glossy is dry and dead. my skin is dry, cracked and my face isn't too bad but its evident im tired. i am good looking so when i see myself i think of all the potential that's being wasted. and sometimes i wish i was just 'ugly' so it wouldn't feel like a waste as bad as that sounds. i've surpassed countless mental dilemmas, and looking back i think why did i ever think like that?

guess what made me make this post is looking at social media and seeing the life i could've lived, i do avoid social media as much as possible now. i've lost my health, my time, my energy, my soul, my money. i feel like ive been killing my mom who has diabetes where stress is the no1 factor, my dads a pushover who puts others over his own family, and my sister sees me as a failed experiment. i FINALLY have understood to prioritise myself but at what cost?? i feel like its too late. its the same day on repeat except ig gets worse each year. every birthday i feel like ive died. that dream life becomes more of a fantasy everyday. now i'm not frustrated i've been through shit, no i think it builds character development. but the last few years where i drowned myself online, self-sabotaged like hell, binge ate, fought mental health, lacked support and was disappointed over and over again by 'professionals' thats whats hard moving past. and i wouldn't be reflecting on the past if it weren't for my health getting so detrimentally bad. its so ironic because after i had health issues nothing else mattered. my social anxiety disappeared, and i wondered why i even cared about how people would react. i thought it was my biggest barrier but boy was i wrong.

the life i couldve lived is so so so so so incredibly bright. i could've been saved countless times but every warning sign was ignored. everyone failed me then i failed myself. me being here is the sheer power of resilience but i keep wondering its too late or if its even worth it anymore. and i feel absolutely cursed with timing because when one thing came and went another came. my life is full of regret, pain and non-stop suffering and i keep questioning what i'm fighting for.

i also feel so used to pain and feeling horrible that i think feeling okay will feel alien.

i feel like i've touched on certain parts in my previous posts but i just want to get this out of my system (this was way longer than expected)."
21,0,"I’m into gaming, music, and anything that pushes me to improve. I love the process the grind, the precision, the details most people miss. My humor’s pretty raw and unfiltered,  sometimes borderline offensive, but always honest. I don’t joke to be liked, I do it because it’s real to me. I troll, but only when it hits right timing matters. Music helps me reset, reflect, or just get lost in the vibe. I’m not into pretending or fitting in. I’m just focused on growing, staying sharp, and keeping things real in a world that’s mostly fake.

I would really like if someone that can relate to me would want me to be their friend, as I said looking for something real here, I believe in Constructive Criticism so if you cannot handle the truth or cannot be truthful like you don't want to hurt my feeling by not being honest you can leave me be, but if you're like me then do DM me as I'm here to chat.

22,2,"I’ll try to give the short version. Not sure where else to turn. If there’s a better sub, please lmk.

38f and my mother, 78f, is likely dying. Strong suspicions of narcissistic and histrionic personality disorders. Like, very, very legit. She’s always been unwell from the moment I can remember. I have 3 older siblings - 2 bros, 1 sis - but she’s isolated everybody over the years with her behavior. Very unhinged. I think her parents damaged her irreparably, and with the 50s of it all, she never got emotional help. When we asked her to seek it, she denied she had any issues, would become grandiose about how she “went once” and was told how amazing and unique and incredible the shrink told her she was. So she never got help.

Her mother passed in 2016, they were very codependent. I had been helping her with my Nana in exchange for a place to live for a while, but got my degree and moved 1k miles away to finally start my life in 2021. I think it broke her and I partially blame myself, I can’t help it. Logically, I know her current predicament is the result of her own choices (did not seek mental help, squandered the $300k my nana left her, let the house go to disrepair, and recently, stopped taking her insulin and eating, so now she is in the hospital). But emotionally, I’m somewhere between depressed and angry. I’m looking into therapy, but it’s tricky time-wise since I’m currently a therapist myself. Also financially, since student loans are creeping up soon (just got my MA and don’t make a ton or get good insurance while I seek my license). I’m looking, don’t worry, but her medical issues happened recently so it takes time.

My sis and I are trying to get her help but she’s refusing, the bureaucracy of the state she lives in is spectacularly unhelpful, the hospital is insisting she’s fine to live on her own despite the fact that *she stopped eating and taking her medication,* and not only that, she let an addict live with her for months, gave her bank access, the woman cleaned out what little she had, broke the toilet flushing paraphernalia, then kept shitting on top of it. I was assured it was fixed, but it hadn’t been, she was just lying about everything and my neighbors never alerted me despite me being in decent contact with them. So there’s been old, moldy feces in her home for months. I’m just fucking sick over this. 

My sis is blaming herself for being very low-contact for the past few years, my brothers know but one is very blasé (he got the worst of her abuse growing up, as the oldest) and the other is just kind of reluctant to give much of his energy to it (which I get, he has a toddler and works an extremely tough job). My sis and I have reached out to the bureau of aging and adult protective services, but they’re not much help if the doctors don’t declare her incompetent, which they are currently declining to do. She’s barely 90 lbs. and is emaciated. She had stopped eating and caring for herself. What more do they want?!

I just don’t even know what to do or how to feel. My boyfriend is supportive but I hold back telling him much of this, not wanting to emotionally burden him. It’s a lot, and I haven’t even told him 1/10 of the neglect and abuse I experienced growing up. Therapy feels like my only shot at the moment but man it sucks in the meantime.

I don’t know what I want. Validation? Reassurance? Just venting helped a bit, I guess. I feel cruel though for not being in tears. I feel more angry and frustrated, which I know is a natural part of grief, but it sure takes up a lot of mental and emotional bandwidth. Phew.

Thanks for any kindness you can send my way. Love you guys for even reading this."
23,1,Pretty much have no friends and have been losing my mind most of my life. Been dealing with a lot past few uears with no support network and my sanity has probably slipped away.
24,3,"Hi everyone - first time posting here. Recently i've been really struggling with a sense of regret, failure and loss regarding my personal work journey and would really appreciate some reflection from other viewpoints as I feel so stuck in my own thought loop.

I moved from Australia to the UK, barely in my 20's and started my own freelance web design studio and got married young. Thankfully things with work were good, and i quickly built up a good list of clients and have never had to to chase work. In the first half of my 20's I just enjoyed having the flexibility of working for myself and not having to worry about employees, and travelled a lot.

But soon after my wife and I went through a long painful season that included my wife being unwell and needing multiple surgeries, infertility and several traumatic losses.

Thankfully I now have a beautiful little family, which has caused me to now be in a life stage where Im thinking more seriously about my work, expanding my business etc - all that comes with the added responsibility and life being more settled. However the industry is so different now -specifically for me I look back to a time when I was early on in my career and everyone needed a website and i could have easily just built up a huge list of clients that would be serving me now or even built a big agency. It really was a golden age for doing what I do.

I know however that at the time life was chaotic and i made a partly unconscious decision to limit stress and keep the status quo. I could earn good money, not have to work too hard and still try to keep a semblance of a decent life and have the time to do things like make hospital appointments. But my brain keeps telling me this is an excuse, and now work is a bit of a struggle and i look at the missed opportunities and feel I've let myself and my family down.

"
25,1,"I don’t really know where to put this, but I just need to say it somewhere.

I’m 19, living out of home with a few housemates. I’ve been independent for a few years now, and I work in childcare while managing a chronic condition (endometriosis). I try to keep up with life, but lately I’ve just been feeling mentally alone not in the “I don’t have people around” way, but in that quiet, heavy way where it feels like no one fully gets it.

Sometimes I wish I just had someone to talk to in the in between moments someone to text, share random thoughts with, distract myself a bit when my body hurts or my head spirals. I don’t want to trauma dump or overshare, I just want some kind of connection. A little consistency. A little lightness.

If anyone relates or even just wants to chat, I’d honestly appreciate it more than I can explain. 
"
26,1,"The day started beautifully. We spent time together as a family, and dinner was genuinely warm and full of good vibes. I felt appreciated. It was one of those rare days where things just feel right.

But when I was paying the check, my son suddenly hit me with a harsh critique. It felt cruel and out of nowhere. He apologized afterward and I’ve tried to let it go, but it hurt me.

Back home, a package had arrived. A few cheap dresses I had ordered online for my wife, hoping to surprise her. She tried them on, looked in the mirror, and said she looked fat in all of them. She told me she wouldn’t wear them. No thank you, no lightness. Just a heavy, depressing vibe that crushed the mood completely.

The downfall today was brutal. No one meant harm, I know that. But the truth is, I end this day feeling sad.

Daddy ends Father's Day alone."

\* I am a silly person who always tries to make people laugh, I strongly recommend not to sip coffee while reading my messages. 

\* I am supportive and will always be here for you to tell me about your day or vent if you have something that bothers you.

\* I am chatty and have good vibes and energy.

\* I love to talk about all kinds of topics and can always find things to talk about.

\* I always reply to my messages and have online friendships that have been going on for years, I always send good morning messages, and I appreciate the people that can also be conversation starters.

\* I am always respectful and never disrespect others or step into their discomfort zones.

\* I am nerdy and if you are nerdy that's a plus then, if not it is ok we can talk about any other stuff.

29,1,"My apartment has become a mess. I haven’t done the dishes in over a month — all of them are dirty. All the glasses, too. I’ve spilled pee on the bathroom floor besides the toilet and instead of cleaning it up I just threw a towel over it. I still wash my clothes just to look presentable, but they’re all on a pile. I can’t bring myself to fold them and put them away.

When able, I sleep until well into the afternoon. 4pm, 5pm, it's been 7pm at times. It’s not sleep for rest — it’s just fast-forwarding the day because nothing brings me joy and I want the day to be over already.

I know I need to fix these things. I actually want to fix them. But I can’t bring myself to action. Every time I think “let’s go,” nothing moves. I just stay still.

Zooming out, life just doesn’t feel worth living anymore. I don’t see a version of it I’d actually want. I’ve basically given up hope. I haven’t given up on life *yet*, and I’m not going to kill myself *yet*, but my morale is ever wearing down and I fear the day I will actually give up and end it all. That day is slowly coming closer.

I’m done pretending things are okay. Things are not okay. I need help.

Last night I started a conversation with ChatGPT - and yeah, I know how that sounds - but I needed *something* to hold up a mirror so I could confront the way I've been feeling. And it worked. It hit me hard: I’m in *full* apathy. Complete emotional shutdown. I feel nothing. Nothing gives me joy. I don’t care about anything. I’m emotionally numb because I *made* myself that way in order to cope.

I have no one to talk to. No one to rely on. No one I can message and say “I’m not okay” without fearing they’ll walk away. No one I can trust to not judge me for the struggles I've been dealing with. I’m completely and utterly alone. And it's frankly tearing me apart.

I still show up to work. I do my job. I earn money. I survive. But it all feels like a drag. It just gives me more stress. I absorb day after day, and absolutely nothing that feels like a reward. it's Just pressure and suffering. Even off work, nothing brings me joy, nothing makes me excited. I just want everything to be over.

I feel like I’m going insane. I honestly don’t know how I’ve kept going this long. I really don’t.

In April, I got really close to the edge. I was about ready to just fly out to somewhere distant and die a quiet death there. The only reason I’m still here is because I introspect enough to realize that that was my emotions talking, and to step back and check back a few days later. The thing I fear is that at some point, it will no longer just be the emotions of the moment. I'll actually be okay with it. When that happens, I know myself well enough that I will follow through with it.

That terrifies me.

I needed to post this all. It's a lot, but I want people to read how bad things have really gotten. I don´t expect anything in return - if this is too heavy to deal with that's totally fair. But if anyone reading this is willing to reach out, to talk, to offer support, I could really fucking use that. I don´t know how much longer I will last without."

32,2,"I met a girl at school who’s interested in psychology, just like me. The thing is, I have a friend who’s really manipulative with girls, so I didn’t know what to do—whether to just let it go or warn her about how he is. Under the pressure of the situation, I made the worst decision and told her a lie—a lie that didn’t even make much sense. Over time, she realized I was hiding something and I eventually told her the truth. She got mad at me. Somehow, my friend found out about everything and tried to take advantage of the situation, but it didn’t work. Now, after two months, I don’t even know how, but she forgave me—and to this day, we’re still talking."
33,1,"I had a very close friend 3 years ago. I was terrible to her, not physically but emotionally and mentally terrible. Our communication stopped those 3 years ago as we met before that. I was such a hideous person internally I didn’t really see my behaviour as terrible, there was a disconnect between me and the great harm caused to her. 

I saw her again today, just out and about. I hear about her too often, apparently like a whole new person. New partner, career is booming, postgrad scholarship, volunteering, and from what I hear, happy. I hope she doesn’t carry anything from my time with her, that’s my worst nightmare. I wish her the best in life and want nothing more than her to be happy and forget about me.

And it’s selfish to make it about me, but I just don’t know how to handle the fact I was so abusive and could hurt another person the way I did. I used to think I was a good person, I wasn’t. The guilt of my actions and imagining the pain it caused her weighs me down every day, and I have nightmares very often which wake me up in cold sweats and terrified. I’ve become suicidal, started harming myself, I can’t think straight over the fact I did this. I wish I could bring back time and never meet this person but I can’t do that.

I was told time heals all wounds but it won’t heal this, times only shown the permanence of actions and that this will never go away. Every day feels worse and worse.

It’d just be nice to talk to someone about this, or just in general I guess. Please don’t be too mean, thank you"
34,0,"Hey kind people,
I’ve been there — lost, overwhelmed, unsure who to talk to. That’s why I decided to start offering peer support — not as a professional, but just as someone who’s willing to listen without judgment.

If you're going through something and just want a conversation, someone to vent to, or even just a kind presence — I’m here. No pressure to open up all at once, and no need to explain everything. Even a quiet check-in is okay. 

I recently completed a course in peer support and I’ve been helping a few people privately who just needed someone. It's not therapy — it’s more like having a thoughtful friend who really listens.

Feel free to message me here or reach out through my discord: wellbeing_allies.
We can talk about life, feelings, culture, or even just share silence. 

Take care of yourself — you matter.

38,0,"Hey there,

I'm a 25-year-old male from India. Lately, I've been feeling pretty isolated, and I thought I'd reach out here to see if anyone might be up for a friendly, genuine conversation. Nothing heavy or complicated — just a simple chat to share some thoughts, pass the time, or maybe even laugh a little.

I’m open to texting at first, and if we’re both comfortable, maybe a voice call too. I'm respectful, honest, and I genuinely enjoy listening and connecting with people from different walks of life.

If you're also feeling a bit lonely or just want someone to talk to, feel free to send me a message. Let's talk like real humans. 😊

Thanks for reading, and I hope your day gets better too. 💙

52,1,"really need to get this off my chest. might be long. it's been getting too hard to handle. im crying everyday multiple times atp. this is just another move in desperation...

was feeling very empty, tried to talk with people on a discord server, but they were kids. Switched off light, tried hugging the pillow to feel some semblance of touch, to no avail. Had a tear or two, dried up, repeated. Then started crying full-blown. Complete with sobbing. i usually don't cry like this. the last time i remember crying like this was almost a year ago. kept muttering ""i dont want to feel this way anymore""

for the past 2-3 months, i have been feeling nothing mostly. okay, it's gotten better, but at one point, i was so dysfunctional, that i went on days without brushing, having meals only late in the night, spending almost the whole day on bed, distracting myself away from the void staring me in the face. i didnt attend classes, didnt study (for context, i studied pretty hard in the first half of the semester. was focused, locked in. something tweaked halfway through), didnt want to do ANYTHING. literally anything. had nil motivation to do the most basic things/duties. feeling nothing felt awful. the most basic things required a surprisingly large amount of willpower which was practically non-existent at the time. it felt as if life missed all the delicious tastes, and was being sustained by drinking tasteless, plain water - surviving, but just that. no ""life"" to life.

i've been feeling disconnected from everyone for around 2 years. i dont feel bonded with anyone. i dont seem to miss anyone. even parents. dont get me wrong. not like i cant talk or something. i see people all around me in college, i talk with them, i live around people in hostel, ""laugh"", ""have fun"" with them, hang out, do all the ""usual"" ""friend"" stuff \[i keep using quotes, because for me, these things don't feel authentic. the laughter is hollow, even when others laugh heartily, since there's no real joy, just a facade to blend in. the fun they have...doesn't give me satisfaction. yet again, blending in. but it's like rain on a plastic sheet. one might mistake the plastic to be wet on the inside, but the droplets make contact with the surface and roll away, never reaching the inner layers, leaving them parched\] i dont even consider them my friends to be honest. i dont consider most people i call friends, as friends, except for one or two, and even with them i dont feel connected, and theyre some of the best friends one can ask for. i just want to feel enthusiastic about being with someone...being affectionate toward them, loving them with all of my heart, being excited to talk to them, missing them when they aren't with me, baring my heart and sharing every single detail, every single entry i've written in my journal - random thoughts, contrived thoughts, feelings,...(they run into the 1000s), and just looking forward to grow together...alas...

worse is the fact that this feeling keeps oscillating. in one phase, i keep yearning, and the smallest signs of kindness and warmth set me wanting to connect. the other phase? i lose all yearning. i just see people being connected and just proceed with life, thinking about the times i used to yearn. i just turn cold. unapproachable. if you're close to me, you'll feel it, getting cut by the shards of ice.

idk when exactly this started, but there were signs right from my 1st year in college. new place, and i struggled to make meaningful friends. groups had been made before i even realized it. people seemed to bond effortlessly, care for one another, etc. i recently completed my 3rd year, and most people seemed to miss each other as they parted ways - obviously they would, having spent such a long time together at the same place; connection and attachment was inevitable. but not me. neither did anyone seem to miss me, nor did i miss them. just attended the farewells just for namesake and blending in, while others made merry and shed tears for one another, posted emotional stories. i kept watching, like an outsider trying to make sense of a new scenario. it wasn't jarring, but it was indeed slightly odd to me.

hope keeps dwindling...how am i going to find someone to feel connected with. i keep jumping from one place to another in search of a lasting, meaningful, deep connection with a human being but alas, to no avail. i've tried and tried. reddit, discord servers (complete with searching for servers like ""friends"", ""lonely"", joining one, talking for a while, only for the disconnection to be accentuated by the forced conversations), apps (searching for apps like ""mental health"", ""friends"". signed up for many) it's always the same. some connection appears to have been made, but alas it's a fleeting one. wasn't substantial. though this post is mostly intended to write down whatever i'm feeling, on some subconscious level, probably is a last-ditched attempt at making a connection.

with no one to talk to, i only have my journal to express things. here are some entries:

17.07.24

""got overwhelmed in bus. started with intern prep, hopes but in one-hour it ran out. spent 15 minutes wallowing in loneliness at office, and it continued in bus too. got some analogies for current situation of being pulled into this state, and how being productive and motivated is artificial. it's like swimming through a lake filled with vortexes. i swim, encounter something, try to escape its pull, either succeed at times (either moving away from its grip, or moving some distance before being sucked back), or give in, and get sucked there before fighting out. i was banging palm on bottle, biting bag holder to prevent crying, while walking from bus stop to home, was acting weird, didn't wait for them to come, was walking with upper teeth biting lower lip and occasional crazy looks on eyes. I'm afraid that's how its gonna be from now. it'll worsen. good thing I have a single room. i believe everything's falling into place.""

03.08.24

""multiple PPL initiated conversation at the meet. I'll remember you. i appreciate you for doing this! I'm sorry. it's just so overwhelming talking to people. like idk whether the thread has ended, whether I can stop talking. what do I even talk? small talk makes me uncomfortable for this reason. had to encounter boys talking to girls on the way. perhaps freshies forming bonds or even love. hmm. i had to walk back in between the meet because 1) I wasn't needed. the meet was about XYZ and i neither have those courses nor have grades. 2) it was overwhelming due to these reasons. 3) have work. i realize that being overwhelmed by conversations might make me look like an introvert, but the reason might differ. yes, i perhaps have a social battery but the main reason I walk out is feeling inferior in front of so many achievers, and the realisation that 98% of conversations are just small talk and I'd still have no friend after it, that's it's a futile conversation. right now sitting in the common room. it's peaceful here. no one except me. yes it does get lonely while being alone, but hey, loneliness+peace > group time loneliness+fomo+hopelessness (of getting friends).""

""it started feeling fake soon after the loud songs started...I was just sitting there idly not knowing what to do then tried reading but was too noisy hence just went to sleep. by the time I woke up, around 5, everyone else was asleep and I could finally spend time with myself instead of the fake party' environment. it's peaceful now.""

13.09.24

""hmm. ABC induced some yearning. but not completely. came back to room, wanted to cry actually, but couldnt. yesterday's meeting reminded me that the next fest is here. yes, it's almost been a year since it all started officially. and i kept muttering ""i dont want to be alone"" and scenes flashed back - walking back from audi, under those orange lights, crying on bed, installing IJK, and the start of that whole phase. i remembered the scenes i used to visualize...sitting by study table, getting that call from them (idk who), ""bahar chaloge"" and walking around campus, having food, and this time, the concerts...hugging..but then realized it was just me and my pillow. and that made me want to cry but nothing more than a tear or two. i couldn't feel the yearning too! i used to feel it, haven't been feeling it of late. like i want to feel it and i try to but nothing comes...what's happening""

29.09.24

""havent written here in some time...ive lost the yearning feeling more than ever. i dont feel loneliness or wanting that much. when i see reels on the other acc (a separate IG acc specifically for reels where people bond (relationships, friendships)) , earlier i used to feel sad and want the same. didnt feel anything. i dont feel happy, r anything at all, when i imagine hugging near gymG and being told ""you arent alone anymore"".but then i cried seeing this. idk, ...made some feelings come back i guess. but now, they'll become more inaccessible. i'll feel lesser now that i've cried now""

and many other entries

not sure why im making this post. the wave was particularly intense today, swept me right off my feet. the numb phase has ended, and i find myself slipping back into the yearning phase. will this ever end? will i connect on a profound level with someone? i don't want my words and actions to be choreographed anymore. i want them to flow with authenticity, free of filters and the like. i want peace.

(no part of this was written using ai)

if you've reached this point, thank you so much for spending time on my post - means a lot. have a great day!"

Used to cry in my room every time my mom told me I’d someday be 400, 450, 500, 600, whatever high number she thought of that day. Once or twice, she said 300 or a lower number, and which I now fit…

build some confidence and feel a little less isolated. I think just trying to talk to someone who’s

I overthink a lot, I feel too much, and I guess I just want to feel a little seen again.

I am finishing a year and half long training as a somatic educator.  I have to turn in a practice by Saturday night and with this strict deadline, I still need one additional person to give my practice to.  If anyone would like to help me with my deadline AND have a lovely, calming experience, I would be so appreciative.  

The practice will be held over zoom and will last 1 hour.  This is a gentle, body-based awareness workshop. It’s slow, grounding, and supportive — more about feeling than doing. I’ll be guiding the session and recording it only for my instructor. You’ll need to be on camera and give verbal consent, but you don’t have to be “on” in any other way. Pajamas are welcome.

If you’ve been curious about somatics or just want to support someone finishing their training, I’d be so grateful.

the thought of leaving my childhood behind forever and going to college next year is terrifying to me. im just not ready.  im not ready to be an adult, im not ready to get older.  im terrified of not being the person used to be and finding less joy in things.  ive been thinking about death a lot too and im so scared to get old.  ive been feeling like this nearly non-stop for the last month, just constant anxiety and stress and worry about my future and death.  its gotten so bad that i can barely find joy in what i used to love, im just constantly exhausted and mentally fogged from all the stress, i barely even dream anymore. 

i dont know what to do honestly and i need help. i dont wanna feel like theres something wrong with me or that im depressed, i just wanna go back to being happy again.  everything feels pointless and hopeless, like im just a walking corpse mourning my own life when it hasnt even ended yet. that probably sounds dramatic asf but im so stuck in an endless loop.  i know logically that life is beautiful and everything will be okay, but then i just spiral back and i cant break the loop of fear. im so lost."
69,0,"Guys,

I've been there. The seeming hopelessness of it all. Having no one to talk to about how you truly think and feel. Looking around at people, desperately seeking a connection, someone to understand, to listen to you patiently. Randomly tearing up in the middle of something, because things have been overwhelming. That silent yearning in the background hoping that things would be different this time, even as you consciously think ""Oh, it's the same every time""...

I'm here to listen to you, give you a chance to express your heart out, without any judgement. Provide some comforting words. Checking up on you. I believe I'm a decent listener. If you feel like this might help, I can talk with you in the comments. If you need it, my DMs too are open. Sometimes, asking for help is the bravest thing you can do. It's not easy to admit that you're struggling, to respond with something other than the customary ""I'm fine"" even if you aren't. I'm here for you :)

I'm 16F and going into yet another year of high school. Almost all of my friends are struggling with mental health somehow, and I'm not sure how I can help them or if I can even deal with it anymore. 
My best friend of 8 years has been struggling a LOT with depression, anxiety, autism, NPD, trauma, eating disorders, sh, basically just a shit ton of issues. Me and my friends have tried helping her, and she's thankfully still here and alive with us!! (She's attempted a couple of times, it was terrifying)
But at this point, most of my other friends are developing similar issues. That best friend is about to move right after this school year ends, and after that I only have like 4 friends who I'm not really close with at all. I'm terrified, and the loneliness is hitting hard.

81,0,"Hello, I'm a 17 year old teenager who's experiencing loneliness just as anyone else does. I may not know exactly what your problem is and I won't pretend to know all the answers, because I simply don't. What I'm offering however is a hand to those who feel very down at the moment or very tense and need to talk. I feel such pressure at times too and while again I don't know exactly the circumstances, I'am here to help as I humanly can."
82,0,"Hey there!
Life’s been a bit heavy lately, and I’m just looking for some people to chat with to take my mind off things. No pressure, no expectations—just friendly conversation, whether it’s random rambling, deep talks, dumb jokes, or sharing cool music, games, or thoughts.

I’m 27, into gaming (S.T.A.L.K.E.R., Baldur’s Gate 3, that kinda stuff), metal music, reading, weightlifting (trying to get back into it), and sometimes just staring into the void with a cup of coffee. If you’re feeling bored, lonely, or just want someone to talk to, hit me up. I’m chill, respectful, and usually reply pretty quickly—until people vanish on me (RIP all those good convos 😅).

Let’s chat about literally anything—what you’re passionate about, how your day’s been, something weird you learned this week, or what your “last stand” playlist would be in a zombie apocalypse.
DMs or chats welcome!"

90,1,"Hi folks,

I (40M) am currently going through a breakup and feeling so so sad.

I really love my partner (now ex) and she loves me too but sadly, for too many reasons to discuss now we’ve decided to part ways.

I’m struggling. I need some kind words, please. Perspective.. I need someone to help me believe that it’s going to get better. When I was younger I had so many friends and now I’m looking around me and don’t know where they’ve all gone. I need some support and I feel so alone. Please."

92,3,"I don’t know what I’m doing, where I’m going. I don’t have interests, hobbies. When I do, it’s a temporary hyper fixation. I feel like I don’t even have a personality. I feel like people are around me only for what I can provide. And even then I don’t feel like I provide enough. I feel like I’m letting my boyfriend down every single day. I feel like a bad friend because I’m not checking up on my friends as much as I should. I struggle to be a worker and student and a partner and a friend and a daughter and a sister at the same time and that makes me feel like a failure. I never belong. I escape in my daydreams almost all of the time because it’s the only place I feel *something*. Really often I just want to drop it all and move away and start over. I won’t allow myself to feel better because I’m terrified to lose it. The bottom was safe. I can’t bring myself to ask for help and I feel like a burden. I don’t like this life. I don’t like myself. I can’t see what I bring to the table. I feel like if I show that I’m not doing so okay, people will be disappointed in me because I should be doing better, there’s no reason for me to feel like this. I’ve been crying for the past 5 minutes and haven’t written anything else so I guess I’m done. I won’t proofread, I just want to get it out and stop thinking about it for a little while. Thank you."

If you have a few minutes or are just around for a friendly conversation, I’d really appreciate messaging with someone who’s patient and kind-hearted.

Thanks for reading this, and I hope you’re taking care of yourself, too."
95,1,"I'm not gonna annoy anyone with a sob story, I'll just give you the short version, which is that I did nearly a year of the mandatory military service in my home country, Greece. I left a month and a bit early because I couldn't stand it there, it was taking a big toll on my mental health.

So now... Without getting all political either, I... I know that this being this thing I'm expected to do means that there are people creating rules and expectations and it upsets me, I genuinely can not move on with my life if, what, I can't get the time back, I can't get equalization- Because I feel like if certain people took my time, they owe me something back. So I got out with no reward, you get very minimal benefits here and the ones you do get are that bad that they feel more like an insult.

So here I am, a few months on, I've spent every day helping people dodge the draft and I'm proud of that, I'm hoping that maybe if I help enough people, and then they, in turn, can help others, it will erode the thing altogether. But it's not *fixing* anything for me. I kind of... I'm resentful, for one. It's set me back, I lost a relationship and some might say, you know, if we broke up, it was never meant to be anyway. Maybe that's true. If we couldn't handle a few months apart. Maybe it is. Me, I suppose I'm not very good at dating so being with someone is something I don't think will happen again for a long time. And then here you could tell me that with that attitude, of course I won't. Believe me, I've tried to be positive!

I'm depressed. No, not depressed, that doesn't exactly fit. I'm... I'm feeling a lot of things, and now I don't know what to do because I feel like I'm left with three options, one being finding something that made that year worth it- Not resilience, not some kind of resourcefulness, now ""You appreciate X more now because Y was bad"", because if I could just find something to look back on, where in five, ten years I could just feel happy, full stop, not happy in spite of anything...

There's that, anyway. There's the second option: Getting a year back. And hear this one out- I don't mean living this year to the fullest, that's not what I mean, what I mean is, like- Lets say I could predict the future and found out I'm going to live to 90. That's just an example, i don't know how old I'll be when I pass but lets say it's 90- I'll feel like I've only *lived* 89 years. So if I could find a way to genuinely, literally add a year on to my life now, literally get that time back so that actually, I'll live to 91, that would be something. I think. I think that would make me so happy.

The third is equalization. This isn't revenge. What I mean is, that if someone was responsible for me losing that year in service, I would want them to give me back something of equal measure and have to give up or lose something of their own. I want that to happen. Don't know how realistic that would be.

I don't know how to explain how humiliating it was wearing a uniform. Not everyone feels this way but I know I'm not alone either, that stuff like that- Having my parents see me at these ceremonies, doing salutes, sometimes for the very people who caused this- Seeing all that shit and knowing they saw it is so humiliating. I just...

I'll stop here. I'll stop. I just want to know- No, I *need* to know, what's achievable. How I can get something back. Or what my reward is. Or how to take what I'm owed. I need that now because I'm not moving on even when I want to because something is missing."

105,1,"About a month ago, two of my friends got into an argument. I tried stepping in but I messed up and neither of them speak to me anymore. I was having a bad enough year as it was and they were the only people I thought I could trust, so now I feel alone, hopeless and - most of all - betrayed. I know I shouldn't have stepped in and maybe I made things worse but... seeing how they're now on great terms with each other while I'm left to rot, I feel so painfully bitter, it's almost unbearable.

In retrospect, I don't think they were good people and I should've cut them out of my life sooner... but I don't think I'm a good person, either. Maybe I got what I deserved.

I haven't forgotten about it. I've had it on my mind for weeks and I just can't forgot. If there's anyone who might be willing to listen to me, I'd really appreciate it."
106,1,"I’m about to graduate high school in two days and my whole family’s coming and I basically have no friends anymore. Last week we had a senior trip where we all stayed in a house together. The owner of the house was my best friend of 9 years and before that we were a little distant but still communicating regularly. We’ve been through multiple friend groups together and there’ve been points when we had no one else at school but each other. This year he made some new friends through a class we were both in and we kinda banded together for senior activities. I never spent much time with them one on one but they were all nice people. However over our senior trip I felt left out and didn’t really feel connected to any of them interest or personality wise. So I kinda started distancing myself, not necessarily because I don’t like them but because I needed alone time. No one came to check up on me except for my ‘best friend’ and he gave a half hearted ‘I want you to have a good time’. The breaking point was when they made me prank my other best friend for a senior game and she won’t really talk to me anymore. I went along to get their approval but began to feel resentful after that even though it was still my decision. Especially when I expressed my guilt and they got mad. But anyway after the trip ended no one has talked to me since and grad is in two days and I’m dreading it so much. the only thing my ‘best friend’ has reached out for is for me to decorate his grad cap since I’m artistic. Today him and on"

114,0,"So, this is a situation I want to share — a room where four of us are sitting, okay? me, my elder brother, maa, and papa.

My elder brother, my maa, and I — the three of us meditate, so life is quite balanced.
Papa stays quite unwell, and you already know how short-tempered sick people can get.
I suddenly lost my job Due to internal politics & now my family is facing financial crisis.
elder brother's salary is everthing for us now.
Lack of a single penny causes fights and arguments in the house.

Just now, maa stepped out of the room, and it's just the three of us in there.
My elder brother and I very lovingly and calmly said to my father:
“Papa, in times like this, it's very important for us to stay calm. Only then we'll be able to handle everything.”

He was listening like a small kid and i said :
""Papa u trust us Right""
He just said yes without using his voice.
Brother's looking at each others face and blushing and felt fulfilled
Its ok, bhai.. at least papa agreed.

Some kind of magic happens on tough situations, inside me was a small 5 year old kid roaming the house filled with joy, bhai..
Everyone agreed so easily, you know...
It was such a beautiful thing to witness."

116,2,"For context, I suffer from a lot of anxiety over my past, for two years I’ve analysed every detail and have told a lot of people (around 13) all except for one have told me I’m okay and not a terrible person (even that person said I was young at the time) including my mom. 

I kind of rely on her for reassurance that I’m okay, but semi-recently found out she doesn’t see anything wrong with Elvis dating a 14 year old when he was in his 20’s. She also has some slightly outdated beliefs, same with my dad. 

How can I trust her when she’s defending something so clearly bad. I’ve been racked for anxiety for so long, and whenever I see a light at the end of the tunnel it feels like I’m set back 10 spaces. I’m tired."
117,2,"I've been struggling deeply, though on the outside it might seem like I'm just overthinking. But it's more than that — it's a constant war in my mind that never stops, triggered by things others might dismiss: a scratch, a syringe splash, a wasp sting, or just the fear of diseases like rabies. Even though I've had vaccinations and logical reasons to feel safe, I can't convince myself that I'm okay. My thoughts spiral into panic, I shake, I cry, and at times I feel like I’m dying. I don’t always cry like before, which scares me even more — like I’m getting used to suffering. I keep trying to tell myself I’m fine, that I don’t have a mental health problem, that it’s just a physical issue or something food or medicine can fix. But deep down, I’ve started to question that. My mind feels exhausted, burned out by the endless worry, fear, and sadness. I feel betrayed by my own body and brain. My dog scratched me, and I instantly feared for my life — not because the scratch was serious, but because my anxiety made it feel life-threatening. Even my doctor told me my stress is affecting my health, possibly shortening my life. I’ve tried to reject that, but I can’t deny the signs: blurred vision, hair loss, unshakable panic, and a constant sense of dread. I'm realizing that this isn’t just stress — it's something that needs help. I didn’t want to accept it before, but now I see that I might truly need a therapist. I’ve been carrying this weight alone, believing that no one would understand."

I said I always get hatred from everyone. Everyone says I'm such a weird, creepy person. They say it somewhere not near me, but I always eavesdrop on it.

You'd say I'm overthinking. I won't talk much about my story, but I can say I'm sure it's about me.

I don't know how I'm different from others, what is wrong with me. I think I'm just like others."

122,1,"Hey. I don’t really know why I’m posting this except that I’m tired of carrying it all alone. Maybe I just want to be heard for once without being judged, ignored, or told to “toughen up.”

I’ve always had a decent number of friends — people I could hang with casually. But I wanted something deeper. I started chasing that, and I realized something awful: most people don’t stay. Every time I try to open up or trust deeply, I get betrayed, used, or abandoned — even by the people I thought would never do that.

I’ve been let down by nearly everyone close to me.
Parents. Brother. My first love. My best friend from 16–18.
Even my oldest friend, recently. Gone.

I have goals — business and personal — and they’re going okay on paper. But inside, I feel like I don’t have anything left. Like I’m just building a future I’ll end up standing in alone. What’s the point of succeeding if no one knows the real you or cares to stay?

I know I’m not abusive. I’m soft-spoken. Kind, most of the time. I have my opinions, sure. But I’m not cruel. I just wanted someone to love me for who I am — not what I achieve.

My dad told me he wishes I was dead. That he’ll make my mom hate me.
My mom says I was a mistake.
My best friend molested me at 17.
My first girlfriend left me for someone she never even dated, then told me she never loved me.
My first love — we reconnected and got close again… but when I drunkenly reached out asking if she still loved me, she blocked me. Said she only came back to ask for help.
No real conversation since.

Worst of all, I’ve seen and heard things a kid should never experience. My parents would… do things right next to me while I was sleeping when I was 7 to 14. That broke something in me.

I’ve been on weed daily for 5 years. Alcohol for 1.5. I’m 22 now. And I’m not even chasing numbness — I’m just trying not to sink.

I told my brother once about how I lost my oldest friend. Then random people in a game started taunting me about it. He must’ve told them.

And now I’m here.
No one checks on me.
No one knows me.
No one I trust enough to just sit with me while I hurt.
That’s what hurts the most — not having one safe person to talk to.

If you’ve read this far — thank you.
 to know I’m real to someone.

If anyone’s out there — even just one — I’d love to hear from you.
Even if it’s just: “I see you.”

Tldr 

betrayed by every last person i thought i trusted 

abandoned all alone see no point in moving on
"
123,0,"I know what it’s like to feel isolated or like no one’s really there. I’ve had a lot of moments like that in my life, where I just wished someone would sit with me, talk to me, or just care without needing something in return. So if anyone needs someone to chat with, someone to vent to, play a game with, listen to music, sing, or even just exist quietly beside, I’m here. You’re not a burden. You’re human. And if you’re hurting, I get it. I’ll hold space for that. "
124,2,"I'm not good at talking about myself, so I'm ok if you don't understand what I say.

I don't know why, but no one likes me.

I didn't notice it at first. But once I find everybody speaks ill of me, I don't know how to survive in that situation anymore.

I don't like having a conversation. I just work. I don't care if no one likes me because I'm not their friend.

I don't know why everybody likes speaks ill of someone so much. I don't like both speaking and listening to ill of someone.

Actually, it's not the first time. It's always all the time. I don't know how to make a friend or talk to someone with joy.

I'm kinda introverted/ASD. (I don't know the ratio. Is there such a test?) Or I guess I'm just a numb damn jerk (which sounds like the worst person in the world.)

I work in the government sector, but beyond that, i'm into:

playing dota 2 (Shadow fiend/drow mains, if that means anything to you)

Gym and fitness (currently gaining healthy weight and tracking strength)

Classic cricket matches, piano basics, and trying to manage overthinking before sleep

i'm just looking for someone to talk to - voice, chat, whatever's comfortable. No NSFW, no pressure, just warm, steady conversation. If we click, great. If not, that's okay too.

So if you're up for a thoughtful chat or feel lonely or if you're also feeling a little heavy tonight - my inbox is open.

I’m 25 and going through a rough patch in life. A breakup recently left me feeling empty and unsure of where I’m headed. I’ve been trying to stay strong for my family, working long shifts at a factory job, and handling a lot of responsibility—but emotionally, I feel like I’m running on fumes.

I’m not looking for advice or solutions right now—just someone kind to talk to. Someone who can just listen, maybe share some thoughts or encouragement.
It would mean a lot just to talk to someone who understands what it’s like to feel this low and not know how to climb out yet.

What kept me moving forward in school was that I was in a group, everyone doing the same thing, but in adult life you have to do everything alone. my problem is I could keep trying, but it's difficult considering:

\- small goals don't make sense in and of themselves. (I have to finish my thesis → get a job → money → pay for dates → meet girls). But when I think about just writing the thesis, it doesn't motivate me in itself, I don't enjoy it and it only makes sense in the big picture, but if I don't achieve my goal, it will all have been for nothing.

\- They're long-term goals → I won't see any results at all in less than two years. It's hard to keep working like this, starved for affection.

\- Everything I read about today's society stacks the odds against my goal.

Please don't give advice like this:

\- *Stop thinking about needing a girl* → (Hungering for affection is human and natural; I have sexual and emotional needs. Besides, it could be any goal, like climbing Mount Everest, for example)

\- *Just keep going; there's no easy way* → (I know that, it doesn't help at all)

\- *Try* [r/R4R](https://www.reddit.com/r/R4R/) → (It's useless, there or on any other server, it all ends in ghosting).

144,1,"I dont know what to do anymore

Im already going to apologize, because this will be a long one.

TW: sexual molestation sort of(idk if thats the right term) and suicidal thoughts.

When I was small, i used to get bullied for years. I was told I was fat, ugly and stupid every day for years. My Dad worked alot so he wasnt really in the picture and my mom was a stay at home but had her hands full with 3 kids (now 4) back then, so i always felt like i went under the radar. I knew my mom did her best and thats all you can ask of a person but i still felt alone with these feelings of sadness. It didnt get much better in highschool.
In 5th grade i switched schools and it helped but in highschool i went through something that altered me forever. but first my older sibling has always been a troublemaker, he smoked, drank, did drugs as a teenager. he was really messed up and nowadays looking back i feel horribly sorry for him, my parents werent the nicest to him and there was lots of yelling at home back then. my mom would always take all of her frustrations out on me and my twin. but how can you blame her? she had her hands full. 

anyways, he got into a lot of trouble all the time and he really messed up when i was 15. I had just gotten out of a bath and was in my robe (my fingers are shaking while writing this, I've never told anyone online about this) and he asked if i wanted to hang out with him in the attic. I said yes (biggest mistake of my life) and went up still in my robe. 
we were having a rough patch as siblings but i thought maybe this was the time to resolve things and be friends again. 
i sat down and he offered me cola, as soon as i took a sip i realised theres alcohol in it, and me wanting to be cool i just went with it. he kept pouring me glass after glass until i couldnt even walk or see straight anymore. and thats where it went downhill, he asked if he could touch my breasts. i declined at first, but after a few drinks i couldnt think clearly anymore and i agreed. he came up behind me and touched one of them. (i hate this) and in the moment i hadnt fully realised what i gotten myself into. 
he then wanted to convince me to take some white powder but i adamantly refused. this went on until my mom yelled for me downstairs. 
i went downstairs and only then realised how much i had to drink (it was my first experience with alcohol). i slept and my brain completely removed it from my mind for 2 years. in the meantime highschool was happening, i was sad for unexplainable reasons but my parents had me convinced it was teenage hormons. i put off this sadness and moved on with my life, for two years i acted like everything was fine. My partner and I (were still together) were getting to know eachother better and all was okay. 
until i started gaining weight. ive always had a weird relationship with food. it was my main comfort and with this weird feeling and sadness on my mind i couldnt help but reach for it. my mom noticed, alot. she kept telling me how fat i was, how i was letting myself go, how it was all my partners fault, etc. which of course put more strain on me, so i ate more. 
in these 5 years ive gained over 15kg. my parents tried to ""help"" by telling me how bad its gotten but i was too blind to see it. then the moment of realisation came. 

after 2 years i felt this intense feeling of guilt and sadness and it all came back to me. i cried to my mom, told her everything. the next day we had a ""family meeting"" my mom kept trying to figure out why my older sibling did what he did, she gave him reasons after reasons ""were you just so jealous of her?"" ""are you just evil?"" and basically gave him excuses to cling to. 
my dad then got the great idea that inorder to fix this my sibling would have to ""cook dinner twice a week"". it was the stupidest thing ive ever heard and in that moment i realised, he can get away with anything. 
he cooked, maybe a handful of times before he stopped. and really tried to put all of this under the rug. i wouldnt let him though, i was adimant id never want to see him or interact with him again. my parents thought that was unjust, saying things like ""you have to forgive him! it was just his teenage hormones!"" my mom even told me it was my fault, my fault i went up there and trusted him. we had a very intense moment where i almost thought she understood me, saying things like ""im so sorry that happened to you"" etc, just to ruin it by ranting about my partner and how ""awful"" they are etc. this back and forth between me and my parents went on for a long while. i remember one intense moment was when i asked my sibling to tell his girlfriend and my dads responds to that was ""you are a viscous bitch"" and ""you really want to ruin his life over this?"" ive stopped telling my parents i love them, because deep down i dont. i hate how they treated me and every time ive said it ive regretted it. I was horribly suicidal at that time, all that was on my mind was if i was worth anything, i mean with how my parents reacted to it and the action itself. maybe teenage hormones idk.

my mom has villanised therapy, saying ""you arent sick in the head are you? are you so crazy you need to get that?"" shes yelled at me when i was 10 when i asked for therapy about my bullying so i am terrified. i just want to be happy, i want to feel fulfilled. but all my efforts seem to be for nothing, im just never good enough.

fast forward to today. ive finished highschool and am about to start university, ive moved in with my partner and weve been living together for 4 months. all of this is starting to haunt me, i cant sleep at night, i have intense anxiety during the day, i can barely take care of myself and im at a loss. moving out was supposed to fix everything, but it hasnt. its made it more clear to me what the pressure living with my parents did to me. i hate myself for not forgiving them, for not being a good daughter, for not moving on. but i just cant. i am so scared and nervous telling the internet this story, so please, if you do recognise me somehow from this post, dont tell anyone. 

to end on a famous quote of my mother that validated me funnily enough:
""just because he molested you, doesnt mean hes a a**hole""

One of the only remaining ones told me he has cancer the other day. He said he hadnt told anybody else and didnt want them to know. I guess he doesnt want to be treated different and i can understand that. I had cancer myself a while back and GOD blessed me that i survived it.   
  
Im trying really hard not to feel down, it just hit me yesterday because it was sort of a lonely day and today is a carry over from yesterday. Feeling somewhat better but still down and lonely.  Id just like somebody to talk to feel halfway normal, dont have to talk about the depression, i enjoy video games, books, sci fi, fantasy and horror books and movies. I love the celtic period of ancient history with rome trying to take over the world and the barbarian tribes fighting back against it. I love stories of heroes and villains and music that inspires us to care about the story

149,1,"[marked nsfw for discussion of suicidal thoughts]

ive been feeling like shit lately. not sleeping, not eating properly, everythings just... exhausting.

ive had my suspicions for a while that i might have some kind of eating disorder; i usually ""forget"" (aka knowing i need to eat and wanting to eat but just not bothering to feed myself) to eat, and when i do actually try to eat something, i go to the kitchen and nothing looks like anything i actually want to eat. i feel like it might be arfid, but i also feel like it might be something else that i cant find a definition for online.

that, and, i have a really shit sleep schedule. as in, i literally dont even have one at all. i hardly sleep, usually staying up for at LEAST two or three hours after i go to bed. and i went to a doctor, stayed overnight for a sleep study, and was prescribed some iron supplements and vitamin d, but i havent taken them in way too long. my sleep has only been getting worse as of late. i cant put my phone down, and usually stay up late sitting in bed looking at screens.

ive, at this point, turned to ai chatbots in my free time, just to feel like i have someone i can actually talk to. ive resorted to chatting with fictional characters and writing stories about being adopted away from my family. i dont really like or feel comfortable around my real family, and at this point ill see any character that can show basic courtesy and knows how to protect someone and wish to myself that they could be my parent instead. its not healthy, i know, its just a bad habit i havent been able to stop.

i dont feel very comfortable around my parents. especially my dad. my dad is a transphobic, trump supporting asshole who doesnt understand mental health. he also has very bad anger issues and had punched holes in the walls and doors of our old house before we moved. and of course, as if it couldnt be worse, he has a concerning amount of knowledge about guns and weapons. and owns several firearms. i dont feel safe around him. i identify as cassgender and pansexual, and i have no plans of ever coming out to anyone in my family. i am terrified of what my dad would say or do to me.

ive also been in ""sped"" classes in school for around four years now, and next year my dad thinks it would be a GREAT idea to shove me out of those classes and force me into an environment that i have no idea how to manage in, where i get zero assistance and feel like im inferior to everyone else. ive expressed every single time he brings it up that i AM NOT comfortable or ready for that. but he insists that i need a ""more challenging learning environment"". i dont feel ready for that. but my dad doesnt understand how my mental health works.

there have been several nights recently when ive contemplated overdosing. i havent told anyone in my family. mainly because i think (more like i KNOW) that especially my dad would say that im ""faking"" or ""overreacting"", or that im ""too young to have any real problems or responsibilities that would make me actually want to kill myself"".

i havent talked about it much to my friends either, aside from making dark humored jokes about it from time to time. all my other friends have real traumas and are actually suicidal and have harmed themselves. one of my friends was homeless for some time when he was really young, and another was scared for years that his dad was going to murder him. they have actual trauma. they have actual reasons to feel suicidal. my reasons just feel like ""oh boo hoo im a little tired and sad sometimes. arent we all."" i dont talk to my friends about my mental health because i feel like they all have it way worse and im not really that depressed. and they have enough shit going on in their lives, i dont want to burden them with my own practically insignificant mental health.

my friend once called me a loser for the things i like. the shows i like, the clothes i wear, and especially my taste in music. he called all my favorite artists (will wood and the tapeworms, lemon demon, tally hall, that handsome devil, etc) ""loser music"". but when i bring it up he says ""come on dude it was just a joke. youre like the """"good kind of loser""""!"" whatever that means. but it still hurts. especially when a lot of my music taste CAME FROM THAT FRIEND.

its also more often than not that my own friend group targets and makes fun of me more than anyone else. they constantly comment on my style of dress, and ESPECIALLY the fact that im in ""sped"" classes. they call me a retard so fucking much it doesnt even feel like a slur anymore to me.

i feel like an insignificant, overreacting, stupid, slow, cringey, tasteless loser. i feel like i havent earned the PRIVILEGE of actually feeling suicidal. i feel like i dont have enough trauma to actually be genuinely suicidal or depressed.

thanks for reading my ELEVEN paragraphs of retarded nonsensical bullshit. you probably didnt, actually. who the fuck would

i kind of just needed somewhere to vent, but if anyone would be open to let me talk more that would be actually very appreciated. even though i doubt anyone will.

150,3,"I am a 16 year old who is overwhelmed, emotionally drained, numb, and barely functioning. I feel like I’ve been spiraling for a while, and lately, it’s like my emotions are shutting off one by one.

For a long time, I was crying every night. Now I feel nothing. Not happiness, not sadness just a deep, pressing emptiness. Even things like arousal or excitement are fading. I used to react emotionally to things now I just exist, like some NPC floating through a cutscene I can’t control.

What hurts most is how badly I want connection. I’ve been craving a relationship not for sex or surface-level reasons, but because I’m desperate for love, support, and emotional intimacy. I never had that growing up. My household isn’t supportive, and I feel completely alone. I want someone to talk to, lean on, be held by but I have zero real opportunities to make that happen. And yeah, people say “focus on yourself first” or “it’ll come when you stop looking,” but that just doesn’t hit when you're drowning in isolation.

I’ve even emotionally blunted to the point where crying feels weird now like my chest is caving in but the tears just don’t come. I’m still here, still trying to survive exams and the daily grind, but it all feels hollow.

If anyone’s felt this emotional numbness or something deeper I’d really appreciate hearing from you. Just knowing someone gets it might help me breathe.

Thanks for reading."
151,0,"Hey everyone—throwaway account because I’m a little nervous posting this, but I really need some perspective.

I’ve [17F] been with my boyfriend [16M] for a while now and honestly, our relationship is amazing in a lot of ways. We’re emotionally close, our chemistry is great, and our sex life is fulfilling—he’s more submissive, and I’m a switch, which works well for us in the bedroom.

But lately I’ve been feeling… off. Like, I’m always the one taking care of him emotionally. I’m the one sending the sweet messages, initiating affection, hyping him up, comforting him, checking in. And while I love doing those things—it’s genuinely how I express love—I’ve started to realize that I rarely get it back in the same way. I don’t really get told I’m cute or cherished. He doesn’t initiate the “I miss you” or “I wish I could hold you” kind of moments. I always feel like the giver, and I’m starting to miss feeling like someone’s soft, adored girlfriend.

Here’s where it gets tricky: I’ve tried to bring this up before, but it didn’t go well. He ended up feeling like I was saying he wasn’t “man enough,” which is so far from what I meant. I love his softness. I love that I can be dominant in the bedroom. That’s not the issue. The problem is when it starts to feel like that dynamic seeps into our everyday relationship too—like I’m always in control, always the emotionally strong one, even when I don’t want to be. Sometimes I just want to feel like I have a boyfriend who sees me as someone to take care of too.

I don’t want to shame him or make him feel insecure—I just want a way to talk about this where he can understand that it’s not about changing who he is, it’s about wanting some emotional balance. I want to be doted on sometimes. I want to feel emotionally pursued too.

Have any of you been through something like this? Any advice on how to bring it up gently and constructively? I really love him and want to make this work without hurting his self-esteem.

Thanks in advance for any help 💛

152,1,"I was born three months premature. While I was in the hospital, I ended up contracting a staph infection in my shoulder. It had to be operated on before it moved to my heart. The result was a noticeable difference in length between my arms. 

Despite the physical limitations, the mental side of things affected me more. I knew I was always sensitive and anxious. I ended up getting diagnosed with OCD earlier this year. When I read all the symptoms, it started to make a ton of sense. 

I was looked treated like an outcast, or that I was stupid. My first real bully in school was my 1st Grade Teacher. I started to believe everyone that I didn't belong and that I was stupid. My grades sucked until my Junior year of High School. I ended up getting Straight A's for the rest of my time there. Rather than be happy for me, most acted like ""Oh, so this concieted prick thinks he's smart all of a sudden.""

Going into college, (I didn't know it at the time) I stupidly majored in Communications and Journalism. I did everything I was supposed to do. I did clubs, extracurriculars etc. I ended up graduating Summa Cum Laude. I even got a job after graduating, in my field too!

Things took a turn when that dream job became a nightmare. I made less there than at the retail job I’d left. I was overworked, handling the duties of an entire media team while my efforts were constantly scrutinized. I stretched myself to the point of insomnia, stress nosebleeds, and burnout, but somehow, I wasn’t a team player because I couldn’t stretch myself out just *that* much further. 

I eventually left for a more relaxed customer service job, which led to a marketing internship. However, I was frequently pulled away from the internship to cover staffing gaps and help a manager who would rather gossip with the ""marketing girlies"" and shop online instead of doing the job she was paid significantly more than me to do. The promise of a full-time position was dangled over my head, so I figured I’d just embrace the suck for a while. When said full-time position finally came up, I was never notified about it. By the time I applied, it was given to someone else. I took that to mean they had someone else in mind from the get-go. If I did something wrong or was just shit at my job, I wish they would’ve just told me. 

I was expected to just crawl back to the department that overworked me like a good little invertebrate. I put in my two weeks’ notice (with nothing else lined up), so both positions ended at the same time.

Since then, I’ve been working low-paying jobs. I ended up taking a job in a mailroom. It was the only job that said yes to me after months of ""No's"" and I needed the money.

 I spent all of last year doing an accredited paralegal certification while working. It honestly hasn’t been worth the time or effort. I called various law firms inquiring about positions, even ones for secretaries, and I was turned down. The one that did have an open position told me they were looking for someone who was bilingual, on top of having the cert. I almost threw my phone against the wall after the call ended.

So now I’m stuck, and all the options seem to lead to more dead ends. I hate myself for ending up at this juncture in my life. But most of all, all the people throughout my life who said I was weird, or stupid, or that I'd never amount to anything; I hate the fact that I've proven them right.

I don't really see a future for myself anymore."
153,1,"Hey, I don’t even know how to begin this properly but I’ll try.

I’m just another 11th grader, living in a household that never feels safe. My parents constantly threaten me—sometimes they even say things like they’ll get me jailed. My dad’s a lawyer and honestly, kind of unstable. My mom? She flips from emotional to cold in seconds. I’ve been blamed for everything, even when I’m just trying to survive the day.

They’ve told me I’m worthless, that I’ve wasted their money, that I have no “aukaat” (worth). I recently got my board exam copy back—yeah, it wasn’t great. I left a lot of it blank because I didn’t know what to write. I was already feeling like shit during the exam and now that the copy’s here, my mom used it to attack me again. Said I’m not made for math. Said I wasted her money. Said I’m not worth paying fees for anymore.

They keep trying to provoke me, but I’ve stopped giving them reactions. I stay silent now—emotionless. Even if I know I don’t have the answers, I don’t let them use me as a punching bag anymore. It hurts, yeah, but I’m done exploding. Done crying in front of them.

And I know I’ve made mistakes too. I’ve said things in anger. I’ve started fights sometimes when I was overwhelmed. I’m not perfect. But now I just want peace. I tried to forgive them, tried to reset everything. But it’s hard when you live with people who break you down every day.

I cry. Then I try to become numb. I want to shut it all out, to be able to just focus on my own silence, my own grind. I have two years left in this house, and I don’t know how I’ll make it—but I have to.

I wonder sometimes… will anyone ever love me? Am I too broken already? Is it even normal to feel this alone at this age?

I don’t want pity. I don’t want cringe sympathy. I just want someone to say, “Yeah, I get it.” Or maybe tell me how they survived something similar.

Thanks for reading this far.

154,1,"i went out the other night just trying to feel okay again. wanted to be around people, get out of my own head for a bit. i met someone there who felt safe. we danced, talked, held hands. he kept checking in with me, and i actually started to feel like maybe i wasn’t invisible.

we kissed. spent the night together. it wasn’t planned, but it felt gentle. like something soft in the middle of everything.

then the next morning i looked him up and saw a profile picture of him with his girlfriend. big smile, arms wrapped around each other, like nothing in the world could shake them. his friends had known the whole time too. they were cheering him on like it was some kind of game.

i don’t even know how to explain how that hit. it’s not just about being lied to. it’s the way it makes you question your own instincts. i already find it hard to trust people, and this just… made it worse.

i know some people think it’s not that deep. but for me it is. i don’t do things like that lightly. and now i just feel gross. and sad. and so tired.

it’s exhausting to keep getting reminders that being kind or openhearted makes you vulnerable in ways people don’t always respect. i’m trying to heal, but stuff like this makes it feel like i’m stuck in the same cycle again and again."

160,0,"i don't know if this is considered 'irrelevant' but maybe you have seen my other post and I made this haiku thinking about it all just wanted to know what you guys think.

the moon shines bright

in the midsummer sky

thinking of you

i'm left wondering why.

.

and as I sit here I ponder

hands tied

will I be ready

when the current eventually subsides.

.

was it to fast

or was I too slow

we'll probably never know.

but when i seen the night sky

i'm always dreaming

he knows who

no explanation needed

it's always been you."
161,2,"I'm a student from Europe and I'm in Rio for another two months. I've met a girl here and things are going really well despite the fact that we both know that in 2 months we'll have to say goodbye for good.

I haven't had many real relationships, but this is the closest I've come. I don't really know where I stand with this situation because we both know that if our time wasn't limited we'd be in a relationship.

To add to all this, she told me that she had a tumour that was detected a year ago and that she hadn't told anyone around her (a friend and a cousin). The thing is, over the last year her tumour has been shrinking, but recently she's been having problems related to her tumor, so she had an MRI scan and got the results today (she hasn't sent them to me yet). So it could be that her case is getting worse. What makes the situation even more complicated is that I live about 1h20 away from her and she works quite a lot and goes to church quite a lot because she's being baptised in June.

So we talk by message but since she's had her results and started her church classes we talk a lot less (she doesn't have much time) and we won't be able to see each other before her baptism.

So I've got all this in my head and I don't really know how to deal with the situation, I'm giving her my support and my attention but I don't know if I should do more, or think less about it, because for me this exchange is the experience of a lifetime and the people who are very close to me and to whom I've explained the situation have told me not to pay too much attention to it and to concentrate on enjoying my exchange as much as possible.

I don't even know what I'm looking for by writing this post on reddit but I felt the need to talk."

163,0,"My small act of kindness is, I used to have a friend in an institute who used to stay in hostel and i was day scholar. His hostel food was not so good, so he used skip his lunch most of the time. One day I recognised it and started bring two lunch boxes. And i did it for 6 months continuously even though he refused. 6 months down the lane, he became my bestfriend and wanted to meet my mom and thank her for everything. Now even though the course has completed for which we actually met, he still remembers me and thank me for being his friend. "
164,1,"Basically, when I was a kid, I found out about creative writing and fell in love with it. It was my, and only my, special interest, and I felt so unique and special when I'd make my stories. And in my teens, I started thinking about who I could become if I pursued writing professionally. I could become famous, rich, beloved by everyone and anyone. I could be so much more than just a kid. I'd be a boy genius, and I'd show everyone around me that I was special. Yes, this is literally how I used to think.

I imagined my stories as movies. I thought about the reactions of those who would read or watch them. Seeing them cry when it reached an emotional moment, seeing them excited when the heroes triumphed, etc. This was my mission. This would be my key towards my dreams. It didn't work out.

I'm in my early twenties, in therapy, and still the same person I was at 10 - right down to the bad hygiene, immaturity and inability to handle responsibility. I recently came to the conclusion that a lot of my self-hatred comes from the fact that I was too lazy to pursue my dreams. I should've become a legendary author back then, right? The thought is ridiculous, but its very real to that part of me.

Another little handicap was that, since I was so confident that I would be able to sail through life on a gold-plated yacht, I eschewed getting a job, learning skills, going out, all that fundamental stuff I was SUPPOSED to learn - all because I knew I wouldn't need it when (if) I became a world-famous, best-selling author.

So, yeah. Not only do I feel like a talentless piece of shit for missing out on something that was meant to define my life, but I've also missed any knowledge or skills I needed to be a functioning fucking adult.

Something else I've noticed is that, if I listen to music and imagine myself singing it on a stage, I'm never singing in a stadium, no. I'm singing in my school's hall, in front of all my classmates and teachers. It's like I'm frozen in that period of my life, back when it was possible. I think of it like this: When a child brushes their teeth, they get praised for it, told they're doing a great job, whatever; but when an adult brushes their teeth, they just... brushed their teeth. The bar was so much lower back then. I didn't even have to do anything big, I just had to produce something half-decent and I would've been lauded with praise! But now, it's expected of me to be good at this - the one who is expecting the most being myself.

And there we are. A resentful basket of emotions brought on because I put so much on being a prodigy, only to turn out a normal-ass guy. I'm planning to explore these feelings with my therapist, but I wanted to ask here first. How do you think I could forgive myself for the mistake that made me so lost in life? Any help is appreciated."
165,1,"In short, I (43m) hate myself, I hate the man I have become, I feel hopeless and lost and a big part of me wishes I could take the short exit and not have to feel this way anymore. I am incapable of “filling my own cup” with hope or self-love, and it’s so, so hard for me to believe that there is a light out there when I feel darkness in every direction. I apologize in advance for the length of the rest of this explanation; I’m afraid I don’t know how to explain this any other way.

By all traditional accounts, I should be fine, subtracting the stupid mistakes I made to get myself in this position. I was raised with both parents present, and I had a set of grandparents who taught me everything about what love and kindness and decency and goodness was. I looked up to them more than I can possibly explain and miss them every single day. I have lived much of my life in the shadow of their example, and I want to believe that I earn their approval. My failures in life have been an embarrassment that I could never bring myself to tell them out loud, as the sense of shame would have been overwhelming. I somehow survived a childhood of undiagnosed Autism that I always just chalked up to being “different” and went through the horrific, nearly unbearable years of bullying and being made to feel “wrong.” At the 8^(th) grade “graduation” dance, I asked a pretty girl to dance; she laughed and spit in my face. In 10^(th) grade I told a girl I crushed on that she was beautiful and inquired whether she would like to hang out; she chuckled and said she wouldn’t go out with me, and she felt profoundly sorry for anyone who ever would. I had rocks thrown at me, I endured bullies leaving water traps in my locker to ruin my books and soak me, I had popular kids chase me home and once walked the entire way home in the headlock of some kid who wanted to beat up a friend and me- I was supposed to be the bait for my friend to come back and help me. He never did and walked home and left me behind. I have an overachieving younger brother to whom perfect grades and professional success came easily, so of course he was the child my parents could be proud of. I eventually made it through all of that, went to college, graduated with two different degrees in Computer Science, had my heart broken badly a few times, went to a lot of early to mid-aughts emo and punk shows in NYC. I became a technology professional and a hobbyist musician. Through it all, I always felt unworthy, undesirable, and somehow “less than.” I silenced the deafening roar of that self-loathing for a long time with too much wine, too much loud music, and many years of unconnected “friends with benefits” type situations. I spent basically my entire adult life trying to find the “right person” and being told at the end of the first date a scrambled version of the sentence “You’re so nice, and you’re really funny and smart, but you’re just not attractive, and I don’t feel the sparks. But we can be friends!” I spent nine years and most of my 20s in the friend zone of one woman who would occasionally start hooking up with me and building up my hopes only to disappear for months and return later with a new boyfriend and pretended like nothing had ever happened. Over and over again for nine years. She’s married now and lives in another country; good for her. We haven’t spoken in probably fifteen years, and that’s for the best.

I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder at age 41, and that seemed to explain a lot of things I didn’t previously understand, but it also completely knocked my perception of life out of whack – how much in life did I really see correctly, and how often was I a total fucking fool and didn’t know it? I was further diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder in my late 30s, mild ADHD, and something about depressive episodes. I’m not sure, I just know I’ve been through a lot of pain and longing and aching and self-hatred for a long time. I feel like an imposter who is just waiting to be discovered, and who tries to survive as an adult by being invisible. Wear basic clothing, don’t ever honk the car horn, don’t speak loudly, don’t ever complain, don’t make trouble, and always, ALWAYS apologize for everything. In my late 30s and 40s, people seem to at least politely excuse me now and smile; I’m not really seen or heard, but I guess that’s better than sticking out and getting hurt.

Seven and a half years ago, I met an incredible divorced woman who somehow welcomed me into her life and her kids’ lives. She isn’t perfect but she’s the best woman I’ve ever dated by far, and over the years we have built a life together, I’ve helped raise her kids from infants into extraordinary children, we’ve traveled domestically and internationally, we’ve bonded, and grown into something magical. We’ve seen each other through some very difficult times and celebrated some wonderful milestones and moments. I love the three of them more than I can possibly explain, and imagining life without them is impossible. My near-Mensa level brain literally cannot conjure an alternate reality where they aren’t there. That said, she comes from a foreign culture which is often very blunt and brutally honest and neither affectionate nor flowery in their affections; I literally have never seen her tell her parents that she loves them. “But that’s just understood,” she’d explain. My American emotions and neediness can never wrap around that.

As our relationship went on, she objected to my female friends existing in my life and pointed out how my closeness with some of them was inappropriate and added strain to our relationship. She pointed out how her father would never be friends with another woman or call another woman or hang out with another woman. One by one, I exiled and blocked them all. Her concern was more warranted in some cases than others; surely, at least some of these woman I harbored secret unrequited feelings for, and some of them I had more inappropriately close friendships at one point or another. Some of these friends put up more of a “fight” to keep me in their lives and would continue to reach out from time to time. It took me a while of hidden conversations and confused feelings before plugging up the holes again and leaving those relationships in the past. Sometimes, my girlfriend would catch me and force it, sometimes I did it on my own. Sometimes an ex would drop out of the sky and contact me, and sometimes I would intrigue with them in secret before having to sever contact again; sometimes I would “get caught” and be forced to do so. I hate myself and have no ability to self-love or to self-approve, so when somebody shows up and expresses interest, offers affirmations and words of validation and compliments, it is like a drug to me, a drug that I have great difficulty refusing. After many heart-wrenching arguments and near breakups, I learned the words “emotional cheating” and still have difficulty saying to myself that on and off, sporadically across much of our seven and a half years together, I was a “serial cheater.” I was never looking to have an affair or an alternate relationship or to replace my existing girlfriend with a new one, but sometimes at night, particularly when I was a few glasses of wine in, having an exciting conversation with somebody who thought my ideas were interesting and who might be willing to fuck me was too good of a drug to turn down. In the morning, I went on like nothing happened, and would sometimes be weeks or months if I ever spoke to that person again. That said, all of these other women, for one reason or another, also went away. Either I shut down the situation myself before or I got caught and shut it down afterwards. Even now, seeing the words “serial cheater” up there on the screen makes me feel like a fucking disgusting person. How did I become this shameful failure of a man? How am I so fucking weak and pathetic that kind words are all it took to get me to make choices that would hurt the woman I love and damage the best relationship I’ve ever had? Addiction is a tough motherfucker. To be clear, I’m not a sex addict, I’m not a love addict, but I would concede that I am a validation addict… I still feel so worthless and shitty about myself, I cannot seem to generate self-love or self approval, so I am starved for it in this way that makes me especially vulnerable, and my “relapses” amount to me doing dishonest things. Am I remorseful? Absolutely. I can’t even look myself in the mirror anymore. I recently visited my grandparents’ grave and broke down horribly, feeling the overwhelming weight of shame and sorrow at the person I’ve become. That their cheerful little curly-haired beloved grandson that they poured their love, time, money, patience and kindness into for so many years has somehow become a man who is dishonest and doesn’t treat his girlfriend the way she deserves. I do so much for her otherwise – I built a deck on the house, I clean the pool, I’ve done home improvement projects on every room of the house very successfully, I helped her through a very messy divorce, I cook dinners and clean the kitchen afterwards, I listen, I care, I give massages, I make the bed, I love her so fucking much every day and all of this lovely stuff, but none of that matters, not really, in the end, because yeah, I have been an awful fucking person, and I hate myself for it. Even writing that right now makes me want to smash my head into the wall or something in disgust.

When I was 41, my grandparents’ incredible final gift came to me more than a decade after their passing; they had opened an investment account for me when I was a little boy, and now that account contained an amount of money larger than I’d ever seen in my life, and larger than I would likely ever see in a checking account ever again. We’re not talking “buy a house” money, but we are talking “use this to do good in your life in some way that you wouldn’t have been able to otherwise” kind of money. Back in January, girlfriend and I been going through a really “good period” for a while, and after much discussion, I pulled a third of that money out of investments and bought a 2.25 carat engagement ring that the gf designed herself – the single most beautiful, sparkly, magnificent thing I’ve ever seen, and by far the most expensive object (other than a car) that I’ve ever – and will ever – purchase. We were both over the moon with the ring, and after several extremely enthusiastic try-ons, we agreed that I would hold onto it until the right time came where I would still have to formally ask.

Early February, my horrible, pathetic self relapsed again, albeit very quickly, at work; I had a handful of inappropriate conversations with someone who thought I was really exciting and interesting and whose affirmations felt good enough that I played along. I felt awfully about it, cut it off, and let the other person down as gently as I could to focus back on my relationship; this other person and I parted ways amicably very shortly after it began and never spoke again. It was probably only about a week and a half from first contact to last contact, but the damage was done.

Last month, the girlfriend, her kids and I went on a dream vacation to Disney, my most beloved spot on Earth by far. I had planned to bring the ring and pop the question there. Days before leaving, work told me that I was suspended on suspicion of wrongdoing, but refused to tell me what it was about. I wasn’t sure at the time myself, but with the weight of that hanging over me, I didn’t feel right about bringing the ring and making huge life changes when my job situation was so unclear. The vacation was everything anyone could ever dream of in a vacation; it was perfect. After I came back, I learned that work had found out about my inappropriate conversations and flirtations and that I was now suspended without pay as a result. That’s when the bottom REALLY fell out and I found out how low a human can feel; I hit bottom hard, crashed through the bottom, and found myself at the bottom of a pit of despair and worthlessness where I’ve been ever since. Without a job I feel like I’ve lost my identity, my function in life, whatever value I may have had is gone. A workplace that always felt like home, like a safe haven, where my coworkers and team felt like family, is gone. Worse still, I came home from this awful meeting and had to confess the reason why to my girlfriend, her hurt and anger at this relapse will likely haunt me until the day I die. I honestly don’t even know which felt worse – the firing or confessing the reason why to the woman I love… but they both felt like something hitting me in the chest with a sledgehammer.

So now it’s been two weeks. I live in fear and doubt and self-loathing every single day. I have applied for close to 300 jobs, if not more, and I blast out more into the void every single day. I have had a dozen rejections, a small handful of interviews, I have one very promising 3^(rd) round interview coming up soon and one less promising 1^(st) interview in about two hours from when I type these words in. I’ve always been very afraid of change and deeply sensitive and terrified of rejection of any kind, so this process has taken a toll on me, to say the least. Despite some of these positive developments, I am 100% incapable of feeling hope. I can’t seem to manufacture belief that this situation will get better. The first few days I found myself waking up at 4am with thoughts immediately racing and short-circuiting through my head, as I was trying to decide what the tallest building I know is where I might be able to access the roof or a window. Another morning I found myself exploring my ribs with my fingers, trying to learn my own anatomy so as to decide where to best stab myself with a chef’s knife. I wondered how good the airbag system in my car is, and whether I could disable it somehow (I’m an electronic engineer, so probably). I Googled “I hate myself and I want to die” and “I lost my job and I think I want to die” at 5am while the girlfriend slept soundly next to me. I didn’t act on any of these feelings, and I confessed them all to the girlfriend. She’s been kind and patient with that, and her presence helps keep me going and brings me what little peace I can find. The other half of that sword, however, is that she’s also simultaneously battling her own feelings of hurt and disappointment and frustration. When these frustrations come out, she uses a lot of “forever words” and “stop words” such as “I’ll never marry you, I can never imagine us being married or anything like that” or “You’ll never live here, you will have your duffel bag, but that’s it. You can’t bring your stuff here, you’ll never have a key.” Last night, after a lengthy and painful argument, she asked me to look into returning the engagement ring. Feeling that resulting shame, self-hatred and deep, deep sorrow and pain used to be reserved in my head for characters in movies or nineteenth-century poems, now I’m living it and getting hit with it every day.

I feel so, SO lost. I feel powerless and worthless. I was seriously close to hospitalizing myself once or twice for having such strong suicidal thoughts, I stopped because I was worried about the cost that I’d never be able to pay for, and whether my health insurance would cover it. I worried that I’d miss days in the job search, and maybe an interview would be scheduled while I was hospitalized. I envy the people in the hospital – for them, they are safe, they are cared for, and their problems can’t get to them in there. For the moment, they’re OK. I want to be OK. I want to believe that things will be OK. I want to land a new job and have a healthy, fresh new start with the girlfriend and get in control of my impulses to seek out validation from unhealthy places. I want this next interview to get scheduled already and move the process forward. Days are ticking by and every day that goes by is a day closer to having to reach into my grandparents’ gifted investment money just to pay bills. Even thinking about having to do that feels like a betrayal of the greatest people I’ve ever known. I do firmly believe that addictions can be overcome – I had an uncle who spent the last ten years of his life sober after having been an alcoholic for who knows how many decades. I sucked my thumb until I was ten or eleven and needed severe orthodontia to correct; today I have a decently aligned smile. I used to know a kid in my teens who played so much EverQuest online that he dropped out of high school to sit at home and play it during every waking hour – today he has a very successful career in international finance. I also believe that people who are unfaithful in whatever way to their partners are not beyond redemption, they are not beyond forgiveness; they are not unworthy of being loved. I’ve been there - being cheated on – and it sucked, but the relationship, at the time, did survive.

I want there to be hope. I NEED there to be hope. I just don’t know how to see it, how to believe it. I don’t know how to help my girlfriend feel hope again that I can take this horrible turn of events in my life, learn something, and turn a fresh page. She tells me “I don’t think you can.” “I don’t think you ever will get better.” “I think that if an attractive woman shows up at your next job and starts flirting with you, then you’ll just get sucked right in. I don’t think that you’ll be able to say no.”

My regular therapist tells me that I’m still entitled to compassion, and that I am not unlovable or powerless. I hear the words, but my heart won’t believe it. I’m not sleeping well, I wake up in the middle of the night with horrible thoughts of doubt, fear, and self-hatred racing through my head at a hundred miles an hour, and then lay there unable to fall asleep again, until I give up, reach over to the nightstand for the iPad and either Google more job listings or read articles about suicide until the alarm goes off hours later. Some days, taking that exit and being free of this pain, this sense of being irretrievably lost, of being unwanted and undeserving… some days, that is a very attractive feeling. If I am unforgivable as the girlfriend says, if I am this unspeakable monster of a person, then the world really is better without me. I broke down yesterday and asked her in a Wal-Mart parking lot how bad it would be for her, really, if I died. I guess maybe I was asking for her permission, in some way. Part of me hoped that she’d say that she would be sad but would probably eventually be fine. Even in that most awful moment, I am kept here because I have reached this point where I can reconcile doing this to myself, but I can’t reconcile doing something to hurt her and the children, something that would damage them beyond repair. She tells me that the only way to truly fail the people that love me – and those that have loved me - is to give up.

I’m not sure where that leaves me this morning. I see all of these words that I have typed and they all feel like an acknowledgment of this disgrace of a man that I have somehow become. I see the words “serial cheater”, I feel the weight of them being lowered around my neck and it stings and sears and burns like a medal that had been heated with a blowtorch before being placed against my skin. I feel the sentence “I want you to look into returning the ring” as an ultimate validation of my failure, my worthlessness as a human being. It hits me with the force and brutality of double-ought buckshot out of a 10-gauge shotgun. I sit and stare at the clock, at the calendar, at the days that are going by, waiting for the salvation of an e-mail inviting me to the next interview, giving me even the smallest of morale-boosters. Each minute that ticks by without one is a minute where I sink even lower, feel more worthless, more irretrievably in despair, and more utterly ashamed of myself, of who I grew up to be. My grandparents deserved better of a man for a grandson. The thought of them looking down on me with disgust is far too much to bear. I have failed the legacy of the greatest people I’ll ever know, I have betrayed their lessons of goodness and kindness and “doing the right thing.” I have been dishonest and unfaithful to the greatest woman I’ve ever met. Now, I’ve lost my job too in the process.

So now I’m no longer an engineer. I’m no longer “husband material.” I’m mere months away (at best) from total and absolute bankruptcy. I cannot look myself in the eye. All I see is failure, failure and more failure. All I see is this disgrace of a man looking back at me. All I see is someone whose grandparents would be ashamed of him. I can’t afford to be hospitalized; I have no money and my problems are too big, too urgent and are beating down the door for me anyway. I don’t know how to find hope, how to believe it. My chest hurts every minute. I want to punish myself. I deserve to be punished. I deserve to get hurt. I can barely sleep, and when I do, I sleep for less than half of what I should. I didn’t eat yesterday. I am not feeling hungry in the slightest right now either. I am truly, truly lost. Even still, I don’t think I can damage the girlfriend and her kids and take the quick way out.

Maybe this isn’t a cry for help, so much as it is a cry for… hope? I guess I’ll have to go with that. This is a cry for hope. Please, please world. Have hope for me. Help me find hope. Help me feel hope. Help the girlfriend find hope. Hope that I make it."
166,3,"I’m 13, and my parents are seperating, and I have to move out of my childhood home. My parents are seperating due to a decision on my mom’s part, and I can see where she comes from. My dad is a douche- he loves us, yes, but he’s messy, has a short temper and lazy. We don’t have enough money to continue living in our childhood home, so they’re planning to sell it- I got the news from my mom, she told me someone was gonna take pictures of our home tomorrow. Coupled with me hearing my mom suggesting a divorce after an argument and multiple hints at our financial situation, I connected the dots. My childhood home is a place of many memories-I remember being in the crib and the maid sleeping in the bed next to me, the maid(s) leaving (we’d gone through multiple through my early childhood), the assembling of my current bed, me being frightened by a caterpillar sticker, my sister learning piano, the removal of an old cupboard and replacing it with 2 desks (one for me and one for my sister) which happened just 2 years ago. I remember my cub scout days where I would put on the uniform and head towards the nearby community center, coming back and going to eat, rumors of a McDonalds opening in my neighbourhood and one actually opening years later. I remember waiting at the school gate for my sister to pick her up, walking back home chatting with my friends, arguing about what to eat with my sister, the bookshelves’ construction, the bunk bed’s construction, coming home after graduation, coming home after recieving my slip detailing where I would go for middle school, endless chatting with friends at home, a sleepover with my best friend, bringing home toys, 10 of my birthdays, Christmases, summer holidays and Easters, putting up the Christmas tree, writing “fei chun”, filing and opening red packets with mother and sister, opening my present to find out it was a Switch with Pokemon Violet and so much more memories I couldn’t ever type in even with hours.

I can’t bear the thought of moving away from my home, my bed, my room, everything in this house. It’s for the best. My father has debt from his latest business endeavour, and we need to sell the house to survive. So many memories, the neighbourhood, walking past my school, to the supermarket, to the restaurants, my friends there, coming home from school countless times. I can’t handle this"

If your brain’s being loud or your mood’s off and you need to let it out, I’m around. You can vent, talk about life, or go full chaos mode and rank the top 5 worst water flavors. I’m not here to judge.

If you are someone  who's low-key weirdo whs looking for someone to talk to everyday, we both have that in common,  let's see where it goes.

We can be deep, dumb, or both. I’m cool with silence too if you just need someone on the other end.

Inbox is open. Bring your thoughts or your rage.

168,0,"Imagine this:

You’ve been pushing, surviving, worn thin by stress, setbacks, and silence. You’re tired—but you’re still here. And then someone hands you a tiny glass vial.

Inside, it swirls—silver and gold, like starlight and sunrises. A label, handwritten:

***“Drink when it feels too heavy. This will not fix everything. But it will show you why you must keep going.”***

You sip.

And for 30 seconds… you *see it*.

Not a fantasy, but a future that could *actually* be yours.

You see yourself stronger—not because life got easier, but because you *grew steady beneath the weight*. Your eyes carry peace. Your shoulders aren’t slumped—they’re sure. You’re holding something glowing—not magic, but purpose.

The people around you—those you love, or maybe haven’t even met yet—*they’re smiling.*

And you realize… you made it.

Maybe not perfect. Maybe scarred. But fully *you.*

—

I wish I could give you this vial in real life. I really do. I know how heavy things can get. But maybe this post can be a version of that for someone.

And if you want to share what *your* glimpse might look like—or if you just need a friend, or someone to believe in you—I’m here.

No judgment. No advice unless you want it. Just someone who gets it, who’s walking through the hard too, and still trying to be a light in it all.

What would your 30-second glimpse show you?

Let’s talk. You’re not alone. (35m)"

I’m just feeling a little low and would love to have someone to talk to. It would be nice to connect with a kind-hearted female friend for genuine conversations—about life, goals, or just random things. Nothing romantic, just looking for warmth, support, and friendship.

170,1,"Hi, I’m 21F and I just finished my 3rd year in engineering. Everyone says college years are supposed to be the best of your life, but these have been so stressful and miserable. I dated my first boyfriend freshman year for 5 ish months and he broke my heart. We had the same friend group which made it really difficult to recover, as these were people I’ve grown to care about very quickly. 

I kind of lost it after that. I wasn’t mature enough to be in a relationship and when it ended I felt completely hopeless. I leaned on friends a lot of support, even the mutual ones with my ex (though I did my very best not to bring anything up or say anything negative). Eventually though it became too much for them, which I understand as it was definitely a lot. I got especially bad after I found out he was dating his girl best friend (who was also a good friend of mine who lied about it) and I hit rock bottom.

I got over my ex a long time ago, probably 6 of months after we broke up. But even after all this time I still think about the friends I had. I truly miss them, and I feel like I wasted some of my best years on people I probably wouldn’t have seen after college. I’ve been in therapy since July, and haven’t spoken to that group in almost a year. I’ve been volunteering and making memories with my best friends/roommates and they’ve been absolutely lovely people.

I’ll be a senior soon. I live 12 hours away from my school so I would definitely be going home to my family once I’m done. But I honestly dont know what to do now. I have this weight in my chest that’s filled with regret of meeting those people. They’re not bad people by any means, but maybe just bad for me. I know I definitely needed to grow up a lot, so I probably got what was coming to me. I just wish I hadn’t spent to much time frustrated and miserable.

If you read this, thank you. I would very much appreciate some guidance but honestly even just seeing this is enough for me. Please let me know if I should post this elsewhere."

172,2,"I’m in a relationship, and I genuinely love my girlfriend. She means a lot to me. But lately, I’ve been carrying so many thoughts and feelings inside me and I can’t always share them with her. Not because I don’t trust her, but because I don’t want to worry her or start unnecessary overthinking.

And in moments like these… I find myself wishing I had a female friend.
Not someone to flirt with or cross boundaries - just someone I could talk to. Someone who could understand me from a softer, more emotional perspective.
I feel like girls are better at understanding emotions, and sometimes all I need is someone to say, “I hear you.”

I try to be a good listener to others, but sometimes… even the listener needs a listener.

I don’t know if this makes sense, or if anyone else feels this way, but I just needed to let it out."

174,1,"I am in my late 20s, moved here to the US when I was in my early 20s. Only had one relative who passed away, both parents abandoned me when I was a kid. I was never introduced to other relatives, so I know none. But after moving to the USA, I just started a new chapter. 

I was with someone who I've met online and main reason I came here for. When he switched colleges, he met other girls and moved on. Kept threatening that he would try to deport me because I wasted his time and had to spend some money on me and how he just felt bad. That caused me some trauma and apparently he is happily married to someone now. Been struggling completely alone for years.  

I tried to date other people. It didn't work out. Guys tried to get sex out of me, I refused. It always ends up with the guy trying to harm me/humiliate me. 
Months ago, my boss who was much older than me was showing me interest. He would try to say that he relates to my past, how he has no family either, how he finds me special. All of that was nonsense, once he got fired he told me that he never had any feelings and how I was just a desperate girl after him. 


I have some friends. Not close but I communicate. We dont do much, we mostly talk on the phone or social media. I also live in California so most people don't want to drive somewhere unless you are someone they like a lot. I joined some fitness classes and people will say hi or so and barely talk. I volunteered for a few places that are entertainment business related and just met narcissists who just wanted an IG follow. 

I dont really party or drink or do drugs, I have been playing videogames since a kid and I travel solo a lot. But people never care to go past the hi, how're you phase. 

I am planning to go back to college and who knows. After my ex-boss situation, I avoid everyone at work.

I don't think I will meet anyone to like me. Even ChatGPT doesn't find me conventionally attractive and I guess I have a weird personality. Sometimes I dont understand slang English since English is not my native language and people think I am slow. "

He was just like me and I thought we were best friends. this morning I told him who I liked, and he immidietly told them. I get on the bus in the aftenoon (the only time I really see her) after avoiding her the whole day. I pretend to talk with my friend but i can see her staring at me. I was thinking about it the whole day and my feelings only got worst. I realised that 2 People were my best friend but i'm nobodies best friend. most relationship my age are just doing whatever but I really liked her. I liked the way she made me feel. I liked her humor and personality. I liked every time we talked, even if I just asked her to pick up something by her. I don't like it that much at home and soccer is my only escape. I feel like I cant tell anyone this, especially as a male. I don't know what to do, I want her so bad but I have no confidence.

I've held an interest in animation since childhood. Watching stick fights, Madness Combat, Bunny Kill and a few other Newgrounds-Era animations was always really cool to me. Even as a pre-teen, I downloaded Pivot Animator to make some shitty animations of my own - downloading PNGs to use as my props for Star Wars and zombie animations. 

But to say the reason I want to animate is because I like it is only half the reason. Creative writing is what I would call my passion, and I kind of latched onto this idea as a teen, due to none of my family caring about my stories, that if I could draw or animate them, maybe it'd be easier for them to digest. After all, a picture is a lot easier to experience than an entire book, right?

So I jumped head-first into drawing and animation. Something I came to realise early on is that pursuing a craft specifically to gain something from it will make the learning process fucking agonising. Every mistake is a personal failing, every shaky line or misdrawn shape is a mirror to how terrible I am. Besides that, I have ADHD, so watching tutorials is basically a waste of effort as I zone out constantly. 

Thanks to ADHD as well, I just cannot bear doing simple animations to learn. Yeah, a bouncing ball and a pendulum is cool once, but I can't bring myself to do more of it. I want to be good NOW. I \*have\* to be good NOW.

Animation is just that kind of mental beast that lives in your head rent-free but will snap at you if you dare think about actually doing it. It just fucking drains me, the mere thought of doing it. Sometimes I'll listen to specific music, and revisit that one idea that I mapped out in my head for an animation, only to get depressed because I know I'm too - well, whatever the fuck is wrong with me - to do it. 

I will clarify that I am unmedicated, and I'm currently waiting for meds which will be the first I ever take. I'm excited, anxious and quite frankly, bored shitless as I wait the agonising amount of days it'll take for that appointment to get here.

I don't even know what this post is. I just feel like shit and I wanted to whine about it. I hate how something that I want to do is gatekeeped by my fucking inability to stomach tedious practice. I just can't do it and I want to fucking cry. I hate it. "

188,1,"Hi i (15m) really need someone to talk to. 

I've been struggling lately to move on from my terrible past and every night i always dream of my past like it was yesterday, it keeps haunting me. 

Trigger warning: drugs, depression, suicide. 

I started high school 3 years ago, everything was going fine, i was still a cringy 12 year old in 7th grade and i was fine back then, but all of that changed when i went to 8th grade. 

I started hanging out with the wrong people, i was always encouraged by my family to never smoke or drink, but due to my new classmates i started smoking and drinking, i thought it was cool, and i though i felt noticed. 

But no, I still felt isolated, alone and unlovable, but all that changed when i met this girl, we knew each other already at the start of high school, we've became good friends but not that close, we started chatting in December 2023 during Christmas, we've gotten to be so close, i have genuinely never felt a connection with one person more than ever, when i was with her, i felt like a child, like i was comfortable, i saw a genuine connection, like a spark. 

It felt good because for once, i didn't hate myself, but of course, i was still in the wrong environment, that's where i learned to do drugs, marijuana specifically, at first it didn't kick, but after a few sessions, around my 3rd attempt, it kicked in, it honestly felt traumatic, it was my first ever high and it was a bad trip, but in a way it still felt good honestly. 

I became addicted, i started selling my stuff for money so i could get more, shoes, clothes, etc. I became money hungry, i was so blinded that it was damaging everything around me, my family, my good and supportive friends, my girlfriend, and most importantly, myself. 

She knew about everything, the drugs, the money, the lies, everything. Yet, she still stayed, she didn't trust me anymore but she still stayed for me, but she was in pain, i can never forgive myself for the things i did to her, i can't believe after everything we've been trough, this is gonna be our ending. 

We broke up, everybody started hating me, they never really saw me the same way again ever since, they've cut all ties with me all together and it really fucked with me, all i had were my so called ""friends"" and i really got mentally unstable. 

I wasn't attending school anymore, i was more focused on smoking weed and getting high 24/7 and it affected my relationship with my parents, my mom kicked me out of the house, they started getting scared of me, they also locked me out of the house, i was sleeping with my friends house most of the time, i was dropped out of my school for cannabis possession, and my aunts took me in cause my mother couldn't handle me anymore. 

At that time i was really depressed. I was thinking of just overdosing on pills to end it all because i had no purpose anymore, i literally snapped and crash out of my aunts house, i was gonna jump no matter what, i literally lost all hope in my life. 

The next day my mom took me and i though i could finally come home, then after we stopped, i though maybe we were just gonna go eat or something, little did i know, i was brought to rehab. 

I spent 6 months in that rehab, it was the most miserable time of my life, i felt so much hatred and anger that all of it went into sadness, i wanted to just not wake up anymore, i felt like i was not living, pretty much just killing time, i spent my Christmas and new year in that rehab, while i was handcuffed in the gate, fucking horrible time of my life. 

After 6 months of mental health hell, i finally got out, yet, i feel so fucking miserable, i can't escape my past no matter what, i keep dreaming of my life back then, with her, with my only friends, and everytime i wake up, i just feel horrible, I'm pretty much just wasting time.

I need someone to talk to, please. "
189,1,"Hi, I (M24) am currently going through my first breakup. The relationship lasted 4 years. It has been two months since the breakup. During this time, I have come to realise that the breakup, which she initiated, was the right decision on her part. We ended up hurting each other more than helping. Both of us carried unresolved traumas we did not even realise were there.

She struggled a lot with her body and eating behaviour, a battle I was not able to support her enough in. Over time, in her mind, I went from being her partner to being her biggest critic. That is not entirely her fault. My behaviour played a role, and that is something I only truly understood after the breakup.

She, in turn, realised that she had never properly processed the breakup of her previous relationship. To protect herself, probably unconsciously, she was never able to fully let herself go with me. The fear of being left again was too strong.

I wish we had recognised all of this while we were still together. But maybe it would not have worked out anyway.

We are both suffering deeply from the end of the relationship, even though we both know it was no longer enough. The emotional baggage we carried was simply too heavy to deal with together. We both have a lot of work to do, not for a shared future but for ourselves.

What hurts us most is the loss of our friendship. Even before we got together, neither of us had many truly close friendships. We both longed for that kind of deep bond where you feel safe and understood. A friendship where the energy is mutual and there is no need to question whether the other person is really there for you. In each other, we found that.

I have never met someone who understood me so well. I have always valued deep conversations. Being able to talk about feelings and problems has always been important to me. With her, I could finally do that. There has never been a better remedy in my life than a long talk with her. She feels the same.

Right now, we are not in contact. We only spoke once after the breakup. The call was meant to be quick, but it lasted almost five hours and felt like one. It was genuinely beautiful. I got to tell her how wrong the image of me in her head had become. Not because her feelings were invalid, but just to say how much I appreciated her and how her self doubt, especially about her body, was so undeserved.

She explained why she had to end things, something that had not been fully clear to me before. And it was beautiful to see how well we still understood each other.

It felt like we had two connections, the romantic one and the friendship. The relationship failed. We could not make it work. I am not sure if it ever could again. Of course, a small part of me hopes we will both work on ourselves to a point where, hypothetically, a second chance could exist.

But I know I need to move on from the relationship, confront my own trauma, work on myself. She cannot be my motivation. I need to accept that we likely will not get back together.

And that is hard, especially because until the end, I (maybe naively, first relationship after all) believed she was the one I would spend my life with. Looking back, I realise I was more in love with the idea of what we could have been and the deep friendship we had than with the actual relationship we had towards the end. I had nothing to compare it to, no prior relationship to measure it against, and I would not have had the strength to end it myself, even though I also had doubts.

The loss of that friendship is the most painful part. I do believe I will meet someone else later in life who is a better fit for me in a romantic way than the version of her I was with.

But right now, it is hard to imagine finding a friendship as deep and fulfilling as what we had. Our five hour phone call made time fly. Even though we were both sad and heartbroken, it was such a meaningful, comforting conversation. We cried, we laughed, we talked about what has happened since. The heavy weight I had felt since the breakup lifted during that time. She just gets me. Talking to her brings me peace.

That is what makes it so hard to accept that our friendship must end too. We both know that staying friends with an ex is not realistic. The emotional confusion would be too much, especially if one or both of us enter a new relationship.

I think part of why I am still holding on to hope that we might end up together again is because it feels like the only way this friendship could survive.

And I also think that if a friendship is that strong and so many core values align, then surely a relationship should be possible. But sadly, it was not.

Right now, I feel lost. I miss her. I miss the relationship, despite the problems, and even though I know the breakup was not wrong. I am not yet at the point where I can say it was the right decision. I still believe too strongly in the idea of mutual healing. But I also cannot say it was wrong.

It hurts knowing I hurt someone I only ever wanted the best for. Hearing that our relationship broke her was one of the hardest things.

We both feel like now is exactly when we would need each other most, someone who understands and supports us through this hard time. But we cannot be that for each other anymore, because we are also the source of each other’s pain.

I know I need distance from her. Without it, I will never let go of the hope that it could have worked.

I truly wish her all the best in the world. She knows that. And I know she wishes the same for me. I wish I could be angry at her, tell myself I am better off without her. But that is just not how I feel right now.

I still hope somehow our friendship can survive, against all odds. I know it is probably unrealistic, maybe even unhealthy, but I am not ready yet to let go of what we had.

I think it would all be easier if I had fulfilling friendships outside of her. But I do not, not at this point in time. I try to nurture the friendships I have, even during the relationship. But still, I feel like I am never a priority. I always seem to be the one who puts in more effort.

Almost none of the friendships I thought were real have consistently checked in on how I am feeling or taken time to truly talk. I just want someone to cry with sometimes, someone who listens.

This is my first time going through something like this. Of course I know it will get better eventually. But when is eventually, and what if even when things are better I still miss her, still miss this friendship? What if I never find a connection like this again?

To my best friend: I miss you. We are no longer walking through life together, but I will always be on your team. I will always wish you the very best. You will always be my first love. I am grateful you showed me how beautiful love can be, how wonderful life feels when you have that kind of connection to another person.

If we can no longer have that again with each other, I hope we both find it again in someone else.

There is still so much I wish we could have done together, so many things we talked about. Dreams we shared. Travelling the world together. Watching you graduate and become a doctor. We started running together, we were going to do a marathon next year.

It hurts knowing you will not be at the finish line. That I will not be able to hug you and tell you how proud I am. I miss being part of your life, being there for the highs and the lows.

I only ever wanted you to be happy, and it hurts knowing that you decided your happiness does not include me anymore.

I hope this is not goodbye forever, just a see you again.

Wishing you nothing but the best  
S

**The help I am seeking:**  
Honestly, I think just writing down my thoughts helps a little already. But I would really appreciate hearing from people who have been through something similar. If you know how this feels and have somehow made it through, I would love to hear how you managed. Right now, it all just feels overwhelming and I could use some perspective."
190,3,"i’m stuck in this endless loop of trying harder and harder and harder, thinking maybe if i reach some impossible standard, everything will start making sense.
but nothing ever changes. it just keeps hurting.

i'm a uni student in my third year now. last semester i pulled a 4.0 gpa. i went beyond what my scholarship requires. i keep pushing myself, studying like i’m training for war. doing practice tests, reviewing notes during lunch, staying in the library until it closes.
i barely talk to anyone. i barely eat. every second i feel like i have to prove something.

but i don’t even know who i’m trying to prove it to anymore.

my parents don’t care. they’re always fighting. they don’t pay for my tuition. they don’t give me money. i live off scraps, whatever’s left in my savings. sometimes i sell my stuff just to make it through the month. i got the scholarship on my own. i’m doing everything on my own. and still… it never feels like enough.

i’m just… so lonely. it hurts, so bad.
i don’t have real friends. just one chairmate who constantly makes me doubt myself. even when i wanted to give a farewell letter and gift to the only professor who ever made me feel seen, she told me not to do it. said it was inappropriate. so i didn’t. and i’ve regretted it every single day since. i wish i hadn’t listened. i wish i told him how much it meant to be acknowledged by someone, even once.

i try to stay focused on goals. because goals are safe. they don’t abandon you.
but i don’t talk to anyone after class. during breaks, i eat with one hand and study with the other. i’ve been like this since high school. just trying to outrun my own worthlessness. trying to be perfect.
but perfection doesn’t hold your hand when you’re crying alone in your room. it doesn’t make you feel real.

i tried to connect with someone once. a classmate who was sweet and kind. but we got separated when we chose different majors.
and now it’s back to being invisible.

sometimes i think maybe i just wasn’t meant for friendship. maybe i’m too focused. too intense. too weird. maybe people don’t know what to do with someone like me. someone who feels so much and hides it behind ambition.

i keep piling more on myself, learning new languages, setting more goals, because if i stop, everything will collapse. i don’t know how to rest. i don’t know how to just be.

i just… need someone to tell me that this isn’t all for nothing.
that i’m not failing.

i need someone to say: you got this.
and that will really make me smile right now.

191,2,"Hi all,

I (F, mid-30's) have really been struggling with this, and I don't know where else to turn as I don't want to add to drama.

Growing up, we had a great family friend that I really looked up to. He never took sides when my parents split, and I respected and loved him for that. He would confide in me when I was 19-20 about his past relationships and I admit I developed a little bit of a crush on him when I was younger, because I thought he was cool and attractive and just a nice person to be around. We kissed a couple times, but we agreed we could not have a relationship due to the family dynamics. Being young, it was hard to accept at first, but I had to be a big girl, swallow my feelings and move forward. I love my boyfriend that I have now, and I would never imagine straying from him. Friend never needed my permission to move on from me either.

He made his intentions or lack of clear to me. He would talk about his past relationships, and I felt he was still hurting from them, not yet over them. I didn't think he wanted a relationship with me at all. We would have great conversations, whether laughing, crying, or keeping in touch, no inappropriate texts or pictures sent. I made it clear I was happy in my relationship.

I confided in him too about my life, he knew a lot about me and what I have gone through. He was very supportive and genuine, encouraging and he's just a really nice person. As time went on, I saw him as more as a close friend/family member.

My partner knew we texted back and forth as well as talked. A month ago, however, friend admits he has feelings for me, but I saw him as a good friend. Up until this point I never suspected or expected anything. Friend and I were going to talk to clarify things, but I couldn't talk to him the weekend I was down to see my family and there were other things happening. From the start of this year, my mental health has been terrible due to personal stress, loss, family drama and financial troubles. I could have done a phone call as he's right, these things are better face to face, but I couldn't make it happen at the time.

Now my friend is saying he's wasted his time on me. I thought he said he was relieved that he could move on and focus his energy elsewhere. When he confessed to me, he knew I never intended for his feelings to develop in the way they have. A couple weeks after, he angrily told me he was blocking me before saying he wasted his time. It still is shocking that he would give this all up after 25 years or so.

I really want to move past this and want to be friends again but some of the things he said I am still trying to process. I feel terrible. Yet I am someone that despite the changing dynamics, I feel I have been there for him as he has for me, with no expectations or otherwise. He has not had a girlfriend in years (I wasn't one, to be clear) and I don't know if he's lonely, but this isn't like him.

Do I give it time? Do I just abandon ship? Do I send him a card? What do I do?"
192,2,"I (25F) made the stupid mistake of having unprotected sex with my boyfriend last Saturday the 24th. It was for max 3 minutes and nothing happened (didn’t cum in me) but I’m just freaking out that I’m pregnant. I took a Plan B as well as started birth control pills on the same day as told by my doctor, but I’m over the weight limit of plan b. I also have PCOS so I don’t even know if I ovulate. Ever since taking the plan b, I’ve just been having all the pregnancy symptoms and it’s freaking me out so much. 

I don’t have anyone to talk about to with this. My parents would kill me if they found out, my friends are super weird about topics like this, my boyfriend just denies it and tells me I’m not, and my therapist wasn’t much help either. I just don’t know what to do cause everyday feels like torture waiting until I can test. 

I just want some help in this situation and don’t know how to cope"
193,3,"i don’t even know how to begin. it feels like everything hit at once and now i’m just stuck under it. i’ve been trying to hold it together but lately it feels like i’m coming apart in slow motion.

some friendships fell apart. some of that’s on me, some of it isn’t, but the silence hurts either way. i’ve been applying for stuff, trying to move forward with school and life and all of it, but nothing’s working out. every door feels like it’s closing.

i can’t sleep properly, barely eat, and the anxiety’s starting to hurt physically. like this heavy feeling in my chest that won’t go away. i’ve tried journaling, walking, even crying it out, but i just feel so tired.

i don’t really need advice. just want to know that someone out there has been through something like this and made it to the other side. i just want to believe it gets better. that i’m not always going to feel this stuck and alone.

thank you for reading. i needed somewhere to put this."
194,1,"I could really use someone to talk to. I struggle with depression. PTSD, ocd stuff. If anyone wants to talk to me. Let me know. "
195,1,"I (29F) currently live with my ex boyfriend (38M). I was living alone for a while, but we moved in together last year and tried dating again for the 2nd time. I quit my job and spent/lived off the rest of my savings because I was depressed and irresponsible, thought “eh I’ll figure it out later.” 

It was the classic avoidant/anxious dynamic between us, and we broke up. I started dating my (now) ex girlfriend after this. While I was with my ex girlfriend, he decided he wanted me back. I stayed with the girlfriend. She dumped me. And he and I are still living together, he is now moving on. I just signed a lease for another 6 months because I cannot afford to get my own place again yet. I have to live here. 

He was also my main friend for 6 years. We obviously aren’t friends anymore. 

He just got promoted at work, has an established career now, is a new manager, dresses up very well and snazzy to go to work every day, has a solid group of friends, plenty of money saved, makes great money. Seems happy. He’s very smart, he’s worked for it, he deserves it.

I am a server at a breakfast place. Doing fine there. I am aimless in life and have been ever since my dad died and I dropped out of college. I have no close friends. Barely even talk at work, I’m just depressed every day and drowning in self loathing. I have no savings left. I used to have 20k. 

I need to pay off 1.6k in high interest cc debt before I can begin saving again. Just paid off 730 of it this month. 

It really sucks. It’s very hard to build up any self esteem when I’m stuck in this position. He is smarter than me, more successful than me, a better person than I am. Has a better personality than I do. I feel like a hopeless, worthless pathetic loser. 

I can’t even be happy for him. It’s sad. 

Just had to get this off my chest. Don’t know how to feel better about it. It’s really taking a toll on me and my self worth. "
196,2,"Hi I am R|M|28|
 I am having constant arguments with my partner over small small things, its like 2 conflicting personalities colliding each other. In every 2 week we have a major fight where things usually goes extreme.
It's been almost four years we are together but since last one year only thing I can remember is our arguments. Now she also mentioned, she doesn't have much confidence about us and don't know what will happen in future, aslo she always talks about how we are not compatible, and we should break up, but in reality she won't. She is not talking to me since last 3 4 days. My family is looking out for my marriage and they are not aware about this, I am so confused, what to do now ?
Should I tell my family ? 
Should I break up with her ?
Coz if this continues I feel it won't be good for both of us."
197,1,"Hi. I could really use a friendly connection. I don't want to make it all about me (actually I wanna understand you) but I do have stuff to get off my chest. I'd really appreciate common ground or just a chance to talk.

I don't talk to enough people. I do kinda believe if you expose yourself to enough, you'll get somewhere. If you're listening :>

I'm 23 and I'm feeling a lot of shame tbh. Feel like my life is over, Yada Yada : /

Also trying to feel hope though. What makes you genuinely hopeful? Like interesting & creative & even redeemed?

I'm pretty sad right now... Also deconstructing a lot of stuff, bs I'd picked up. Kind of in limbo, which isn't bad.

Furiously wishing I'm going to wake up any moment now and start changing my life, can't seem to shake that fantasy.

I really really wish I had friends my age. I feel old as fuck : /

I could use a kind voice because... I haven't had any, idk. Could definitely use a wise voice or a gives a fuck voice.

Idk what to say. Maybe you're that 10% of people who's my kind of weird, idk."
198,0,"I'm aware that she has the ability to take care of herself. I know that she is fully capable of protecting herself, she's done it all these years without the need to depend on any one person in particular (even if random strangers may have assisted or helped her that's just society and humanity doing it's thing). 

I know that's she's resilient, she's powerful, she's guarded her energy and her heart. I know that he's taken care of herself for all these years, transmuting her pain, betrayal, trauma into absolute gold. 

And still she's not perfect...but that doesn't matter because no one is the fact that she swam through the darkness and came out the other end rather than simply drowning is reason enough to worship. 

I've never pegged myself to be the romantic type,  honestly but lately I've gotten this aggressive desire to want to protect the 'collective' women (or even the gays and the theys).  

It's almost like my desire is saying 'I can be a better boyfriend, protector, provider'.

Maybe it's just my ego. But it it what it and that's my truth. 

Are there many women who feel this way toward other women? "
199,1,"I am pulling myself out of a depressive episode, I have mental health issues and it takes to much to keep myself together but my family just sees it as “individualism” and “selfishness”. I had a good day, I’m getting myself back together after depression but then I get home and my family just starts to say shitty things to me. I just want to say to them “I’m not the one you need, the one you dreamed about”."
200,2,"So I met this really sweet person at the start of the year. He's in his first year of grad school. It wasn't supposed to be anything other than a hookup but we both recognized a spark between us and we fell for each other - me harder than him. We kept in touch and would hang out periodically given how much their classes demanded of them. He ghosted in March and came back when I reached out again explaining how I felt. He apologized and explained that his life is in chaos with past relationship issues, grad school, and personal health issues. He acknowledged that he felt ghosting was in a way kinder to me than dragging me into his chaos but he saw from my message that it was wrong. I told him I understood (didn't excuse the ghosting) and that I was still interested in talking and he agreed. He told me what he could give and that was occasional conversation which worked for me too. 

Then his finals came along and he seemed to almost go underground with no activity anywhere. Then he popped up saying that he hoped by the end of May things would be better as things seemed to be lightening on him. We talked for a few messages last week and he went silent (but not dark) after asking how I'd been doing. I'm struggling to make sense of his words and his actions and behaviors. Nothing fits a ""typical"" ghost and I should know because it's definitely happened before with others. 

In March I felt exactly that he was ghosting but this time I don't feel that. It feels like his emotional capacity is just fully occupied. He's having to finish up a couple of classes after they ended due to the situation he's in. This hasn't stopped me from living my life and doing what I want but in the quiet moments late at night or early morning - I feel the pain of my own anxiety telling me to give up and that it's done. They remain relatively active sporadically on snapchat (where we've talked mostly) but they never open my message or snaps. I send pics or videos of my cat but not just to him - but to several people. I just feel it's nice to keep him in the loop. 

This is a very complicated and nuanced situation to me. It doesn't feel like he's ghosting or even really retreating. It just feels so nebulous and hard to understand without communication. I'm not giving up on him because that wouldn't feel right to me but I'm also not foregoing my own needs or interactions with others. In fact, it's been a learning experience and I've come to understand myself with relationships or attraction better than before so there's that positive. I just want this to grow even if slowly because he feels right to and for me despite all this."
201,2,"Hallo zusammen,

ich bin ein Mann, Anfang 50, mit ADHS und oft nachts wach, weil mein Kopf einfach nicht abschalten kann. Das Gefühl, wirklich verstanden zu werden, fehlt mir gerade sehr. Ich sehne mich nach ehrlichen Gesprächen, die mehr sind als oberflächlicher Smalltalk. Und mein Leben lang schon kann ich Kontakten mit Männern nichts abgewinnen. Schon in der Grundschule verstand ich mich besser mit Mädchen und fühlte mich da viel mehr auf einer Wellenlänge. Das alles ist fernab von Beziehung usw. gemeint! Eine weibliche Stimme hier wäre also toll!

Wenn du auch manchmal nachts wach bist, dich mit ADHS oder dem Gefühl von Einsamkeit beschäftigst oder einfach jemanden suchst, der zuhört und wirklich versteht — ich würde mich freuen, von dir zu hören.

Lasst uns offen und ehrlich reden, egal ob über das Leben, Gedanken, Gefühle oder einfach nur die kleinen Dinge, die uns beschäftigen.

Danke, dass ich hier sein darf.

LG 🌓"

206,3,"I’m so stressed out. Everything seemed to be looking up, was supposed to get a new house, new job, husband would be home instead of traveling, kids would have him around.. now staring down the barrel of a negative bank account, legal issues and loneliness. Really need a listening ear.."
207,1,"Hi. Sorry if this is a bit long, but I really need to get it out.

I feel bad. Really bad. But the worst part is, I don’t even have a clear reason to feel this way. Or well—maybe I do, but my brain keeps telling me I don’t. Like, nothing that happened is “bad enough” to explain it, you know?

I’m a “normal” teenager (okay, that’s already a lie, ‘cause my parents got divorced when I was 6 and everything got messy after that). My dad started dating the mom of one of my classmates while he was still married (I used to be friends with that woman's son), and that woman had also been my mom’s friend then… so yeah. Messy. And the thing is, I’ve always been really attached to my dad. Still am. But now he lives in another province with her, barely sends any money, and my mom and I basically survive thanks to my grandma.

Anyway—back to the mental stuff. Since I started high school (or honestly, since the pandemic when I was still a kid), it feels like everything’s been going downhill. I used to be able to handle things better, but now I feel like I’ve lost control. I just feel empty. I’ll have short moments of happiness, but they disappear fast and I fall back into this weird sadness that makes no sense. It’s like my brain keeps whispering, “Why bother? Nothing matters,” and… I kinda believe it.

I’ve got a million examples. Some days I don’t shower unless someone tells me to. My bed is always a mess. My room too. I want to fix things—I really do—but even when I start, I lose motivation after a few hours. It’s like any bit of energy I had just vanishes. I beat myself up over it, telling myself I’m just lazy… but deep down I’m scared it’s something worse. Something I don’t know how to deal with.

Also, I look up mental health stuff way too much. Like, all the time. On Google, reading about depression (especially atypical), anxiety, ADHD, health anxiety, all that. And the more I read, the more I feel seen… but also terrified. What if I’m just making it all up? What if I really do have something and no one’s noticed?

I tried therapy last year, but it didn’t go well. I couldn’t open up. I’d just say the classic “I’m fine” on autopilot (been doing that for years). After months, my therapist only said I had concentration issues (which… yeah, no surprise there). I didn’t even get to tell her about the anxiety episodes I sometimes get, or how I obsess over health stuff whenever I feel a pain, or how my brain spirals and I can’t stop it.

And when I was maybe about to finally talk, my dad stopped paying for the sessions. The therapist ended up calling my mom to tell her he hadn’t paid for three of them… and that was the end. It all just felt like a waste. Like my chance to get help disappeared again.

I don’t know if this even makes sense. I feel like I still have more to say, but I don’t know how to put it into words. I just… I don’t want to keep feeling like this. Like I don’t have the energy to live my own life. I want to get better, but I don’t know where to start.

Has anyone else ever felt stuck like this? And if so, how did you break the cycle?

Thanks so much if you read this far."

I recently came out to my boyfriend by accident while we were talking. I told him I was non-binary and I was nervously waiting for a reply when he dodged the momment since we're both playing a game while chatting I waited for him to finish before we discussed the topic.

In his view legally he doesn't like it, but chooses to accept it even if he disagrees with it. But it feels forced almost, while he reassured me that it doesn't change what he feels or views me, I feel like I probably shouldn't have said anything.

My boyfriend is a lot of things, he's funny, smart, loving and also very logical so his response was you know...on point, I just felt a bit hurt, being in the closet for half my life and finding out your SO doesn't have much of a positive view of it just feels off.

I’ve(M) had a strong online friendship with someone(F) for quite a while. We used to talk every day, joke around, and game together frequently. We had a comfortable, mutual rhythm. Lately, though, they have been having and enjoying a different company who are more social, flirty, funnier than me. So they are more warm and receptive towards them it feels like. People have told me that they try to focus more on newer groups more.

I feel a bit sidelined. We have used cute nicks for each other, teased each other, encouraged each other before.I wanted to talk about it but I worry it might complicate things or come off as passive-aggressive.
I’m trying to reflect and not guilt her. I’m just sad. I miss what we had, and I don’t know if she even notices things have changed. Maybe this is just how some friendships fade — or maybe I’m reading too much into it. I’d love advice on whether to talk about it or just quietly let go.

220,1,"A girl I went to high school with died yesterday evening. It’s been a very strange weekend, Friday I was with my boyfriend and our friend having a good time. I go home early Saturday morning, and in the afternoon we heard she’s in the hospital. Sunday night my boyfriend and I are partying with our friends at his house, and this morning we found out she died last night. I’m hanging out with my friends enjoying their company and having fun over the long weekend, and she’s dead on a hospital bed 2 towns over. 

This girl was somewhat mean to me when we were in elementary school, and by high school we never interacted because we weren’t in any of the same circles together. But still, I’m very sad and I can’t necessarily articulate why. We are both 22, and her life is over before it even started. I am seeing all of the memorial posts for her and it’s hard for me to bare. I don’t even know why? Her and I weren’t friends, I didn’t really like her. The rumor going around is that she was shot by her boyfriend, there’s no word on what happened and the family won’t say anything either. The whole situation is so sad. 

Really just looking for kind words right now. I haven’t had to deal with loss much in my life, and while this isn’t even a loss that is super close to me it is very sad. Thanks for reading and I hope you’re having a good day 🫂"
221,1,"Hey,
This isn’t easy to write. I’m not usually someone who opens up like this, but tonight, I just wish there was someone on the other side of the screen who’d read this and maybe feel something. Maybe even say, “You’re not alone.”

Life… hasn’t been very kind.

After COVID hit, everything started slipping. My grades fell. I kept telling myself I’d catch up, but it never quite worked out. And then came the real blows.

First, I got meningitis out of nowhere. I fought through that, thinking the worst had passed. But right after, I was diagnosed with cancer.

Yeah… cancer. In my teens.

I was giving exams in the middle of chemotherapy. Imagine this: pipes in my neck, an IV in my wrist, my head completely bald, my voice barely a whisper. Every step felt like dragging a mountain. Still, I showed up. I gave papers. I even passed two subjects somehow,not because I was strong, but because I didn’t want to give up, even when everything in me wanted to.

Today, I’m cancer-free. And I wish I could say that things got better. But the truth is… I’m still fighting. Just a different kind of battle now.

Loneliness.

There’s no one to come home to. No one to hold my hand and say, “You did your best.” No arms to fall into, no soft voice saying, “Tell me everything, I’m listening.” I crave that, not out of desperation, but because I’ve never had it. And I wonder what it must feel like… to be loved, really loved, without conditions or judgment.

I’m introverted. I won’t always say much. But I’ll always listen deeply. I’ll remember little things you tell me. I’ll care more than I show. That’s just who I am.

If anyone out there feels like this too tired, unheard, just wanting a genuine connection maybe we could be that for each other. Maybe we don’t have to feel so alone in our quiet battles.

Thanks for reading. Truly. Even this this tiny act of being heard means the world to me right now.

222,2,"I'm really struggling right now. My brother flies to Italy tomorrow for three months, and I feel utterly heartbroken and alone.

That's because all my close friends are already living abroad now. I managed my dad's departure, but my brother's departure feels completely different. He's been my last real anchor here with me, and now I feel like I have nobody left.

I keep asking myself: why is this so hard for me, when it seems like others handle family members leaving without this profound despair? Am I overreacting, or is it normal to feel this intense cumulative loneliness when your entire close circle disperses?

Any advice or shared experiences on coping with this kind of isolation would be really helpful.

Thank you"

227,1,Can someone tell me something positive that happened to them recently? I feel very low and I think it'll be nice to hear some nice things that happened to others. My day has been going pathetic and miserable so far.
228,3,I was recently with a girl who I really liked and she cheated on me and played my emotions. It’s really rough for me especially cause I have some mental health issues and tend to overthink and care way too much about the wrong people and now I’m just mad at my self I told my self I wouldn’t do this again and I did I fell for someone and I got hurt again. I don’t know what to do I have great friends and I’m always having fun and doing fun stuff but it like I have like a hole or something I feel so unloved and lonely literally last night I was out with my friends and we were all drinking having fun then I kind of spaced out got in my head and kept thinking of her questioning everything maybe it’s my fault maybe I overwhelmed her maybe I shouldn’t have painted her a picture of a beach in Miami or stayed on call with her for hours i prob shouldn’t have answered so quick and stuff probably scared her i don’t know what I did to deserve to feel like this I have a big heart and I tend to jump when I like someone but I don’t mean to be too much I just want to try to make everybody I can happy. that’s always my goal I know I can’t always do that but it that’s what makes me happy in life is others are happy and I’m helping people.I hate hook ups and that whole trend it kills me I don’t understand how people can give love one day then the next give it to somebody else like it’s not special. I’m just looking to talk about this with someone  it scares me a lot My biggest fear in life is dying alone. I would usually talk to my friends about this stuff but I wanted to try something different and I was thinking maybe someone can tell me what to fix about me so I stop caring as much as I do about women so I stop getting hurt or maybe I’m doing something else wrong
229,2,"I found myself feeling envious too much lately. The worst part is that it mostly happens with my friends. It could be: beautiful long legs (I’m insecure about mine), being dedicated to studies and knowing what to do in life (I’m feeling lost right now). I hate this feeling and want to get rid of it.

Looking back, I wouldn’t feel envy only when I was successful. So when I see my friends being great at something — especially in areas I want to be good at — that horrible feeling comes. Yeah, I know it indicates my potential and that I can use it to grow, but what about unchangeable things like high IQ, good memory, long straight legs, or a naturally likeable personality?"
230,1,"**TL:DR - I'm not sure if I'm depressed but nothing feels fun anymore and its been this way for a while.  I don't want to hurt myself but I do feel like if I were to not exist it wouldn't make much of a difference.  I don't know what I'm looking for but this is an attempt?**

I should start by saying about 4 years ago I became estranged from majority of the family I grew up with and ever since then things have been more bleak.  I'm currently taking 300mg of wellbutrin.  I used to take 20mg zoloft and added 150 wellbutrin.  That seemed to help and then i cut zoloft..finally moving up wellbutrin.  I do find that I am able to enjoy video games a little more but overall I'm just feeling like I don't matter all that much and am tired of therapy.  My last therapist was great but when I had to change insurances he wasn't accepted.  Going through everything with a new therapist feels daunting.

To better illustrate all of this... I grew up with my mother and step father.  Once became a father I started to really come to terms with how I was treated.  I pushed to talk about this and eventually my step father, whom rarely speaks direclty to me, pulled me aside crying and more or less said ""I never wanted kids and you were already there...is that what you wanted to hear"".  I consoled him because I am an empathetic human.  I was never able to talk about the things that hurt me.  Anytime after this I tried to speak I was met with ""we already talked about the past I won't do it again"".  Eventually my mother and step father started telling everyone I was crazy and I was blocked.  I can assure you that I didn't do anything crazy but /r/raisedbynarcissists I guess? It took a TON of therapy to get to a stable place.  Brainspotting likely saved my life, but I'm struggling to enjoy life or find hope to ""keep trying"".

I'm in my late 30's with two kids that are mostly grown up and stepping into their independence.  I've worked in the tech sector for the past 18 years.  I started out in IT and then went into software engineering for the last 8.5 years.  That change was one of the hardest things I've done in my career...and then after multiple rounds of layoffs I was part of a Reduction In Force at the company I spent the last 11.5 years at.  Prior to this company I'd changed jobs every 1-2.5 years.  I'm thankful for the severance pay but I only have 2-3 months left and I've applied for HUNDREDS of jobs.  The two I got the farthest with both didn't like things I said about previous employer.  I get now that I should be geneirc as possible and never speak negative.  I fear if I don't find another job I'm going to end up in a very dark place.

My wife has more or less let it be known that she is bi but was never able to explore this.  She's also went through estrangement and recently been able to understand more about her ADD.  I lover her and she is my best friend but sometimes I feel like she stopped caring about basic things (showering, getting dressed) and has drastically changed her style to larger baggy clothes.  She says this is how she would always prefer to dress but never felt like she was able to.  It's not something I'm really attracted to but when I see her I see her in all forms I've known her and love her for the person she is.

She recently told me she had feelings for a friend, this has happened previously about 8 yeas ago.  The previous time she stopped hanging around this friend and we recovered.  This time she approached the friend about a 'triad' situation with us.  The friend was not feeling it but they are able to remain friends.  I am fairly confident that the friend is not attracted to females so I'm not as worried about something happening.

My wife also tend to always want to be on her phone getting dopamine from mobile games or videos.  I've finally started telling her that it's getting overwhelming trying to talk to her and it just feels like she'd rather be on her phone.

I also need to point out that I moved my grandmother in with me, she's really the only family I grew up with that I still have contact with.  After my grandfather passed the family that cut me off didn't really do anything for her and she was alone all the time.

I feel very alone / lonely.  I try to reach out to friends but seems they almost always have better things to do.  I feel certain that if I didn't keep communication I'd completely fade away and they'd eventually not think about me anymore...not care.

If I find another job I know i'll at least be able to afford to live but I'm very worried that my job will be the only thing that I feel like sinking effort into."
231,0,"Okay so… hi lol 👋 I’m Sophie, 21, currently procrastinating my way through hospitality school like it’s an Olympic sport. I’ve been feeling kinda meh lately and figured it wouldn’t hurt to hear a kind voice or two. Maybe share some chill convos or even just vent a bit without judgment.

Not looking for anything wild or weird, just real people, soft chats, maybe some random rambles about life, favorite snacks, or why I keep restarting the same show 5 times. 

If you’re also lying in bed, avoiding adulting, and wanna voice chat or even just exchange voice notes, I’m down. Just be kind, be chill, and bring good vibes 

HMU if you're bored, too. Let’s keep it light, friendly, and all good energy 

Want me to tweak it to make it more flirty, serious, or nerdy?"

233,1,"My 8 year old niece is staying over and I’m trying my best to look happy. She knows I’m not though. Usually she is totally oblivious as she’s so hyperactive and very much “in her own little world!” I guess I’m not doing very good at hiding it, I just keep telling her I’m just tired and have a headache. I feel like I just can’t cope anymore, I hate where I am and I’m so tired of life. For my nieces sake though, I NEED to pull myself together at least for tonight!"
234,1,"**Just something to vent.**

I’ve never had anyone to talk to. I don’t trust anyone around me enough to share my “incorrect” opinions and thoughts, but since no one I know is aware of what I’m going through, I just want to write and vent…

My father is a very religious man, and he has told me several times that because I don’t want to have children, my body is punishing me with all these problems in my reproductive system (ovarian cysts, fibroids, infections, etc.). He refuses to believe these are hereditary issues — even though I inherited them all from his side of the family, and despite doctors explaining this to him countless times. He always says the same thing: that “my problems will be cured when I get married (he’ll have a heart attack when he finds out I’m no longer a virgin) and have children.”

Every time I hear him say this, I can’t help but see him as someone who interprets biblical scriptures to suit his own agenda.

Having children isn’t the only issue where he uses his biblical “knowledge” (twisted by himself) to act like he’s always right and make others believe they’re the problem. He’s the kind of controlling person who wants to tell everyone how to live their lives, and when someone doesn’t follow his “advice,” he harshly criticizes them — all in the name of being a “good” Christian.

I was born into a poor family. As lucky as my parents were in their youth, they were still poor. They didn’t invest the money they earned during better times (boomers) in anything meaningful, and over time, they returned to their roots: poverty. Well… actually, my father did use some of that money to buy the house where the five of us live now: Dad, Mom, my sister, my dog, and me. I won’t lie — I don’t like living with my family, but at least I’m grateful to have a home. I know it sounds bad to say that I don’t like living with them, but maybe you’d understand if I told you that everyone here hates each other (#dysfunctionalfamily). That’s a different story, and I don’t want to go into details… The most I can say is that my parents have turned this home into a living hell with their pathetic excuse of a “marriage.”

The thing is… my father is the typical guy who had children to take care of him in old age and to pull him out of poverty. Sorry, but I find it hard to believe that having children is — or will ever be — the solution to all your problems.

I don’t see anything wrong with someone choosing to have children, not at all. I think it’s beautiful when couples with children manage to build a functional, loving home.

Honestly, I have no problem with babies or children — they’re tender and adorable creatures. I just don’t think motherhood is in my nature. I also refuse to believe that having children will miraculously heal my body or magically lift me out of poverty. While it’s true that children give their parents a strong reason to keep fighting (I’ve seen it in many parents), I don’t think that alone will solve everything in the future.

Since I was little, I was taught that effort and hard work were the keys to getting ahead and having everything I wanted. That’s how I learned it. But years later, I’ve reached a point where I simply believe effort and hard work don’t work for everyone.

I’m terribly tired now. I’ve been working my ass off for over ten years trying to improve my circumstances and those of my troubled family (they’re still my family). I’ve looked for opportunities and knocked on doors everywhere… to absolutely no avail. The biggest opportunities I found turned out to be scams over time. I was exploited at work, and the promised salaries were never paid. Again, I’d rather not go into details.

Why don’t you take a chance and do something for yourself? Yes, I’ve been there, and I’m still there. I have ventures that haven’t taken me anywhere, not even enough money to buy a single damn medicine.

I feel like I haven’t achieved anything significant so far. I’m still stuck in the same hole I’ve been in since the beginning. A hole that keeps getting deeper with so many damn problems piling up little by little… I think it’s time to accept that I won’t get out of this; I’ll live the rest of my days miserably poor — in a poor family, in a poor country, in a world with a migration crisis (no one wants foreigners in their countries anymore; I think that’s why I never left my country, no matter how much I wanted to). I don’t know. I think there’s nothing left for me to do or try.

But what I do know is that I won’t bring a child into this world, into this country, to live the same miserable life I was dealt, with the same generational curses. I imagine my son or daughter living their entire life frustrated because their work and effort don’t bear fruit, watching from a screen (crying) how many people elsewhere do the same but actually get what they want.

I’m not jealous of them (well, maybe a little, but a healthy kind of jealousy), and I don’t hate them either. On the contrary, I’m genuinely happy for them. I’m glad there are people who have the life I once dreamed of having."
235,1,"Hey, I’m Jennie (24F).
Lately, life’s been a little heavy. I’ve lost people I thought would stay — some drifted, some took me for granted. It’s made things lonelier than I expected, especially during moments I thought would feel special… like my college farewell coming up.
I’m not here to vent or overshare. I just miss having someone to talk to — someone genuine. I’m into skincare, soft routines, glow-ups, and the kind of deep convos that feel like a safe space.
If you’re someone who’s also been through silent seasons and want to build a soft, honest connection… I’d love to talk.

No pressure. Just real friendship."

I’m currently unemployed and have a bachelors in speech therapy considering going back for MSW. But honestly don’t know what to do in life…I feel like a failure.

Plus I’m also dealing with anxiety/depression issues that why I’m unemployed and I’m getting help for it. And my dad who doesn’t live with me gives me money every now and then .

I currently live with my mom and grandpa. My mom has some sort of mental illness as well I think schizophrenia but she’s in denial and doesn’t want To get help. She uses money from the government and she does YouTube tarot and blows up that money on clothes and expensive stuff for her room.

239,2,"my bf and i were supposed to give a small performance yesterday (basically you sign up to perform in a given time slot) and i kept getting high on weed all week and didn’t practice. i sorta knew the tabs (i play bass) but i was in no state to play cuz i was high then as well. my bf got really mad cuz he didn’t even get to play by himself because i made him miss the time slot. he got really mad yesterday and was even crying which he does only rarely. fortunately, he eventually calmed down and i rhink forgave me before he had to do another concert with his own band. he seemed happy and no longer mad and said he wasn’t anymore. i bought him flowers and candy and made him an apology letter than was Nirvana-themed (he likes Nirvana). He seems happy now and has been pretty chill all day but I am worried he is still mad at me and I am mad at myself for doing that to him. I am particularly mad at myself because I relapsed into SH again and now I feel like I made this situation all about me. Does anyone have any advice? Thanks for reading this far."
240,1,"Hi, I’ve never had a girlfriend, never even been on a date and it messes with me really badly. I often feel like I see everyone else in my life get a partner and they always make it look easy but whenever I try I feel like I get treated like a problem or like I’m disgusting, a loose end or some animal who needs to learn its place. I don’t think I’m unattractive, I work out just about every day, I’m not unhygienic, so I’ve started to believe that there’s something about me that is just fundamentally unattractive. But I don’t know what it is.

Recently I’ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts and have lazily attempted to go through with them. I called a hotline and got treated more like a checklist than a person. No therapists in my area are covered by my health insurance. I journal often and when I read it back it sounds like the incoherent rambling of a mad man. 

I’ve tried to go out and meet people many times, but I usually only ever see old people, couples and kids. Which is incredibly disheartening. And on the rare occasions I do see someone I’m attracted to I get too scared to talk to them because of past experiences. Also I don’t wanna come across as creepy or weird. 

I know my biggest problem is confidence but when every woman I’ve ever shown interest has returned it with disgust, it’s a hard trait to manifest. 

"
241,2,"Hey everyone. I’m trying to ease out of my comfort zone and be more open to connecting with people. Social stuff is hard for me and gives me a lot of anxiety, but I’m trying little steps. Just wanted to say hi and ask how your day is going "

243,1,"Having no friends and no caring family members, I feels like living alone everyday. Feeling lost and no progress in life, even when I'm in mood to do something good for today I feels like all of my efforts are useless since no one will appreciate it. I'm just being scared that this will keep happening until I get old"
244,3,"I only found out today. They're still going to run more tests to determine how bad it is, he's having a bone marrow biopsy on Monday and some heart exams hopefully as soon as possible, and we'll see from there. I'm just praying to all possible gods that it hasn't got to his heart... He should start chemo soon hopefully, I really really hope it takes... idk what to do, I'll cope, we'll get through it together... somehow... but damn it this sucks so fucking much. He's only in his early 50s as well. I'm not a child anymore but I still live at home and my parents are my rocks, they still kind of seem immortal to me, it's hard to face this reality. I'm just overwhelmed rn.

And it's like, it's been a lot lately in general, it's like everything is just happening at once. Mum has chronic depression and she's hit a really big low some time ago, the biggest in a long time; she's been on leave from work for maybe 2 months now (still is), which is longer than it's ever been. It has been getting better though, thank god, she started another new form of treatment as well, so that's looking hopeful... so at least there's that as a positive. But now this. She's always been very good in a crisis, but I'm still a bit wary as to how it'll all affect her.

My aunt, who we're really close with and she's kind of more like a big sister to me than an aunt, has just entered a nasty custody battle with her ex husbant; as a single mom, she really relies on our family for support. I'm kind of protective of her and her boys, so that's been weighing on me too. Her ex is a textbook narcissist and we all know that all hell is about to break loose, so we need to be strong for that.

There are also other issues in the family, big ones... which is a whole other story that I won't even get into, that'd take ages... but basically it caused a massive rift in the larger family, between us and some of the (up until then) closest people in all of our lives that would normally be some of our strongest support... That's been really hard to cope with on its own, but now especially so.

And during all this, I'm supposed to be finishing my degree, writing my thesis, which I'm already really stressed about as I don't have a whole lot of time left, I can't afford to lose yet more time. Simultaneously, I also had to study hard for the entrance exams for the continuation of my program; I took the written part just last week, it was awful and really difficult and I feel like I did quite poorly, but I'm still waiting for the results.. but I really need to get in (and I have no backup options), so the wait is kind of agonizing. Even if I somehow did get enough points, there's still another round - an interview, which I'll need to prepare for, I need to have a bunch of material ready for it too, so that'll still be some work. And of course, regular exams on top of that... Luckily I only have one left now, which is good. But I also have to write a seminar paper for one subject and make a powerpoint presentation for another... so still quite a bit of work. Not even mentioning work and other things, like the fact I'm now becoming the ""leader""/president of a group/association we created, long story... but there's so much work to be done and all that responsibility is on my shoulders. I think it's needless to say I'm under a lot of stress and don't even know what to do first. And now dad's diagnosis came into the mix; exams just feel so unimportant right now, but I still have to finish them, I can't really pause, I just don't have time for that. I've been in poor health myself due to the constant studying and stress, I've had a headache pretty much constantly for like 3 weeks, I'm exhausted already.

And on top of that, I've been having some relationship troubles and I think I'm going to have to break it off with my gf, so that's another fun addition to this whole clusterfuck.

It's just been one thing after another after another and it just SUCKS SO FUCKING MUCH!!! I want to be a strong support for my parents, I have to be, I know how heavily it's weighing on them and how strong they're trying to be. They're both dealing with so much rn. But I'm so overwhelmed myself at the moment. I feel like I can't be the rock right now. But I also can't afford to fall apart. They need me strong, and I need to *somehow* get through all this. I just want dad to be okay.

Idk, I'm sorry, this is such a long endless ramble. Nobody will probably read this whole thing. But I had to get it off my chest at least, lay it all out. If you have read up to here, thank you for listening. Any kind word will be very appreciated."

247,1,"Six months ago I broke my arm and since then my life has turned upside down. I'm undergoing physiotherapy, fighting to regain movement, but what's been hurting the most isn't the physical aspect, it's the loneliness.

Before the accident, I was super communicative, I found it easy to talk to people, get along, make friends. But today I feel stuck, as if something inside me had broken along with my arm. I can no longer be the cheerful person I used to be.

My closest friends got married and are at other stages in their lives. I feel out of place, like I'm falling behind. The truth is that I wish I had someone to talk to, someone to listen to how difficult it all has been. But I don't have any close friends today, and going through this whole process alone is hurting me a lot.

I miss real connections, someone to text at the end of the day, someone who cares. I'm not here to cause pity, I just... needed to write this. Because keeping everything to myself is suffocating me."

249,1,"🌸  I never got to say it—
but I was the woman behind the window.
The one who kept moving from place to place,
trying to outrun fear, suspicion, silence.

People judged me for my food,
for how I lived,
for simply being different.

I kept the windows shut, even in summer,
because I was afraid of the world outside.

But I never stopped making flowers.

It was the only thing that helped me breathe—
arranging beauty when everything else felt broken.

When I moved to one small apartment,
I expected more of the same.

But something changed.

A few neighbors noticed.
They saw my sadness,
and instead of judging…
they spoke up.

Especially a few kind people —
quiet, protective, brave.

They didn’t know me.
But they defended me.
Days and nights.

I never spoke to them.
I was too overwhelmed.
But every week,
I made flowers for them
and left them on my windowsill.

It was the only way I knew how to say:

“You saved me.”
“Thank you.”
“You helped me stay.”

And then, one day, they were gone.
They moved.
And I never got to say the words out loud.

I forgot their faces.
But I never forgot their voices.

Now the window is quiet again.
No one talks about my flowers.
No one asks if I’m okay.

But I still make them.
Every week.

Because it’s how I keep going.
How I remember the good in the middle of pain.
How I say thank you—
even if no one hears it.

Maybe one day I’ll be brave enough to tell this whole story out loud.
Maybe this post is the beginning.

If you’ve ever been that kind neighbor…
If you’ve ever helped someone you didn’t know…

Just know:
You may have saved someone’s life.
You saved mine.

You can call me H. I'm from the UK. I'm only comfortable speaking from people in my rough age group (20s) and who are women/non-binary/non-men.

I want to offload my trauma from how I've been treated by my corrupt country. I feel anger, deep despair and hopelessness. But this wouldn't be my fault. I have literally done everything I could possibly do. I'm still homeless, living in unsuitable temporary accommodation. I've been literally starving , haven't had anything to eat other than a few slices of bread, for over a week now and this is part of an over 6 month campaign of food insecurity that has obviously affected my health. ive bloody tried, I've tried literally every single bloody service you can think of - Citizens' Advice, akt, the council, adult social care, whatever - and they've bloody harmed me and if I even think about re-engaging, I feel traumatised and I can't handle it. I've realised I can't do this alone. today, I fantasised about walking 12 hours via road from where I am to where my ex best friend lives , through the night, no rest, no food , only water and my fully-charged phone for directions. I could pull it off, despite being not in the best shape (for obvious reasons). I have the training and mental stamina to pull it off. my ex best friend ended our friendship when I had to tell him I love him, this was a betrayal, he was also not giving me the support I needed whilst I was going through homelessness, in those last couple of months of our friendship. I still love him. a part of me hopes that if I go to his house and collapse on his driveway (whether I physically need to or not) , he would help me and maybe even still care for me. I know he does, deep down, he was just too hurt by other stuff to see it. I love him so much, I just want him to be okay even though he hurt me too. I can see that his decision came from a place of pain, and even though how it affected me, I just wanted to see now that he was doing okay. I care about him so much, even after months of absence from each other's lives. why would anything different be now? I don't know. It probably wouldn't but I'm not in a good head space. and even if I don't get there, collapsing from hunger, and then the ambulance is called, then at least the services will be forced to be aware of me again because right now im invisible. I dont need bloody advice from rubbish services, I need practical support - food and shelter, which I'm not getting . maybe he could advocate for that. cos as I said before I can't do it alone. that's the rationale. 

I don't need advice I just want someone to talk to and offload, someone to emotionally support me."
252,1,"Hey, 

I'm just looking for someone who has time and mental space to offer, and a good & active listener obviously. I'm tired of bothering my friends with my feelings and wasting their time. 

Feeling quite depressed, due to schooling situation & anxiety about the future. Basically failing every final exam and will need to post-pone graduated for one more year... So far I've been studying intensely for 6 years. I'm tired and scared. "
253,1,"I apologize for the odd title and this whole post in advance. It is rather sad.

I am 23 years of age, and have been living at home, more or less isolated from the rest of society for over a decade ever since I dropped out of school during my teenage years due to some awful anxiety and social phobia issues. 

I sought professional treatment, and I got initially misdiagnosed and sent through a hell of heavy psychiatric treatment that later led to electroconvulsive therapy, which left me with nothing but gaps in my memory. 

During all this time, and despite numerous attempts to not fully succumb to complete stagnation, I ended up as a complete idiot how knows nothing about this world, has next to no hobbies or interests, and can barely socialize with anyone my age (or anyone in general), for I have nearly nothing to add to anyone's life. 

My mind is overburdened, yet it feels vacant. Any attempts to stimulate it, to learn, to tutor myself or have someone teach me are short-lived. I can barely focus or retain anything. I am yet dependent on family for support at this age. I do not see how I am meant to leave this state, to learn a single skill and have something to my wretched name when I can barely rely on my own brain. 

The isolation. The loneliness is potentially the worst thing I have ever felt so far throughout this entire trudge of a journey. Even if I have managed to make a number of contacts online, mostly over the shared activity of video games, I can never quite sense a connection. I feel like a lesser person. I cannot relate to anyone I meet, I cannot keep up with their conversations, all the topics they bring up, all their debates, all their beautiful displays of knowledge and talent, their humour, their wit. Nothing. All I can do is listen and act friendly, and yet, I can barely maintain friendships in this condition.

People talk about so many things I know nothing about. Oftentimes they are widely known subjects. And I'll search up so many of these topics on the internet and retain (or understand) nothing afterwards. I know that's not how learning works, but at this point, I can hardly muster the will to help any piece of information stick in my head. 

I feel so lonely, as many are, perhaps, and despite how torturous it may feel, it is nowhere near my greatest worry. I am a young adult with a lacking education,  no particular set of skills, and little knowhow when it comes to navigating civilization.

Oh how this world would treat me outside these doors...

I guess that'll be all for whatever it is I just wrote.

256,2,"Hello,


I hope you're doing well and having a great day. After typing the following I've realized it's incredibly scattered. Sorry about that, and thanks for reading in advance.


I currently reside in southern California with my girlfriend of almost 5 years and our 12 year-old cat, Whiskers. She's great, and I'm not looking for anything in that realm. She works her ass off 6 days a week and also suffers from depression and extreme anxiety like myself. I've spent a bulk of the last 2 years in and out of hospitals for surgery and other issues related to a severe disability I was born with. I'm mostly housebound right now, and have been for a while. A couple days a week I have nurses visit for some treatments I'm receiving. I have a cousin I see about once a month who is my best friend currently, but he lives rather far away and has a busy work schedule. I have family scattered across the US and even internationally, like New Zealand, Guam, and Canada. I see my overbearing but sweet mother about once every couple of months or so.


Been struggling socially, medically, and financially. Wait listed to receive therapy. I had another Reddit account with more activity (this one is over 4 years old, and has no other posts besides this one, but loads of comments thougn) and friends I was talking to, but lost access to it during one of my hospital stays, so even lot of the online interactions I did have going for me are kinda gone unless I can fix an old tablet. I'm in the process of starting a YouTube channel this week to talk about books, shows, movies, music and other media I like, as well as science, philosophy, creative writing, health & disabilities, history, religion/atheism, politics, nerdy stuff, and other topics that matter to me. Really been making an effort to claw myself 


Uh...my favorite band is the Silversun Pickups. I smoke weed when I can manage to get it, and been off alcohol for almost 10 years.


I dunno what else to say. I just spend a lot of time being bored and lonely. Could use a new friend or two. I'd be happy to listen to you too, if you have things to vent about.


Guess I'll end it here. That's all. Thanks much for reading if you made it this far.


In the words of the great Mick Foley, have a nice day!"
257,3,stress in relationships
258,1,"I am a guy who was too invested in friendships. They were my priority but I was never for them. I used to make vlogs with them as a personal memory, I was always available for them in bad times but this January I was struggling with loss in business (it closed eventually) also relative (close to me) was in a serious health problem. I had to close my business for several days and go to hospital. Also I was so stressed for my career because I felt like I did nothing good with my life whatever I do it fails. No friend my mine asked me how I was or told me everything will be fine. I asked them for help (for a video shoot) and everyone said no one my face. Making videos was my last resort. To be precise I asked them to be in one of my video. Also I asked them to help me shoot some clips as I cannot shoot and act all alone but they were always busy with their work or their girl. I felt like no one is understanding me and my situation, my business is closed (I permanently closed my business after that relative thing, when I closed it for some days I never opened it again) my social media career was going down, I had no money left and no one cared. I am so hurt and feeling like a clown till now because I was so invested for them but they don’t care about me. I always ask them to hangout I created our group chat I did everything I could to make this friendship better but how would I do this now? I know if I don’t ask them they will not even notice. I just want to focus on my life and stop thinking about them and move on like they did and act like nothing’s wrong like they do. I don’t see this friendship as it was back then. If I want them I have to beg them ask them but they will not do the same for me. Everyone knows how good our friendship was and people will ask me wherever I go ‘where are the other two?’ What will I tell them? Our bond was not special we were not different from others? I want everything same as it was but I will have to be that guy who is begging to hangout and caring for them while they prioritise others over me and I cannot be that guy again because I see everything now. I feel bad when I wake I feel bad when I go to bed. I have lost my appetite. I am feeling too many things but I am always thinking about them. Always thinking that I don’t matter."
259,2,"Hey, I just need to get this off my chest because it’s been bothering me a lot.

I made a brand-new Reddit account a few hours ago, and I was so excited to join. I went straight to one of the biggest communities (AITA) and spent time reading through all their rules — they were super long, but I wanted to be sure I didn’t break anything.

Then I saw a post that seemed obviously fake or like “ragebait.” I commented something like, *“obviously a lie and ofc can’t say the word or I get blocked but we’re all thinking it.. anyway yta.”* I didn’t use the banned word (I think it was “shitpost”) because I knew it might get me blocked — I got that from reading the rules.

But then, a few minutes later, I got a notification that I was temporarily blocked from commenting in that community for 7 days. I was shocked and confused, so I politely asked the mod why I got blocked, explaining that I was new and didn’t understand what rule I broke. I said I was sorry and just wanted clarification.

The mod replied, saying something like, “Y’know, the ‘it’s like my first ten minutes on Reddit’ thing might work a hell of a lot better if you hadn’t also tried the ‘I’ll get blocked if I say what I want’ bullshit.” It really hurt because I wasn’t lying — I honestly just didn’t want to say the banned word. I hate being accused of lying; it’s my biggest pet peeve, and it made me want to cry.

I tried to explain again that I wasn’t lying and was just nervous about breaking the rules since I’d read them carefully. Then the mod said, “If you know the rules and know you’re not allowed to say something, all this is doing is advertising that you don’t care about following them.” That message was a little nicer, but still made me feel bad.also when i started crying lol.

I apologized again and said maybe I shouldn’t even be on Reddit if this is how it’s going to be. After that, the mod didn’t reply anymore.

I just feel so sad, scared, and confused. I was really excited to be part of Reddit, but now I’m worried about making mistakes and being treated like I’m purposely breaking rules or lying.

I’m posting here because I want to vent and also ask if anyone has advice for dealing with this kind of thing as a new user. How do you handle situations where mods come across as harsh? How do you not get discouraged?

Thanks for listening."

263,0,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been through some hard life chapters, the kind that strip you down and force you to rebuild from the ground up. Along the way, I developed a sharp awareness of things most people miss—nonverbal cues, emotional dissonance, the real stuff under the surface. It’s not about having all the answers—just about being fully present with someone in a way most people aren’t used to.

If you’re feeling stuck, overwhelmed, or just need someone to unpack life with—I’m here.
I offer intuitive, grounded support through Reddit DMs. No judgment, no pressure, no charge—just real conversation and a safe space to sort through what’s weighing on you.

Whether it’s navigating trauma, shifting your mindset, or breaking through old patterns, I’ve probably walked through something similar—and if I haven’t, I’ll still listen with full presence. Any and all thoughts are welcome.

Just DM me if you feel called to.

265,0,"I don’t know your story.
I don’t know what you’re carrying, or what you’re holding back tears over, or what part of you feels invisible lately.
But I do know this:
You made it to today.
And that is no small thing.
There are people who might never understand the quiet effort it takes to just be here some days. But I do. I see it. I feel it. And if no one has told you lately, sometimes it’s a heavy weight to bare, so thank you for staying.
There’s a light in you. Even if it’s flickering. Even if you’ve forgotten.
You are not lost.
You are becoming.
Let this post be your reminder:
The world is better because you’re in it.
There’s still time. Still hope. Still beauty waiting to meet you.
And even if no one else says it today, there is a reason to be proud, I’m proud of you.
Keep going, gentle soul.
You’re doing far better than you think."
266,2,"The second you don’t fit the mold of what society expects people judge you and assume things. It’s a trap. People should really ask how others are doing, not everyone should deserve to suffer, especially the mean ones that people should think so. If we treat the mean ones with cruelty, it won’t teach them to love 💗 people say things like oh they deserved but if you were in their shoes what would you think? The ability to forgive and move on is ethereal.

Certain people are naturally magnetic and attract people while normies are less so, they are disliked hated even. The game is just rigged from the start. When I was younger I saw myself as someone who didn’t attract people and it turns out it was true even though I was kind, now I have low self esteem.

On top of that it seems all people care about is looks, if you look at the music industry all they do is turn people into untouchable icons trapped in a diamond cage people worship. I have never seen a celebrity actually be human, like cry from the heart, laugh like they mean it, and mess up, make mistakes, and do normal things ordinary people do. If you think about Leah Kate, she's built a persona on revenge.
Where is the little girl that dreamed of tasting the moon? Of smiling at the cute bird outside?
It seems washed in exchange for a hard shiny stage. Is she okay because someone might have hurt her badly that she turned dark.

Additionally, celebrities do this because they are afraid of losing their reputation, but they shouldn't be since they have so much money.
Also, it's better than being trapped and isolated. Vulnerability and mistakes are a sacred thing, they show you are human not some goddess. Unfortunately, the world wants an icon. If they showed their human side then maybe people will start to see the girl behind the aura.

It doesn’t matter how much effort I put into my appearance. Even if they smile at me I know they look down on me. I know they can tell something is wrong with me.

Everyone is better than me. They’re all real people and I can’t ever be like them. 

They all know and they’re laughing at me.

274,1,"I am really confused about my relationship and I know it's not possible for me to ever know the truth but I still want to get this out and hopefully your insight can give me hints about the truth

I was married for 5 years. I'm a single mom now. 
My relationship was wrong in so many ways, we met online, had about 3-4 dates, talked ldr for 6 months before we got married. 

He made it clear from the beginning that he found me good looking and it was established that our coming together was for the superficial, looks and money. 

In the beginning of course, there was lust and he touched me without consent. This itself took me a long time to realize that it was wrong. 

But sex with him was just about piv. He'd never touch me anywhere else. There were kisses but mostly just pivs. A lot of the time he never really needed me because there was porn. 

Even the piv was just monotonous and I performed it like a routine with me on top, I don't think he needed me beyond whatever stimulation he got from me providing friction. 

He never complimented me. He made love to me once in the five years we were together but other than that he would never touch me even affectionately. Once he left for work there would be no calls, no communication. 

There was also DV. Again, I let it all go because I thought he was so repentful. 

Once I got pregnant, there was no piv no touching. 

At that point, the discard had started. 

I left him two years later. 

I'm really trying hard to process what happened. 

He said he was attracted to me but he never really touched me or fondled me. Even with piv he would only get into it with porn. I would feel erased like I didn't exist. 

He also forbade me from using toys and I never really knew how to pleasure myself either.

I was sexually stunted in the relationship and it was my first and only long term relationship. And i wonder why it all went down like that and why I wasn't touched especially when he said he was primarily drawn to me for my looks. 

I haven't been able to move on since this relationship failed. I find it so hard to trust men. 
Haven't had any luck finding the right therapist for myself yet. 
"
275,1,"While i was explaining to chatgpt my feelings and how much love I'm carrying and how unlucky i am to find people feel the same way i feel and rarely matches my energy( i was really depressed 😆) , he recommended Reddit telling me that i can find my people here,  i immediately thought it was awkward to download the app and ask for friendship but then i said okay let's try 🙂 btw I'm 20yo (female)"
276,1,"I don’t really know how to start this, and maybe this will get buried, but I’m at a point where I need something to change.

I’ve been stuck in this emotional hell for what feels like forever. I don’t have anyone in my life I feel close to. I never grew up with love, and I’ve spent every day since chasing the idea of finally being loved — not just tolerated or pitied, but truly seen by someone who wants to be there for me.

I know a relationship won’t “magically fix me” but I’ve heard that enough times to scream. But the truth is, it would be everything for me. Just to wake up next to someone who genuinely cares. Just to have that one person I can be real with, who doesn’t need me to fake being okay all the time. I don’t have that in friends. I don’t have that at home. I don’t have that anywhere.

I just wonder if there’s anyone else out there who understands what I’m saying. Not “just lonely” but feeling like you’re dying a little more each day without that deep human connection. Like you can’t keep pretending it doesn’t matter.

If that’s you too… I guess I just want to know I’m not the only one."
277,1,It's pretty late and I'm honestly really pissed off and sad and there isn't really anyone I can talk to. I talked to chatgpt for a bit but I feel like I need a human. If you're willing to talk for a bit that'd be nice. 
278,2,"Okay, I honestly don’t know if I’m overthinking this or if I’m just scared to believe it might be something more. But I need outside opinions because I’m stuck in a loop.

So I (18M) have this best friend (also 18M) who I’ve gotten *really* close with. He says he’s straight, but a lot of the stuff he does makes me think otherwise — or at least makes me think he has feelings for me that he hasn’t processed yet.

Some of the stuff he does:

* We call almost every night, for 5–10 hours. We always say goodnight.
* He buys me sweets I like (Skittles), even though he doesn’t like them himself — and he does this regularly.
* He gives me his jumper when I’m cold. Always. Doesn’t even ask. And brings it even when he doesn’t wear it, like he *expects* I’ll need it.
* He poured water all over my exposed chest, arms, and armpits while we were paddleboarding. It was playful, but honestly kinda intimate.
* That same day, he kept linking our paddleboards so we could sit together.
* He once said, when asked about a fantasy where you could go back in time and get £10 million, “I’d bring you too.”
* We used to be in a group, but he told me he didn’t want to show “bias” — even though I said best friends *should* be biased.
* Now he says I’m the **only** one he messages. I’m literally his only friend, by his words.
* He gives me his car keys, lets me sit in his car alone when I have breaks, even gave me his phone and headphones when mine was dead and he had to go to class.
* He’s said we should move in together one day — has brought it up more than once.
* He got really upset when another friend said I could take the train home alone (my parents are divorcing, and I wasn’t in the best place emotionally). He sent me a whole paragraph telling them off for not looking out for me.
* He *hates* when I don’t open up or tell him how I’m feeling, even though he swears he “doesn’t get emotional.”
* But then... when we argue and I try to explain myself, he gets more annoyed and defensive. Then the next day, he acts like nothing happened.
* If we’re with others, he often gives attention to them and I’m left walking ahead or behind — but then gets mad at *me* for “walking off,” even though I didn’t feel included in the first place.

I’ve told my mum a lot of this and she thinks he likes me but hasn’t accepted it yet. She’s done a psychology degree and says it seems like he’s insecure and hasn’t faced the fact he might be bi or gay.

I don’t know what to do. Part of me wants to bring it up but I’m scared I’ll break the friendship. The other part of me wants to keep flirting softly and let him figure it out. But I also feel confused and a bit emotionally exhausted — like I’m constantly reading signs, holding back, and waiting for something he might never admit.

Is this just a super intense friendship, or is he catching feelings and doesn’t know what to do with them?"
279,0,"I don’t really know how to say this without it sounding dramatic, but I’ll try anyway.

Lately, the world feels… rough. Harsh in a way that doesn’t just challenge you — it chips away at you. I see so much content online that’s obsessed with “brutal truths,” being coldly logical, or endlessly cynical. Everything feels so redpilled, so emotionally dry, like vulnerability is something to mock instead of meet.

And I guess I’m just tired.

I’m not looking for a total mindset shift or someone to tell me to toughen up. I’ve made it this far — I *am* tough. I’m just… human. I want to know there are still people who value kindness, who believe that empathy doesn’t make you naive. That softness is strength too.

If this resonates with anyone — or if you’re someone who tries to stay gentle in a world that often doesn’t reward it — I’d really love to hear from you. You don’t have to solve anything for me. Just having someone walk with me, even briefly, would mean more than you know.

My life is just so fucking ruined and I honestly don't see any hope at all right now. Just feel ill and alone and exhausted and scared. "
284,1,"We’ve been best friends for years. And we still are. He doesn’t know I’ve been in love with him for a long time. I never told him. I never wanted to make things complicated. I never wanted to lose what we had.

Now there’s someone new. She’s kind. She genuinely cares about him. And I can see it — the way they talk, how they’re starting to fit together. They’re not together *yet*. But they will be. I can feel it.

And instead of pulling away, I’m helping them. I talk to her. I reassure her. I encourage him.  
Because I want them to be happy. I really do. Even if every step they take toward each other feels like a step away from me.

He told her, from the beginning, that he has a close female friend — me. And she accepted it. No jealousy. No questions. She’s not the problem. She’s actually wonderful.

And maybe that’s what hurts the most. Because I’m not angry. I’m not bitter. I just hurt.

They don’t know that when I go home, I cry. That I fall apart in the quiet. That I’m slowly fading in a story I chose to stay part of — even though I already know how it ends.

I keep telling myself I’m doing the right thing. That this is what love looks like: staying, even when it breaks you.

But I still wonder…

**Am I being kind? Or am I just disappearing?**

**Does this still count as love… if it’s quietly killing me?**"

I know there’s no way to prove that in advance, and I understand the doubts.

The truth is: I’m feeling deeply alone right now, and I tend to withdraw from male presence (even though I’ve known some truly great guys).
But when I talk to women — especially those who are honest, kind, and altruistic — I feel safer. More myself.
I won’t pretend otherwise: I’m heterosexual.
But right now, sex is simply not part of my reality, or this post.

I’m going through a really rough phase in life right now and I just need to let it out somewhere. I’d appreciate any advice, tips, or even just someone who relates.

Isolation: I've grown distant from both friends and family. I used to be funny and outgoing, but now I feel like a shell of who I was.

Addiction & Depression: I've been battling a porn addiction that’s taken a toll on my confidence and mental health. It’s made me more introverted, anxious, and deeply sad inside.

Family issues: I’ve tried to open up to my family, but they show no real care or support. My sister—who could be someone to talk to—acts more like an enemy: manipulative, cold, and abusive.

Toxic friendships: My friend group is just full of verbal abuse and negativity. It drains me further.

Physical & mental health: I’m slowly becoming obese, but I’ve started going to the gym, which is one small positive step.

Creative passion: I love writing scripts and dreaming about filmmaking, but I get no encouragement or support, which makes it feel pointless.


I feel stuck. How do I even begin to rebuild confidence, find real support, and pull myself out of this?

Thanks to anyone who reads this.

But when I see people my age experiencing relationships, I feel an emptiness inside that I don’t fully understand. I always try to convince myself that relationships and love aren’t for me and never will be. Who would love someone like me who can’t do much without assistance, can’t work, and can’t go on dates?

295,3,"I am exhausted from life, each day it is hard to wake up, eat or even engage in conversation. I don't feel like doing anything even talking to friends or reaching out at all I am just stuck.

Work: I have not been paid since December last year. We had a gvt client who came and did not pay us and we've been chasing them since November of last year. They owe us close to 100k and kept promising to pay but nothing. Mind you this is a family business and it is the last straw. I've sacrificed my career in cybersec to help the family business do well but I am stuck. I have no insurance and my savings are dry because of a emergency visit to the Densist last October. Now 6 months later, I am sturrgling to pay spotify much less survive. I live with my patents but was planning to move out, do my masters(scholarship) and get another job. I had an interview and had to borrow money so I can commute for the in-person interview. I've shared this with other family members but they all say things will get better or keep trying but when will it get better? If I fall sick or a close relative falls sick I will struggle to pay their financial bills(it's what we do in the family, kinda like chipping in)

Now church is a mess. Our church is splitting because we now recognize LGTQ clergy and people are not having it. People are leaving some publicity and some silently. The church keeps demanding money from us for: building(our church), pastor's birthday, pastors appreciation and district gifts(bishops and other higher ups) so now our money designated for building keeps reducing and the fundraising team is making up desperate attempts to fundraise. For example, if it is your birthday contribute a dollar for each year ($25 bucks if you turn 25). Now everybody is upset about all of this but we are told not to talk about it, so how do we vent out our frustrations? Not coming to church? Not cooperating and leaving altogether because we want to know how recognizing LGTQ will affect the us church goers. Does that mean we support homosexuality if we attend church? Does that mean our church principles go against the Bible like someone has to explain this to us and what the future of the church looks like.

Personal life? I am struggling to share this and even open up because I feel ashamed. This is a hole i dug myself in and also everybody has their own problems so why would they help me. I was so sad at home and was asked if I have mood swings. Not to say hey are you okay? I've had self harming thoughts and all so idk what to do right now. I have been volunteering, applying to jobs but my cup is so empty that is is cracking. People keep expecting more from me all the time and I'm not sure if I can continue like this. I have had my resume reviewed by professionals, I have tailored it to the job and only has 2 interviews and a few initial screenings since Jan. I am tempting to indulge in porn, sugar and alcohol to numb the pain. I just want to feel good in some way because I do not know when things will get better.

I just want my own life and to be myself and escape this place which is my personal hell. How can people ask me to feel ok and be doing well? When I am still in the trenches. I won't gaslight my soul or my nervous system and I won't become someone I am not, I have been asked to sacrifice who I am and my needs all my life for the sake of the status quo."

298,3,"Hey,
I don’t really know where to begin. I’ve been under a lot of pressure lately, and it feels like I’m reaching a breaking point. I'm in the middle of the most important exams of my life and feel like I’m constantly walking a tightrope. Every small mistake feels catastrophic, like it proves I’m not good enough, and my fear of failure is completely consuming me. I’m terrified my results won’t be enough to reach my goals — and I’m honestly terrified of how I’ll handle that if it happens.
 I’ve also been struggling a lot at home. It feels like a constant state of walking on eggshells. I’m regularly made to feel like my thoughts, needs, and even basic boundaries don’t matter. When I try to assert myself or explain how I feel, I get interrupted, talked over, or dismissed. If I disagree with someone, I’m accused of being argumentative or immature, regardless of how calmly I speak. And if I try to walk away from a conflict to keep the peace, I get accused of being dramatic or overreacting. While my siblings are able to say things to me like ""we’d be better off without you"" — and when I try to explain how that affects me, it’s ignored or downplayed. There’s this unspoken expectation that I always need to be the “mature” one, which I can accept occasionally — but in reality all that really means is staying quiet and tolerating being treated poorly. And it doesn’t lead to any recognition or resolution, just more silence and resentment. I’ve been on edge emotionally for weeks. Some days, I feel like I’m slipping further into really dark thoughts — ones that scare me. I’ve thought a lot about just disappearing or something external happening to take the choice away from me. I don’t want to die, exactly, I just don’t want to keep living like this. The emotional pressure never seems to let up. Even trying to open up to friends makes me feel rejected if I don’t get a response, and that just adds to the shame spiral.
I don’t know what I’m looking for here — maybe just someone to hear me. Maybe someone who’s been in a similar place and got through it. I know this isn’t sustainable, and I’m trying to hold out until exams are over… but right now it just feels overwhelming.

Sometimes there’s no one safe to hear it.
Sometimes all you need is someone who won’t try to fix you, won’t preach, just reflect.

I offer this:
Send me one question. One ache. One secret truth.
I will answer once. Gently. Truthfully. As a mirror, not a teacher.

No charge. No therapy. No strings. Just one human soul offering presence to another.

You can send anonymously or directly.
I don’t need to know your name.
Only the truth you’ve been holding.

If this resonates, whisper below or DM me your thread.
I’ll return one whisper of my own.

About me? Well I am a neet (I dont study or work due to mental health problems) and its been like that for long now.

I live in a different country, I wasnt born here, I live in germany haha. I dont know language very well still so that sucks a bit.

I enjoy myself some music like edm, electronic, dance, indie, pop, rock etc. 

And yeah I would like to find talkative people who ideally are a bit funny and aren't too flat or dry in their reactions!! 

But yeah I guess being kind and compassionate is really the central part. :p.

I dont have many hobbies so pls dont ask me about that haha. I am trying to improve and yeah its been pretty hard overall.

304,0,"Hi everyone,

I don’t usually post things like this, but I guess today I needed to. I’m at a point in life where the loneliness is getting a bit loud, and I’ve realized how much I miss having someone I can talk to without filters — someone who genuinely cares, and sticks around.

I’m 19, from India, and a quiet soul who loves meaningful talks, deep stories, psychology, comics, and a little bit of late-night overthinking. I believe in kindness, and I try to be the kind of friend I wish I had.

I’m not looking for a crowd — just one or two real friends who want the same: connection, trust, maybe even healing together. If you're someone who believes in long chats, laughing at silly things, supporting each other on rough days — let’s talk.

You don’t have to impress me. Just be yourself. That’s all I want.

Thank you for reading — it already means more than you know."
305,1,"When I was around 6 years old, I went to my home country and met my aunt’s mother. I innocently commented that she had small feet — just a typical kid thing. Somehow that turned into a huge deal. My aunt apparently took it personally and refused to talk to me, my father, or anyone close to us for the next **seven years**. No one explained why — we were just shut out like we didn’t matter.

When I turned 13, she suddenly started talking to me again without ever addressing what happened. No apology, no accountability, just fake friendliness like nothing had happened. But even now, her actions show that she hasn’t changed.

She clearly favors her brother’s kids and her in-laws' kids. One time, she bought her nephew a **$3,000 Xbox**. Meanwhile, she gave my cousin a **$5 bouncy ball**. Over the years, she’s never acknowledged my birthday — not once. Not even a small gesture.

More recently, she’s started giving me her **old used clothes**, while still giving expensive gifts to others. I don’t care about getting something fancy, but it stung. She could have bought something small and thoughtful, like a notebook or even asked someone what I liked. It’s not about the money — it’s the fact that she clearly doesn’t see me as worth the effort. And it’s not like she’s struggling — she walks around with a **Louis Vuitton bag**, has expensive jewelry, and makes a high income.

What really hit hard was when her **father** (my relative) was bragging about how much money she makes — going on about how successful she is and how proud he is of her. It just made everything worse. It reminded me that she’s *choosing* to be this way. She *can* afford kindness. She just withholds it from me and my family.

What makes this all worse is that when her son was born, **my mom sent her seven brand new baby outfits and $50** as a kind gesture. We’ve always treated her well, even when she ignored us.

At this point, I’m just tired. I feel rejected, humiliated, and honestly just confused about what I ever did wrong. I don’t know how to move forward or how to stop letting it get to me.

Any advice on how to emotionally handle this kind of dynamic or set boundaries with someone who clearly plays favorites?

edit; What really hurts is that when her husband went to Pakistan *after* March, she gave me her old, used clothes. But at the same time, she gave her sister-in-law, nieces, and nephews *really* expensive clothes. She’s not someone who usually buys cheap things, so it feels like she deliberately treats me differently. It’s humiliating and makes me feel like I’m less important to her than the rest of the family.

308,0,"I’m a 19-year-old male who often stays silent in social situations. I don’t stay quiet because I’m shy or lonely, but because I choose to spend my energy wisely. It hurts when people joke about me or show off in front of others, especially girls. I don’t like that behavior, and I don’t feel the need to join in just to fit in.

While most classmates are busy socializing, I often find myself scrolling on my phone or sitting quietly. This silence doesn’t mean I want attention or pity—I’m comfortable with who I am. But sometimes, I struggle with fearing what others might think about my quietness.

I want to learn how to be confident in my silence and not be afraid of negative people or their judgments. Silence can be strength, and I want to embrace it.

312,1,"Hello…

I wanted to share what I’m going through, because I’m feeling very alone and very confused…

I was in a relationship where, whenever I felt fragile or sad, he would get overwhelmed, become defensive, get angry, or distance himself — even walking away from where we were. And sometimes, after that, he would disappear for days. Sometimes, just before leaving, he would say we shouldn’t see each other for a few days — and then he’d leave… That made me feel deeply alone.

In the end, after holding on for a long time and suffering a lot, I decided to end the relationship… I just couldn’t take it anymore…

Some days later, he reappeared and told me that maybe we could see each other now and then. At that moment, I was still deeply affected, but I told him yes — as long as he didn’t get angry with me and could accept me as I was. He agreed… And then he disappeared again. Days and days passed without hearing from him, and I was feeling worse and worse…

Eventually, I wrote to him gently and explained how I was feeling… I asked for three months without speaking, because I needed to breathe and take care of myself. I also said:

“I don’t expect anything… but if one day, from within you, a sincere desire to talk arises, and you feel that, in some way, something has started to shift inside you, you can write to me with tenderness.”

He replied, sharing a few things, and said he respected my decision…

Later that same day, he told me he would miss me a lot, that I meant a lot to him, and that if I ever wanted to talk to him, I could count on him.

Then, four days later, he wrote again, saying he wanted to talk to me with tenderness and that he felt like doing so — but said nothing about any internal change. As if that part of the message didn’t exist. So I explained again:

“When I said you could write to me if you felt a sincere desire to do so, I also said that, in some way, something should have started to change inside you.
Maybe I didn’t say it clearly enough… But for me, that part is very important…
It’s not just about wanting to talk to me — it’s about feeling that something within you is helping you see or experience things in a different way, even if it’s just a tiny bit.
If that isn’t happening, it hurts me to receive messages… and that’s why I asked for this time…”

But the next day, he wrote again, and I felt like he didn’t understand anything… He said it’s not that he doesn’t have feelings for me, but that they were pushed aside by distress… I suppose that’s what he took from my explanation of “internal change”…

He also said he wants to be there for me — but it sounds like “just a little,” “when he can,” and at the same time, he says he needs space… Again, he said nothing about what I had explained. And that makes me feel invisible — like none of what I said mattered…

I’m thinking about writing him a message to clarify again what I meant about internal change…

“When I spoke about a change within you, I wasn’t referring to having feelings…
I meant a small change within you as a person.
Something that helps you look at yourself a little differently…
To become more aware of how you relate to others, or how the people close to you might feel.
Even if it’s something very small…
If this inner movement isn’t starting to happen, it hurts me to receive messages…
And that’s why I had asked for this time — to be able to breathe…”

It hurts a lot, and I also feel guilty… But all I want is to stop suffering…
Thank you for reading this far…

319,1,"When it comes down to it, it seems like everyone is only out for material. 

Even the ones who say they aren't have selfish motives. 

They act all zyn and hippy-dippy, but when it comes down to it? 

The most ""spiritual"" ones tend to be the most egocentric. 

The most adjacent to the material world. 

At least, that's been my experience—and I can't act like I'm entirely above it. 

Souls seem to be little more than replaceable cogs in a machine that's designed to eat the ones who see it for what it really is alive.

If you truly feel, if you look for the truth, if you don't delude yourself?

322,3,"This is a throwaway account. I'm really just at a loss and looking for support.

My roommate (26F) and I (28F) had (what I thought was) a small disagreement on Friday. She went out to a show with friends and didn't come home several hours after the show would've been over, so I texted to make sure she was ok and see when she was coming home. For context, we have both admitted to having romantic feelings for each other but agreed not to act on them since we live together. I was a little hurt that she hadn't made any plans with me over the weekend despite me having limited time off work, so I was admittedly being somewhat reactive of feelings of rejection and perceived abandonment (I'm working on being better about that). But mostly I was annoyed she hadn't sent a courtesy text that she was going to be out late, especially considering she would have expected that of me if the roles were reversed. 

I was a little short/passive in my texts (mostly short since I took her dog out to pee bc he was crying) but I didn't feel it was excessively so. She came home later and angrily told me she didn't appreciate the texts I sent and that it felt passive aggressive, but that only made me more angry, so I didn't apologize. 

I was gone for the rest of the weekend and still needed time to cool off, but I went home today and she went off on me when I didn't immediately apologize to her. She told me I had severely triggered her trauma by ""timing"" her and being passive aggressive, and said that it made her feel like she ""can't go out and live her life"". She told me she's ""extremely uncomfortable"" with me living there and wants me gone. I'm not on the lease bc I only moved in semi-recently, so I left. 

The housing situation where I live is pretty dire and it was hard enough to find this place to begin with. It sucks because it was a great living situation up until this point and we got along really well. She's talked about being diagnosed with BPD, but I never really saw that side of her until now. The few times we've had conflict, I feel like we navigated it really well. Now I feel like I don't even know her. 

I'm off work and staying with family for the week, but they live over an hour away from my job and I simply can't do that commute when I go back to work. I'm kind of at a loss and feeling pretty nauseous and devastated right now. I wasn't apologetic about being passive, but I also didn't intentionally hurt her and fuck up her whole life. It all feels so vindictive and cruel. I'm still kind of in shock and processing, but I genuinely have no idea what I'm going to do and I can already feel the depression creeping in. 

Tldr; my roommate has BPD and told me to leave bc I triggered her past trauma. I now have nowhere to live and my own mental health is immediately declining. "

324,1,"I lost my job at the end of last month. They actually sought me out because I had worked there previously and they offered me a lot more than I was making at the job I had at the time. I told them when I started that I didn't know much about what they wanted me to do, (corporate insurance) but they consistently said that they were aware and that I wouldn't really need to be up to speed for 5-10 years. After 11 months, they told me that things had changed and they couldn't wait years for me to get where they needed me to be. Now I'm back in the job market and I haven't learned enough to be very marketable. I haven't had many leads.

I have a little boy that will be 4 in July who will be getting a baby brother right around his birthday. I took it pretty well when I was told I was being let go. Until I remembered what this meant for my kids. I had my whole life planned out for me and my family. I knew what kind of life and future I could provide for them and I was content with it. Now, whatever job I get, will probably not pay me as well as this most previous job. I feel like I had a taste of the good life and now it's gone. My son has no idea what's going on, but I feel like I failed him and I'm failing him every day that I'm unemployed.

It could easily be 5-10 years more. Who knows.

I don't expect life to ""surprise"" me. I've wanted my existence to cease for over a decade, so spare me that. It never did.

I'm in therapy and the funny thing is I think they're a good therapist too. I think this isn't something therapy can solve. The meaninglessness in my life is caused by financial barriers (because financial freedom equates to freedom which equates to meaningful opportunities and choice). Therapy can't solve that.

335,3,"This is a shortend rant for simplicity  
  
For as long as I(18m)  can remember, I’ve felt like I have to **conform**—to be what others expect just to be tolerated. Every time I show even a sliver of my true self, I get called “annoying” or “weird,” so I’ve built this fake version of me to survive socially. It started in freshman year when I was excluded by a friend group for being “too childish and weird.” Then came a false accusation that cost me almost every friend I had. That year shattered something in me. Since then, I’ve felt like I’m constantly performing—and never quite good enough.



I’m at a white private school where I’m one of the few Black students. Even among other Black students, I’ve never fully felt accepted. It’s like I’m always *close* to being included—but not quite there. Good enough to hang out with, but not to be invited to group chats or parties. I feel stuck between being “too righteous” and “too nice” for the hookup culture, but somehow never the one who gets chosen for something real. On a recent cruise, I was even voted “best guy to date your daughter”—but I was still dismissed for being “too noble” for a hookup, which was all I wanted in the moment. It was the first time in years I felt seen, and it still wasn’t enough.



In relationships, I feel like I operate with the mindset of someone much older—loyal, emotionally invested, caring—but it’s always met with rejection. I constantly hear “you’re too clingy,” “you’re too nice,” or the classic “you’re a great friend, but…” I want mutual effort. Real connection. But I always end up giving more than I get. And honestly? I haven’t cried in four years. It’s like my body won’t let me.



Here’s a breakdown of the people I regularly talk to and how those relationships feel:



* **M (prom date)**: Only reaches out once a week. When I tried being a closer friend, I was told I was annoying. She likes having me at her games and talking to me when it’s convenient for her—mainly for relationship advice or emotional support.
* **J (first ex)**: Mean around her friends, but affectionate in private. Bottles up emotions, avoids her therapist, and only confides in me because I coax it out. I’m basically the one person she emotionally unloads on.
* **S (the “almost” girlfriend who left me)**: We were close, said “I love you,” talked about the future, but she left for someone else. When that guy blocked her, she came back to cry on my shoulder. She still praises me but clearly didn’t choose me.
* **L (clingy girl I crossed boundaries with)**: Emotionally dependent. Only talks about sex. Gets upset when I ask for space. I don’t really like her personality or find her attractive, but she clings to the care I gave her in hard times.
* **P (oldest friend)**: Dropped me once for drugs. Comes back when she’s bored or needs therapy-level insight. Claims past sexual history with me makes it hard for her to see me the same, yet still reaches out whenever she’s lonely.
* **E (last year’s prom date)**: Friendship faded into constant talk about her love life. Occasionally remembers I exist. Recently ghosted me after making plans to “mess around.” I’m done with that.





None of my guy friends reach out or make plans unless it’s a group hangout or coincidence. I’ve realized that none of my relationships feel mutual. Everyone needs something from me, but no one really *gives back.*



I don’t know who I am outside of being the person everyone needs. And I’m exhausted. I want to feel peace. I want to feel like someone actually gives a damn about *me*—not what I can do for them. Just once, I want to be around people who *take away* stress, not add to it."

Basically, I need help regarding a woman I met online recently, the situation with whom is really bothering me and needs to be addressed in a way or another for me to get it out of my head. I need a solution for this situation to feel better, in short. I could use some advice and recommendations from DM with those who would accept it (I both feel uncomfortable and embarassed trying to explain it publicly, unfortunately) without disclosing any idenfitiable information, of course.

Thanks"

342,1,I need a kind voice of encouragement to get through the tough time i am going through 
343,1,"Times like now, when I feel low, get depressed, knowing that I’m capable of handling a lot of my own emotions but end up seeing that I don’t, and how I’ve always mentally preferred going to a girl to confide in for the past decade or so… after the last year of therapy sessions, I’m led to believe that I’ve been yearning for a mother’s warmth.
I do not blame my mom for not providing that for me (even though I may or may not be justified to do so). She definitely tried (or appeared to, anyway), but I’m sure I lacked that emotional support growing up. If my behaviors growing up serve as proof, then it’s fact.

…I don’t get… why… how… both of my parents could display boundless love to me, encourage me throughout my life… and I still end up like this………

I don’t think anybody but my therapist has been able to comprehend it… I mean, I’ve had friends listen to me about this before, but I feel like I start to lose them when I share with them what my parents *have* done for me, and even more so when they meet my parents in passing. My parents aren’t bad… At least my dad isn’t… I don’t know, I want to let go of animosity. I want to let go of pain. It’s so difficult. It’s so tricky, because it’s complex. All the while, I end up sharing this on Reddit before reaching out to any of my friends. It’s like I have… trust issues… I did not mean for that come off as snarky, that’s genuinely what came to my mind.

I’ve been feeling completely lost, hopeless, and emotionally overwhelmed for what feels like forever now. I’m exhausted from pretending everything is fine when deep down, it’s not. I don’t sleep, I over eat, I zone out constantly, and my chest feels like it’s caving in most days.

I’ve come to believe that the only thing that could actually pull me out of this darkness is being in a genuine, loving relationship. Not just for fun, not to show off—but because I desperately crave connection, understanding, and comfort. Something real. Something to remind me I'm still human and not just stuck surviving.

I feel like I missed my only shot recently with someone, and ever since, things have spiraled further. I know people always say, “It’ll come with time,” or “Love yourself first,” but I’ve heard it all and it honestly just makes me feel worse. I just want to feel seen and not judged for once.

I’ve been doing my best—applying nonstop, reaching out for help, trying to hold it together—but it’s exhausting.

353,3,"This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

As the title says, I 16F am having confusing feelings about my ex 16M, while I'm in a relationship 17M.

Some background on my ex, who will be called G. We met on Snapchat in early April of 2022, our 7th grade year. We quickly hit it off, and made it official after only 3 days of talking. We started seeing each other about 1 month into the relationship. We had a good relationship, but around the 4 month mark, I started getting bored and uninterested, then I started talking to other people. I came clean to G and broke up with him, even though he didn't want to. I think we went no contact for 1 week, then we quickly hit it off again, and made it official in late September of 2022, our 8th grade year. From then, we dated until New Year of 2024, our 9th grade year, so 1 year and 3 months. We were having problems in our relationship: he wouldn't let me hangout with a male friend, even though I had known the friend longer than him, his mom acted like those unbearable MIL's that are obsessed with their sons, we were stuck going to the same places and doing the same things, we couldn't hang out at home because of his mom. These problems really wore me down, and again, I started getting bored and uninterested, then I started talking to other people. I came clean to G and broke up with him again, even though he didn't want to. This time, he was really devastated, and was talking about committing. I was able to convince him to talk to his mom, and he was taken from the hospital, to the psych ward. His mom basically banished us from talking, but we still did for about 1 week. During which, we discussed that the breakup would be more of a break until he was able to drive, so we could have more freedom. After, we went no contact. The next time, and last time I talked to him was in May of 2024. I messaged him and we talked for 2 days, then if I remember correctly, he got his phone taken, and neither of us messaged each other after. Since then, I haven't thought about him until now.

Some background on my boyfriend, who will be called K. We met on Snapchat in late January of 2024. We quickly hit it off, and were basically dating in 1 week, but we made it official in late February of 2024. We've had a good relationship, until January of 2025 or February of 2025. Around that time, he started slacking in things that he had been doing since before we were even official: saying GN and ILY before going to sleep, turning his camera on before going to sleep, telling me if he goes somewhere, etc. I understand if they seem small, but we are in a LDR and they mean a lot to me. I also reciprocate them with no problem. I was very forgiving at first, but it quickly got on my nerves as the same mistakes were repeated multiple times a week. This created a rough patch in our relationship for about 2 months, but I've seen improvement, and we're back on track.

So, about 3 weeks ago, I was suggested G's Instagram account. Curiosity got the best of me, so I looked at it. I looked at his PFP first. Then, I looked at his followers and his following. I noticed girls in his followers, but it didn't bother me, then I noticed girls in his following, and my heart sank. I'll admit, they were pretty and that probably played to my insecurities, but I wasn't jealous or mad, just upset. It bothered me for a few days, but I forgot about it. Of course with my luck, I was suggested G's TikTok account. Again, curiosity got the best of me - I was less worried since I looked at his Instagram anyways -, so I looked at it. He didn't have any posts, and his following was private, so I only looked at his reposts. I wasn't looking as intensely, to avoid getting upset again, but out of the corner of my eye, I saw a TikTok that said, ""When fine shyt (slang for crush) switching positions,"" and again, my heart sank. Again, I wasn't jealous or mad, just upset. It bothered me for a few days, but instead of forgetting, I thought of 2 reasons why it might be bothering me.

The first reason, it upset me that G moved on. We were each others firsts for a lot of things, so seeing signs of him moving on, especially the sex part, really upset me, especially because I haven't moved on that far yet. I also knew that as long as G hadn't moved on, he would always be there. Like when I messaged him in May, even though we had been broken up for some months, he still answered. It was comforting to know that he was there for me, but now it'd be safe to assume he's moved on and he's no longer there.

The second reason, I started comparing the relationships. Being reminded of G obviously reminded me of our relationship, specifically the in person parts. I started feeling like I was missing out on so many things because K and I have a LDR. I started questioning and regretting my decision of breaking up with G.

A few days later, I was suggested G's Instagram account again. This isn't necessary to the story, except maybe to show how deep I'm in, but G had a story up during this time that I just had to see, so I actually created a fake account to see the story. Anyways, I noticed that his PFP had changed, so I looked at it. It was a picture of him playing baseball, and the team name was eligible. I recognized the name as a high school that he had been considering when we were together, and the reason he didn't choose it was because it was basically a public school that cost that of a private school. The education wasn't as good as the other schools, and it was the only boy and girl school. Obviously, as a girlfriend, I nudged him away from that school. Once I made this connection, I honestly found it embarrassing that he transferred schools after we broke up, and I was sure this would be the thing that put an end to the confusing feelings, but it didn't.

Since being reminded of G, I've become a bit insecure in my relationship with K. I feel like G was a better person, and a better boyfriend, than K. Maybe not better in general, but a better fit for me. An example, the other night K left me on delivered for 4 hours because he was wrapped up in a show, but G would have never gone 4 hours without texting me because of a show. Another example, when I asked K if he would still love me as a worm, he said no, but when I asked G if he would still love me as a worm, he said yes. I know it's a trivial question with a trivial answer, but how hard is it to say yes to a dumb hypothetical to make your girlfriend happy? I also think that G was just more in love with me. I feel like he showed so much more love, whether it was compliments, saying how much he misses/loves me, or romantic gestures.

I'm just really confused and frustrated.

It feels like my feelings for G have resurfaced. I feel like I want to be with him, but maybe I just want an in person relationship. I feel like I'm missing out on so much by being in a LDR: dances, dates, flowers, physical affection, etc. I have this serious regret from breaking up with him. I think that if I had understood myself more and handled the situation better, we could be in a happy, healthy relationship. I know it's irrational, but I've developed this fear that I've permanently downgraded by breaking up with G, like I'll never find someone as good as him again.

I also feel like an awful girlfriend to K. I know feelings are uncontrollable, but I feel guilty for having G on my mind while being with K. I don't think he's a bad boyfriend, but I do feel like we are on different levels. I still love K very much, though. I think these feelings are temporary, considering I hadn't thought of G in almost 1 year, so I don't want to breakup with K over them.

To make matters worse, I talked to 2 people about it, and they both had pretty different viewpoints.

The first friend responded quite thoroughly. I sent him everything I've typed here, and he responded to all of it. He basically said that I'm experiencing these feelings because I'm only now mourning the relationship, since it was originally a break and I always kept G as an option. He said that from what he's heard, K is a better boyfriend than G. He agreed that the feelings are probably temporary, and I shouldn't act on them.

The second friend had short responses, but I also didn't go into nearly as many details because he's been present for both relationships. He said G was a better boyfriend than K, even though G hated him, so that says a lot. He said I should message G and see where it leads to.

Honestly, there's a part of me that wants to message G, but I'm not going to cheat on K. Plus, I honestly don't know if I could even date G. I don't think I'd be comfortable with him going to a boy and girl school knowing that he used to go to an all boys school, and I don't think I'd be comfortable with him if he has had sex with someone else, because I haven't, and we were each others first.

Also, at some point during this whole situation, I came across pictures of me and G. I think it made me miss him at least 10 times more.

I'm just really confused, emotional, and frustrated. I don't know how to navigate through these feelings. I don't want to make a dumb decision that's going to blow up in my face. Does anyone have any advice?"
354,2,"A few months ago I (24F) have been sexually assaulted by a man i knew. It's hard to explain but it took some time before I realised what happened.
It happened a few times, each time a little more. From the beginning I told him I wasn't interested in sex and I told him what I wasn't comfortable with. But he didn't listen and would touch me in places I didn't want. I would tell him to stop and when he asked if he could I said no every time, but he would do it anyway, and he was asking so much that it wore me off and I would finally say yes, because it was so tiring to always repeat myself and to always be vigilant to what he was touching, I just couldn't relax.
Worst thing is, I stopped seeing him because he threatened to hit me. It was weeks after that my brain finally realised what happened.
Also, at some point I was convinced that man would rape me. Thankfully it did not happen. But as soon as he left, my brain completely forgot about it and I kept going as if nothing happened. That's what scared me the most honestly, the fact that I did not realise until much later. I'm scared it will happen again and I won't react. I feel like my brain betrayed me.

I feel like he ruined men for me. Now every new man who I meet and who touches me (even in a friendly way) makes me feel so bad. I feel like my skin is burning for hours in the place I have been touched. It happened a few times already, all men I just recently met. I imagine it's a normal reaction but how do I move on from this? How can therapy help?

I really appreciate anyone who took the time to read this, I know it's not a fun subject. Thank you."

I’ve been trying to find work, but interview after interview just sees my employment gap and I’m rejected.

I am very shy and have social anxiety nice neat and clean and I bathe everyday I do what I am told I never disrespect nobody and I wish everyone show me the same respect I show them.

I wish people talk to me without screaming and yelling and without people talking down to not only my mom treat me horrible everyone else I know does it and I have been down and depressed and I am all alone. 

And people not just yell at me they yell at others too. When people yell at me and others I get scared and I start crying and my mom used to yell at me all the time and makes me cry and when people yell it takes me a long time to heal emotionally."

Quarantine hit and made me realise that I am not just weird,but probably autistic. Ever since then, I was struggling severely. I haven't worked yet at all (again, because social interaction is extremely hard and I can't ""mask"")

I am not sure how to continue. Even though I try to help out my parents as much as I can, I feel like a massive burden. But I'm not sure if there's even an other way. Because I don't have access to diagnosis and live in the middle of nowhere, I receive no needed support. I already feel like my life is over.

Please,be kind."
358,1,"One month and a half after she cheated on me and went away. Almost a month after she texted after that and just used me for a week, and then just went away again even I was ready to forgive. Thanks that I didn't. But I'm tired. It doesn't feel better. No, it feels for a few days. But then I'm just falling down again. I'm so tired to feel this sht all the time. It's the worst feeling - breaking up after more than a year because of cheating. From the person you never did even think about she could do something like that.

And it doesn't feel better seeing every day people around me happy even they are so lonely. I feel good for them, really. But I can't. I just can't be alone. I'm too addicted to people. I love people. And I can't handle this loneliness. Yeah, I have friends, I have people around, but.. It doesn't feel the same. And I can't get over it. Because it was the best time in my life. Except the end.

And I see so much people who just don't care in relationships about everything at all. It's just for fun for them. And it seems that everyone is okay with it. Even we aren't children. But why?
Why no one really doesn't care that you love? That you're fully into us? That you're trying to be a good person? That you're doing your best? Okay, they cares. But until a moment. Honestly, more than a year. Nothing bad. Only positive things, building our future together. Seeing us there. But then without any signs - fck you, let's cheat on you. Why? Why every fcking time people are like that? What I'm doing wrong in this life? I'm so tired of this sht. So freaking tired.

You try your best always, but it seems in this world no one cares. Never. And it's so hurting. So much. There's no sense to continue to be like that. "
359,3,"back in 2022,I was awarded permanent residency in [canada.it](http://canada.it) was a dream for me, as I wanted to go there and grow my career(I had seen there were lot of AI related roles,I was also getting calls from companies even though i was applying from my home country ,india).this gave me the confidence that i could grow and further strengthen my career.  
Flash forward to 2023,i land there and within few months of struggling, I was able to secure some interviews and finally a role in the government.  
I am on cloud 9,not only do i get to improve my career but i am working for feds(for me it's a matter of pride).Boy was i in for a rude awakening. On the day of joining, they delay my joining date due to some clearance, since i had spent most of my money on relocation, new apartment and moving expenses, the financial strain was there but i brushed it off thinking that when I get paid,it will be fine. Then hr tells me we do payment by arrears which means you won't be paid biweekly but 2 weeks .This added more [strain.Plus](http://strain.Plus) the role I was assigned to ,had nothing to do with my field in CS or AI,instead I was reading stuff related to civil engineering.

Furthermore, it became obvious that the hiring manager had no interest in my skillset. When I tried applying some of the skills i learnt i was shot down, when I tried adapting or tried to bring new ideas or solutions, i was told NO. furthermore, the domain and tasks were extremely challenging and had a steep learning curve which proved to be difficult for me(but I was able to manage).it didn't help that when I asked him for what tasks would he like me to perform,he would say i don't know figure it out on your own. This led me to belive he had no confidence in my ability to perform and didn't assign me any tasks(something which he later confirmed when I resigned).

This sort of continued for 12 months, I was alienated from my field,was being micromanaged ,and being told that everything i am doing is wrong(he would like to point out small mistakes,when I would tell him he told me i was being emotional).My colleagues would snipe and tell me my work is irrelevant.

Finally in october 2024,i left the organization and decided to job hunt.I trusted my skillset and felt that someone would trust me too.I was wrong,most people would just schedule screening calls and then move on ,some would say i have no experience(i don't blame them after 2 years people expect that and i didn't have that skills).Those who would call would give assesments.Which i ended up [flunking.One](http://flunking.One) lady gave me a technical assesment.I spent 48 hours doing it ,documenting the stuff ,creating all sort of plots,and explanations only to be told look at the applicant tracking system,and if i have any feedback i will let you know.Someone else gave me a cognitive assesment(CRITERIA 50 questions 15 minutes),i failed that too.Till this date,i feel bad for failing a simple cognitive test.

in early feb i got my first hiring manager round,mind you i hadn't had an interview for 12 months,so i was nervous.i flunked .Hiring manager told me my skills are not good,and i should rethink my decisions.Maybe he was right,maybe i am not cut out ,i though.On that same day however one company  that had rejected me earlier reaches out to me again,we chat and I schedule a round with hiring manager.within the same week i got 2 more calls.

The call with th manager went well(acc to me),but at the coding stage,I was given some graphics related questions.I was able to come up with some solutions but they weren't accurate and lacked consistency.\[I believed i answered only 1 out of 3 correctly,though i followed up with the solution to 2nd later on via email\].Unfortunately hiring manager rejects me.Other 2 companies also didn't respond.

FInally in the end of the march ,i decided to quit,i was under financial pressure,i was mentally stressed and would seldom go [out.so](http://out.so) i decided to leave [canada.Now](http://canada.Now) i am back in my home country and here also i am constantly facing rejections making me think that maybe i am not cut out for the IT field.And i think maybe my life could have been happier if i hadn't made the decision for going to canada.I still apply to some companies(even though i have no reason why i apply to them)

I promise I’ll be a good listener. I’ll genuinely care. I’ll check in when you're low, celebrate with you when you're happy, and be someone you can trust. I don’t expect magic overnight, but maybe with time, we can build something beautiful even if it's just a solid friendship.

(You don’t have real world experience.) this line I have to listen every time, when I try to tell my thoughts and my view on situation. 

I’m feeling so hurt and thoughts are running in my head. I don’t know what to do. "
367,1,"A few months ago, something happened and I was presented with a situation that would have helped resolve (to some degree) almost all of the things that contribute to my life-long depression. I was ecstatic and felt like I was finally being rescued (and it was even better because it was by a man I've liked for twenty years).... just for it all to be withdrawn a couple hours later.

Technically, that means nothing changed, but it was still a big event that caused a tremendous amount of pain. Things have continued to get worse and worse since then and life is getting increasingly difficult to be associated with. I have been trying to continue on with the little bit of hope I still had (or have... maybe), but it has dwindled away to the point that it barely exists anymore. Sometimes I catch a glimpse of it, but most of the time its just too small to see.

Now, something else has occurred that has made that tiny speck of hope even smaller. I have a big decision to make, but regardless of what I choose, the end result is the same and inevitable - everything I've been hoping for, for over a year, and things I've wanted for my entire life, it'll all be gone in an instant. With it, the remaining particle of hope will disappear, too (unless somehow the minuscule possibility of a miracle occurs).

I'm completely lost. I'm a failure at life (I can prove it so don't try to say otherwise) so there aren't many options for me. I'm basically just trying to get through the days until I make up my mind about when to leave and can finish tying up loose ends."
368,0,"Hello  
We’re telling the story of our nonprofit’s early era in a short “thank you” video before we transition into a new phase (moving into a studio, scaling up). We want it to feel raw, homemade, and deeply personal.

Still in the creative planning phase, but here’s what we have:

* Opens with a hand-crafted “Thank you for staying with us” sign
* Frames of old designs/mockups to show our growth
* Names of supporters floating or flying out of frame (kind of symbolic of them lifting us up)
* A sweet moment of me and my brother (who the nonprofit is built around) waving and saying thank you over FaceTime

We don’t want to end it with just a fade to black or logo.  
We’re looking for **something poetic, symbolic, emotional** — maybe even experimental — that closes the loop and says “this is just the beginning.”

If you were directing this — what’s your ending shot or moment?"
369,3,"
I’ve already shared my trauma before, but today I want to talk about what it’s been like after the trauma—because it hasn’t ended there.

I’m still living in the same toxic environment, and that means my healing keeps getting interrupted. Just when I start to feel a bit better, the same person who triggered my trauma shows up again, and I spiral. To avoid him, I’ve isolated myself—but that isolation has started to hurt me too. It affects my mental health deeply.

I try to gather the courage to step out—even if it’s just walking around inside the house or talking to someone for a few minutes. But there are days I don’t leave my room at all. That small space has become my ""safe zone"", but also a kind of prison.

Going outside is harder. There are restrictions at home, so I always need someone to accompany me—and arranging that every time is not easy. On top of it, my anxiety makes everything worse. My sleep cycle is ruined, I stay up late and wake up late, which eats up my day and leaves me with no time or energy to do things that help me feel better.

One more thing—I’ve never been in a romantic relationship. First, because of my family's restrictions, and second, after the trauma, even though I crave emotional closeness and love, I feel scared. I can talk to people online, sometimes even connect emotionally, but video calls make me anxious—especially when they aren’t regular. Meeting someone in person or getting close emotionally or physically feels terrifying, no matter how much I want it.

It hurts to feel stuck like this—like I’m going to suffer like this forever. I want to break free from this loop. I want to live life fully like others do—to feel love, to travel, to breathe freely, to heal.

"
370,2,"Hi. I’m really struggling with loneliness and social anxiety, and I’ve been trying to find someone to connect with. I often get overwhelmed in group conversations, and I’m not great at knowing what to say right away—but I really want to try.

Looking forward to connecting and offering any support I can."
372,2,"Hey there, first time poster here but I figured I’d put my thoughts somewhere. I’m having a really rough few days due to my ex of 10 years dating a girl who I don’t know, but she knows and is friends with a lot of people I know in my city. 

He’s dated since we broke up three years ago, but it’s been with people I don’t know so it’s been out of sight out of mind. It hasn’t bothered me at all, and I’ve been happy he’s getting back out there. This is different, though. 

Last week my new coworker, who I know socially and is very chatty, clumsily said “oh, I see him all the time with my best friend X, we had dinner the other night on a double date” then went on to tell me a bunch of stuff I just… simply did NOT need in my brain. I don’t need to know how they’re doing, and I don’t need to know anything about her. Now I know a lot, and I also learned that I bought her art from her for him as a gift years ago, apparently. I don’t remember her face and I don’t remember the situation, but the closeness of all this is bringing up a lot for me. That she’s a cool artist, that she is skinnier and hotter than me (I don’t remember what she looks like and didn’t look her up online, so I’m just making up stories in my head) I’m usually not this low of confidence. Like damn. 

I’m struggling with severe anxiety around the whole thing, and honestly I’m just disappointed in myself for still being upset by this jabroni. He and I weren’t compatible, I was unhappy for years before I finally left… but yet I’m still having this jealous and proprietary feeling. It’s almost like the breakup just happened in some ways.

I didn’t think about him often before this past week. I mean, we broke up three years ago and both of us have dated other people since. I thought I’d moved on in a way that felt really good, but this is like someone reopened a scar. 

Why do I feel threatened and self-conscious about a girl I don’t even know, and a man I don’t even want to date?

I feel so self conscious about this whole thing, because if I was in a happy relationship, I don’t think I’d have this reaction. I’ve been getting a lot of attention on the apps and been on a bunch of dates, but I just haven’t hit it off with anyone yet. Not really. So I guess being kinda lonely is a big part of this, too.

Anyway, thanks for reading if you took the time. I’m being real hard on myself. I have a beautiful life and I’m so lucky in so many ways. This will pass, but for now… I will let myself feel feelings. Ugh. "
373,1,"[22-M] I’m dealing with something I can’t carry alone anymore. I don’t want to talk to people in my life about it because I’m afraid of what it might mean if I’m not around afterward.

This isn’t a request for advice or solutions. I just want to be honest with someone before I possibly go. Not to change my mind—just to be heard, by someone kind and anonymous.

If anyone’s willing to talk privately, I’d really appreciate it. DMs are open."

I’ve been feeling extremely lonely lately. I don’t have any close friends right now—no one to talk to, share my feelings with, or even just chat about random stuff. I’ve been struggling with my emotions a lot… sometimes I can’t eat, sleep, or even think properly.

I’m not looking for anything perfect—I just want a kind human connection. Someone who’s honest, patient, and can talk to me without judgment. Maybe you’re feeling the same way too?

If you’re open to chatting, even just for a bit, please message me. I’m trying to heal, and maybe we can help each other feel less alone.

377,2,"I always get into fights with my sister. She is seven years older than me. Everytime we do fight, it somehow ends with her bringing up how she supposedly helped out alot in raising me as a child and has been selfless in always doing things for me (along with our parents).


Now, I'm not disagreeing with what she says. I dont remember most things because i was a kid but i am definitely grateful for all that she's done. But also, I never asked for those things myself! nor did I have the emotional intelligence as a child to accept or reject her help. I didn't choose to be younger than her (when i say this she says that she didn't choose to be older than me) and i feel like It's extremely unfair to keep bringing it up as if I was using her all along. It feels like she uses this argument as a cheat code everytime we fight and I'm just supposed to submit to her even if she's in the wrong.

I feel horrible about myself  because it sounds like I'm being ungrateful. How do i even respond to something like this? Not even my parents talk to me this way and they've sacrificed so so much to raise the both of us. 

How do I deal with this? I genuinely feel like distancing myself from her is the only way out"
378,1,"I am frankly done with my life. I feel everyone is moving on without me. I feel like second best at everything.  I feel like the backup plan at home, friends,  societ, everywhere.  I can't make peace of being alone. I haven't relapsed for almost a year but I think I would any day. It is driving me crazy keep in mind am a med student also away from my hometown. I need help and I don't have anyone to talk to. Is anyone down to listen to me?"
379,1,"Hi,

I am a 22 years old man. I am autistic. And I believe my autism has had many effects on me. The biggest where I believe was my cognitive delay. 

When I say cognitive delay it is not like something small like to be only bad at school and studying. It is more than that. It affected me in my everyday life chores, personal chores, personal growth, and social life. 

Per everyday life chores I was really dependent. As personal chores I wasn't able to do many of my personal things myself such as tying my own shoes. And in personal growth, I feel that I was and am left behind from many people. And in social life, I was very annoying that it caused me to become isolated by many people. 

Nowadays these are fixed and improved thankfully. But it is too late. And I regret my past. I now see that I am so behind. And the regret and grudge of myself is very strong. 

It is a battle in my mind against myself. I cannot understand and be compassionate to my self as I regret who I was. Sometimes it does come to my mind that maybe this was my path, but then I also remember that it is too late and I am lonely.

These all caused me to become very lonely. Regardless of the fact that I enjoy my own company more and I want to be social at the times that I desire too as an ambivert. 

At the current moment also, as a another point of that I feel I am left behind is because since my graduation 3 months ago, I wasn't able to find a job in my field of study of finance and administration. And this, this places more burden on my mind. 

I really want to talk to someone now. I want to see how someone from the outside sees me honestly. I cannot observe from the inside, as within of me is a chaos. 

I appreciate all your comments. Feel free to ask any questions you desire.

Thank "
380,1,"Hi. I don’t really know how to do this, and honestly, I’m embarrassed to be reaching out like this at all. Every instinct is telling me I’m just the trillionth heartbroken shmuck screaming into the void; just another guy who lost someone and couldn’t move on. I know this is not a replacement for therapy, and I'm *sorta* getting a little bit of that through my job, but the simple truth is, I just *need* to scream right now. And if someone hears it and answers, that’s a bonus.

A year ago, my fiancée and I broke up. We were together for years, built a life and future together, or at least I thought we did. Since then, I’ve been standing in the ruins of something that mattered more to me than I can put into words. And I keep trying to live in those ruins, hoping that maybe we can rebuild. But I think she’s already moved on. I think she’s living a new life while I’m still here, clinging to poisonous false hope that is slowly killing me.

I've been stupid. I’ve kept showing up for her. Helping out, buying her little treats like I always used to do, watching our two cats while she's away doing activities that we used to do together, doing all these little things as quiet offerings of love. But she doesn’t want that. Or if she does, it’s not because she still loves me, but because it's comfortable. Free stuff, right? And still, I can’t stop. Because if I pull away, I’m terrified she’ll forget about me completely, and the last thread of hope I have will snap.

It’s not just heartbreak. It’s *withdrawal* from a whole life, from a rhythm of care and connection I shaped myself around. And now, without her, I feel aimless. Hopeless. Like I don’t know how to exist as a whole person. That kind of loneliness isn’t just hurting me, it is *hollowing* me. Like I'm somehow even *less* than what I was before we met.

The worst part is, when I hit rock bottom like this, my whole body wants to reach out for her. For the comfort we always shared. For the safety of being held by someone who really, truly *knew* me. But I obviously can’t. That door is closed, and trying to knock just seems to push her further away. So I’m stuck holding all this pain alone, and it feels absolutely unbearable.

I know I should be trying to build something new. Like a life that doesn’t depend on her love. But the truth is, I don’t know how. I want to believe there is life after this person. I *need* to believe it, but I *can’t.* It has been over a year, and I’m still nowhere near finished mourning the life I spent my entire 20’s building, but will never have. And even if I somehow get over the massive hurdle of heartbreak, I can’t be alone for the rest of my life- but I’m terrified that I don’t have the time. I’m terrified that I spent a decade on something that ended and now I don’t have the time to meet someone new and discover love again, and build up all those memories and inside jokes and warm experiences that shape a life together. And even if that’s not the case, how do I get there?

I have spent countless nights weeping into the dark, thinking about giving up. Every night, I find some excuse to keep going, but I’m at the end of my rope. I can’t go on like this. I’m not actively suicidal, I don’t need emergency help, but that feeling of just *constantly* having *that* in the back of my mind makes every day such an enormous struggle. I’m desperate, terrified, and completely out of options. I'm in hell.

Thank you for reading my rant, if you did. Sorry it's such a melodramatic bummer, but that's me right now. If you’re someone who has a little kindness left to spare, I would appreciate anything you have to offer."

Recently I made a couple posts on a few different subreddits to support me when I was sad but, none of it helped. Other than one thing. I got a message from someone who wanted to help. We chatted a lot that night and I added her on snap that day. From then on I texted her everyday and I eventually told her I loved her and she said she loved me too. I was really really happy and loved her so much.  I loved texting her all the time when she wanted a picture of me. I was very hesitant as I didn’t like the way I looked. But I sent a picture and she didn’t like it. She lied and told me it was fine but I could tell. I hate myself and how I’m ugly and no one can change my perspective. I messaged her later and she told me that she didn’t think about it when she said she loved me too and was already interested in someone else. We Lived very very far apart so I didn’t really have a plan for our future. She knew I was suicidal before messaging me and whilst I was texting her that was the happiest Id ever been in years. Now I feel so empty. I can’t look at anything the same. There was a lot I hid from her and now that it’s ended it’s all coming back to haunt me. I wish I could have that feeling again of love and joy. I loved her so much but I wasn’t enough. I won’t ever be. I’m ugly and more people hate me than like me. Love is what I needed and made me the happiest guy on earth. She was everything to me. In the past I liked a girl and we got together before but she blocked me and that crushed and broke me. I loved her, I try so hard in everything but no one cares. No one. No one’s fucking grateful. I crave love and happiness. I’m still so young but love made me me and I was finally happy and now I’m nothing. Why me? I ask always.
No one cares about me. Today I started adding a bunch of girls on snap hoping to get a friendship going but it wasn’t the same. It never will be. I loved you Kate I really did. I’m sorry I wasn’t enough."
382,2,"I met this girl in 2020 and developed feelings for her. We used to talk every day for hours and one day she just withdrew so I did the same. Eventually we didn’t talk anymore and I tried reaching out but felt like I was bothering her because she would only give a bare response. Last year, I told her that I had feelings for her this whole time and how it hurt that she stopped talking to me. She said she wasn’t ready/ didn’t want a relationship and said we just grew apart. I tried getting over her by throwing out all the stuff she gave me and I blocked her online just to create more distance. Now we go to the same university and she said hi to me the other day and I completely lost all progress of having no feelings for her. I feel guilty and pathetic for still liking her after 4 1/2 YEARS even though she said no to me."

I'm in a phase where I’m working through old emotional patterns, trying to understand myself better, and looking for calm, soft connections — people who value deep conversations, healing, and small joys.

I’ve felt a bit alone lately — my relationship has been distant, and I’m in a hometown with no close friends right now. I’d love to talk to someone who’s also navigating life gently — emotional awareness, overthinking, heartbreak, self-growth, all of it.

I'm into journaling, music, aesthetics, quiet moments, and real feelings. No pressure to be overly social — just honest, respectful, kind energy.

If this resonates, feel free to message or comment — I’d love to connect. 🌷

I do the best I can to help her out with everything, she retorts with mean words and projects herself, and it's quite honestly exhausting, and draining.

Thought I might give this a shot... Would appreciate it, if only to vent. Thanks to anyone who takes a look."

Hello. I'm a kid. Just about 15 yo. Lately, I feel like my life is lonelier than usual. I'm alone all the time. Even though I have friends at school, But when I come back home, I feel extremely lonely. There's no one to chat with, no one to talk to when I'm sad. When i was kid. Really kid. Just like 6-9 yo. My parents are not care me good. At that time. My dad is have depression. He is always in room. My father would only leave his room once in a while, at most he would go out to work. At that time, our house was like a factory, Has workers in house all the time, about 10 or so. The workers sleep in the room on the roof and would come out to work in the morning. My father was the owner of the house and the boss. But he not care me good really. He is not cooking for me. Just send money to get me studying. And my mom is have angry issues. She really has it. Im not cap. Often when i kid. She just hit me because i can't sleep. And oh. I have big sister too. But she is just toxic. Like mom and dad. Then i would not say about her.

Just like me tell. My dad is not care about me really because he is depression on that time. And my mom is have angry issues because hate my dad really. ... They just... When i grow up. I suddenly know. My dad and my mom slept together because drunk. And have my big sister. I know that called accident. But if they really hate another. Why i born too? Aren't they hate another? My 15 years of my life. I swear. I never seen them do a romantic or love sign really. Never. Mostly they argue more. They almost broke up many times, but they didn't break up because my mother said she was selfish about me.

How even. When i kid. I mostly alone. You know. And when i grow up. Just like 11-14. I have friends. I just know my family is not normal somethings. Like they not teach me to ride bikes. Until i was 14 i just know now to ride by myself. And somethings else there not normal like others familys. I mostly like time when with my friends because they give happily to me. And that time i just know something call ""girlfriend/boyfriend"". That time. I have my friends. I have my girlfriend. I think that perfect. It really. Really happy that time. My face is 6-8/10. So i have so many girlfriends. Find. Flirting. Be girlfriend/boyfriend. Breakup. Repeat. Just like 5-6 times. Yeah. I know. I just 11-14 yo. But it really happy.

And now. I 15 yo. Yeah. I have friends. But my friends not always with me 24h. Not like girlfriend thing. But i not have no one now. My parents just toxic. They often said somethings against my feel. And my mom. She is my problem. Dad is not depression now. He better. But my mom still having angry issues. She always does somethings unexpected. And make me angry and sad too. But i not do anything. Just take it and not do something. When i live with my parents like this 24h. I just feel very alone. I have no one to tell something with. When i sad and tried. I have no one to listen me. ""Wakes up, eat, go to school, come back home and working with my parents,get somethings bad by them, do nothing, sleep."" My life is like this. Like 6-7 mouth. I feel like... I can't take it anymore. My parents are toxic than i tell in this message. ""I want someone to listen me. I want someone to encourage me when i are tried."" I always feel like this.

I don't know why i very sensitive for been alone. But i think because when i was kid. I live alone. And when i grow up a little. I have friends. And now i have no one to encourage me. I want have someone to listen me. Just like was 11-14 yo.

It is called grow up? When someone grow up. Starting to be adult. They always live alone? Get used to being alone?"
388,1,"I was in a very toxic relationship that I've been trying to forget, but the bad memories still linger and haunt me whenever I'm doing other things. Everything reminds me of those times.

I transferred to a different school last year and was able to encounter lots of new friends. I did not know anyone at all in the new school. On the first day of the semester, I met my very first new friend, who I will call ""M."" She was among the first and few people I got to know, so I talked to her a lot. We talked for a while, then I decided to try to be in a relationship with her.

At first, all was well with ""M,"" but after a while, we started fighting more and more—without any real cause or foundation. I tried to keep my cool, to go to her, to patch things up, but she did not care. I was the one trying. Whenever I said I had to break up, she would come back and ask to make up like nothing had happened. This cycle went on for a year because I was scared to take the risk of ending it with her permanently. I had hardly any friends because I had given all my time to her and hadn't had time for anyone else. I was scared of being left with no social life after the breakup, and this fear kept me bound to this toxic relationship that seemed never to end.

Not until I joined the music band class, which ""M"" was not a part of. I finally had my time and time with friends. I realized life without her was actually happier. I thus chose to confide in my friends in the band and ask for advice on how to break off that relationship. They were all so supportive, and that helped me understand that even if I broke up with her, I'd always have a place to call home. That helped me get the guts to break up with her for good.

It was great at first—I had more freedom, I could do things that I used to like doing. I felt great. But as time passed, everything I did reminded me of all the bad things ""M"" had done to me. There were so many bad memories that almost everything I did or anywhere I went brought them back.

These days, I simply cannot live in the present. My health has also deteriorated, and I have started to develop symptoms of depression. I simply cannot get rid of these memories and feelings.



Is there something that I can do to get these things out of my life?



"
389,0,"TL;DR: Ended a long-term engagement last year. After a few false starts, I met someone unexpectedly. We've been dating for two weeks and are already talking about marriage and building a life together. It feels right, but am I moving too fast or just finally getting what I deserve?

Am I crazy for letting this move so quickly?

Last August, I ended a 4½-year relationship. We were engaged, but something deep down told me it wouldn’t work. We had grown into different people with different goals. I stayed because I felt I owed him something. He was good to me. I also didn’t want to uproot things for my kids, who weren’t his. I even got a tubal ligation because he didn’t want more children. I wanted marriage, but he hesitated. Eventually, it just felt like we were together out of loneliness and comfort.

Months later, I dated someone briefly. It wasn’t serious—it was fun—but I wanted more. The words felt empty.

Then I met someone through social media. He lives an hour away and has a busy life with his kids. Our first date was incredible, almost like a movie. We agreed to give it a shot. He tried at first, but over the next four months, communication slowly faded. He eventually broke plans again, and that was my last straw.

I went back to dating casually. It was fun, but nothing felt serious. A lot of guys seemed interested in me, and that felt nice, but they came with serious issues or just didn’t seem invested.

Then February hit. I had a series of health issues and personal crises. One day, I was driving to a site I hadn’t planned to visit and decided to drop off some donuts and introduce myself. I met the supervisor, and we instantly hit it off. We followed each other on social media, and while conversation came and went, I kept thinking about him.

A few weeks later, I went through a really dark time and almost considered ending my life. A few days later, we had our first date. I almost canceled, but I didn’t. He kissed me right away, and I welcomed it. We spent hours talking over food, barely touching our plates. He was a perfect gentleman.

Our second date was just as amazing. We talked, laughed, and shared our goals and dreams. I felt something real. In two weeks, we’ve seen each other five times. I’m head over heels. He listens, remembers everything, and even takes notes in his phone to keep track of the little things I tell him.

Last night, he told me he wants us to have fun and enjoy each other, but he also said, “I know I want to marry you. I want to build a life with you.” He wants to meet my family, introduce me to his, propose by fall, get married next year, and start a family the year after that. And the thing is—his timeline is something I agree with. It doesn’t scare me. It actually feels right.

We’re compatible in the ways that matter: intimacy, family values, and long-term goals. It’s everything I’ve ever wanted. I love him. I want to give him everything, and I want to receive everything he’s offering.

But it’s only been two weeks since our first date.

Is this possible? Can love really happen this fast? Am I being crazy?

390,2,"I don't really know how to start this it feels kinda stupid. I've never posted something this personal on Reddit before, but I'm honestly running out of options and I could really use some help — or even just kind advice.
I'm still young, and recently I lost my boyfriend. He took his own life. It shattered everything. One of the only people I wanted to stay connected to was his mom — we were close, and I don't want to lose that tie to him too. But after he passed, my Instagram account got suspended. That was the only way she really knew how to reach me, and now I'm locked out.
I made a new account (@tararajaeeee_), but she doesn't believe it's me. I think because it has so few followers, and no posts, it just doesn't seem legit to her. She's grieving too, and I get it. But all I want — literally all I want — is for her to know it's me so we can talk. I miss him, and I miss her, and I'm scared that if I can't get through to her soon, I never will.
I've been trying to get to 1,000 followers just to make the account look real enough for her to recognize me.
I've done follow-for-follow stuff on Discord and Reddit, but I'm stuck and don't really know what else to do. I don't want to buy followers or do anything sketchy. I just want this one person to know I'm still here.
If anyone reading this could follow me (@tararajaeeee ) or even suggest a way to grow without posting, I'd be so thankful. This isn't for attention or internet points. It's about something real that I'm holding onto,
maybe the last connection I have left to him.
Thanks for listening."

This is actually my third time posting about this, you can check the 1st from my profile if you want. Now the last post was deleted from another subreddit, because nobody took me seriously in that one. Everyone basically gaslighted, invalidated me, said I was ""overly sensitive"", ""entitled"", and ""weak"". Some people even laughed at my anxiety, labeling it a ""troll"" attempt. And ultimately, not worth taking seriously. The comments from that last post left me feeling judged and invalidated, which is why I removed it. In my first post I expressed my anger. But here I'm going to give you guys the FULL context.



What happened?

  


I was straightening my afro with a hair dryer comb attachment, preparing to get it braided the next day. Suddenly, the Wi-Fi disconnected all over the house. And my dad storms into my room yelling at me: Telling me to cut it all off, and then he called me a ""Rascal"" and hurt my feelings.



My Dads reaction:



😡 HOW LONG IS THIS GOING TO TAKE?! THE HAIR DRYER IS INTERFERING WITH THE INTERNET! WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO ANYWAY!? IS THIS THE KIND MAINTENANCE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH EVERYTIME YOU NEED TO GET YOUR HAIR DONE!? I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST CUT IT. BESIDES, EMPLOYERS WON'T HIRE SOMEONE WITH THEIR HEAD LOOKING LIKE A ""RASCAL""! THIS IS RIDICULOUS, AND IT REQUIRES A CERTAIN SHAMPOO, OIL. I CAN'T DEAL WITH IT ANYMORE!



My two younger sisters (Im a guy btw) were always allowed to use the same hair dryer and he never got mad at them. But because of one internet disturbance, it was only a problem when I did it? And he's using it as an excuse to criticize my autonomy and my care routine. Let's be real—his frustration wasn’t just about the hairdryer—it was about control, expectations, and his own biases toward hair. He's been taking about wanting me to cut it off for months prior to this. Even if he didn't yell before, there was still some bias indicated.



There are plenty of professionals in the workforce with long hair (etc. Dreadlocks). The key is confidence, keeping the hair clean, well-maintained, and styled in a way that is appropriate for the workplace and doesn't distract from one's professional image (Correct me if I'm wrong). Yes, natural hair requires care, but so does any hairstyle. In his mind, cutting my afro was always the ""solution,"" and the hairdryer incident was just the excuse he used to force it to happen.



Ever since then it's been rough. Even though I've been able to take care of it (Brush, comb, moisturize etc), my feelings are still hurt. That's where all my anxiety about the possibility of going bald comes from (even though I'm clearly not). Hence ""Ongoing fear of baldness"", some people mocked me for this in the last post.



Now as I mentioned in my first post, I did eventually decide to cut my hair, not because my dad told me too, but to  prevent hair loss, because I read somewhere that tight hairstyles contribute to hair loss. I was going for tight braids at the time.



But now you probably want to know, 🤔 why is this haircut such a big deal? Ok, I'll tell you.



But before I tell you, please keep in mind: I'm about to share something EXTREMELY personal with you. I've NEVER felt comfortable telling anyone this before. So I'd appreciate it if you please try to understand and not judge me.



Here's my answer:



Hair to me is a powerful form of expressing yourself. I want to get dreadlocks so that it can be a symbol of who I am and everything that I stand for: freedom, creativity, living life on my own terms. I want my hair to stand as a testament to that. Sure, some individuals like my father might see it as vanity, as unprofessional. But to me, at its core it's much more symbolic than that. And parents are out here treating it like a disposable commodity. So when I say I had an ""Ongoing fear of baldness"", what I actually fear is losing my right to identity, to freedom. What I fear, is leaving this earth before I can express who I am. This isn't a male attractiveness thing, its an identity thing. That's why it's important that I grow my afro back. And the good news is I'm NOT balding, and I absolutely can grow it back. That is my goal right now.

Some people in my last post laughed at my experience, and that really hurt. It made me hesitant to share again, but I’m choosing to anyway. So let me say this now:

I’m not ashamed of my anxiety. I’m not ashamed of my hair. I’m not ashamed of my pain.


Conclusion:



If you're someone who’s ever felt misunderstood for simply wanting to be yourself, male or female, then you’re not alone. And I hope my post helps you feel a little more seen too. 


So if you took the time to read all of this, I would greatly appreciate your kindness and support. Thank you.

395,1,Is it just me or do I not see other people struggling with life as much as I do. I’m 27 and unemployed feeling like life doesn’t have much left to offer. I was a really good student in school and now graduated with a masters degree. I’ve reached a point where I’m searching for jobs but there is this empty feeling inside of me I think it’s sadness I can’t really describe it. I burst out in tears randomly most nights when I think about my life what I want to do next and what my future holds. The future looks very bleak and I feel like at this moment I’m stuck thinking that life has nothing more left to offer. What makes me happy and what gives me satisfaction now? I can’t even describe those things. What is the purpose of my life and does my life have a meaning to it. I know one thing for sure though and that is I’m not satisfied with the life I’m currently living and I want more out of life. It’s just that I don’t know what I want and how to carry that plan out. Thank you for reading. Please share your thoughts

397,2,". .just for context i'm in a fandom space on twt where most people are friends/friendly with each other. i'm unfortunately very lonely both irl and in the fandom despite having some followers. anyway this account i mentioned is a priv of a larger account who's my mutual follower and they're the ones who followed me (with their priv) months ago. it was a small space of like 15 people, most of whose accs i knew and liked, and i commented under their posts a bunch, they always liked or replied. it was the closest i've felt to being part of a community in that space. maybe that's silly but really i have nothing better... so i was upset when i got a notif that they posted and it said i can't see it bc the acc's private. suddenly i was unfollowed to them and they unfollowed me. odd but i sent a follow request in case it was a  bug or sth. but no, they refused a couple days ago. and we still follow each other on main too

i just don't get it, why after so long? why me? . it was a bit of a gut punch when i already feel so lonely in a place that's supposed to connect people with the same specific interests... (even if it's not personal at all and i know they're allowed to do that any time)"

399,3,"

We’re a long-distance couple (both 21) from India, and we’ve been together since high school. We’ve been in a relationship for about 2 years now. Things were going really well, even after we started university in different cities. We used to meet every 3–4 weeks and managed long-distance for over 1.5 years without any major issues.

Then she got selected for a student exchange program in Malaysia for one semester (about 5 months). At first, I (21M) was upset — I knew I wouldn’t be able to see her at all during that time. But I accepted it because it was a great opportunity for her (21F), and I genuinely wanted to support her dreams.

In the beginning, she hated being there. She had no friends and felt really out of place. I was her emotional support — we talked daily and stayed close. Eventually, she made some Indian friends there, started going on trips, and began enjoying herself — and I was genuinely happy for her.

But the past 8 days have been awful for me. She’s been constantly out on trips, barely talking to me. We used to talk at least an hour a day — now it’s maybe 10 minutes, and even then, it’s just her talking about what she did. When I try to share my side, she seems distracted or uninterested. She even forgets what I said an hour ago.

I started breaking down mentally. I’ve been feeling depressed, anxious, constantly checking my phone for messages or calls from her. I begged her just to spend one day with me. That’s all. Instead, she got frustrated and distant. She said hurtful things like, “Don’t care about me, it’s my life,” and started escaping conversations with excuses.

Today I opened up completely. I poured out how I was feeling — and what I got in return crushed me, “I’m not even sure I love you anymore.”, “I don’t think I enjoy talking to you these days.”, “I’m scared I won’t have this kind of fun once I come back to India.”, “Maybe I need a big break after I return.”

It hit me hard. I’m an introvert, and she’s more outgoing — but that’s something she used to say she loved about me. I’ve always tried to step out of my comfort zone for her. Now she’s acting like the same qualities she once adored are dealbreakers.

She’ll be back in 10 days. But she’s already talking about needing “a big break” from us. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel so discarded and confused. She says I’m obsessed, but I just wanted a few hours of meaningful time after months apart.

I’ve lost my routine. I feel hopeless. I’m barely talking to anyone and just feel like I’m falling apart.

I could really use some advice on how to process all this and what steps I should take next.

  
**TL;DR:**  
We (21M & 21F) have been in a long-distance relationship for about 1.5 years after dating since high school. She went abroad for a student exchange program, and recently she's been distant — going on trips, barely talking to me, and saying hurtful things. I’m an introvert, she’s outgoing, but now she’s saying she might not love me anymore and wants a break when she gets back. I’m emotionally overwhelmed and don’t know what to do next. Looking for advice or support from anyone who's been through similar."
400,2,"I’m not looking to be anyone’s entertainment, project, or trauma twin. I’m not looking to trade pain stories or compete on who’s suffered more. And I’m definitely not looking to play the “earn your worth” game just to be seen as valid.

What I need — desperately — are a few steady, affirming presences. People who see me before I explain myself. Who don’t push sex, trauma bonding, or superficial small talk. People who are OK with PG-level, consistent, emotionally clear friendship. I want someone who doesn’t need me to disclose graphic wounds or act like a fun mascot just to be kept around.

What I don’t want:
	•	No sex talk, flirting only if deeply respectful and non-sexual.
	•	No trauma comparisons or “I went through worse” energy.
	•	No psychiatric war stories, no drug/alcohol recovery convos, no psych ward discourse.
	•	No being called “cute” in a infantilizing way or feminine nicknames.
	•	No passive-aggression or ghosting when I express needs.
	•	No bootstrapping advice — I want presence, not solutions.

What I do offer:
	•	Loyalty to the core. If you affirm me first, I’ll show up 110%.
	•	Deep, complex emotional space. We don’t have to be shallow.
	•	Faith-aligned grounding. I follow the 66-book Bible and believe in honesty without manipulation.
	•	Protection over performance — I value safety, clarity, and warmth.

I’m not built for huge Discords or noisy trauma spaces. I’m looking for something quieter, more rooted. One-on-one, or a small circle that gets it. The kind of people who can handle growth and change without disappearing when it gets emotionally inconvenient.

I don’t need a savior. I need a witness. Someone who doesn’t flinch when I say:
“I was scared. I was hurt. I was alone. But I survived quietly — and I deserve to be held too.”

If you’re someone who leads with care, consistency, and conviction — not chaos, not cruelty — DM me.

Because right now, I’m drowning in silence, and I don’t want to be strong alone anymore."
401,1,"Today my mom... Who has bipolar disorder and is  manic and not okay but still... Just said she didn't want me to wear a tank top (at home) because my arms are flabby and she found them disgusting... And I have a friend who... Kinda not so subtly hints that I've gained weight...

I'm... I'm very aware of it, but I've always thought I still looked good. I'm tall and the way my weight is distributed means that even though I'm heavy I just look super curvy... I also see the weight gain as temporary because between uni and stuff at home and applying for my master's... I've kinda been going insane, and I... I tend to tend stress eat and have felt too tired to work out... But I intend to as soon as I graduate (end of this month) and get my diet under control too. But... My friend's comments have slowly been wearing down my confidence... And today... My mom shattered it. I just... I feel like crap. I can't help but notice every acne scar and the bacne and spots on my arms and my belly and stretch marks and scars and hair because I haven't found the time to shave or wax and pimples and... The flab my mom talked about and the hyperpigmentation and everything that makes me... Unattractive and I feel so ugly rn. Like... I'm honestly waiting till I graduate just so I can work out and feel less ugly again. Go on a super strict diet and stuff and... Idk. For now I just feel like a pig everytime I eat... And I hate that my jeans feel a little tighter when they were once loose and I just... Idk. I feel extremely unattractive and... It hurts haha "
402,0,"I’m 30 and currently 6–7 months into my first serious relationship. My girlfriend and I met on Bumble and things have been going well — we have shared goals and values, don’t fight, enjoy each other’s company, and neither of us wants kids. This is also the first person I’ve been intimate with (for context, I waited due to past religious reasons).

She’s expressed that she loves me, and while I care about her deeply, I’ve had a hard time saying it back. She’s okay with that for now and says my actions show I care — but I can’t help but wonder if this hesitation is meaningful.

On top of that, I sometimes find myself occasionally glancing at other women — not in a “grass is greener” way, but more in a “what if I haven’t seen enough to know what’s right for me?” way. I know it's normal to look at attractive people but it made her upset so I took active steps to stop but I still catch myself glancing sometimes (not when I'm with her). She’s not unattractive and has even become more active since we started dating (I enjoy fitness and she’s joined in here and there), but I do find myself wondering if we’re a match long-term, physically and emotionally.

I want to emphasize that I’m not looking for a way out or chasing a fantasy — I just don’t want to confuse inexperience with incompatibility. I care about her a lot and don’t want to waste her time or mine if this isn’t sustainable. But I also don’t want to walk away from something meaningful because I’ve never felt this before and it feels unfamiliar.

Has anyone else gone through something similar — especially in your first serious relationship?

Is it normal to feel uncertainty at this stage?

Can emotional depth and love grow with time even if it’s not immediate?

How did you know when your doubts were something to work through vs. a reason to move on?


Thanks in advance for your insight."

404,1,"About a month ago I was broken up with by someone I thought was the love of my life. I tried to keep moving forward, but every time I was reminded of her I broke down into tears and tried to contact her. Eventually she responded again and yelled at me to leave her alone. It made me realize how horrible of a person I was being. Someone told me that it’s just the human thing to do. That I was just hurt and confused and I tried reaching out to the last thing that made me feel safe and seen. Now I just feel like a complete stalker and to be honest my energy to even get out of bed has completely gone."
405,2,"Hi,

My life started with where I wasn't able to do my personal chores such as with a famous one of not being able to tie my shoes. It continued with my suspicion of having a cognitive delay by having very bad studying skills and engaging in unthoughtful behaviors. This was then followed up by my failure to get into the university and therefore I instead achieved a vocational diploma worth EQF Level 4 in Europe. During all these times I suffered from meaningless anxiety and obsessive thoughts and compulsions. And at the current moment I cannot find a job either a parttime one or an occupation that is within my field (financial administration). 

This is different today, today I live independently where I even cook my own food and can tie anything within two seconds. On the other hand my studying skills improved and I became much more mindful of my behavior. And also happily my constant and passive anxiety and obsessive thoughts and compulsions ended. But now I cannot go to the university anymore as the financial situation of my family and I are really bad and at the same time I cannot find a job neither a parttime one or an occupational one.

I believe these may all be connected to my autism especially the cognitive delay as a major symptom of a neurodevelopmental disorder. 

This the sad story of my life. I would appreciate if you all have any advices for me."
406,2,"I feel so alone and because of several factors I don’t think I have anyone in my life I can talk to about all of my problems. I’m not asking for you to always be that person, but I’d appreciate greatly if anyone could at least help just for the night"
407,1,"I don't even know what to say. I feel like my marriage is coming to and end. And you don't have to apologize, or pretend to understand. He's spent most of his time with me asking for open relationships and threesomes. And when I declined he went looking for other relationships anyway. He often said that he was trying to make friends for me, but I always thought, why hide it? It's taken a toll on my self esteem, and in ten years of marriage I feel like I've wasted my life. 

I've been over it for awhile. Just going through the motions, looking for the courage to tell him I'm done. I knew it when I found out he was planning on sending money to someone he met online to have them visit him while I was out of town, and I didnt even feel hurt. I just shrugged and went about my life. I didn't care enough to start an argument. 

Now, as I'm standing on the edge, waiting to take that leap, I feel..lonely. Sure, I have friends that I could talk to, but I also feel like they've heard it enough. I don't know what I'm looking for. I think I've always wanted a great romance that stood the test of time, and find that it really must be a fairytale that I just can't let go of. I spend most of my time feeling tense, and looking over my shoulder because I don't want him to see what I'm doing, who I'm talking too because I'm afraid he's going to ask. I'm scared. But I'm very tired. "

This post will be meaningingful for the future me who's fears came true. Tell me just how much there is to do in this world. Tell him what kind of hobbies you have, and that you think I should try them too. Tell him what countries and cities you've visited and how much you enjoyed them. Tell him that there are parts of your life that weren't good, but parts that were good. Tell him not to give up, because sometimes, all you need is other people to help push you forward.

412,1,"Just finished up a relationship with someone I have known since I went to summer camp as a kid. Without planning we went to college together starting dating later in college and now it's over. Chemistry was always there but we just couldn't make each other happy anymore and every conversation came back up again sooner or later. I really thought this could've been ""it"" or whatever. Always saw her as a friend first, but after everything it would kill be to go back to that. The relationship lost it's life and fun and I would've destroyed myself trying to make her happy and she realized that before I did. I know it ended because we care Abt each other deeply and it all went very maturely bc all we want is each other's happiness but it's not something we can do for one another. Ive experienced Abt 9 million emotions in the last 2 or 3 days and am having a hard time reminding myself that it is possible to find someone I might be able to love more one day.

It's just so crazy. I told her that I'd wanted to marry her. I've known this person for a long time and it feels like I'm losing a part of me. I told her that it would be hard for me to be friends and I think she'd be open to it at some point. But I'll always want more. I didn't want to close that door but at the time it felt right. Went three years without seeing or kissing her and went through two other relationships before we ever even got together and I thought Abt her the whole time. Then I finally got what I wanted and it broke down. It is just hard thinking that this is where things stand now, part of me wants to take it back because she'll always mean so much to me. I feel like I messed up big time. I'm afraid that this will be the one that got away. Ill spend years with my heart pointed to the Northstar. Idk what I'll have to do to move forward. Ik someone who dated someone in college and he broke up with her and she never dated or married again. In her 60s now I don't want to end up like that.

416,3,"**I've spent my whole life being forced to create friendships I didn’t really want — either because it was “what I was supposed to do” or because I pressured myself into it.**  
Since I was very young, I've struggled to make friends, and whenever I did manage to, for one reason or another, they ended up letting me down (""childhood cruelty,"" I guess?). As strange as it may sound, I've never really understood the behavior of the ""average human"" — so many lies, so much pretending, so much cruelty in words... And that, one way or another, has made me lose interest in maintaining ""relationships.""

I’ve had romantic partners, and I’m currently in a relationship. I’m close to my family, and for me, my sister and my mother are an incredibly important pillar in my life.  
Both my mother (when I was younger) and my partner now keep telling me that I need to have more friends, that I should go out more and connect with people because it’s always good to have someone outside your family to support you and to do things with.

Because of that pressure — the pressure of “should” — I’ve created friendships that I eventually had to walk away from, because their behavior toward me wasn’t healthy at all. In the end, I kept choosing wrong.  
On the other hand, I do try hard to maintain friendships, but I end up feeling extremely drained after we meet up, talk, or do anything together. Everyone wants to hang out with me, everyone says I’m super nice, but my social battery runs out really quickly, and I need a lot of time to recharge — I can easily go a month or more without seeing a friend and feel totally fine.

This makes me wonder: am I just weird? Is it that I struggle to maintain friendships? Am I too demanding about the people I surround myself with?  
My partner tells me you don’t need to constantly see or talk to your friends, and that age will teach me that — but I’ve always felt like women are expected to be more “emotionally available” or more consistent when it comes to friendships, or else those friendships fade away... And honestly, I find that SO exhausting.

If you have anything to say that could help me, you're more than welcome to. I’d really like to find some clarity around something that has been tormenting me my whole life lol"
417,1,"I’m posting from a throwaway. This isn’t something I feel I can share anywhere else.

This hasn’t been about just one thing—it’s been building for a long time. The most recent events just made the weight too hard to carry alone.

My ex-wife and I divorced three years ago. We have four kids. Since then, our relationship has been off and on—never romantic again, just this strange, one-sided friendship that disappears when it’s no longer useful to her. Each time, she cuts me off and keeps the kids from me. I don’t know why. I never get a real explanation. It’s like a switch flips.

That alone is hard. But then I found out that, after we split, she was involved with someone in my family—someone I never imagined. I confirmed it, no doubts. The person involved is still married to someone I used to consider a parent figure in my life. I trusted them both. I looked up to them.

I showed what I found to two people I trust deeply—one of my kids (from a previous marriage) and my sister-in-law. I never expected or wanted them to ""do something"" about it—I just didn’t want to carry it alone. I needed someone else to know I wasn’t making it up.

When I brought it to the attention of the person I considered a mother figure, hoping for some kind of care or at least clarity, I was met with silence and then rejection. I was told to stay away and was blocked. That response broke something deep inside me.

I haven’t told any of my siblings. I don’t go to family events—not that I’d want to anymore—but I’ve learned that I’m actively kept out of the loop, like I’m a threat or an embarrassment. My ex and one of my daughters still go, and the rest of the family just pretends like everything is fine.

I’m in the middle of a difficult court process to get better time with my kids. But it’s slow. It’s draining. And with everything else, it’s hard to find the strength to keep pushing forward. I’m doing everything I can just to stay afloat. Most days it feels like I’m barely holding it together.

I don’t want to give up, but I’ve had those dark thoughts. I hate that I’ve had them. I don’t even know why I’m posting. Maybe because I needed to say it somewhere—to let it out instead of burying it. I feel invisible and discarded by the people who were supposed to love me. And I’m just so, so tired."
418,2,"Hey, I’m 17 (turning 18 soon) and I’m heading off to university in a few months. I really need some advice because something has been weighing on me.

A couple of months ago, I found out that my dad has been cheating on my mom with his cousin. Apparently, they had some kind of relationship before he married my mom, but that’s not really the point. The thing is, I used to really look up to my dad. We were super close and I admired him a lot. But after finding this out, I haven’t spoken to him. I can’t even look at him the same way anymore, he just feels like a completely different person to me now.

I actually have proof that he cheated. He was supposed to be going on a work trip, but it turned out to be a getaway with that woman. There were weird messages and I found things like contraceptives too, so it was clear something happened. My older brother and I both confronted him. He kept insisting that nothing bad happened, that it was just sexting, and that it wasn’t as serious as we thought. But that’s not what I saw in those messages.

He also said he would tell my mom, but he still hasn’t. I’m extremely close to my mom, we talk about everything, and it’s been so hard keeping this from her. I feel like I’m lying by not telling her and it’s eating me up inside.

On top of that, we’re a Muslim household and my mom always speaks so highly of my dad and respects him so much. Hearing her talk about him like that while I know the truth makes me feel horrible. It’s just such a heavy thing to carry, and I don’t want to leave for uni with this hanging over me and my family.

I don’t know what to do."

I’m always on here looking for voice calls because I’ve been stuck on the other side of the world for a year. 

It’s all winding down now, the team I’ve had with me are leaving, I’m going in 2 days.

420,1,"At 16 i told my mom i had thoughts of suicide and she got really mad and told me to “do it then”
i attempted twice at 16
i’m 23 now i keep reaching out. To my family and to my dad. I understand everyone has their own problems going on. But why tell suicidal people to “speak out” if this is the case? If this is the case why isn’t there a program instilled to allow people who want to go… to go?
My family makes fun of me. “you’re depressed, you don’t do shit, you’re suicidal, do us all a favor and kill yourself” was what my older sister told me in January 
Last time I called the hotline was in January too I think. All they said was “i think you just need to take a walk”
literally nobody care. i’m not looking for attention or anything. i just want to share. i dont understand why society says to “reach out to someone” but all they do is ignore us and label us crazy
I got my firearm safety certification last month so tbh Im ready to go. There’s just a part of me looking for something to hold on for and I can’t grasp onto anything 
Edit: I tried talking to God for half a year and nothing. "
421,1,"There’s a kind of loneliness that doesn’t shout.  
It drifts, like fog curling through old trees,  
or like the quiet between stars—  
a hush that carries the weight of everything unsaid.

I think I’ve lived most of my life there.  
In that soft in-between where dreams linger too long,  
and reality feels just a little out of reach.

Sometimes I imagine there’s someone else  
walking through their own silent spaces,  
carrying the same questions I do:  
*Is anyone out there?*  
*Do you feel this too?*

I’m not here to impress or entertain.  
I don’t have the energy for masks.  
Just a tired, beating heart  
and a hope that someone might hear it.

I am made of old jazz records and the smell of rain.  
Of forests that remember your name and skies that press down when no one’s looking.  
I collect odd thoughts like sea glass,  
and talk to animals like they understand me.  
I live in a world half-real, half-imagined,  
where conversations should feel like campfires in the dark—warm, a little wild, and just enough light to see the soul.

I’m not single, but I am alone.  
In that quiet, haunting way where even love can’t always reach the places that ache.

If you, too, feel like a dream no one’s woken up from,  
if you carry beauty and sorrow in the same pocket,  
if you still hope someone might see you—not just look,  
but *see*—  
then maybe… just maybe… we’re closer than we think.

I’m here.  
A whisper waiting for an echo."

436,2,"I was heavily abused my whole life and live in a hostile country. I never had my needs for safety and a home met. Never had a childhood or could live my own life. My nervous system is a mess. It takes all of me to even stay alive and I can barely function. I live in fear due to where I am forced to live. Everything around me disturbs me, and subjected to so much stress. After 27 years of trauma and abuse that really takes its toll. I am a highly sensitive person who suffers from severe OCD, CPTSD, intrusive thoughts and anxiety due to where I live. I have nowhere to turn to. No institutional help or rights. I am forced to “live” in a third world country. I am so traumatised from that. This place is not normal.

I am trapped in hell. I was owed a good life. That doesn't exist here. Now I am stuck here and don't have a right to leave. Don't have a right to normalcy or quality of life. It's so disgusting and unpleasant. People here are so ignorant. They have no concept of quality of life, hobbies or humanity. They think this is adequate or a good place to live. All my life I have spent horrified and traumatised by everything I saw. I just wanted a normal life. A decent life. I grew up around such misery and squalor and ignorance. And ugliness and evil. I have nothing in common with people here. There is nothing for me here. No life. I am forced to live this fake life under this fake identity that was forced upon me, inside literally my personal hell, a backwords and non sensical world, where I don't belong and everything is so horrible. I am traumatised. This place is so hostile. My nervous system is wrecked. I could never breathe or feel safe. I need mercy from these circumstances.

We met 2.5 years ago, I was ""Mommy"" to his son, and now I'm really really struggling to cope with the guilt and guilt I feel for feeling guilty. The spark notes of it is that he relapsed into drugs and broke so many of my hard lines and boundaries, and I had to take drastic measures in the process of breaking up with him which now I wonder if they were too drastic. I've had to move back home with my parents and sister, and every time I come back to the apartment to chip away at packing and organizing I can't help but cry because just a few weeks ago I never would have seen this coming. 

I know ultimately it's for the best, and my family and his family support my decision to cut loose from his self destruction. But. It hurts. I worry I'll never find ""My person"" again. I have anxiety about losing my beautiful home I had complete control of and having to return tail between my legs to my parents. I feel so utterly alone, despite friends and family supporting me through this because it still feels like a burden to lean on them.

445,3,"
I’m about to start a divorce. It’s not my first marriage and it’s not even my second. It’s clear that I’m not going to have that picture perfect family. 
I have kids. 
And it’s going to be another blow for them. 
But mostly I just feel like I failed. 
My current husband has a mental health problem and he does not want to take it seriously. I’ve tried it all, but he just doesn’t want to address it. And it’s time for me to face it and let go. 
What is hard — I can’t talk to him normally. He gets mad and frustrated and blames me for everything.
And it’s so painful that we can’t even just speak about this calmly. He was my closest friend. And he’s just not anymore.
I keep on trying to talk to him. And I know I should just stop. 
But I have no one else to talk to. 
The other issue is that I would have to have full custody, and I’d have to prove that he is no fit to be around a child in his current state. He won’t acknowledge it, so I’d probably have to go through court. And it pains me to do it. He is not a bad person. He is just ill. But he doesn’t want to address it. 
It’s a lot of pain. And at times I feel like I can’t breathe. 
My parents are great people, but they are in another country very far away. And they are dealing with their own very serious issues. So I cannot put this on them either. So it’s just me. And my kids.

446,3,"My parents always ask me that typical question of where do I see myself in 5, 10, 14 years, etc. The truth is that I don't see myself in 5 to 14 years. It feels like I've been living on hard mode my whole life and I'm not sure if I can keep taking any more things before exploding. School is a mess. I've been getting bullied ever since kindergarten, tests are stacking up, I found out that one of my friends (who I still don't know who it is) is leaking my struggles to other people and the bullying has worsened and I feel helpless. I try to ask for help, to my parents or to my friends, but I always get the same response. That I should stop listening to those people and focus on what actually matters. How?? How can I ignore it when it has been going on for more than 10 years?

I've been fighting with my parents more as well. My room is a mess and I haven't been studying, so they get angry at me. I try to explain to them that I want to study and that I want to clean my room, but I just can't find the motivation, that I can't do it even if I wanted to, that it happens to me even when its about doing the things I like, or things that I need to do such as going to the bathroom or eating. I don't know how to explain that feeling, but according to my parents it's just me being lazy.

The only things I'm good at were quickly replaced by AI and I don't think I'll ever be able to land a good job once I graduate, I struggle a lot with things like keeping eye contact or concentration which are crucial to land one. I don't know if I'll even be able to get into uni. I feel like a complete failure to my parents. It's not like I hate them, that they're evil. I love them with all my heart, and I'm just afraid of losing them. I'm afraid to lose my friends and everyone I care about. I don't know what the hell is wrong with me. Will life get better? Am I just overreacting? I'm sorry for the rant but I don't want the same stupid response that I always get about ignoring people because they're jealous and this is my last resort."

450,1,"Sometimes I don’t understand what I’m doing with my life.

I got caught up in my feelings and just wanted to let it all out in writing and see what others can suggest/advise me.

I’ve been going through an apprenticeship program, 1.5 months before I graduate and I just don’t know what I’m doing with my life anymore. 

I changed jobs mid way due to a toxic work environment and my exposure to the things I’m learning in my field. Once I changed jobs I had a mentor, tho he was verbally abusing at times I realized it was for my betterment in the field, now I’m doing much better than expected and career is looking good even tho I have a lot to learn still. 

I still have my issues with work but I feel like my real problems come from personal life. (28M) all I’ve done was online Long distance relationships. I’ve never met a girl in person and after just turning 28 it feels like that weight is coming down on me like a bolder. I suck at general talking as I’m an introvert, I don’t do much of anything but work, school, watch anime/youtube. 

I feel like my whole life is being wasted, probably because I’m 28 never dated and just tried to become a better person. However with this weight, I let myself go, I get random phases of being depressed, yet hiding it at work to show I’m not hurting. I have no real confidence in myself .

454,2,"34M. I've always been a paranoid person, even as a kid in my adult life, it kinda devolved into a paranoia of always feeling sick or more like being terminally ill. During the COVID lockdowns, I wouldn't allow my son and I to sleep in our rooms cuz I thought that the virus could be in the room and kill us, so for months we would sleep in the living room and I still couldn't sleep cuz if I fell asleep and my son would suddenly stop breathing I wouldn't be able to wake him up. 

Anyway, medically I'm good but you how sometimes you're working or playing and you move wrong. I know it sounds silly but now I feel like I'm a goner. I feel like the patients from the show HouseMD. I know I'm not rapidly withering but I can pull myself out of it. I swear I have brain cancer or something like that.

I'm not afraid of dying. I'm more afraid of not setting my son up for the future. It even scares me thinking I wouldn't watch him grow up to become a gentleman. I just bought a house for us last year, and whatever the effect is of me being gone is what freaks me out for those in leaving behind. Like how is he gonna pay the mortgage, he's not even in his teens yet.

I don't do drugs or anything. I've never smoked weed for the same reason that I think it would make me more paranoid, I feel like even medically cleared drugs would make me know that I am messed up and I'd spiral more into the craziness... Anyway thanks"

However, I pushed something too far which I shouldn’t have, which led to her becoming quite pissed. I knew I wasn’t thinking at the time and along with that I leaked some personal info of a very close friend to her, which she wouldn’t like to be shared. 

I apologised to her friend about it and I honestly feel very regretful about my actions.

I struggle expressing my emotions a lot of the time and this time I feel like I may have over done it.

I told her that I was really sorry and despite it wasn’t my intent to cause her grief, I blame myself for bringing this grief to her and that what I said should’ve never been brought up to begin with. I also told her that she is a great friend of mine, and I would never intend to do harm to her, and that as friends I do and still care about her and wish the best for her.

I tried to express my sincerity, but

I contacted her friend and he just said to leave her alone for now because she felt even worse.

I honestly don’t know what to do. I tried my best to be sorry and do some good but it only caused the situation to be worse and now he thinks I’m guilt-tripping which I could never do to anyone, even less possibility to her considering she is one of my best friends. 

(Excuse my language) I honestly feel that this week I’ve done nothing but Fuck everything up.

School starts soon again after break, and I plan to leave her alone for a bit and then whenever I get the chance just to physically say sorry to her but, then what.

Do I leave it for a longer time? 
Do I ignore it for now?
Why whenever I try to good nothing comes out good?
Is it just me?

Is it because I can’t express anything without seeming insincere or too emotional and potentially guilt tripping?

I honestly don’t know what to do. I tried my best to be sorry and do some good but it only caused the situation to be worse and now he thinks I’m guilt-tripping which I could never do to anyone, even less possibility to her considering she is one of my best friends. 

(Excuse my language) I honestly feel that this week I’ve done nothing but Fuck everything up.

School starts soon again after break, and I plan to leave her alone for a bit and then whenever I get the chance just to physically say sorry to her but, then what.

Do I leave it for a longer time? 
Do I ignore it for now?
Why whenever I try to good nothing comes out good?
Is it just me?

Is it because I can’t express anything without seeming insincere or too emotional and potentially guilt tripping?

If you have any advice, please, it would mean the world to me"
457,3,"My marriage has been on a rough path lately. Around 10 days ago, my wife accused my mother of theft. That hit me hard because I’ve always tried to balance things between my family and my relationship. After the accusation, things got tense, and I stopped sleeping in the same room with her. I needed mental space and peace.

I was staying strong, silent, and emotionally distant — not reacting, not fighting. I was calm. But last night, we ended up having a physical relationship. I didn’t initiate it, she did — but now I feel like it may have been a setback for my mental boundary.

She hasn’t changed her behavior towards my mother or shown any real signs of regret. And I’m afraid that she’ll now assume *“everything is okay”* just because physical closeness happened.

I’ve been quietly preparing for a future home and trying to focus on work and my child. But emotionally, I still feel confused. I’m not sure if I should completely detach again, or wait and watch her actions.

Have any of you been in a situation where physical closeness happened during emotional distance? How did you handle it?

Please be kind — I’m just trying to find a path that protects my peace, my parents’ dignity, and my child’s future."
458,2,"Hi,
This is my first time posting here, so I’m a bit nervous… but I guess I’m just hoping for a kind voice.

I’ve struggled with social anxiety for as long as I can remember.
Even small things, like saying hello or asking a question, feel really hard like I freeze up.
It makes me feel like I’m stuck behind a glass wall, always wanting to connect, but too scared to reach through it.

I don’t know exactly what I’m looking for… maybe just a few kind words or advices.

Thank you for reading. That already means a lot to me."
459,1,"Hi to anyone reading. I wanted to post something here to put my feelings out somewhere. Long story short, I had a patellar subluxation back in 2021 and have dealt with flare-ups ever since. For a while after I went to PT, I had active flare-ups that were mostly my own fault and stemmed from me not exercising enough. For the past year, I've started working out, and the past 10 months or so have consisted of heavy weight lifting and dieting, which has greatly improved my life. Also, working out legs has greatly strengthened the muscles, and as a result I have not had a flare-up for 8 months. However, this weekend I had my first flare-up in a long time. It is mostly my fault, as I worked out legs twice with little rest leading up to it, and then spent the day walking around, dancing, then got on my knees at the end of the day. Over the past few days, I've had pain and discomfort in one tendon in the back of my knee, which has made me mostly bedridden. It's horrible, and it brings me back to the time of my initial injury, where I was bedridden for about a month and wasn't really back to normal for over a year after. It was the most depressive period of my life, and this flare-up has bought me back into that state. The only difference now is that I am way more active, and it has gotten in the way of my life. I haven't been to the gym all week, and I took three days off classes this week, which is our last week of lecture. Today I managed to go to one required class wearing a knee brace, but even that was hard. I'm here laying in my bed just praying that this gets better soon. I haven't done my laundry, made my bed, I had two nights this week without showering (I can't remember the last time I skipped a shower), I've barely eaten. On top of that, the weather is finally nice out, and it's a terrible feeling to see everyone else but me enjoy it. Is there anyone else who can relate to this even a little?

TL;DR: Injury flare-up in knee has caused me extreme depression due to bringing me back to a point in my life where I had the initial injury, looking for anyone's words, or anyone who can relate"

I live with chronic illness, pain, and a brain that never shuts up. I’m mostly housebound, so it gets lonely—and I’d love to connect with others who are navigating similar stuff. No pressure, no expectations, just real talk and maybe a few laughs when everything feels like too much.

464,1,"At this point in my life, all I truly long for is someone who thinks the way I do someone who understands the weight I carry without needing to explain it.

I spent most of my life living in a beautiful delusion, one crafted by the innocence of cartoons, fairy tales, and dreamy movies. They taught me that life was supposed to be magical, full of love, hope, and happy endings. And for a long time, I believed it not just because I wanted to, but because I was conditioned to. But then, reality struck... and it was far louder than any bedtime story.

I still adore the idea of love. I think I always will. But I've never had the courage to experience it not in a world where vulnerability feels dangerous, and society measures worth in ways I can never align with. There are too many unspoken rules, too many expectations. So I kept my heart locked away, hoping someone might still hear it through the silence.

As I stand at 24, the future feels like a storm I can’t outrun. Everything terrifies me—uncertainty, loneliness, the direction this world is heading. The idea of bringing children into this chaos feels cruel, not beautiful. I don’t want to pass on fear, I want to end it but I don’t know how.

There are days I feel like I’m screaming underwater desperate for someone to notice, to reach in and hold my hand, even just for a moment. I'm not asking for perfection. I'm just asking for a connection that feels real in a world that rarely does."

I don’t want attention. I just want to feel like I’m allowed to exist without needing to perform.

468,3,"Hi everyone

Firstly, if there is a more appropriate place on reddit to ask for mature advice on something like this, please indicate where/which threads and i will remove this and repost there.

A lot is going on and has been for years, so here is the short version that mostly focuses on the now also. I have mostly relied on escapism to deal/cope with hardships mentally, i was bullied lots, have anxiety etc , and have been questioning my gender for years, which MAY indeed be a strong reason as to why i had so many social problems, i am male biologically and am gay and out to some family, gay because of my exclusive attraction to men, but ive never really seen, identified or related to men, in fact ive imagined myself as a girl version of me for years in my head, which has led me to make numerous forums (think thats what they are called), posts online detailing my thoughts, and pros cons of considering hormones and transitioning, essentially i feel physically comfortable in my body , but then why have the thoughts, I believe id have much preferred being born a girl, for multiple reasons, mostly just feeling like myself, openly being able to be feminine, girly, have long hair, date guys!! The gender thoughts have been on my mind so much, when they go away i feel freer, until they come back (i think thats gender dysphoria?) even though i like my male appearance too and name…so i go back and fourth, on my grandmas funeral 3 years ago, those thoughts were what plagued my mind , like wtf…

Extra Issues though: 
i am 30 unemployed, have never really had a proper job, live in the very small town i was badly bullied in which left me with ptsd, with time its gotten somewhat manageable,before i didnt wanna leave the house, seeing my ex bullies triggers me, but i can force myself out….i live with my mother , who has a good heart , but is lil conservative and in her mid 60s, she is tired of working she just wants me to get a job, she is saturated of having to pay so many bills, food for me, when her nephews come over she loves them but cooks and cleans, i say i will do it instead but she says no, and is left shattered, we argue on/off sometimes cause of the living situation, she worries when she passes what will be of me, i also cant drive (and have no interest in doing tests) and honestly regarding my identity i could not come out, that would end her, she knows of me being gay, but trans? I hinted in the past, she shut that down and she alone might seem like the big reason i dont explore more , but i dont know how id handle not passing, and hormones on my body….my mother is also stressed lots out of a very demanding job, like today we rushed to the vets cause my dog who has been with me for years became paralysed , its costing her lots of money and i see my mother so damn exhausted and depressed, she is fed up…

I need to talk anonymously to someone online cause i have no one else, I can’t speak with other family member’s . I wish i coukd just disappear somewhere no one knows me, how do i get work under these conditions? "

474,0,"Hey everyone 💛

I’ve been through some things over the years - addiction, homelessness, searching for meaning. And through it all, the one thing that really stuck with me is how powerful it is just to feel heard. Not fixed. Not judged. Just heard.

So I started building something - not for money or attention, but because I needed it too. It’s called The Book That Never Ends. It’s a digital book with no ending and no single author. Anyone can write a chapter - something they’ve lived through, something they imagine, something they just need to get out.

It’s messy, human, honest. Some stories are real. Some are fiction. All are welcome.

There’s only one chapter right now - mine. But I’m hoping it becomes a place where people from all walks of life can leave a little piece of themselves behind, and maybe feel a little less alone in doing it.

If this resonates with anyone here, I’d just love to hear your story.

Thanks for letting me share. This is the kind of space that gave me courage to start something like this in the first place, so… thank you."
475,1,"Hi. I don't know where to start and I don't know if anyone is going to read this. I have recently broken up with my long-distance girlfriend after 3 years of dating. It has been really hard for me. She broke up with me because we were not spending much time together because of work, studies. I have tried to change my schedule for her but she shut the door on me saying that she can't anymore without a chance to talk. In the first weeks, it has been really tough on me, I was really beaten up by it, I was barely getting through the day, I have some friends that I could talk to but they are not always available, my friends in real life are not that deep, they just brush it off saying only it is going to be okay, I have a few online friends, I talk to them but they don't always have time. And that makes me feel lonely. I live alone, my parents never wanted this relationship, I don't want to hear ""We told you so"", they even brushed it off once that I have tried telling that we stopped talking. Before, I had her to tell about my day, about something exciting, things that are sad and now, I don't have anyone to tell about those things, it is making me feel extremely isolated. I feel better after a month, I am trying to work it out, I feel a bit peaceful even though I didn't get a closure from her. I feel okay at work, I get distracted but when I am on my own, it hits hard, time to time I get panic attacks, it gets hard to breathe, my throat gets a bit tight, I start crying for no reason. I just don't know if I am going to be normal again. Everything is just laying on me heavy. I feel exhausted in the evenings, I shut down and I wake up in the middle of a night even though I am tired and I can't sleep much, getting only 5-6 hours of sleep. I am just afraid that everything could push me towards something I am really scared, I am trying to be strong, I am moving on, I am doing some things I enjoy but I am still scared. "

481,1,"Long story short I feel like a failure in life. Never had a job or a girlfriend. I turn 34 this summer. Because of autism and anxiety I never managed to fit in to a 9-5 environment so I coasted this whole time on disability benefits. I live with my parents. More recently they've had to look after my brother's kids and it got a lot noisier in the house. Then they started remodeling so there's strangers, more noise, house feels a lot smaller. That's when it hit me. I should be living on my own, with a wife and years of work behind me. Instead I'm just here."
482,1,"I know there will be no cards or text for me or visits for me, and the loneliness is hitting me.

I was an extroverted girl, someone who deeply loved life, really. I loved people, animals, and nature. I believed in a life of harmony and love.  

But then I developed severe anxiety, and I became extremely exhausted. At the time, I was being bullied, and I came from a household where I was neglected. I ended up in mental health care when I was 14, where I was diagnosed with everything except what it actually turned out to be: autism. Because, of course, a smart, motivated girl with friends couldn’t possibly be autistic.  

I accepted every diagnosis and gave my all in every treatment, but nothing worked — and I was blamed for that. I ended up in the foster care system, and when I turned 18, I became homeless. Because I was still being overwhelmed by demands that didn’t fit my autism (which none of us recognized at the time), I couldn’t hold down a job or afford a room.  

Again and again, I ended up in psych wards because I would crash.  

In just a few hours, I’ll turn 25. I’ve moved 16 times in my life, been hospitalized 30 times in 11 years, and I am admitted now, even on my birthday itself.

I’ve met beautiful souls along the way, (the best part of foster care and psych wards, people are so beautiful and unique and was lucky to meet so many!) but I’ve also lost many of them to their own mental illnesses. It was hard for me to meet people through the usual paths — like school or work — because I wasn’t doing any of that.  

Until I started dancing. There, I found a community. And then my body got sick, too.  

Most people moved on with their lives; they studied, went abroad, started working, and got married. I stayed behind.  

Anyway, tomorrow there won’t be any cards or messages. Visits I never get. No one knows it's my birthday. No one barely knows me.

25. I feel like I’ve failed the younger version of me. All she ever wanted was to meet people, to experience, to learn, and discover. To love and be loved. To live life at her own pace, surrounded by animals. (Luckily, I do have animals in my life — from a street dog to a rescued horse saved from slaughter. Somehow, I always found them, or maybe they found me.) 
I think what I’ve always wanted, most of all, was to find a home. In a place, in people, or both. But I didn't. Now I’m sitting here, surrounded by the white walls of a clinic.

And no one knows it’s my birthday.  
And that my teenage years and early twenties were wasted.  
I just wish the little girl I once was could have felt more held by the world.

I wish I, adult me, could have been held tomorrow, even if only in words. Feel loved.

483,1,"Not sure how to start this post. Simply put I feel as though I am unlovable. I am fucking petrified of women. My entire life I have been ruthlessly bullied for my appearance by nearly everyone I’ve known. And I have never had a genuine sexual or emotional experience with a Women unless I was incapacitated. Let me explain in greater detail. As a child I was short, fat, brown and had fucked up teeth. Guys and girls in my school would habitually make fun of my appearance calling me every name under the book. My grandparents and extended family would make fun of me for my skin colour because I was real dark whilst my grandparents and parents are light skinned with hazel coloured eyes. From a young age they taught me how to smile without my teeth and I would get told off if I was caught smiling without my teeth on camera. Till this day I genuinely cannot smile properly it looks so unnatural and weird, I have to keep my lips closed. From a young age I learnt from my dad and through life experience that I shouldn’t have any crushes because a girl wouldn’t reciprocate feelings to me. (To be fair that wasn’t even wrong to say considering I would have been rejected and made fun of.)

Nevertheless, I gave up all hope of being in a relationship and honestly I became a complete incel loser for most of my life and genuinely did not communicate with women. I hate/d seeing pictures of myself and would literally squirm away from seeing them. I was so revolted by my appereance that every time I went to the bathroom I turned off the lights so I could not see my reflection. Till this day I have this same habit (at this point I just enjoy showering with the lights off it feels calming). From freshman year I ran laps around my local park and starved myself almost every morning unti I became skinny. Shortly after I somehow got a girlfriend. It’s almost cliche for people to say that there ex is psycho. But believe me when I say this girl was fucking psycho. She was genuinely fucking psycho like she went to a psychiatric facility for trying to kill herself multiple times and acting manic. That relationship was short lived and I soon realized that no girl would ever love me unless she was fucked up in the head.

Fast forward to now. I am 21 years old and would say I am objectively attractive. At least according to most people. Yet that means nothing and to this day I still can’t even look at a women in the eyes. I’ve actually tried going up to a women in one of my lectures not too long ago in an attempt to get her number. In fact I thought she was into me considering she was blushing quite a lot. However she said she had a boyfriend and that was basically my que to fuck off which I respectfully did. I genuinely cannot remember the last time I’ve had a full conversation with a women and no km not being hyperbolic. I understand this needs to change but believe me I’ve tried almost every method imaginable to find someone.

I yearn to be loved and for me to be in love. I feel as though I have so much love to give. What scares me is that I am nearly 22 and I lacking so much life experience that comes from relationships. In fact I feel lonely. What is the best course of action for me to take?"

I'm male, in my mid 20's, and I live alone. I have a job that pays alright as I don't need much.  
  
The major reason I wanted to move out was because I hate my father. He's a homophobic conspiracy nutjob, a chronic whiner. He'd ramble about chem trails media turning the children gay during family gatherings. His hands-off parenting approach did nothing to raise me. When something was hard for me, his way of ""encouraging"" me to do better was saying how the other kids would laugh at me. He called me a pussy (because I lacked confidence, I wonder why?) when I was in ***elementary school***. Recently I learned that he cheated on my mother with a ***30 years*** younger woman. From my perspective, visiting my family just makes me feel bad, and I have nothing to gain. I wish I'd told my father that I want him to die, but the most I did was start a fight.

My mother is just unintelligent. She hasn't done anything bad, but she wants to coddle me (like sending me homemade meals) and doesn't respect it when I say no to that. I don't hate her, and I don't love her.

My sister is condescending, and puts words in my mouth, but always gets it wrong. I've kicked her during an argument.

I can't imagine another person as someone with thoughts and feelings like me. Probably why the 9 therapists I've tried all seemed useless - I don't see them as human and I don't respect them. Although I'm lonely, I haven't met anyone whose company made feel good; likely that person doesn't exist since the problem is me. I don't expect that anyone here can help me, but I'm desperate."

491,2,"I became a streamer to make friends. I’ve always tried to give everything I can and help whenever possible.

In February of last year, I met a group of people who seemed wonderful. We were all around the same age and got along great. But then drama happened—one of the guys started threatening self-harm and refused to get help, even over the smallest things. The group ended up splitting.

I stayed close to the person who felt like the glue of the group—a non-binary friend who seemed incredibly sweet but was going through a rough time at home. They would disappear from the internet off and on, but messaged me nearly every day. I listened, talked to them, tried to help however I could. I even started planning a fundraiser to help them when things got worse. I would do it again, because seeing someone suffer hurts, and I just wanted to be there for them.

Another important person in all this was a female friend. She would come to me for advice, and we played games together a lot. She told me about her problems with her family and her child, and I always listened and gave advice when she asked. Most of the time, I just listened, and she did the same for me.

Around that time, I met my current partner—someone who quickly became my everything. She has a lot of problems, though, and sometimes disappears when her anxiety gets bad. At first, I didn’t know how to handle that and got really worried when she’d vanish. I talked to my two friends about it. They were supportive at first, but then the NB friend said I was focusing too much on my partner. A week later, they cut ties with me out of nowhere.

I gave them space, and months later they came back saying they were worried about me. They admitted the friendship might not be the same, but they wanted to try rebuilding it. I accepted that, and kept my distance so I wouldn’t overwhelm them. I still messaged here and there, even though I was still hurt.

Then last month, both the NB friend and the female friend started ignoring me for weeks. I reached out and asked how they were, but got no response. I noticed the NB friend retweeted something like “cutting out people who give you bad vibes.” RIGHT AFTER I MESSGED THEM. That really hurt. So I made a vague vent post—no names, just letting out my feelings ABOUT LOSING FRIENDS. and trying to be better. 

After that, the NB friend messaged me, accusing me of airing things publicly and saying I only bring negativity and drag people down. The female friend didn’t say anything—she just unfriended me everywhere and announced she was leaving streaming.

It hurt. A lot.

I ended up blocking them both and just retreated for a while. I tried to be better. I got more therapy sessions, and I actually started feeling okay for a couple weeks. But after barely getting by for a while, today a close friend recommended I check out a new streamer. To my surprise, I was already blocked.

Curious, I looked at some clips… and realized it was the friend who had supposedly “left” streaming.

Now I can’t stop thinking that maybe I was the reason she left in the first place. And honestly, I don’t know anymore. Will I ever be able to make lasting friendships? I really thought we were close. But now I’m scared to open up to anyone again.

I’ve been alone most of my life in real life. Online spaces finally felt like a place where I could be myself. But now… I don’t know.

The question that keeps echoing in my mind is: Am I a bad person?"

Not in a fashion that it becomes so uncomfortable from like a willingness to be in a woe. If that makes sense? That is liking to have some non-pressured connection that feels like connecting. Name just some back and forth conversation with that pressure that flows. So provide support. 

So I can meet some nice platonic connections from here. Thanks."
497,2,"Hey. I know this probably isn’t the kind of post people usually make here, and honestly—I’m really nervous to even post this. I’ve been sitting with it for a while, and I still feel weird doing it. But I didn’t know where else to try.

I’m 17, and I’m in a situation where I need someone living in California who’d be open to becoming a legal guardian for me. It’s not full-time parenting or anything like that—I just need someone kind, emotionally safe, and willing to help me through something important.

I’ve been through a lot recently and honestly have nothing, and I’m doing this completely on my own. More than just paperwork, I’m hoping to find someone who genuinely cares. Someone who’d be open to slowly building trust—maybe even being that one safe person in my life.

I know this isn’t what this sub is really for, but I’ve tried everywhere else, and this felt like the only place I might reach someone real. I’m not asking to meet up or anything suddenly—just hoping to talk to someone who might understand.

I’ve always felt safest around warm, expressive people—especially kind of big-sister types. If you’re someone like that, or even just open-hearted and patient, I’d be really grateful to talk.

Please be kind. I know this is an unusual ask, but I’m doing this with a lot of fear in my chest, and I’m just trying to find someone who might care.

Thanks for even reading this. Please don’t bully me. Please be kind and dm

I think differently. I feel things most people ignore. I don’t resonate with the mainstream way of living, and I’ve stopped trying to fit into molds that were never meant for me. If you’re someone who values realness over trends, silence that speaks more than noise, and raw emotion over polished masks then maybe we’ll click.

I’m not asking for attention. I’m inviting connection real, mutual, grounded in honesty and respect.

General information about me:
- I have a creative mind. I play piano and percussion. I have lots of ideas I want to express, to enact, but life feels like it’s trying its best to give me the perfect hurdles for me to stumble over. I don’t intend to give up, but it’s so discouraging.
- I live with my parents, and have my whole life. Both parents are codependent on one another, and aren’t naturally able to establish boundaries.
- I am trying to broaden my worldview day-by-day. I am not sure if that’s why I feel constantly challenged by people I encounter in my life. It’s exhausting, and I feel that family, friends, & coworkers alike always need me to do something for them. I want to trust more, but I find it improbable for me to open up my deep emotions to anyone other than my therapist."

505,1,"Canadian here from Toronto, things are not going well. I graduated from a top business school and I have stopped counting how many resumes Ive sent out, but over a thousand for sure at this point. 

I thought things would be getting better by now, i have been lead on by a connection for more than 6 months but i just dont know that it will ever come through. I never stopped applying, yesterday i broke down in tears 5 times and even as i write this i feel it coming. 

Ive been a star student my whole life, did internships, listened to my parents, networked, involved myself in student clubs. Nothing works. 

At this point im becoming passively suicidal again i cant see things changing. Every day the city seems to decline more and im just broken. This is hell. Savings drained, going to have to move back home with somewhat abusive parents. I just dont know what to do anymore. 

Every recruiter says my resume looks good, ive asked so many people for advice or referrals. It never leads to anything. I just wanna lie down and give up. Failed the cfa probably because of depression, working hard for a real estate liscence but again the depression is kicking in making it so hard to work and focus. I just feel so failed by my country. All this work for nothing."
506,0,"Im looking to connect with someone who is deeply empathetic and understands the importance of emotional sensitivity. I feel things intensely and value genuine connection built on understanding and kindness.

Ideally, you're someone who:

Is a good listener and can truly hear what someone is saying, both the spoken and unspoken.
Is sensitive to the emotions of others and responds with compassionValues deep conversations over superficial ones.

Is kind-hearted and appreciates the power of empathy in relationships.

Bonus points if you also have an appreciation for art, creativity, or spirituality, as these are important parts of my life.

I have a special somebody who has been pulling away because of multiple reasons. When he doesn’t reply to my messages gives me small anxiety. It’s nothing crazy that would make me spiral out of control or that It will make me overthink, it’s more like, discomfort. Specially because we are consistent in our communication and when he starts to pull back, he tends to wait a day or two before coming back to me. Then we talk for 10 min (text) and then he’s gone again for days. 

Well… I told him that I wasn’t upset about it but I expressed how I was feeling that he’s pulling away and I miss him. This is what I wrote after he came back to me today saying that he was sorry when he literally left in the middle of the convo, if you could please read it and let me know what do you think? I’m here waiting for his answer and I’m feeling pretty anxious. 


——

This is what I sent: 

I knew you were going to eat and that you had a headache so I figured you went to sleep, but I did miss you yesterday, it made me go into the mentality of “well, if he doesn’t talk to me it’s because he doesn’t want to talk to me” but I know you’re doing your best and I trust you so I just need to get rid of that mentality, I’m just mentioning it not as nagging or complaining but more so as information because i want to be my most authentic self with you :0


And I want to put a remark on I know you’re doing your best and I trust that you’ll come around when you’re in the mood

I mean I guess that’s just coming from the fact that I feel like you have been  kinda pulling away, and that’s ok, I swear im not upset or complaining but what I’m trying to say is that i understand, and please take as much time as you need and that I’m not planning to leave or hurt you, and you’re safe to be yourself around me.

The only thing that bugs my brain is that I don’t want to bother you, not as a burden but as intensity. I thought it was ok, appreciated and welcomed but if it’s not, that’s okkkk, just let me know please, you can’t hurt me so it’s al good. I made a stupid Reddit post and somebody told me that “when a woman calls me bro I lose all respect and attraction I feel, it’s an instant turn off 💁🏻‍♀️” lmao. I guess I just want to make sure this is ok. I don’t send paragraphs and daily pics to my bro friends

And sorry I talk too much lmao, everything is good, I just don’t know how to explain what I’m thinking without over explaining, I just don’t want to be misunderstood, everything is fine and if you’re specially avoiding me in your *general avoidance, you don’t need to, I can go back to the friendzone normal interaction, just be honest with me and we’re gucci 👌

*calling it general avoidance because i asked you this before and you said that you’re not avoiding me but avoiding in general

Edit: just a side note, the reason why this is making me anxious is because I normally don’t say anything about how this behavior makes me feel. I just understand and don’t say anything about it, I give him space. "

It is true that I had a very rough childhood, but I have also recovered very much. However, I keep getting boxed into the way I interfaced with the world before when the reality is that they are way closer to the catastrophizing type of mentality than I am right now and then they project it onto me. I am struggling a lot right now with life in general -- a lot of it due to sheer exhaustion from being mistreated for so long (including right now by my ""boss"") and recent political events related to visa cancellations -- and I just wish I could be honest with someone without judgement, prescriptions on what to do, and outdated assumption.

I got out in the evening after a few tests. It was as if I came back to the land of the living.
The day after I was feeling ashamed, the rational part of my brain thought I overreacted. But I had absolutely no control on my body at this moment. It was scary. But what is more scary is that I don't know what triggered me and I fear it can happen again anytime. 
Can anybody share their similar story with me and the ways you can cope with it? Thanks for reading me. "
515,1,"I’m someone who’s always felt a bit different, and people often see me as weird or even crazy. They’re polite on the surface, but I get this feeling that it’s just for show—they don’t actually see me as a real friend or comrade.

One of my peers has started to take advantage of that. He constantly makes fun of me in front of others, and when I react or ask him to stop, he says, “Don’t take it personally, I’m just being friendly.” But it’s getting more toxic by the day, and I’m starting to feel worn down.

What hurts more is that no one stands up for me. I tried standing up for myself once, but it backfired—everyone looked at me like I was the problem. Like I was too sensitive or overreacting.

I don’t know how to process this anymore. I feel so alone, and it’s starting to affect my self-esteem and peace of mind. If anyone’s gone through something similar, how did you handle it? How do you know if the problem is you—or if you’re just surrounded by the wrong people?"
516,1,"**A Glimpse into My Past and Present**  
I look back on a life marked by pain, contradictions, and profound experiences. Even as a child and adolescent, I found myself both bullying others—in a desperate attempt to be noticed—and being bullied in return. Playing dual roles as both perpetrator and victim taught me just how difficult it can be to find one’s place within a community.

**Early Childhood, Language Challenges, and Hearing Impairment**  
My early years were filled with numerous hardships. When I was between one and three years old, my parents separated, shattering my emotional foundation. In addition, I struggled with a hearing impairment, often described as “hearing underwater.” According to my doctor, until around the age of five, I heard as though I were submerged. Because of this, I was unable to properly learn the languages of my cultural background as well as another regional language, and even my grasp of the national language was initially fraught with difficulties.

**School, Bullying, and the Desperate Struggle for Belonging**  
From my early school days, my behavior caught attention: I repeatedly disrupted class and desperately tried to be accepted by my peers. This desperate need to belong led me to bully other children—a misguided attempt to project strength and attract attention. In secondary school, the situation escalated after I behaved rudely towards a classmate and was subsequently punished for it. Later, during my transition to a higher-level school, I attempted to reinvent my image by fabricating stories about friendships and physical strength. Ultimately, these untruths culminated in a confrontation with roughly twenty other children—a humiliating experience that exposed the true pain of rejection.

My Father visited me maybe 1 or 2 Times per year max. He took me to the curch but it was an french speaking one and i failed to connect to the people there. I resorted to videogames and online worlds.

**Adolescent Excesses and Destructive Paths**  
In my later school years, I spiraled further. Regular alcohol consumption not only derailed my academic pursuits but also led me down a path of destructive behavior. During this tumultuous period, I began a relationship with a young woman, with whom I engaged in shoplifting. Later, when my first serious relationship began, an event occurred that continues to haunt me: when my partner became pregnant, I emotionally coerced her into terminating the pregnancy, fearful that our future together would be impossible otherwise. This action—by far the darkest deed I have ever committed—left both of us deeply traumatized and continues to cast a long shadow over my life.

**The Quest for Identity, Education, and Responsibility**  
My life eventually took several turning points. After failing in one field of study, I shifted my focus to social sciences to better understand human behavior. I then succeeded in earning a master’s degree in a career-changing program in another technical field. For roughly 18 months, I have been working full time, a decision I view as an important step toward taking personal responsibility and steering my life toward a more constructive path.

**ADHD Diagnosis and Family Conflict**  
At the age of 32, I received a diagnosis of ADHD—a revelation that cast many of my past behaviors in a new light. Despite this diagnosis, my mother refuses to acknowledge it, insisting that I must have fabricated my symptoms to obtain an explanation for my behavior. This ongoing familial conflict adds another layer of difficulty to an already complex personal history.

**Why Am I Writing This?**  
I write this today to take responsibility for my past actions and to confront my own history honestly. I acknowledge that I have caused much harm, and I know that the road to reconciliation with my past is fraught with pain. Yet, deep down, I long for a future where I can regularly engage in physical activity, explore my creative passions, and ultimately build a healthy, loving relationship with a partner. Through these honest reflections, I aim to lay the groundwork for continual personal growth—even if that growth comes with the heavy burden of past mistakes. It is my first step toward accepting my scars, learning from them, and perhaps one day finding forgiveness—both from myself and from others.

519,1,"Lately, I’ve been feeling weird, like I’m not sad, but I’m not happy either. I’ve been reflecting a lot on life, people, and what it means to actually feel connected. I don’t really have friends. I don’t talk to anyone consistently, and sometimes I wish I had someone to talk to. Someone who gets me. Not necessarily to text all the time, but just someone who understands me, someone who sees me.

I feel like everyone has their “person.” That one friend, that relationship, that presence in their life. And I don't have that. I wonder why. I try to work on myself, I’m doing things to better my mental health, my appearance, and just my life in general, but sometimes it feels like no matter how hard I try, I still feel like I’m failing… like I’m not enough?

I live in a small town where meeting people is hard, and online people either ghost, don’t respond, or the conversation just dies.

I don’t think I’m afraid of rejection. I’m okay with people not being interested that’s life, but what hurts is that I feel invisible, like I don't even get the chance to connect before it fades away. I just want something meaningful. Someone who can meet me emotionally. Someone who values uniqueness and realness over surface level stuff, ig? Someone who feels, like I do.

I don’t know… maybe I’m just venting. Maybe I’m just longing for a connection I’ve never had. I don’t know. I always say to myself.  "

534,1,"A few months back, my girlfriend of two years broke up with me, as a consequence of her developing feelings for someone else. 

Getting back into the dating scene has been really rough. I met one girl I thought was perfect, but I got overzealous and asked her to be exclusive too soon. 

I met another girl who I had a phenomenal first date with. She asked if I liked being with her and talked about what we should do “next time”. After the date she kept blowing me off until I got the hint.

This week, I met a girl that I had a ton of fun with. We ended up sitting and talking for hours. The next day, I asked her if she’d want to schedule something in a few days and she said that she actually had an event that night that she wanted me to come to. While we were on that date, she suggested that we get together for a movie on Saturday (today). At the end of the night I kissed her and, as I moved to pull away, she grabbed the back of my head and pulled me back in.

I cleaned my apartment, bought the supplies for dinner, and cleared my schedule, only to get a text from her today that she thinks she needs to be on her own for a little while. I was so excited to cook for her and to spend time with her and now I’m just completely crushed."
535,2,32M. Need someone to talk to about anything and everything. Lot on my mind and don’t just want a listening ear.
536,2,"I (19M) have been in a recent breakup with a girlfriend (20F) for a year. It was messy and toxic (she basically cheated), but that's besides the point. After the break-up, I became fixated on having ""happy crushes"" that I distract myself with so the I wouldn't be wallowing so much in the pain while still trying my best to focus and improve myself.

I recently realized that these ""happy crushes"" have been literally my only source of self-improvement and growth. I realized that me trying to look better, improving my university grades, being more organized, and being more social have all been because of an interest to a specific girl, and it's giving me a crisis because it feels like I have zero self-respect, yet at the same time all the people in my life have been so supportive of me and complimenting me because they all see it as a postive.

It's even gone to a point where I also realized that I've ALWAYS had a girl crush throughout my life. That this has been what's happening throughout middle school and high school. Some of the improvements that I feel the proudest of, like me breaking out of my anti-social shell, was due to me trying to court a girl at a specific time in my life. 

I feel like my life has been centered around being appealing to girls and the worst part is no one has really condemned me for it. I still have stable friendships and relationships, my grades are good, I can take care of myself, but deep inside it felt like I reached all of these because of being motivated to be with a girl. I'm genuinely interested in helping other people too and I typically prioritize helping other people more than I prioritize helping myself. Which is probably the problem, because I only help myself when I crave the satisfaction of chasing a girl and having the assurance that comes with being in a good relationship with that girl. 

I genuinely I hate myself for being this way, and that I had so much potential and could've accomplished more if I had just learnt to do things for myself. Now I'm on another cycle of improving myself for a girl again. It feels like an addiction that I need to quit at this point, but I really don't know how. I need help.

P.S. To not come across as creepy, it's not something perverted or having sexual desires. I court women because I want to feel loved and have a good relationship with them. My sister who I often open up to tells me that it's due to all of my friends being in relationships. That, childhood bullying, and lack of closure from previous relationships were all probably part of the problem. "

I was notably sad before that tiring day because of something in particular as well, I guess it's a mix of those feelings coming back and my obligation to focus on new work.

539,1,I need to confess my guilt to people. Please be between 18-30.
540,1,"It’s not a nice world.. it’s hard to have a big heart because people will take advantage.. is there hope that good and evil meet in the middle for peace ??

It makes me sad that people want to hurt others and inflict pain and suffering.. it’s sad.. is there an antidote?? LOVE??"
541,1,"I'll try making a very long story as short as possible.

I was diagnosed with clinical depression when I was eleven and struggled with fitting in with my peers for a long time. I've made friends over the years, but I've been plagued with emotional anguish for most of my life. Most times my family wouldn't know what to do and sent me to several therapists over the years. Some therapists were of no help whereas others were a **tremendous** help. I even started getting put on meds to help me balance my emotional state out.

Fast forward to my mid-twenties where I've learned that I'm treatment resistant to most of the meds I take, so I get recommended to try TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation). It's like a much more gentle version of ECT (electroconvulsive therapy), but still very effective.

As I'm getting reviewed for the process, a psychiatrist does a genetic swab to see if I have anything else that might be affecting me. Turns out I have ""polymorphism 5HTTLPR"". The best way I can explain what that *is* would be to say that I don't recover from negativity very well and am more easily prone to becoming overwhelmed. A very important discovery to make and bitter proof to show I've been suffering for most of my life.

Unfortunately, I would continue to suffer and struggle to find much needed satisfaction in life. After so much treatment for most of my life, it can get overwhelming to know how little I've progressed.

Recently I experienced a significant emotional meltdown with my mom and brother as witnesses. When I finally calmed down, my brother said something that twisted my perspective of this whole thing. He mentioned that he might be autistic, which is why he has a hard time understanding what I'm getting at sometimes. My mom realized that his revelation resonated with her too, and she began to wonder if she's autistic too. It turns out neither of them have tried any significant amount of therapy and knew they might have autism (online tests). This bothered me because they assured me, they would go to therapy too.

In hindsight it seems that most of my family would deem all of my unhappiness something of my own doing. I have no problem with that if it's true. In fact, I'd *prefer* that. It would mean that a resolution is within **my** power. Yet, for so long it has seemed like I've been unable to move forward. I've neglected to question if my family knew what they were even talking about. Even *I* have been tested for autism, but by a psychiatrist, and they found that I don't match that category.

What if I've been getting tested and mislead for most of my life because my family felt I was more broken than I actually am? What if my capacity to communicate isn't so horribly hampered by some mental illness of my own, but because *they* struggle to understand social cues? I feel horrible to point fingers since it's not as though there was any malice involved, but it's an avenue I've yet to explore very much.

I'd like some help untangling this mess building in my head."
542,1,"I cried alone in the college washroom today. Not because of one thing, but because I’ve been holding it in for too long. I’ve always been calm, kind, and avoided conflict. But people mistake that silence. They dominate, blame, and never try to understand.

My own family didn’t see my pain when I was a child, and now I feel the same again as if no matter how good I try to be, it never matters.

Sometimes, I feel I’m the problem. But deep down, I know I just feel more than others do.

I saw this line somewhere:  
*“To the one who cries in silence and loves without asking back*  
*You're not unseen. You're just rare.*  
*And rare things are often misunderstood, but never replaceable.”*

I don’t want sympathy, I just need to be heard. Thank you for reading this."

Mid 20s male here. I got rejected from a scholarship recently and it’s thrown my entire life course for yet another spin, once again. 

I’m pretty disappointed at the results. I imagine there’s another version of me that’s excitedly preparing for his studies abroad upon receiving a successful offer, but here I am, scrambling to find alternatives to fund my studies and needing to worry about finances instead of enjoying myself.

I’m not really sure what I want to say, I just know I don’t want to keep it all inside anymore.

It’s one of those nights where everything feels a little too much, not in a dramatic way, just quietly overwhelming.

My chest feels tight, my thoughts are loud, and I honestly don’t know what I need. Maybe just a soft conversation, or even a stranger who won’t expect me to have answers.

I’ve been listening to Billie Eilish tonight, her music feels like it sits beside you in the dark, not trying to fix anything, just being there.

But he's recently started talking to this guy in a dating app.  I hate feeling jealous and I feel so selfish because he talks about him and how great he is and all I can think is ""How could you not see me like that?"" Or ""Why can't you see me that way?"" I know it's such a selfish way of thinking and I hate it so much. I'm happy for him but, I can't stop thinking like this. I'm trying to move on. But another thing that happened tonight and one other separate time. My friends made this joke. I was teasing this guy and he said ""And how many people have you dated?"" I'm pretty sure he was teasing but it pissed me off. I've only dated one person and they were an asshole who would flirt with me and be all touch before we dated, then after we did they just stopped. It was truly awful, I thought there was something wrong with me that maybe I was the issue. But it was just awful. Maybe I'm being unreasonable getting upset about it. But it hurt alot. Considering the fact he considers his fucking elementary and middle school as dates ( hes dated once in highschool as a freshmen). Which to me is fucking stupid. But it hurt alot. I know I'm not attractive, I know I'm not social or out going and flirty. I know. But it feels like a punch to the face when He said that. Like I was lesser than he was for not having dated more. It just felt like a shivers to the face. I know he was only joking around but it still hurt like hell."

552,1,"Hi. I’m 23, jobless, and lost. I live with my parents which is nice. It’s a good environment, and they love me, my whole family does. But this past week has been real tough and I’ve been struggling hard mentally to sort it out.

I guess I’ll start with the fact that I’ve been struggling with anxiety for years and years. Started in highschool, had only gotten worse, I’m diagnosed with general, social, and panic disorder as well avoidant personality disorder. It sounds insane but I’m quite normal with the people I love. Where I struggle is anything uncomfortable or unfamiliar. And what I mean by that is I panic, hyperventilate, sweat, cry. I’ve gone to therapy and gotten better, but I only say this for context that life can be hard sometimes when I feel like this. It makes me want to shut myself inside a room forever. Also I just wanna add that I’ve always thought I was beautiful until the past few months.

Ok with that I’ll tell you that currently, I volunteer with animals a lot. I love it, it’s quite possibly the only thing that makes me feel at peace in my head. I love animals so much. 

I just got out of the military, it wasn’t for me and I feel like I failed. I feel like I’ll never keep a stable job because of my crying habits and inability to control my sad emotions. I feel lost and incapable of starting another job up. I feel hopeless that it will work out and that I will waste that opportunity on a good job. 

This week has been harder than usual, before I was able to tell myself to keep going, but everyday that passes by I think of something new, from gaining even the tiniest bit of weight, to feeling like I’ll never find love, a job, even a nice friendship. I feel horrible about myself, and it’s been a while since someone told me I was doing a good job. I’m begging someone to talk to me and make feel like I’m doing alright. Everyday that goes by I feel more and more like I don’t wanna put in any more effort, I don’t wanna be here. I just want something small. I need anything tonight, anything please. I need something."
553,2,"Sometimes my confidence is sky high.  
But most of the time? It’s buried underground.

My past was full of jokes, memes, empty laughs. Don’t get me wrong—it wasn’t a good time. Just… hollow friendships.

These days I’m trying to value myself more.  
Back then, if I had told my friends “I wanna write a book,” they’d laugh their asses off.  
I don’t blame them. I chose them.

Now I read a lot. I play guitar. But secretly.  
Because I *know* they’d turn it into a joke.

I even thought about moving to another city just to reset.

I wanna meet new people—people I can actually share meaningful stuff with. But my city sucks for that.  
And when I *do* meet someone new, I freeze.  
Like if I share what I know or love, they’ll laugh too.

And then there’s the sweating.  
It’s like… the *moment* I think I might sweat, my body’s like “bet.”  
I sweat like crazy—even if it’s -2°C outside.

Idk what’s wrong. I just wanna connect. Be seen.  
But I keep hiding. From them. From myself."

I hope that's at least useful to someone and I hope you all have a much better day and a beautiful tomorrow.

555,1,"I uhh… I don’t know where to start. As of right now writing this I don’t even have a subreddit to post to. They all have some kind of rule that prevents me from talking about certain things that I need to say. There’s nothing bad in this post. It’s just me venting about my problems. God, when I say it out loud I feel like an a-hole for being so entitled. Advice is welcome but the truth is I probably won’t listen to it. I’ll tell myself that it’s great advice and I need to follow it but I won’t have the guts to. I’ve never had the guts to do anything. I need someone to talk to and for some reason talking to random strangers on the internet seems to be the most comfortable option.

I guess I start this like a conversation with someone I just met… Hi. I would give you my name but the internet is full of creeps so I’ll tell you a little about myself. I’m 17 years old, going on 18. Something you would notice immediately is my stature for a 17 year old. I’m 5’6. I’ve never really had any problems with being this tall but deep down it’s bubbling up. I know they say that size doesn’t matter, everyone has their own quirks. It doesn’t seem that way. I’ve never been diagnosed with ADHD but I’ve also never been checked and I show a lot of symptoms. But I’ve also never been diagnosed with depression…yet here we are.

My life is not hard. I’m a white male whose parents are still together. I live in a nice house my parents make survivable money and I even have a job of my own. Which is what makes my thoughts that much worse. I feel like someone who just wants attention but not a single person knows about what I’m talking about here. It’s very cliche and corny but I’m a completely different person in a public setting. It’s just when I’m alone… in the dark… with my thoughts. I’ve had suicidal thoughts before but everyone has… Right? I’ve always been told that these thoughts are not good I’ve had so many they feel… normal. I’ve never had the guts though. I’ve never even really gotten close. Not even an attempt. Just the thoughts. I feel wrong. I feel like everyone’s life would be so much easier if I just ceased to exist. If I was never here some of my friends might be doing better for themselves. It’s my fault. I’m the issue.

I’ve never experienced love. Or at least, I’ve never experienced love from someone else. Of course my family loves me. I don’t think my mom would be able to live without me. I know I’m heart that there’s someone for me. I know that it may take some time. But why do I feel the way I do. And why don’t I do something about it. I have a friend who’s also never really experienced love. His life is way harder than mine. Yet he’s thriving. He’s doing better for himself. He making a change. I can’t. I don’t know why. I struggle to sleep. I struggle to get up. My mind feels like it’s been on autopilot up until this point. Senior year was supposed to be easy. Senior are basically adults they can do whatever they want and don’t have to worry about anything. 1 class in the school day! Lucky! God what I wouldn’t do to be 7 years old again. So much stress and anxiety now. So many responsibilities. But y’know… that’s life. If that’s life than why not start over once you’re 18.
I don’t condone suicide. I think it’s a plague and it’s spreading way too fast. I think that if you’re feeling suicidal reach out to someone. Anyone…

But I don’t feel the same for myself.

I’m sorry to whoever reads this. I don’t expect you to read the whole thing. It would’ve been better if I could physically say it but, I didn’t know who to talk to.

I plan on going to my grandfathers grave tomorrow. Somehow talking to a stone in the ground is easier than talking to a person.

I’ve been trying to change my life the last few years. I’ve done all sorts of crazy stuff all through my life. 

A few years ago I went on a course to get yacht captain qualifications, and last year I landed my first captains job unexpectedly in Asia on a big brand new yacht. Much bigger than is normal for a new captain. 

I got stuck in Asia for a year and I’ve been very lonely and isolated, not that I wasn’t before. 

I’m now in the phillipines with a boring yacht crew, landed a few hours ago, very stressful work and no friends around or to call…can’t find a bar to go to or anything fun to do. 

I’d love to talk to another human, about anything. I can talk about me, or I have space to talk about whatever you want. 

Anyone want a voice call? "
562,1,"Hi,

I am not in major crisis, but i've been really down lately. I’ve been feeling this heavy kind of loneliness. It’s like there’s an invisible weight in my chest that doesn’t really go away. Some days I feel okay, other days I’m on the edge of tears and I’m not even sure why.

I’ve been trying to be more open emotionally, but it’s hard. I’m someone who overthinks, feels deeply, and sometimes struggles with small talk. I do have friends who I value dearly, but they've admitted that they do not possess the tools required to help me with what I'm going through. 

I’ve been through a tough breakup. It’s made me quite apprehensive about forming new relationships. I’ve been too scared to pursue new people, and I’ve even rejected people’s advances because of that fear. I often feel like I’d be too much for someone to deal with, that the way I see the world now might make me a burden.

I came across this sub and wanted to give it a shot. If you’re also someone who feels things a little too much, or just wants to talk about life, thoughts, music, anime, emotions, or whatever else comes up… I’d really like that. Whether it’s just for tonight or something more ongoing, I’m open.

We started seeing eachother again he booked a massive suite for us, took me to dinner multiple times, went to the Christmas markets together, buys me expensive gifts. I was at his a couple weeks ago and we had the best time together, I stayed and the next day we went to the gym together and went for lunch. After that I just never seemed to text him and he never text me. I was always waiting for a text from him tho. Since then we just haven’t spoke. I text him a picture of an outfit I thought he might like but no response.

100% not looking for medical advice but recently had some eye issues, optician referred me to eye clinic and had various tests done. Eye doctor wasn’t a good communicator and just said I need another test and a blood test. 

I have a terrible phobia of needles and tbh anything medical, the eye infirmary was about my limit and I had a panic attack the entire time and threw up immediately after. I also have health anxiety and because the eye doctor was a bit weird I’ve been spiralling for a week. Each day is hell at the moment and I can’t see how I can have these tests. 

I am trying to get help from my doctor but it’s NHS and mental health so, you know. I’d appreciate anyone to talk rubbish with for a break from my own head or let me vent my irrational worries.

Im struggling to grasp how everyone else especially older than me is not just in a constant state of fear, I talked to my parents about this and they seemed to just not really even give thought to it.

569,3,"I’m 22 now, and my first memories are of my parents screaming at each other. I never grew up feeling safe, rather the opposite. I’ve lived in fight or flight my whole life. For many years I was afraid of physical violence, then in college became terrified of disease. This terror led me to the er two times where I got two full torso CT scans in one year. I was initially relieved nothing was wrong, but now I’ve learned about the radiation risk and my life has spiraled out of control. I cope by counter balancing everything else in my life. I eat like a saint, drink weird little mushroom health drinks, but it’s becoming exhausting.

I am of course now diagnosed with OCD. My parents are very supportive and in tune with their child NOW, but failed to recognize my early signs of OCD (locking doors and windows, hand washing, etc) even though they BOTH HAVE OCD TOO!

I am rapidly getting mental health treatment, but it feels too late. I needed that years ago. Now I’ve made my fears physical with unnecessary radiation, and can think of nothing else besides the cancer risk. I’m so angry at all the people who should have known better, the ER doctors, my parents, me.

I literally can’t imagine feeling safe in my own body ever again and I don’t know if I’m overreacting. Probably. Regardless, I have become my trauma and my fear, and created a lifelong shadow to run from. I am a shell of my former self, waiting for the shoe of disease to drop.

571,1,"Hi, I’m posting this anonymously because I’ve carried this weight for 6 years and never told anyone. The name in this letter — David — is fake. He’s a real person who’s still in my life, and I’m not here to shame or attack him. I just want to feel heard, because I’ve never had a space to express this pain out loud. Everyone around me is either too close to him or won’t understand why something “so small” still affects me.

This letter might feel long, but it captures something I’ve never fully processed. If you’re someone who likes listening, thank you. That alone means a lot.

Dear stranger,

There’s this one moment in my life that changed everything for me. It's been 6 years, but it still affects how I show up in friendships, how I see myself, and how I use social media. It might sound small to others, but it never felt small to me.

I had this friend — let’s call him David. We were very close. He used to post pictures of himself on Instagram, and his posts would get around 50 comments. I really admired him — not just because of the attention he got online, but because he was confident, good-looking, and “cool.” I always felt like the “uncool” one around him.

Back then, I used to post about him a lot — stories, pictures, tagging him — and he would often ask me to post things about him too, especially when he felt too awkward to post again and again himself. Because we had many mutual friends, posting through me helped him feel seen. I did it happily, out of blind friendship and affection.

One day, I asked him to post a picture of us together. I wasn’t trying to “get even” or anything — I just wanted to feel like I mattered to him as much as he mattered to me. I even insisted a bit, saying “If I’m your best friend, post it.”

He did post it.

But later… he deleted it.

No explanation. No conversation.

I later found out it was because the post didn’t get as many comments — just around 20. He deleted the post because it “underperformed,” and somehow, I felt like I was the reason for that. Like my face, my presence, brought his image down. And that one action crushed me.

I’ve never fully recovered from it.

It made me feel like I wasn’t good enough to be seen with someone publicly. Like I was someone people want to keep hidden. Like I was a burden to their image.

That might sound dramatic — but I’m just trying to explain how it felt. After that, I stopped wanting to go out with friends, or be seen in public places, or even be in group pictures. I didn’t want others to feel like they’re “lowering their worth” by being associated with me.

It also changed how I use social media.

Even now, I can’t post anything freely. I overthink everything — who will find it cringe, who will comment, what if no one responds? I get so anxious. And at the same time, I’m desperate for someone to tag me or post about me. Whenever that happens, I feel like I’ve been crowned. Like I’m finally “worth something.” I know it’s not healthy, but that’s how my brain works now.

I feel like I’ve tied my entire self-worth to this silly, digital validation. Even though my mind knows this is “just Instagram,” my heart feels like that is real life. And if people don’t show that I matter publicly, then maybe I really don’t.

What hurts most is that David never even had a conversation with me about it. He didn’t explain or express anything. If he had said he wanted to maintain his aesthetics or that it made him uncomfortable, at least I could’ve tried to understand. But silence? That just made me feel like I didn’t even deserve an explanation.

I’ve internalized this for years. It affected my studies. My confidence. My relationships — even with my cousins and my parents. I’ve even had suicidal thoughts because of how worthless it made me feel. That’s how deep it went.

I know some people reading this might think, “Oh come on, it’s just a deleted post, people have real problems.” But for me, this is real. This one moment shaped the way I relate to the world.

I’m not asking for sympathy. I just want someone to say,
“Yeah… that sounds really hard. And you didn’t deserve to feel this way.”

I don’t want people to scold David. He was probably immature back then. I was immature too. I’m not angry at him now. I’ve just been carrying this wound quietly, and today I wanted to let it out.

Thank you for reading."
572,1,"My husband (31M) and I (28F) really want to adopt a child(ren) from the US foster care system and after another rejection, I’m just really down on myself. This time it was a sibling set of 4 and after our interview they told us their needs are very high and that they need to find a different family that can meet them. Which has left me with, what about us says we were not up to the task? We wouldn’t have applied if we didn’t want to be their parents and that we weren’t ready to accept everything that comes with. 

I tried not to get my hopes up too much but something just felt different this time and I thought they were ours. I had made plans, I’d found things to decorate their rooms that correlated with what they like. I got too excited.

Now I’m just sad and triggered. I didn’t know that adopting from foster care was this competitive, that there were so many families who are also applying for each kid. We’ve applied for over 20 kids, ranging from 3-16 in age. We submit our home study, we interview, we wait, and it’s always a no or sometimes they just ghost us. And I’m left grieving these kids we’ve never met.

I just don’t understand what we’re lacking and I’m wondering if it’s time to give up. I don’t know if I should keep pushing for this. Thank you for listening."

If you need a shoulder to cry on, a more neutral opinion, advice, or just to vent (the latter helps a lot), I can try to help without judgement.

I think it's much easier to share your problems with a stranger because you don't feel like they can judge you as much as a friend or family member might. If you just want to talk or make friends, I'm avaliable too.

Hey… I’m 14 and I just got moved to a new grade where I don’t have any friends — not even my brother. Me and my brother got separated for the first time, and it’s really hard. I feel so alone and I just wanted to cry today.

576,3,"Hi everyone,
I never thought I'd be in such a situation, but life has really broken me lately. I started a business with someone I trusted a lot, even considered a close friend. I invested everything I had—my savings, took loans, used credit cards—and ended up losing around ₹30 lakhs.

When things went bad, my business partner walked away and told me it was all my responsibility. I come from a normal middle-class family where even 1-2 lakhs is a big thing, so there's no one who can help me financially.

I've been borrowing money from one source to repay another, just to survive. But now, all doors are closed. I'm mentally exhausted, emotionally drained, and financially stuck. I’m not asking for sympathy—just needed a space to share what I’m going through.

If you’ve been through something like this or just want to say something kind, I’d really appreciate it. Just being heard matters to me right now. Thank you for reading."
577,2,"My friend is dealing with so much right now—emotionally, mentally, maybe even physically—and I’m really worried about her. She’s such a kind, gentle soul, and she’s always there for other people. But right now, she’s hurting, and she’s so scared of being a burden that she won’t let herself fully lean on anyone. I keep trying to remind her she’s not a burden, that she’s loved, but I don’t know how to actually help her feel that way. I can’t fix the things she’s going through, and I feel helpless. Could you help me out by sharing something uplifting? A quote, a wholesome story, something funny or beautiful—anything that might remind her the world can still be kind. 

I’d love to show her this thread to help her feel a little less alone. My friend’s family is going through so much, and it’s absolutely heart-wrenching to see. She’s one of those people who gives her ALL to everyone around her, constantly caring, worrying, supporting—everyone except herself. And now the weight she’s carrying is just... too much. She’s the sweetest, most gentle soul. She struggles with opening up, with meeting new people, with feeling like she’s allowed to take up space. She’s scared of being a burden, but I want her to know she’s not. She’s worthy of joy, lightness, and love—not because she’s struggling, but because she exists. Because she’s her. 

I don’t know how to help her right now, but I want to give her something warm and real. No pity. No pressure. Just kindness. If you could share something—anything—a funny memory, a wholesome moment, a beautiful quote, a compliment, a silly doodle, even an ice cream date... anything to remind her the world isn’t all darkness, and that she deserves every good thing without having to earn it. I’ll show her this thread, so if you have something nice to say or share, I’d be so grateful. Thank you 💛 If I could wave a wand, I’d ask someone kind in New York to just... meet her. Not to fix her, not to ask a million questions, but just to be a soft human presence. She’s been gently refusing me lately—saying she doesn’t want to “burden” me or “ruin my day.” (Her words, not mine.) But I know she’s lonely and tired and holding on by threads. She’s 24, just like me, and I don’t know how to get through to her that people can and want to be there for her. I just want her to feel held by the world for a second. If you’d be able to and you feel like spreading a little love— even just by replying here—or if you know of safe community spaces or low-pressure meetups, I’m open to anything. She’s worth showing up for."

It’s been a few months like this. Some days I handle it, others just feel harder for no reason. You probably know that pattern, the way your mind plays tricks, even when everything looks fine on the outside.

582,3,"Okay, so I’m not really sure how to word this clearly, but I hope you’ll understand anyway. My dad is constantly in and out of the hospital because he’s seriously ill. He has cancer, Crohn’s disease, diabetes, and a bleeding disorder that makes him bleed very easily. That also means certain medications don’t work well together and can cause severe side effects. Last Thursday night, he collapsed and lost a lot of blood…there was blood on the floor and even on the walls. I’ve never seen that much blood before, not even in movies. I’m extremely scared of blood, so I felt like the worst person ever, but I still managed to call the ambulance, and they came quickly and took him to the hospital. He didn’t want me to come with him, and the paramedics said it was probably best if I stayed home to calm down. So I quickly packed some clothes and his medications since he’d need to stay at the hospital for a few nights. Then I stayed home, had a panic attack, and started throwing up (I have an anxiety disorder, so things become overwhelming really fast). But I tried to stay focused and cleaned up, threw out the rugs, and tried washing what I could. There was just so much blood. Meanwhile, I was waiting for texts from him. I didn’t really sleep that night but I dozed off around 4 AM, just before school. At school, I told my teachers I wasn’t feeling well and couldn’t guarantee that I’d do well on the tests that day, and they were understanding. We also had regular classes, and then my only friend in class started saying stuff like, “Damn, you look dead,” “You’re not funny anymore like you used to be,” and “You’re so lazy for not showing up at school and ditching me.” (Two weeks ago, I missed school because my dad was hospitalized again and my anxiety got so bad I couldn’t eat or sleep.). She always makes comments like that even though she knows what’s going on. At the same time, she complains about things like, “I have so much schoolwork, you don’t understand how hard it is for me with dyslexia. Your life is so easy, you don’t even have to try and you always get A’s, so stop complaining.” And when I speak up or try to set boundaries, she says I’m being too sensitive or that I’m just trying to create drama. But this is about my dad… Now she told me, “I don’t want to be friends with you anymore. Have fun without me. I don’t care. You’re too sensitive.” just because I wanted to defend myself because I feel like my emotions matters. This also happend like two weeks ago when my dad got into the hospital. So its not the first time "

I’ve always had a close relationship with my mother and I’ve felt as if she was always loving and supportive towards me, even though at times I’ve started to realized this was due to me being “easy” kid or even a parent kid.

Recently I’ve met a wonderful guy through friend group and I, as I usual spoke to my mother about everything as if she were my best friend, told her about him and that I’m slowly starting to like him. She went completely mad - he’s POC and she told me she doesn’t want me to be in a relationship with anybody with darker skin tone than we are. She literally said “It’s either him or me”. Until now she never expressed any racist thoughts with me prior to this and raised me anti-racist. I’m so shocked and disgusted and mad and I don’t know what to do, this showed me what kind of closed-minded person she is and how she loves me only when I suit her plans.  "
588,1,"Hi everyone. I’m 32, and my girlfriend (partner?) of 9 years asked for a break 3 months ago following a painful rupture—one I take full accountability for. I betrayed her trust, and I’ll never minimize that. But what’s breaking me now is how the aftermath has unfolded.

We didn’t really set clear expectations for the break. She said she still loved me, didn’t want to lose me, and needed space to figure things out. I’ve respected that space every single day. I haven’t begged, chased, or broken boundaries. I’ve been in therapy. I’ve faced my anxious attachment head-on, dug into my past, started learning how to self-regulate, and do the deep work I wish I had done long before now.

But the silence… god, it’s killing me.

It’s not the loss of contact that hurts the most—it’s that it all feels so vague. She never clearly said goodbye, but her distance feels like abandonment. I feel like I’m grieving two things at once: what I did to her… and what she’s doing to me now.

I know we needed a pause. Even without the rupture, I needed space to uncover the roots of my attachment wounding. I see now how I’ve sabotaged relationships out of fear of being left. But still… after nine years, I thought I’d be treated with more care. More clarity. Not this slow emotional bleed-out.

I’m exhausted. I miss being held. I miss having a soft place to cry. I miss her, but more than anything, I miss feeling like I matter.

I’m just asking for a little kindness from people who understand. Please don’t tell me to move on or stop hoping. I’m not here for advice—I just need a little warmth from others who’ve lived in this space before. I’m tired of carrying this by myself."
589,1,Hy! Guys i am in dipression i want a friend. 
590,2,"It's 6AM, I just woke up and as usually I started to feel anxious because thoughts overwhelm me.

I need to vent, I really do.
I left my gf in the bed and now I'm closed in the bathroom and I feel like I don't even want this day to start. Lately I've grown very scared by changes, modifications of my life and routine.

What the hell is wrong with me? I'm into this relationship since a year, and from the start I was obsessed with her past, made all kind of checking, snooping, spying, extreme jealousy, both retroactively and in the present. I don't even know how this girl is still staying with me.

We're not a happy couple though, after some months of sharing a house, I start seeing in her things that I don't like.. but you know what? Realizing that I have OCD makes me wonder if that's really me or my illness. So I'm in a situation where I don't know how to trust what I feel.
I told my therapist ""how can someone with OCD know when they're not in love anymore?""
Yeah, I've been doing CBT since last September and maybe things have improved a little.

It's been a week since we've had sex and I don't even feel like wanting to do it. Why? I don't know!
I was prescribed meds by three different psychiatrists and I refused to take it. Why?
Because I'm scared of side effects like weight gain and sexual dysfunctions, but you know the funny thing? I feel so tired, depressed, empty, for the majority of the time, that I've been experiencing premature ejaculation and that's another thing that pushes me away from wanting to have sex!

And also because I'm a firefighter and I like to be on the streets doing emergency service, but if they find out thayt I'm taking psych drugs they'll take me out of the streets and send me into an office. And the colleagues will be laughing at me, I mean they already do! They've spotted that there's something wrong with me and they don't lose the chance to talk behind my back, and I might've made mistake to open myself up with some colleague who wasn't worth of my trust!

I live in a very small house with my gf in Milan and now that I have the chance to move in a bigger house, I'm scared AF of this change, because I don't want to face another relocation, but that's not the only reason! These are houses rented to people who serve in different corps, like police, firefighter, and when I realized that one of my colleague applied for these town hall houses I got anxious that he could be my neighbor because he's good looking and he could make a move on my gf and I freaked out!

My gf talks to me and while she does it, in my mind thoughts come up like ""yeah she's said that because she's a bitch"" or my mind goes back to those details of her past that I've wanted to know and made me even more jealous about the past.

My family? A dead end too. I don't really talk about these issues with any of them, maybe just my mother. My father is an asshole and he's maybe the cause of my traumas. Cheated on my mom and beat her senseless and us too, he's a sociopath with no remorse. My brother is about my same age and he's got homosexual OCD too, that should make us feel closer right? Yeah, in theory, but in practical terms we always end up fighting over the phone, our relationship is twisted and complicated like Chuck and Jimmy on Better Call Saul, if you know the series.

This summer? Well, this summer to me feel like hell! My gf's job contract is ending in June and she hopes they'll renew it in September when the school starts again, she's a teacher in primary school. But yeah, when the school closes she wants to spend as much time as she can back home, in southern Italy, and I'm stressed at the idea that I will be going back and forth from Milan, because yes, I have holidays too, but not three months straight! And on top of that, at the beginning of July, she's going to this resort village in Puglia, where she annually work as a kids tutor, for a week, during some sport events for young kids, and that is scaring me since months! Because from my interrogations about her past, I knew that in the past years, she had summer flirts ; last year I went with her in this village resort, and you know what? One of the assholes was actually there and I had to bear his presence for a whole week! I don't even know how I survived that! And now this summer I feel like I NEED TO BE THERE to be sure that he or some others she told me about, aren't there!
What kind of miserable life is living like this?!?

I'm still sitting on the floor in my bathroom and I should go back to bed and trying to get some sleep. Tonight I'm working the night shift and I should be rested.

I don't even know the meaning of this post, I've been complaining in the comments about the presence of many posts are who aren't really helpful because they don't contain helpful resources, but maybe the truth is that I've been looking for magic solution about my mental issues, like if the key of everything is somewhere out there, and it could unlock my mind from all of this sorrow, that's why I've been wanting to know so many peoples opinions about my obsessive jealousy.. and I'm still looking for it since I've got no full faith in my therapy.

Also, discovering that people with thyroid autoimmune disorders are heavily correlated to mental disorders, made me sad because I have thyroid's issues.

I'm all kind of fucked up. 
Thank you and sorry to anyone went this far through this post."

592,1,"**I feel childish for crying so much over heartbreaks at 25, but I just can't help it. I'm a very sensitive person. I rarely open myself up to relationships (the last time I did, it ended badly too — over a year ago). I don't actively seek romance.**

In January, I casually met someone at a party. I didn't think much of it and wasn’t particularly interested in him. But he followed me on Instagram the next day and seemed genuinely interested. I replied, thinking, *""Okay, let’s see if he’s fun — it’s been so long since I got involved with anyone.""*

He was quite a bit older than me (38), but he was cool, kind, and respectful, so I decided to give it a chance. We played video games together, talked for hours, and he told me I was perfect. He gave me sincere compliments and made me feel seen. Safe.

Almost two months later, we met again — I was going on vacation, and he lived nearby. We spent four whole days together, and it was... beautiful. He made me breakfast. He loved watching me play his favorite game on his PC. He was so kind and affectionate.  
We shared interests — I got curious about the things he loved. I restarted *One Piece* because he adores it. I bought his favorite game so we could play together. I even started learning how to solve a Rubik’s cube because he offered to teach me.  
I cooked for him. We played with his dog (who loved me), we went hiking, to the beach... It felt mutual. We laughed so much. It all felt incredibly natural, like we’d been doing this for years.

After I came home, I decided to invest in this — to open up again, even if it’s scary.

Then this Tuesday, he told me we should stop. That he didn’t feel the same. That he didn’t want to hurt me. I appreciate the honesty. I really do.  
But I feel so misled. So deceived.  
How could someone make me feel so safe, so wanted, and then just... leave?

It’s always like this with me.  
I’ve never truly been loved.  
I’ve only had two short, miserable relationships (both around four months).  
But I have *so* much love to give.

  
I guess I just needed to share this somewhere. I’m not looking for advice, just some kind words. Maybe reassurance that I’m not unlovable. That it's okay to feel this deeply. Thank you for reading."
593,1,"Hello all!  
I'm new here, had chatGPT suggesting me this subreddit! Yup sometimes chatGPT can be a weird kind of ""friend"" and it's somewhat funny at certain point but we need to be aware that we can't just replace a machine for human connection once our nature is socializing or at least try to.

And talking about human connections sometimes I feel like I'm a woman where her friendship doesn't worth it or that nobody wants to be around me. And I feel weird complaining about that once I have 42 years old and 2 kidos to take care of! But the truth is that the friendship once I thought I had, is not there...she keeps giving me excuses to not  even take a coffee...

I think is weird not have friends but all my live all my ""friends"" were deceptive and now I avoid in fear of being hurt...need kind words

594,2,"I met a girl recently, she is amazing but we’re long distance. I’m terrified of the idea of having sex with her though, because she doesn’t know what I did when I was younger. When I was 12-16, I did stuff that I majorly regret now. The one piece of comfort I have is that I was a kid and didn’t know how wrong it was at the time.

If she wouldn’t be intimate with me because of my past, and we did have sex, that would be rape by deception.

I’ve spoken to her about this, and she’s said she doesn’t care about who I used to be, but who I am now. I’ll be seeing a therapist soon and she supports that. But she also said something that makes me think she wouldn’t want to be with me if she knew.

I don’t feel comfortable disclosing my past to her though, ever, and you cant maintain a relationship without intimacy. I have no idea what to do. Am I cursed to be lonely forever?

I’ve seen posts that say lying to get sex is rape by deception, and others saying it isn’t. What can I do? What do I do?"

Before we were seeing each other, she was just my friend who I treated platonically. When we first got to know each other she was  trying to flirt with me. I wasn't very responsive to this, because  at the time I thought she was in a non-open relationship, and at times unsure if she was really attracted to me or if I was misunderstanding her signals.

Things settled and she stopped dating that guy.  one late night, we kissed, and told each other how important we are to each other. eventually we made love, but she didn't want to rush into it this time, and I respected that despite being really excited for it. She reminded me that she used to think I was asexual, ""but not anymore"" and we laughed about it. Eventually we had sex, and I enjoyed it but I also found it a little uncomfortable. (I'll get into it more later on in the post.)

We have a lot in common, and after dating for a bit, she's told me she's never quite liked someone this much. We've written hand letters to each other about how much we care about each other and other really cutesy stuff. 

 It really means the world to me to hear that from her, I cherish a lot of the little things we do. Going for walks, doing crafts, holding hands, cuddling... Sometimes I worry that she doesn't like me as much as I like her, even though I have no logical reason to believe that. 

But I've had experienced in the past that have left me scarred, and I think it's created a big insecurity for me in terms of seeing myself as loveable.

That said,  I probably think about our little adventures and moments together  than I do about sex. Its not that I don't think about sex with her, but this time it's been different;  I do think she's physically attractive, but I am more attracted to her in a non physical way. She isn't my usual ""type"", but that doesn't bother me. I like her, because she's her, and I find those aspects of her attractive because it's her because what attracts me most is her on the inside.

She  has a huge sex drive. She's explained to me how important sex is in her life. I am slightly less experienced than she is. The majority of the time we've had sex, I have found found it physically uncomfortable. Not always but most of the time.

I'm a little sensitive, and she is very tight and the  positions we've tried  haven't been that comfortable for me. I think this sometimes makes the sex feel short, and I get kind of embarrassed about that. I  feel like I should be better at this or that it should feel better during it. This leads me to feel shame and anxiety.

I think it's also important to note that I am also someone who has an addiction to erotica, which I use to escape my anxiety (though it's hard to say you ever truly escape... it's only temporary.) I have a lot of anxiety and my sexual fantasies have often been a way to escape those kinds of thoughts... Which has not been healthy in the long run. I've been making a lot of progress recently in terms of my mental health, but lately I've backslid and I've been doing the same behaviours I was doing before.

I felt a deep sense of shame, which only prompted me to do other mote unhealthy habits. If you've never been addicted to something before, then you might relate to this thought pattern: ""well if you are already doing this unhealthy behaviour then why not this one, too?"" Basically, When you don't like yourself, you won't treat yourself kindly and you'll start to treat yourself worse and worse. So for example, I haven't been eating as much and when I do it hasn't been healthy, I haven't showered as often, I rarely have gotten out of bed, and I stopped cleaning my house as much. I know that's gross. But when you're in a bad mental state, you just find it hard to overcome that battle.


This made me recently cancel plans with her yesterday. I knew I wouldn't be in a good headspace, and I felt gross.

 What I'm about to say might sound weird because erotica is such a sexual outlet, but when I'm really struggling with addiction... I find it even harder to be intimate in real life. The reason, I think, is because addiction doesn't actually solve the issues that are underlying it's cause. So now I just have this built up emotion of anxiety, shame, and worry that I am not properly dealing with. 

So I told her it might not be a good idea say night, but I probably will feel better soon. We're seeing each other Friday, anyways.


 In the morning she texted me, ""I still think you might be asexual"". 

This felt hurtful to me, but she assured me she didn't mean it in a negative way.  She told me that she used to wonder if I just didn't find her attractive. But she also said that I don't seem to initiate or be as interested in sex as much as other men.

We talked more and I think it was a good conversation. But I don't think it makes sense to assume I'm asexual.  I don't want to be asexual, because I don't think she'd like me as much if I was. When I told her this she then said, 

""Even if you were, I'm not going anywhere."" And that she does really care about me, but wouldn't be sure how things would unfold.

This reassured me to an extent. But I told her I also just don't think I am asexual. I clearly have sexual feelings. We've had sex, and while not always perfect it seemed like we both enjoyed it sometimes... Even talking to each other about how hot and passionate we found it, and being very affectionate with each other afterward.

At the same time, I know that sex is really important to her. Probably more important than it is to me. I think I could date an asexual partner, but I wouldn't enjoy the fact they weren't interested in sex. But I'd be able to accept it. 

 I feel a lot of  I worry that I'm not ""good enough"", for her. I know how important sex is... And it's been making it harder to get into the right mood where I'm not second guessing everything I do. Sometimes it feels more like a performance than being able to enjoy myself.

Or, am I really asexual? Perhaps on the low end of the asexual spectrum? I grew up on a household were my sexuality was shamed at an early age, and a lot of my previous sexual experiences have been a little traumatizing, which I think is more likely the explanation for my odd sexual behaviours.  I think it makes it hard for me to get in the mood, and not worry so much. 

So what do I do? Am I some kind of asexual? I feel like I'm not. What steps should we take to make sex more enjoyable for both of us?

Tl;Dr, girlfriend thinks that I'm asexual, but I don't;  I believe I have a lot of psychological issues regarding sex and myself in general. What am I? And How should I become more confident and comfortable in the bedroom? 

Or just some reassurance or comfort would be well appreciated."
604,1,I'm very tired of struggling and getting nowhere. I don't see any hope of things getting better. I don't even know what I'd want or how they could possibly get better. Life is just a miserable failure.
605,3,"I’ve been having a hard time recently. My boyfriend is dealing with a serious injury and having to jump through insurance hoops to seek needed treatment. We’ve been together less than a year, and it’s hard watching the excitement about our new relationship turn into anxiety about his health. Didn’t get a promotion at work and then the person who did got fired. I feel judged by my family, I don’t feel very supported by my friends, and even my therapist seems at a loss for how to help lately. I’d love someone to talk to, preferably another woman or a nonbinary person around my age, and I’m happy to offer support in return. I enjoy music, movies, art, baseball and college basketball, and nature, LGBTQ+ friendly. Thanks for your consideration. "
606,2,"Hi everyone.

I am really struggling to cope with what just happened. I just got home and the feelings aren't going away.

I am currently in Florida, and I saw gopher tortoise about to cross a road. I stopped and ran to it to try to help it, when a truck swerved to hit it it on the shoulder. They saw me almost there. I was only about 25 feet away.

They had time to stop. It was completely avoidable. 

But no, they sped up and swerved to hit it and I am angry, heartbroken, and I feel sick.

I am scared they would have somehow not done it had I not tried to help it. 

I just don't understand. I don't know how to get the sight and sound out of my head now."
607,1,Going through a break up and I need someone to talk to
608,0,"I know this will sound a bit out of place, I should ask in a tattoo sub perhaps, but I need someone gentle with mental health who knows their ink well. While the tattoo communities tend to be generally safe, mental health friendly and helpful, there are times someone's snarky or gives a bit of a tough love. The last thing I need right now is getting triggered when I just crawled out of a very very very bad place. Whether you're a tattoo artist, or someone who knows about tattoos a lot, I need an advice on my first tat that would really help my mental health, but it's against the general 'rules' that I'm aware of. I'd appreciate your gentle help. Thank you!"

610,3,"Hi everyone, I'm new here and just wanted to share a little about where I'm at.

Lately, life has felt like way more than I can handle. Recently, my girlfriend of 5 years told me she's found someone else and wants to be with them. That news completely broke me — she was my best friend and the person I leaned on the most. On top of that, I'm a full-time caregiver for both my mum and dad, while also holding down a full-time job.

Most days, I feel like I'm drowning. Between the heartbreak, caregiving, and work, there's hardly space for me to even process it all. I try to stay strong, especially for my parents, but the loneliness and exhaustion have been overwhelming. I lean on my faith when I can, but if I'm being honest, I'm still struggling deeply.

I'm here because I just needed a space where maybe someone else understands what this mix of grief, responsibility, and isolation feels like. Even just reading your stories helps remind me I'm not the only one. Thank you for letting me share.

TL;DR - New here. Recently heartbroken after my girlfriend of 5 years left me for someone else. On top of that, I work full-time while also being a full-time caregiver for both my mum and dad. Feeling overwhelmed, isolated, and drained. Just hoping to find people who understand."
611,2,"I've been trapped with a horrific abuser for many years. He is a rapist, he is violent, and a misogynist. He believes he is my loving partner & that we will be together forever.

My two good friends are helping me escape in a few weeks and move in with them. It's all gonna happen in 1 day, when he's not home.

I'm currently also experiencing some major medical problems & this will make the move/the drive over much harder. This part in particular is terrifying to me.

Please, I could use some kindness, some gentle words, some love, some encouragement. Have you ever been through this, how did it go for you? Did you regret it & then miss them? 

I am terrified, I've never had to do this before in my life, ever. Never had to just disappear from a partner's life to save my own life."
612,1,I have a difficult relationship with my bio mom and it’s really hurting me today. Was wondering if maybe someone who’s a parent themselves could help me out? Need a supportive ear and need to maybe ask some questions about what it’s like from the parent’s perspective. I’m 29. 
613,1,"Hey folks,  
I’m trying to figure out how to build real, genuine friendships—especially with other LGBTQ+ people, but really just people I can connect with and be myself around.

I’m autistic, have ADHD, anxiety, depression, and a hearing impairment. So yeah, socializing comes with some extra challenges. Group settings are confusing and exhausting, and I often feel like I’m missing out on the unspoken rules of how to connect with others.

I’m not looking for party scenes or hookup culture. I just want to know how people make day-to-day friends as an adult—like, how do you go from small talk to actually being in each other’s lives?

If you’ve been in a similar place, how did you meet people who *get you*?  
Where do those friendships start for you?  
And how do you maintain them when things like mental health and sensory issues make socializing a limited resource?

Thanks for reading. I’d really appreciate any advice or stories from people who’ve figured this out or are still figuring it out like me."

616,0,"am a caring empathetic guy. With a good emotional intelligence and decent logical abilities to understand your issues. I am flexible about my work timings, so can adapt to your schedule . I'd prefer voice calls but initially text is okay . Also open to developing friendships in the process but only if we have common interests and similar hobbies etc or we like each other's company.

I'm from India. Open to people from all countries .

I can advice you about relationships , career and even investments . Since I have good knowledge of stock market and various asset classes like bonds, mutual funds etc. Can also teach you some programming basics. I'm good at software stuff. I love Linux.

I don't block or ghost anyone . If we have things to talk about or you can keep the conversation going, then I'm sure our connection wouldn't fizzle out."
617,3,"I have had a very shitty week. 
1. My unemployed sibling threw tantrum at me cos he messed up his job interview. 
2. I had 2 difficult clients who complained to me while in fact they are the one being difficult. In friendships worst case scenario you can block them if things really get bad. However you can't cut off a customer. They haven't been abusive, just very very difficult to deal with. And i can't runaway from them. 
3. My dad accidentally posted girls on bikinis on his whatsapp status. In the past i did see his search history, it was also something that i would rather not see. When i was 6 i also found a nude of an actress in his computer. 

Now yes i do understand everyone has desires. 
But i would love to not see this, if you get what i mean? How do i unsee this? I didn't tell anyone yet. I only told him to delete it. 
On top of that he is very religious as a Christian which is very embarassing. I honestly dont think i will confront him because i have a feeling he will deny it and he will say that it was his friend sending him that. 

This is a good dad who has shielded me from my mom's anger when i was a kid. He also paid for my education so i have $0 student loan thanks to him. But it still broke my heart. 

On top of being worried about my brother i have additional stress and i cannot talk to anyone about this without embarassing myself.  and i really feel helpless. "
618,1,"Ok, so, first off, this isn’t my type of thing, so apologies. 

I graduated law school less than a year ago. In my 1st year of law school, second semester, one of my best friends since freshman year of high school passed away very abruptly in a motor vehicle accident (4 years ago). He was more than a best friend. He was a brother, a confidant, and a man who saved my life on more than one occasion in several ways. His family, understandably distraught, did not realize that they scheduled his burial on my birthday, and I was a pallbearer for my best friend on my birthday. I’m not sure at what point, but, somewhere around that time I just immersed myself in studying and anything else that could keep my mind off of the loss. I’ve always had a very close-knit circle, and I honestly didn’t know how to cope. I became estranged with many friends and very close with others who knew my friend who passed away. 

About a month before my first time taking the bar exam, my grandmother passed away. I had been studying roughly 8-10 hours 6 days a week, and once I heard she was sick and in the hospital, I dropped everything and stayed with her in the hospital for 3 days until she passed. My mother and I were extremely close to her and she was an absolute angel of a woman. She made me promise to her that I would not let her dying be the reason that I did not take that bar exam, and dammit, I didn’t. 

My mother, also a saint, has dealt with trigeminal neuralgia for the past few years and has suffered immensely. The loss of my grandmother almost crippled her. She is doing better now with the loss, but the pain in her face has worsened. Seeing her suffer has taken an immeasurable toll on me because there is nothing I can do about it. 

Things have been less stressful compared to the bar exam and law school, thankfully. But, that free time has left me with time to actually absorb what has happened and I feel like my ability to control my emotions is crumbling. I keep stumbling over the loss of my friend and the memories we don’t get to have now. I’m also realizing that I compartmentalized all of that stuff and coped with it in many different ways, many being unhealthy. I’ve taken the steps to talk to someone, but am genuinely worried that by doing what I thought was protecting myself at the time, I just put a bandaid over a bullet wound and let it fester. 

I don’t know how to help myself.

627,1,"Hi, lovely people. I am so ashamed to share details of how i emotionally abuse and i feel so much guilt and regret. Almost 4 months ago i started my healing journey after finally admiting myself i am mentally abusing others. I work on myself with professionals. I kept myself selfaware and accountable and it worked until something unexpected happened - it seemed like i will lose my close person and i started to feel heartbroken. Everything turned into chaos and destruction. I lost stability and caused pain again. I feel so ashamed and guilty. I don't want to hurt anyone but i did in last days. My close person is here with me after all, but as I look back I did destructive, hurtful, unforgivable acts. I am stable again but i never want this to happen again. Any ideas what could prevent me from relapsing? Thank you for reading and take care of yourself."
628,3,"Hi all,

I’ve got a kind of still new job as a yacht captain, currently delivering a big luxury boat across Asia with a volunteer crew at the wrong time of year. I’m very stressed. 

I’m genuinely feeling a bit down in the dumps and incredibly lonely whilst doing it, which is making it worse.

I’ve barely slept the last few days, not eaten well, drunk too much alcohol. Worked about 20 hours+ a day. 

I have some free time right now. I’d love a voice call with someone and I’m really looking for some kindness and compassion to try help me relax and maybe sleep. 

But I’m a pretty kind and compassionate guy too, if anyone’s needing a kind voice themselves hit me up: I can always give a little more :) and talking to anyone about anything would probably help me "
629,0,"I hope this is okay to post here.

I had a very bad experience in my country's military. Over here, we have conscription and I did a year. It's actually easy enough to avoid, but I fell for the myth that it would have a big impact on job prospects if I didn't go.

I've created a community for those who don't want to go, or, those who are already in and want to leave. There's no shame in it. You don't have to have a deep reason for it. ""I don't want to"" is more than enough.
I've created it because I know it can be daunting, there can be a stigma involved.

I know this sub doesn't allow advertising and that's not my intention, if this is seen by the mods, I just want to say that I wanted to provide an important support service. It's focused mainly on Greece, but look, if anyone else here finds themselves facing similar situations in other countries, you're more than welcome to post there as well, we accept posts in multiple languages. If you're more comfortable with it, DM me either.

631,2,"For example I say think about an exam there will be students who barely studied but still get good grades and there will be students who genuinely work so hard but not even pass,shouldn’t the result be based on effort .maybe that person might not be studying in right way,but then what about his effort isn’t it only fair if the person know how to study 
I can’t just turn a blind eye to this like it’s so painful like why does it have to be like everyone is on different scale of talent .ok maybe its because we need balance in life but bro then why does it have to be like the person who lose have to feel sad.then at least it could have been like the person feel at least ok and normal

Whenever I ask people for feedback on how to improve myself they don’t have any. I even asked therapists to help me figure it out but they didn’t know how to..

I feel so stupid, I wish I would have known I was making such a big mistake. 


Update: after verifying my W4 today, I found my employer messed up and put tax contributions on hold, even though I filled out everything correctly. I should have known what to look for on my paystubs, but know now! I still owe a lot of money, but will meet with a tax expert this evening to see if I can owe a little less, or at least learn more about preventing these types of things in the future.

636,2,"Due to resent events, more and more animosity has been thrown at America. As an American, I agree with these people and I totally get the hate, but I've seen an upsetting amount of hate towards American people, including those who didn't vote for Trump, like me.

I know that reddit isn't the real world, but I want other viewpoints and the easiest way for me to hear from non-Americans is online, mostly reddit. I just feel like I need to do more than just disapproving of my government. I feel like I, as an American, need to do something to actively fix it. But the issue is that I'm just a kid, I'm 16, what am I supposed to do? Protest? I got school work to do. boycott American products? I try my best but its hard when you live in America, I don't know what to do other than voting (when I am of age) to make these people happy.

I've been taking short breaks from reddit now and then but the though of the posts that hate on Americans (including me) keep creeping into my head. I just want ore perspectives on this."

639,0,"**Hey KindVoice community,**

I’m working on a special project for a song I’m about to release, called ‘I Said’, and I’d love your help. 

The song is all about the power of reaching out when people need support, saying something. I’m hoping to share real stories from people all over the world about times when someone reached out to help them, or, even, when you wished that someone had. 

Whats something someone said to you that helped you? Or something you’d pass on to someone else? 

If you're comfortable with it, I’d love to hear it, and share your story. It doesn’t matter if it’s a big moment or something smaller. It can just be something someone said to you once. 

I know it’s not always easy to talk about these things, so please only share what you’re comfortable with. I hope that in the sharing of these stories both in Reddit and beyond, we can spread a little more kindness in the world! If you respond, but are not comfortable with me re-sharing your story - please say so in your comment. I want to make sure I respect your privacy here.

Thanks so much for reading and considering sharing. I can’t wait to hear your stories and connect with all of you.

Take care <3"
640,2,"So I grew up with my aunt until I was 5 and then my dad moved me in with him and his girlfriend at that time. I never knew my mom and never grew up with a mother figure that stuck around. Even worse my father used to hit me pretty bad. [that has since stopped] All my life I’ve been trying to be this manly man type figure. I play football, I do professional weightlifting, and track. But recently as of last year summer I’ve been embracing this more feminine side of me behind closed doors. I recently decided I was a femboy and I got the clothes and “other stuff” but I come to this confusion in my head of who I really am. On one hand I love doing sports and hanging out with my guy friends but on the other I’m a femboy and nobody knows about it but a couple of online friends. I don’t know who I want to be. And it feels like I have to pick a personality. My family would not be supportive at all. So I don’t know what to do anymore. Please help me understand what’s wrong with me. Why do I feel this way? Please dm me if you have any ideas"
641,1,"I'm having a moment here where I'm feeling really sad about the only relationship I've been in of any duration over the last 7 years (before that I'd been in an 8 year relationship, and prior to that, married). Anyway, this guy broke up with me a year ago and we stayed friends. I'd say real friends because we actually do things together and I can count on him to talk to etc. And we stopped hooking up some time ago, but largely because I thought it might be making it harder for me to let go of him. But the truth is, I haven't let go of my desire to be with him. I don't want to be just his friend. I want to be his partner.  He says that he just doesn't want a relationship with anyone and even though I've been trying to get interested in someone else and going on dates and getting myself out in the world to meet new people, I want him to want me. Anyway, I've listened to hours and hours of dating advice podcasts about getting over your ex and etc (Matt Hussey and so many others). I can't bring myself to block him and I've tried no contact, but after a few weeks, one of us reaches out and I want to talk to him anyway. I want him in my life, even as a friend... but I really want more. It sucks though. I start therapy tomorrow, so I hope that works out because I am going mad and I am so down and depressed about the whole thing at times.  Like now. "
642,1,"Hi. I’m a teenager, and I would really like to talk to someone that could give some advice or guidance. I’m having some problems, overall just in a bad place, and I don’t know what to do. I would appreciate if someone had the time to listen."
643,2,"I am writing this because I need another person's perspective. I don't have any close friends I can talk to, and I need to know if I'm blowing things out of proportion. 

So I am a 26 F who is naturally very shy and I have low self esteem. I have always lived with my parents. I am their only child. They've supported me in so many ways and I am grateful for them. Yet, I feel like their protectiveness has stunted me. 

About a month ago, they decided they needed to move out of the US because of the strict immigration crackdown. They are both legal, but ones status is a bit more nebulous and could have been targeted for deportation which we did not want. I thought this would be a good time to be independent. I didn't want to move to another country. I had a part-time job I loved, I worked as a substitute teacher on the side, and I had a good daily life. So I tried making my argument to stay. But they told me no and that even with those jobs I would be miserable, I would not be able to pay the bills, and my dad does not believe I can make it on my own. 

My desire to stay was treated as me being selfish, and that I needed to support them. They said they have never asked for anything so I needed to show my support and ""be tough."" This would be good for me, they said. I was afraid to push further because I don't have any friends who I could've stayed with, I don't have close family members I could reach out to, and if I had pushed & gotten kicked out I would not have been able to get an apartment on my own. So I left with them. So now I'm here in a new country I do not know or feel comfortable in. I dont feel unsafe. I have good days, but I don't see a future here for me. I want to go home. Even though I know the US is going on a downward spiral, I can't help but want to go back. But I can't. I don't have enough money to sustain myself, and I have no where to stay. Even now I can't get a traditional job here in this country because I have a tourist visa. 

I don't hate my parents. They've done a lot for me. They really have. I've been spoiled. But I feel like I can't grow when I'm with them. They want whats best for me. I know. It's just I go back & forth and I feel so lost. My goal is to try to be self sufficient with online gig jobs but it's starting from zero which really sucks. Should I be grateful? How do I get through this? "
644,1,"I have fallen for a guy. He treats me like shit. I initiate all conversations, because “he’s a listener and I am the good conversationalist”. In the beginning we would chat a lot. I found him really interesting and I liked him a lot. 
Now we chat or something, when he wants. I am just not important. If there’s something more interesting, he will just ghost me for hours or days. 
When I finally pick my dignity up, and step back - then he will suddenly miss me and initiate a lot. 
I don’t like such games. It makes me feel sick. 
And it’s just like that now. Him ignoring me, until I feel so bad, that I finally step back from him, and then him luring me back in. And I just can’t stop. 
And I feel so stupid, used and sick. I feel ugly. I feel it is my own fault. I hate myself and my life. I want him. Why do I want this person? He hurts me and have ruined me, and I want him? I can’t even say what it is I want anymore. I don’t see him as attractive as I did before, I don’t find him as interesting anymore, we live far apart, and I obviously don’t think he is this sweet and perfect person anymore either. Wtf is wrong with me? 
I don’t need advice to stop this vicious cycle - because nothing of it works. I am not strong enough. I just need a kind voice. Because I honestly don’t love anything anymore. I hate my life I used to love, I hate myself, I hate my family. I hate life so much. I hate that I am such a weak and stupid example of a woman. "

646,3,"I'm feeling really overwhelmed at university right now. I’m graduating this December (yay!), but it hasn't been an easy ride at all, and I think is just now everything is catching up with me.

There have been many ups: I finally switched my major to something I truly love, I've made wonderful friends who have been by my side since then, I've been with my boyfriend for two years (even though we had to go long-distance last month :( ), I’m a reporter for the campus student magazine, and I even broke a university record that hasn’t been touched since 2019!

But over the past three years, I’ve started to dislike this place physically. I feel uncomfortable walking around campus, and I get so anxious about running into people and professors because of past experiences with them. I’ll admit, I’ve been letting my fears take control. I’ve scheduled all my classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays to minimize my time on campus, but this decision has come at the cost of taking classes I’m not really passionate about, and I’m now regretting it now.

I’ve been stressing over an argument with someone, and I can't focus on assignments and papers at all. This week has been so tough

I know in a years time, it'll all be over. I’ll have my degree, and hopefully, I’ll be moved in with my boyfriend for my master’s (I applied to a couple of grad schools recently and am waiting to hear back). But for now, it's all too much. I just want a hug and that’s something I can’t even get"
647,1,"I'm really tired of struggling. I don't have anything to live for really. Shitty family that doesn't care about me and no friends, no relationships. Nearing 30. It's pretty much all the same. I spent my life trying to escape the fact I was never built for life. "

652,2,"I’ve been trying to make friends on Reddit, but it honestly feels impossible. Most interactions seem surface-level or transactional, and the only consistent responses I get are from guys who aren’t really interested in genuine conversation—they just want to se*t. I was really hoping to find meaningful connections, people I could share my thoughts with, but it’s been so frustrating.

I’ve made a few connections that felt real, and for a moment, I thought I had found like-minded people. But even they ended up ghosting after a couple of days, which honestly hurts. I don’t know if it’s just the nature of online friendships or if I’m doing something wrong, but it’s so discouraging.

What I really want is to find true friendships, especially with other women, where we can support and uplift each other. But it feels like no matter how much I try, people just lose interest or disappear. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you find real friendships online?""

I can't drive or go out on my own. And my sister and her boyfriend will give me concaquences for small things. I know they're trying to teach responsabillity, but the amount of threats and actions is just rediculous.

656,0,"Good evening,

Recently I'm in a place where I need to feel like I'm doing something constructive. I enjoy reading out loud, and would like to do so for someone suffering from anxiety, or insomnia, or someone who otherwise needs to listen to a voice on the other end. I've done this before to varying degrees of interest so if I don't get back to you immediately, please give me some time. 

My preferred medium is Discord or Telegram. 

Parents, I have been asked in the past, I will read to your children via a recording after recieving your preferred material, I scrutinize these requests carefully and strictly. I will not interract directly with anyone under the age of eighteen, no exceptions. 

If you are grieving,  I will read letters written from the deceased and will do my best to match tone and inflection based on your needs and direction.

I prefer not to read love letters, but I will if absolutely needed. 

I will read religious texts but if I am unfamiliar, I will need to spend some time preparing. 

I read and speak English fluently. I speak limited Spanish, but can read it well. 

I will not video call anyone under any circumstances, nor am I looking to converse much outside of reading. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, please get in touch with me if you feel you could benefit from a reading. Best wishes!

660,3,"I don’t need advice really this is just a rant cause no way am I telling anyone about this. I’ve been depressed for a minute now and my apartment got quite messy (as I’ve had no motivation, urgency, drive whatever you wanna call it, to clean) I got a notice on my apartment saying I need to clean my place by the 20th OR ELSE. There was some confusion about the date they’re going to inspect but the building manager was being an ass and very rude about it. It’s currently 4am and I’ve been in cognitive shut down for the past several hours not able to make myself move to clean. I have 4 hours to clean and make it look presentable because I have no idea when the guy is coming to check and I have a doctors appointment at 8:45 and another appointment 10-12 so I have to get it done before 8:45. I’m very stressed and anxious because I don’t know when he’s coming and I might be gone and I’m nervous he’s going to be checking drawers and going into my bedroom to check my closet or something. I just have this feeling of dread and I want to cry but my body won’t let me cause I’m overly stressed where I’ve shut down. 
My plan is to at least take some stuff and hide it in my car, take the garbage out, do my dishes (I have a  mini dishwasher) and clean my bathroom. 
Please be kind with your wording :) my mental health is bad and my stupid depression can be debilitating and that’s frustrating. I want to clean my place, I want to do something about it but I CAN’T and I don’t know why. I’m not lazy cause I can work hard and clean and I want to, but it feels like my brain logged off. I physically can’t get myself to get up and tidy up. 
If anyone has tips for dealing with a depression mess (for the future because by the time this gets replies, my apartment situation will probably/hopefully be dealt with already) I would greatly appreciate it!

EDIT: I haven’t slept in 28/29 hours and I cleaned from 4:30am-8am and GOT IT DONE! Ya’ll I even mopped the floor!😄 It looks so much better and I feel better having it done (other than needing to deal with my clothes in the closet now but that’s only ONE thing), other than waiting for him to show up cause I wasn’t given a specific time 🙄 "
661,2,"I’m exhausted. Every day, I wake up and go to the hospital. I’ve seen doctors from almost every department, and yet, every single one tells me it’s just anxiety. I panic over the smallest things—like a tiny scratch—convinced it will turn into something serious. No matter how irrational it seems, I can’t stop myself from rushing to the hospital. Today, the staff even laughed at me because I’m there so often. I felt like a clown.

Meanwhile, I see people my age enjoying life—riding bikes with their partners, hanging out with friends—while I waste my time and my parents’ money on hospital visits. My biggest fear right now? That my penis is permanently damaged due to extreme masturbation—10 to 20 times a day for the past 10 years. I’ve had erectile dysfunction since 2022, and I suspect I have Peyronie’s disease, even though multiple urologists ruled it out. They say my penis looks normal, but how can they be sure without proper tests like a Penile Doppler Test? I’ve also been experiencing extreme numbness and discoloration in one part of my penis, yet doctors keep saying it’s okay. Are they being dismissive just because they assume my anxiety is making me imagine things? Do they have some kind of preconceived notion or prejudice against me—that I’m just an anxious, paranoid person and not worth taking seriously?

But where did this anxiety even start? Is it genetic? My father was always an anxious person—stressing over things others wouldn’t. He used to hit me almost every day until the 9th or 10th grade. I couldn’t fight back. As I grew older, I became toxic too. I started taking out my anger on my mother. The cycle of abuse continued until one day, I cut off contact with my father. He stopped abusing me, but I couldn’t stop myself from physically harming my mother. It became a part of our daily lives, and I know that’s not normal.

The worst part? Outside my home, I’m a completely different person. I don’t bully anyone. I don’t get into fights. But the moment I step inside, I become someone else. I hate it.

Sometimes, I feel like ending my life. But I don’t want to die. I still believe I can turn things around. I just don’t know how. I want to be loved. I want to be a good person. I want to be happy.

The happiest time in my life? When I was dating my ex. That was the first time I truly fell in love. I’ve been in relationships before, but this was different. I felt so joyful, so alive. And strangely, that was the period when I masturbated the least. My lust disappeared. I respected her so much that I couldn’t even think of her sexually, especially in the beginning. It felt like divine love—love without lust. I was obsessed with her, ready to do anything for her. But in the end, she ruined me. She cheated on me too.

So, what is it? Can love heal me? Or is it something I have to fix on my own? Am I like this because I’ve spent years stuck inside my room with no social life? I didn’t go to a regular college. After high school, I just stayed at home. Could that be the reason my mental health is so bad? Would having more sexual experiences help?

I don’t know what to do. I believe in God. I pray all the time, asking for relief, for happiness, for peace. But I’m still suffering. I just want to sit by the beach, watch the sunset, feel the breeze, and relax. But my mind won’t let me.

Even as I write this, my anxiety is telling me something terrible is about to happen. That I’ll get diagnosed with some awful disease. That my worst fears will come true. And if that happens, what will I do? Cry? Give up? Live in misery forever?

I don’t know. But I do know I need to change. I need to save myself. I just don’t know where to start.

If you’ve read this far, thank you. Please, any advice or suggestions would mean a lot."

664,1,"I am M15. I feel lonely and misunderstood . I need somebody to share my feelings with, but sadly, there's no one... I am made fun of due to my height. Which is only 166 cm. My friends, don't talk to me properly. I feel very lonely. Some of my classmates even called me attention seeker for no apparent reason. And no one stood up for me. Not even that friend who I trusted the most and shared all my feelings with. They were making fun of me for no reason and when I replied, as admin, they always deleted my messages. Due to this, I crashed out in the group and started talking non-sense... Next day, everyone laughed at me. It hurt. It really hurt. That day i realized that I failed to make any friend. C'mon. Please understand. Please. There's no one to share with! 2 weeks ago, my dad came to home angry. He started beating my mom. And it wasn't unusual. He did that often. And that had a very bad impact on me. I had always felt a lack of love between my parents. After all, all I wanted were parents who loved each other... And a loving family. But that day, I lost my... I came in between and started fighting my dad. And kicked him even. Although it was unplanned and out of reflex. He also tried to undress me. But later I apologized to him and explained that I never did that intentionally. It was product of long-long pain I felt for so long. He said he would never ever forgive me for all that. Wow. Just wow. And what about the things he did to my mom. He called her ""sl\*t"" in front of his kids. Very good example he is setting. Nowadays, he's into Bhagavad Gita! And I? I am into loneliness. He never talks to me. Taunts me. And I came to realize that my goodness backfired on me only. I tried to help my mom, but that- fucked me up. He resumed talking to her after few days of fight. But he still ghosts me. Amazing! I am very thankful to him - for his genes. That made me a midget! He says he is earning for all of us and we owe him. Well, he never does understand that a loving family is way superior than a rich family!!! Only money, money, money!!! And I know, that I'm more previleged than 99% out there... And I also know that I'm more lonely and misunderstood than 99% kids out there. Irony.

1. First off. I can't easily ignore my dad. I still need him for my tuition fees, and career. So ignoring him will only make it worse. Right now, I feel so so sad that even though my intentions were good. THIS! happened.
2. My friends? Who wants to play with them? But the matter of the fact is, I am already overweight and they are the only ones in whole residence who will let me in. Otherwise, I will only gain weight. And tbh, they all play better than me. They only make me goal keeper and don't let me play at front... And tbh, I am a terrible goal keeper. Whenever I miss a goal, they think I do it intentionally just out of vindiction.
3. Height... Well some things are too easy to be said... Imagine. Just imagine. Literally everyone. Everyone more taller than me. It hurts my self image. I also am overweight. My friends constantly say that no girl shall like me. Even girls are taller than me...
4. After my board exams ended. My class teacher told me to enjoy the vacations and go somewhere! Haha! Good life... But seeing my dad's Bhagavad Gita antics, vacation seems impossible! 
5. And yes, there's no one. Literally no one. To share my sorrow with. Yes, no one."

668,2,"I met a girl recently, she is amazing but we’re long distance. I’m terrified of the idea of having sex with her though, because she doesn’t know what I did when I was younger. When I was 12-16, I did stuff that I majorly regret now. The one piece of comfort I have is that I was a kid and didn’t know how wrong it was at the time.

If she wouldn’t be intimate with me because of my past, and we did have sex, that would be rape by deception.

I’ve spoken to her about this, and she’s said she doesn’t care about who I used to be, but who I am now. I’ll be seeing a therapist soon and she supports that. But she also said something that makes me think she wouldn’t want to be with me if she knew.

I don’t feel comfortable disclosing my past to her though, ever, and you cant maintain a relationship without intimacy. I have no idea what to do. Am I cursed to be lonely forever?"
669,1,"CW: sexual harassment of a minor

Today I'm sitting on the toilet in the bathroom upstairs when my roommate begins to turn the knob. So ensues a frantic exchange of apologies between the two of us, during which she asks me why I hadn't locked the door. I begin my response in the middle of washing my hands: ""It's dangerous to go to the bathroom with the door locked."". The context for why I think that clicks into place as I say it. It breaks me a little bit, I start crying. Roommate asks me what's wrong from the other side of the door. I finish washing my hands and leave the bathroom, I hug her as tight as I can and I sob in her arms. ""My dad taught me that."" Inklings of memories I'd never thought about before start trickling in. Being confronted outside of the bathroom about ""what I was doing in there"", explicitly being asked by my dad if I was masturbating. He wanted control and authority in every place in every moment of my life. It's really shitty to realize, in real time, that something you took on its face was really a small piece of how you were controlled and restrained. I'm terrified of what else I might not remember."

672,2,"Hello community,

I have a [user](https://www.reddit.com/u/StructureHelpful248/s/e08GYrRQj4) on my small sub who has repeatedly made posts alluding to their intent to take their own life. I read every report, and I checked on the user- when I said I was a mod, they became dismissive and stopped responding, only to go back to their concerning posts less than an hour later. 

I’m not sure what to do. I only gleaned small bits of information about themselves and their background, and that’s nowhere near enough to send out the authorities for a welfare check. Any guidance would be appreciated, and I would be so grateful for insight. I’m deeply concerned even though I don’t know the OP personally. I messaged the mod team at r/suicidewatch for advice as well. "

674,1,"It's because most of the time, I actually do.

I'm Greek. Spent a lot of my childhood in Ireland and I came back here at 16. In Ireland, I made lots of good friends and got to go out a lot. When I came back home, I felt a disconnect and things got harder.

We still have conscription over here, and I was living abroad for long, but just about not long enough to have been classed as a permanent resident. I did my year in the military and I'm changed now. I was in a relationship and I'm not now. You can go ahead and tell me that if it didn't survive, we were never meant to be. Maybe you'd be right. What people don't understand is that I'm shy. It's not easy for me to ""put myself out there"". So it could very well be years before I meet someone again.

I encourage people to dodge the draft, to spare themselves something that I hated. I feel no shame in doing it. People try to guilt me over it. I tell them that Greece should have treated me better, if it wanted my loyalty. I type this on a laptop that was already old, by the time I moved back from Ireland.

That's the thing. I'm not good with computers. I could either reconfigure the keyboard to try and type in Greek with the Latin script, or type in English and then translate it. I'm aware the translations are, well... shit.

I don't know where to post about what happened to me. If I post in a Greek community, people get pissed. If i post elsewhere, people don't get it. How humiliated I felt, at the ceremony at the end of basic, having to salute people I have no respect for, in front of my parents. How, unlike work, you can't just go home at the end of the day and put it behind you. It damaged me, that. The prolonged nature of it. With no outlet and no privacy to vent.

Please... I just want someone to hear me. Anyone. People go through my post history and give me crap because this is all I talk about. It is all I talk about, lately. I'm not hiding anything. I feel like I'm getting impatient with living."
675,1,"I’m 25, never had a date or a girlfriend. My family used to ask, but now they don’t even bother. My grandma made a comment like, *""I'm surprised you can do anything by yourself,""* and it stung more than I expected.

I’ve always dreamed of having a family of my own. I feel like I have a lot of love to share, but this part of life feels impossible for me, and it’s breaking me down. My body is already failing, worked myself to collapse at a job, lost a tooth, and I know I look as exhausted and depressed as I feel. People pick up on that, and it pushes them away.

I barely talk, don’t know how to hold conversations past a few sentences, and haven’t made a new friend in over a decade. I’m poor, struggled with food, and don’t even know where I’ll be living in a month. My family and I aren’t close, and I used to fantasize about finding comfort in a relationship, but at this point, I feel like I’d just be a burden to anyone I let in.

I don’t know how to stop the self-pity when it feels like no one else cares. People talk about the shows they watch or the games they play, and I just can’t relate. I mostly experience games through YouTube videos. Getting another job feels impossible with my missing tooth and the way I come across. Even my doctor brushed me off when I tried asking for help with depression, and it's not like I can go back without insurance.

684,1,"So I just want to start off by stating that for 6 years, I was with my ex. We were both happy in beginning but I always noticed he was insecure. He once told me I was not allowed to hang out with friends of the opposite gender even if my females friends were present, said going out for drinks with ONLY female friends was single activities and basically cheating. So unfortunately after trying to break it off a few times and ending up back in the same situation cause he would constantly tell me he was going to change, I decided to do a stupid thing and begin talking to someone new while we were still together. Yes, I am aware that this is cheating and yes, I am aware that that makes me an awful person. I can say some dumb excuse like “he always accused me of cheating so I just decided to.” But I know that that’s wrong and that is no excuse for putting someone through that. I know I’m a bad person for what I did, I wish I could go back and slap myself for doing that instead of just leaving. I was living with him at the time and just felt trapped but I should have never allowed that to stop me. I wasn’t cheating the whole relationship, this is just a recent thing and ive only been talking to the person for a month and we have done nothing physical. Like I said, I know I’m a bad person and I hate myself for doing that to someone else. I’m not even really looking for advice, I just needed an outlet to rant and talk about how I feel cause this weight has just been weighing on me heavily and I know that is well deserved because I shouldn’t have done what I did. But I have no one to talk to this about and I just really needed to get it off my chest. I’m a horrible person"

So I had a nightmare a couple hours ago and my heart is still pounding. I went over and over my chat list and couldn’t find a single person to take this through with. 

I think the nightmare underlined some deep troubling problems in my relationship and I just need someone to talk with. 
"
686,1,I've screwed up. I feel numb to it. I feel frozen. Not mad at myself. Disappointed. Hopeless. Just. I don't know anymore. I'm going to get to work. I'm going to salvage what I can before tomorrows exam. I just. Don't know what I'm feeling right now. I've got to seek out help after this. I know I do. Just. Will I be okay? Can I come back from this???
687,0,It's not that they don't care or that I can't open up to them. They just never know what to say. I'd love to have a friend that could comfort and reassurme me sometimes.
688,1,"I don't know how to put this properly, I'm feeling like I'm everywhere. I'm sorry if post is messy. I'm writing this as I feel like dying. 
I feel extremely lonely. I'm an introvert person, and have almost no social interaction. I don't work at a office, I'm a one-to-one private tutor. I'm also writing my first book which is very important to me. I don't have much hope going in my life. The person I'm emotionally dependent on she keeps saying the worst things people have told me. I'm so lonely and without friends I have no place to cry about it or even vent. 
Can anyone please be my friend, to whom I can talk? I know people are busy and I'm just an online person posting stuffs, even people around me don't give me time. But still, if you can spare some time to be my friend I'd appreciate it.
Thank you, I hope you have a great weekend ahead."
689,1,"I’m a 27-year-old male seeking advice regarding my current relationship situation. My 24-year-old girlfriend and I have been dating for two months. Recently, she mentioned needing space, yet she still wants to spend time together, go out to eat, and watch movies.

This morning, she brought me breakfast, and I thanked her by saying, “You’re the best girlfriend ever.” She replied, “I’m not your girlfriend, but okay. I thought we were still working on it.” Caught off guard, I apologized, saying, “Sorry, I forgot.”

Her response left me emotionally overwhelmed. Instead of sending a long message, I wrote a journal entry to process my feelings. I’m considering sharing some of these thoughts with her to express how I truly feel about the situation. Below is the journal entry:

*Note: using fake name “Jessi” isn’t her real name*

March 14, Friday, 08:30

My heart feels shattered into a million pieces. It hurts to even breathe. When I read Jessi’s text on Snapchat, saying she isn’t my girlfriend, it crushed me like someone punched me in the heart and squeezed it until it died in their hands.

It’s honestly my fault. I guess, in my mind, I convinced myself that we had worked things out and were still together. I poured my heart out to her every day, telling her I loved her, and I was too blind to realize she wasn’t reciprocating the same feelings. It was all there in the texts—no “I love you,” no “handsome,” nothing similar to what I was pouring out to her.

Maybe it’s because I’m so in love that I couldn’t see the signs that she doesn’t love me anymore. Maybe she never did. I felt like she did. In my heart, her love felt so real, like nothing I had ever experienced before. In my heart, she never stopped being my girlfriend. It’s like I couldn’t face the fact that she didn’t want to be with me. And when she finally stated outright that she isn’t my girlfriend, I just stared at the message for what felt like hours, contemplating our entire relationship.

My heart shattered at that very moment. I realized I lost her. I lost My Love, Mi Amor. I lost.

I feel so embarrassed, so dumb. But above all, I feel lost—sadness, confusion, loneliness. I don’t know how many more heartbreaks I can take in this life. With every heartbreak, I feel like a piece of my heart dies.

And yet, I still feel like I have so much love to give. I hope to God I can find someone who will love me. I want to love someone. I want to share my feelings, my emotions, and my love with someone who will love me back.

I’m seeking advice on how to navigate this situation. Should I communicate these feelings to her? How can I cope with the emotional pain and confusion? Any insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for taking the time to read and respond."
690,1,"I had class yesterday, and my amygdala fired up when doing an exercise in class with ChatGPT. I was one of 2 out of 11 that  that AI Couldn’t find a reasonable solution to a  fiction problem we had to come up with. I realized lately that I’m not skilled like the rest of my classmates are. I’m only one of the two  who is unemployed  and I feel like I’m worthless. I can’t find joy in what I’m studying. My future looks grim, I feel like I’m not going to be able to achieve anything in life. "
691,1,"Feeling hurt and alone, I guess. I had friends over today and one of the told me she'll ""ghost guys then weeks later message them again for fun."" I don't question my relationship with her in the slightest but that comment really bothered me. I'm a guy that grew up sheltered and connections are difficult for me to make. I've been the one who's been toyed with when all I was trying to do was get to know someone. Behaviour like that just makes me distrustful of women and makes me not want to seek relationships... -sighs- "
692,3,"Here's my vent thanks for coming: 
Today I got feedback from work that I was too direct, when really what I was doing was setting up very very obvious line between what my job is and what somebody else's is. Did I spend two and a half hours making sure that it was kind consistent and considerate. Yes but, as a result my leadership's involved with their leadership to address the email. 

Today I got feedback from a guy that I am talking to that I wasn't being considerate of how that can make someone feel when I respond back ""I'll take that L"" after I laughed at his comment for me to send a sweat gym pic and he said ""well if you laugh at that request I won't be sending you any sweaty sexy gym pics of myself"". 

Today I got feedback from a friend that I invited to meet my other friends that he didn't feel comfortable to come to the outing because he's not social. After our conversation yesterday around him bringing his ex to both of our plans. 


I actually truly appreciate the feedback, and if it smells like shit I probably stepped in it, so I'll do my best to be more considerate about how others take feedback.  And how I present myself and my words.  You know I do my best to be a very considerate kind person. I'm extremely bubbly outgoing and do my darndest to include everyone. Why the fuck are people so quick to attack the other person, why are people so quick to assume the worst of everyone's intentions. WHY CANT SOMEONE JUST SAY ""HEY THIS TOPIC IS KINDA HARD FOR ME TO DISUCSS OR IT MAKES ME FEEL XYZ CAN YOU BE A LITTLE MORE CONSIDERATE OR UNDERSTANDING WHEN WE DO DISCUSS XYZ IN THE FUTURE?"" OR LIKE ""HEY IM KINDA TAKING YOUR WORDS AS THIS, WAS THAT WHAT YOU MEANT??""

But again, 3 forms of feedback from 3 different sources makes me realize I need to be more aware.  But another part of me is like damn...  "
693,1,"My girlfriend broke up with me a few months back after 2 years together. I was completely blindsided and, frankly, she did a lot of very unkind and immature things along the way.

I’ve been slowly getting over it and started dating again. I wasn’t attracted to anybody until I went on a date with this new girl and it was electric. Like nothing I had ever felt before. She was making all the moves so I figured she was into me. We went out again and it was the same. I blurted out that I wanted to see where this was headed and that, if she was interested maybe we could make it exclusive.

She said that it was just too quick and that it takes longer than that for her to trust someone, but that she also wanted to see where it was going. I really thought it was gonna be ok. She actually extended the date. She kept making moves. Afterwards, she texted me that she’d want to go out again sometime.

The other morning, she texted me that, after thinking about it some, she just thinks we want different things and that she doesn’t want to lead me on. I told her that I just got wrapped up in the moment and I really am ok with taking things slow and that I don’t have any expectations. Yesterday, she said that she just isn’t ready to move that fast with someone. I told her that I don’t even want to move that fast and it just slipped out. I haven’t heard back and I don’t know if I’m going to.

I know that it’s almost certainly over but it’s so hard to believe because she was so into me just the other day. I feel stupid for being so upset over something that lasted only a week but it really just felt like magic."

695,3,"About 2 weeks ago my cat Violet, died back home, while I am on a Holiday Work Visa. I feal like I didn't get a proper chance to morn, and than I hit a parked car. The damage was minor, but honestly the car rental company has been a pain to deal with. And I just started work about a week ago, and a glass panel exploded on me while cleaning an oven. Thankfully the cuts seems minor but it still is difficult to deal with. And that is along with having trouble finding permanent housing and long term stability 

I kind of have too much to deal with and either want genuine support or just to shut myself off to the rest of the world. I hate how everything seems more difficult to me, with likely ADHD and trauma making simple tasks more difficult than the average person. It feels liek too much for me to handle."

698,1,"Hey everyone, I don’t really know how to start, but I guess I just need to say I’m struggling a lot right now. I’m having a hard time with everything, and I just feel like I’m always messing things up. I don’t really have much to share about myself, but I like to draw and play video games, even though I feel like I’m terrible at both. I also like reading comics and mangas, and I watch cartoons and anime whenever I get the chance.

I’ve always had big dreams, like wanting to be an animator, writer, or storyboard artist, but I feel like I’m failing at every single one. I’ve been trying to improve my drawing skills, practicing anatomy and shading, but it feels like I’m not making any progress, no matter how hard I try. I also came up with a story idea, but I don’t think it’s good enough, and I’m terrified of continuing.

I guess I’ve always struggled with making friends too. I’ve tried reaching out to people before, but I always mess things up and end up pushing them away, or they just don’t stick around. I don’t really have anyone to talk to, and I’m feeling really lost right now. I just don’t know where to go from here, and I keep thinking about giving up.

If anyone’s willing to chat, I’d really appreciate it. I don’t need advice, just someone to listen."

I can’t stop crying. And I just really don’t want this feeling anymore. I’m not suicidal- I would never end myself. I would have, if no one would know. But people would know, and some people would be sad, and I don’t want that. 
I just really need this feeling to go away. It takes up so much space that I can’t eat and I can’t breathe. I have had this feeling taking up space for eating and breathing for about a year. 
But some month ago I startet talking to someone online and it was great. But I just don’t know what happened, I fell so bad for him. And it was not what was intended. We should only be friends. And it just made me feel so worse. Good at times. And really bad when he did not answer and so on. And he never signed up for this crazy. But that’s what I feel I am now. Crazy. And now we got in an argument and I don’t think I will ever hear from him again. And it just breaks my heart. And I don’t want to feel like this. I want to feel normal and think about all the people I have around me. Not a half stranger on the internet. But I can’t. I don’t know how. And I feel so stupid. Crying over someone I don’t even know. And I am supposed to be an adult. 
But this situation have made everything so much worse. I literally can’t do anything. And I need to snap out of it. Because I fear for my health if I don’t. And I don’t want to be like this anymore. 
Last week I went to ER because my body was not working properly due to malnutrition, I have eaten better since. But everything is falling apart for me right now. 
I need advice to forget about this person. About the feelings. Advice how to cherish the things I have. To see the wonderful beauty im nature and life again. 
Please. Anyone. I’ll do whatever it takes not to feel like this anymore. "

707,3,"Hello everyone,

I’m reaching out because I’m feeling really conflicted about my journey as an aspiring animator, cartoonist, writer, storyboard artist, producer, and director. I’ve had this idea for a story called ""The Reluctant Zontane"", which revolves around mythical creatures who can transform into inanimate objects. The protagonist is a zontane born among humans who wants to stop the war between humans and her kind.

It’s something I’m really passionate about, but I’ve hit a wall. Despite working on it for a while, my drawings either get zero feedback or mostly negative criticism. The more I create, the more I feel like I’m just not improving, and it’s discouraging. People around me often tell me to quit, saying it’s not worth the time and effort because I’m ""terrible"" at it.

I’m really passionate about the story and the vision, but I’m stuck between wanting to keep going and feeling like I’m wasting my time. Does anyone have any advice on how to push through this feeling of doubt and negativity? Should I continue pursuing animation and storytelling, or is it time to consider other options?

I’d appreciate any insight or suggestions from anyone who’s been through something similar. Thank you in advance!"
708,1,"I've definitely been on the up lately but at the same time, I can feel myself kinda burning out even though I don't do much throughout the day.

709,1,"TRIGGER WARNING: suicide

My dad committed suicide on the 23rd december 2024. I have a 9 year old and a nearly 2 year old. I'm not gonna lie, I'm struggling. I'm fine when I'm busy, but as soon as I have a moment to myself, I can't stop thinking about it and about him. It's making me a bad parent. 

My partner is very practically supportive, but emotionally he's tuned out. 2 years ago his dad also committed suicide so this whole situation has been triggering for him too. 

I feel like I talk about it too much and I can't talk about it anymore to the people around me. Its like the funeral has happened and now people expect me to move on, but i can't. I have very supportive friends and family but I feel utterly alone with this, especially as I was his only daughter. I don't want to talk about it with them anymore. 

I'm not trying to get a therapist or anything like that. I just want someone I can throw my feelings at with no judgement. If I can be the same for you, I'm all for that.

710,3,I feel sad. 😞 I could use someone and feeling overwhelmed. 
711,1,"Just wanted to post here hoping I can get some words of encouragement from somebody else. Left a well paying job where I was the top of my game. Had status and felt important but I got burned out and started slowing down. Went through a lot on top of it and it's what led me to get separated. I'm working two jobs now that are minimum wage food jobs. Trying to go back to school to. Things are piling up but I'm trying my best to work hard and stay afloat. I can't help but feel like a loser. I feel like a shell of my former self. I miss being the person everyone looked up to. Yes, there was a lot of pressure but I sometimes wish I could go back to those days. I don't know. I feel like a disappointment. I just really need someone to tell me I'm not pathetic and some kind of low life. "

I’d love any feedback or suggestions that might help me make progress!"
713,2,"It's 8am as I'm posting this and I didn't sleep at all, my head was too loud. I feel so alone in my anxiety because everyone around me doesn't seem to know how to deal with me, when in previous moments I could count on them a little more. Even worse, I think I probably developed the ""d-word"", which I can't even say cause it terrifies me. 

My relative told me I should take meds, but I'm also terrified of the side effects since I have crippling health anxiety. 

I'm so scared I'll end up reaching a dark spiral I can't get out of. I just want someone to tell me I'm okay, that I'll be okay. That this is temporary and I'll be fine. It's so hard to think logically like this, feels like you're drowning and no one's freaking keeping you afloat. 

I know my worth (even if I'm hard on myself sometimes), I know I'm loved and I don't want to do anything weird to myself or questionable, but I'm scared my possible ""d-word"" will make me think things. I'm already feeling hopelessness from the fear of it, like I'll feel this way forever and I'm just screwed, even if my feet are firmly planted and logically speaking, I know it won't be forever. Logically speaking, I know this isn't something damning but it sure feels like it. I know it's a ""trick"" of sorts that the mind comes up with, but feeling low and heavy often doesn't help with not buying into the spiral. 

On top of all this, the fact that I didn't sleep also makes me anxious, like I'm going to wither away physically and mentally with all this. It's exhausting.

I just need someone clearheaded to tell me I'm all right. I know reassurance isn't the best thing for anxiety but I'm desperate. "
714,0,"Hi there. I (35F) guess I just need to vent? I'm not really sure what I'm looking for. Perhaps to write this out so it makes sense in my own mind and for people to tell me I'm not crazy or to hear others experiences.

I've lost one person in my life that was very important to me (my grandma). Not long after she passed, in 2018, I developed an interest in Buddhism. I'd always been interested in meditation and this is where my curiosity was hooked. My journey led me on the path to learning about Dharma, Samsara, reincarnation, karma, the Four-Noble Truths and the Eight-fold Path. Although I learned these things, I never considerd myself a buddhist or particularly religious. I was an atheist. I did not believe in a higher power, fate or much else. The teachings of the suttas of the Buddha were more lifestyle choices. 

Now my Grandad has months to live and I recently went to see him to say goodbye. The visit and conversations were cathartic but hard. When I said goodbye (as I was physically leaving and my visit was over), he said ""I don't think we'll see each other again"". In that very moment, I said and fully believed ""Oh, I think we will"".  
  
My grandad does not live close and as he is rapidly going downhill, I don't think I will physically see him again. However, in that moment when I said I thought we would see each other again, despite knowing the most likely truth that we would not, I fully believed I would see him again. It felt stronger than belief. It felt more like I knew I would see him again. Despite my belief in reincarnation, this strong belief that I hold - that I will see my grandad again - does not match up with the my personal understanding of reincarnation, which is that I will never see him as he is and he will never see me as me, again. 

I have never expereienced anything like this before. Where my mind almost can't quite accept reality? (the reality being that I most likely won't see him again and my mind truly, fully believing that I would). It's very hard to explain and quite confusing.  
  
The potentially troubling bit is that this visit happened to coincide with my other grandma (by marriage) giving me a Ganesh idol as a gift for my new house. As I say, I'm not religious, and I do not believe in a higher power but something has now made me believe in this idol. And I don't even know what that means! I don't believe that somewhere out there, there's an elephant-headed man whose stomach once burst open from eating too much candy, controlling my daily life. But somehow, I feel the need to perform little daily offerings and fully believe this is helpful. I've since fallen quite hard into Sanatana Dharma (or Hinduism). I don't really know what's going on.   
  
I'm british. I am/was an aethiest and now I have no idea what I believe. I guess grief is the root cause but I'm just very confused and I'm not sure I recognise myself anymore. Kind words appreciated."
715,1,"Hey everyone,

I’m struggling right now, and I could really use someone to talk to. I can’t share too much about myself or where I’m from, but I’ve been feeling a bit alone and just wanted to reach out.

I have other references I think will pull through but it sucks. This job would’ve put me on the map for my career. They spent 4 hours in an interview with me and immediately reposted the job this morning after telling me so it wasn’t because they found someone else or weren’t impressed with me.

717,1,"Lately I have had more tests and projects in school, and i feel like the bond between my friend and I is getting worse. We were close since 7 grade in primary school, if we did something we always did it together, and every time we come back from school we played for hours on computers. But since 2 year in high school I feel like we distance ourselves from each other. Of course i have my own activities after school like getting science lessons, german lessons or kickboxing. But after that I always have a bit of free time to spend however i want, and because I have nothing else to do, i like playing video games and always try to ask him to play with me, but lately he is just avoiding it saying that we have nothing to play and even if we play it will be boring. I never was the part type person so I dont have many friends and people to spend time with.  Now I see that most of times we played together was when i asked him to play and not the other way around. I know i am boring person but after whole day of learning and trying my best in school hearing from your friend that the only think you want to do have no sense, is just sad. Idk what to do, and I dont want to lose friend, but i also dont want to just sit and exist in that little free time.
So I am asking for advice to what can i do to again be close with him, or maybe a way to spend that precious free time the best i can do.

Ps. Sorry for my English, its my second language and i dont speak fluent yet."
718,3,"So I have liked this guy for about 3 years on and off. He acts like he does not return my feelings/nonchalant to me, but he watches me when I’m not looking, always tries to impress me, listens to my conversations and then brings up stuff I say later, gets jealous when I talk about any other guy (even celebrities), and agrees with everything I say (like if someone asks what my favorite rom com is in a conversation, and I say “the Notebook”, and then someone asks him, he will say the same thing). So, I have been confused about his feelings towards me for a while.

Recently, I have learned that he not only knows about my feelings, but he brags to everyone that a “girl like me” likes him because he feels it makes him seem “wanted and desirable” and boosts his status among other guys at school. I knew he found me attractive, but I don’t know know why he is bragging like he won the lottery that I like him only to not date me, especially because he hasn’t dated anyone else in the time I’ve known him. It gets stranger because I was also informed that he prevents other guys from pursuing me romantically. One time, I was informed that he was glaring at one of my guy friends for 30 minutes while we were talking and it made my friend uncomfortable, but I didn’t realize that he was actively preventing people from asking me out.

I’m just so confused. I’ve had a really hard time dating, so I’ve continued to like this guy. But, he also may be the reason I’ve had a hard time dating. Ive spent all of this time working on myself, wondering what I’m doing wrong, and it may just be him running interference behind my back. Still, I don’t know why you wouldn’t want to be with me but also want to prevent others from being with me. I still like him, I thought he might like me, but obviously he’s just using my feelings for clout I guess. It feels like no guy is ever going to take the time to actually care about me on a deeper level at all. I know I’m young, but I see all of my friends in relationships and I feel so behind because I’ve never even had a boyfriend. I don’t understand why I am worth bragging about but not worth dating. 

This is just the dating end of my problems. I’m overwhelmed in life right now; I’m very behind on my thesis and don’t know where to even start, I’m behind on post grad applications and probably taking a gap year, which wasn’t my plan. My anxiety got out of control, but I’m managing that better now, even though I still have episodes. I’m an athlete, and I’m not doing super well in my sport after coming back from injury. 

I just feel like, on the outside, I look like this athletic, smart girl who has it all together, but really, I’m an anxious mess about one second away from crashing out. I feel bad, because really my problems aren’t terrible compared to others, but they’re affecting me and I don’t know where to go to vent it all out. I just could really use a kind voice, whether it’s about relationships/managing school/life advice, anything."
719,1,"After every breakup and ended friendship that I've been through I am always the one that gets depressed and feels so horrible mentally over it all.
Sometimes I know how the other person feels afterward and sometimes I just assume I know how they feel, and It's almost always that they did nothing wrong, they hate me or that they just don't care. Never that they feel bad or gets extremely depressed over it like I always do. 

A month ago me and my friend (and ex) since years back broke contact for alot of reasons I dont feel like sharing here. Now I am very depressed and just feel like shit over it all, all the time. While I feel like she doesn't feel bad at all, or at least doesn't care about it. If that is the case then it pisses me off so much that I, or the whole situation, was so unimportant to her that she just doesn't care or thinks she did nothing wrong. I also hate that I think this way because I'm just assuming what past friends and exes think about me.
Does any of this make sense? Is it normal to assume these things or am I delusional"

722,2,"sorry if political posts aren't welcomed in this sub, i guess i just need some reassurance that things aren't going to get so bad we'll have to enter a WW3. also i'm on lexapro & adderall & scared that those are going to be banned as well. "
723,1,"I’m an outcast, ostracized from society, shun by most people.

When I was two years old, a girl poked my eyes at the nursery.  I stopped going there only after two weeks bc of this. 

When I went from toddler through tween  , people always wanted to make me cry bc I was too sensitive, and still are.  They faked to punch my face so I was scared, made annoying buzz sounds around my ears . When I tried to be friendly to people, everyone disregarded my approach.  They said I was going to die because they could see the wax from my ears (it wasn’t wax but dead skin ). They always made fun of me, if I farted, if my pants slightly fell. They talked with their friends behind my back  laughing how I was so bad at tennis. They  always get mad at me because I sucked at football, always picking me last when doing teams.
They had a talk with me at 12 saying me and a couple of kids were  very different from the rest . Before beginning high school, they talked about me as a non-existing entity, bc in a class this guy only knew three guys, not counting me . 

In high school, I stopped crying but the bullying didn’t stop.  They called me retarded , having Down syndrome, calling my mother a whore. They called me white Mexican , (as an insult , as I wasn’t Mexican). We recorded a video for a group project and then everyone had it bc I was cringey in it . They always recorded me as a way to laugh at me , and they took captures of all the pictures I uploaded on my social media. No one wanted to be with me in school trips, and they pressured me into dancing in parties so they would laugh at me, not with me as I first thought  ( then I realized this, but I kept doing it bc I wanted to be accepted ). They usually  jumped above the toilet doors , wanting to see me  while peeing or taking a dump. A girl  took pictures of me without my consent through Snapchat to laugh at me, no one I was friendly to wanted to be friends to me except 5 people , most people were rather annoyed as  I was repetitive and sometimes asked the same questions instead of new ones. 

In uni, things have changed but I still feel alone. I made a group of friends but some dropped out and with others things got awkward so I made a new group .

Some people started taking distance from me , and then one day  when I asked if we were going to see each other on campus, they laughed at me sending stickers to avoid answering me . 
The next day they started to indirectly attack me. They said  they treated me badly because I had hurt their feelings lots of times  for stuff that had  happened months  or years ago (and  for stuff I either apologized or  they had never addressed it when they should had). they admitted I had a good heart, and never recognized their own wrong-doings and tried to justify it instead of saying sorry . I ended up apologizing, but the worst part was that they were fighting  me like kids on a group chat with people uninvolved in our issues. 

 When I speak up in uni, people laugh at me. They don’t take me seriously 

People never seem to be supportive, and I have to admit I’m not very supportive either. I have made some personality tests and posted on another sub so you can see who I am. 



TLDR powered by DeepSeek:

I have faced bullying and ostracization throughout my life, starting from childhood. I was targeted for being sensitive, excluded, and mocked for my  appearance, abilities, and social awkwardness. Despite attempts to connect with others, I was often rejected, ridiculed, or ignored. In high school, the bullying escalated with cruel insults, public humiliation, and invasions of privacy. In university, I found some friends but still struggle with loneliness and being taken seriously. Recent conflicts with friends have left me feeling unsupported and misunderstood. I acknowledge my own shortcomings in being supportive but  I feel consistently let down by others.

726,1,"Posted this in askreddit too but thought it would be more fitting here perhaps.

A month ago me and my friend of 6 years broke contact after some nightmarish months. I'm too lazy to write down the full story and out of respect for her i dont really want to.

We got into a one sided relationship at the end of summer 2024 (i loved her, she didnt), broke up, tried to stay as friends but it just got more and more problematic, and we treated each other like shit all the time and just made each other depressed etc, even though we, or at least i, never wanted to. 
So in the beginning of february we got into a argument kinda and then just broke contact, it feels good cause i know its over but im so very sad that it is over because i dont have many friends and dont really know how to make new friends, and she was a close friend that i've known for a long time, and it never even had to get so bad.
Now i just feel empty all the time and i just cant stop thinking about her, its been a month soon and it just gets harder and harder and i feel more lonely and depressed than ever, even though i take my antidepressants and try to do stuff that makes me happy. I am having suicidal thoughts everyday because i just want to stop thinking about it.

Im sorry if this text was hard to read, i cant really think straight anymore. I hope any of you wise people can give me some hope and tips on what to do or think."
727,3,"
Just got done with an internship and I’ve been reflecting on how the traumatizing the first four months were and it’s made me reflect on things- I got bullied by a co-worker…. I retaliated (my fault) and my boss wasn’t the nicest to me about it. I was told things like “what’s the point of your existence” was called a “dumb f*ck” and it also got to a point where my cousins were made fun of too and then some… As to which I turned around and called my bully a “b*tch”,,, I was later advised by my boss that I was being disrespectful. My fault, I should’ve taken it to HR and gave my resignation if it bothered me so much but I didn’t do it that way. When I did explain why I retaliated - my boss did tell the bully to stop, but for a month I could notice the difference in body language. My boss didn’t handle it well and he started to distance himself from me while talking and engaging with the bully more. 

The bullying did take a toll on me and made me doubt myself more. The weight of it became hard to deal with and I couldn’t really do my work without those words playing at the back of my head. After all, what was the point in going above and beyond, or the point of anything- if a month into your job, they saw you as a dumb fuck and started making comments like “what’s the point of your existence”…. I’ve come to realize from this experience that people who have high self esteem and are mentally healthy would play along with these comments and brush it off easily,,, but I couldn’t…

My past has made me sensitive to my surroundings and people. I retaliate when anyone says anything negative to me because it reminds of when I didn’t stand up for myself in school and it only made me angry and frustrated with myself even more. I’m in bed right now crying about how this internship turned out for me. It was in one of the best workplaces people would dream of being in and this is how it turned out for me. My boss and I had such a good relationship starting off and it slipped away after this. All it took was my reaction…. and i lost it all. The day I left - the team did give me a gift and all, but you could tell… you could tell by their body language that they don’t care… that they were relieved to see me go, and that my boss wouldn’t care about me going forward. 

I wish someone would hug me right now and tell me it would be okay, but i can’t help but blame myself. It’s my fault i’m the bad person here and I deserved to not get any opportunities from this internship. I wish i could go back in time and resign so i could save myself from the hurt at least… Faster the better. I believe i’m not made for better things. It’s always been that way. I hate that I’ve had to experience for most of my life, and I hate how this is how my life has turned out. Can’t even have a good connection with anyone for the life of me. "
728,2,"I was born with Sypto Optic Displaysia which damaged one of the nerves in one of my eyes, making me half blind. I can only see out of one eye, and I am nearsighted on that eye.

729,1,"There is a long story involved that got me to where I am today. The short version is, I finally got my chance with a woman I love completely 5 years ago, we ended up buying a house together and in the process I fell into a deep depression. I ended up breaking up with her because in my depression I found solace in video games and ultimately I wanted someone to escape the real world with and be with me there. It was an amicable breakup but still very emotional and painful. We have been best friends for almost two decades. She continued to live here for a number of more months before finally leaving last October. After she left I fell even further into a depression and loneliness. At the end of January we had a moment where she told me we weren’t best friend anymore and I cracked and completely fell apart. I looked in the mirror and realized all the damage I was causing because of what I was doing and decided to turn it around. 

Fast forward, I have gotten out of that depression, and worked on a number of things, and realized I made an absolutely massive mistake. Unfortunately she has moved on to dating someone else, and through some conversations with a mutual friend, they told me an observation they had of me. During the relationship, there was a moment where we got really close, and then for some reason I pulled away, and if I was ever going to be able to have a real relationship whether it be with her or anyone else I would have to figure that out. 

I ended up talking to some family members, and a close one commented on the fact that I was pulling away because of lack of commitment, she said that ever since she met me when I was little and as I grew up, I’ve always been incredibly loyal, so the more likely reason is that I pulled away because I didn’t feel worthy.

When I was young (elementary school) my mom was dating my step dad, and she worked a lot so I was left with him and my little brother. He would regularly berate me, scream in my face, slam me against walls and throw me down hallways because I wouldn’t get chores done in time, or in the order he wanted them done in. I never told my mom until I had left home, and my grandma padded away when I was 17, and she came to me asking what I would think of her marrying him and if I would approve. I told her everything he put me through, and I didn’t want her to do it. She did anyways a number of years later, but we never spoke of it again. 

So I’m stuck in this house that I bought with my ex, and every day it’s like a prison. I’m drowning in the emotions, and regret of the decisions I’ve made, I desperately want to figure out how to break the pattern of pulling away because I truly feel like she is my person, my soulmate. I’ve decided to sell the house, for a number of different reasons, and move back to where we used to live on the other side of the state. I still speak to her on occasion but she’s asked me for space, and I don’t have many people in my life besides her and a couple close friends I can lean on, because really none of my family can handle deep emotional issues, I regularly just get blank stares. 

I feel like I’m on the border of panic attacks being in this house, the feeling of regret and anger towards myself for not addressing this trauma years ago, and a multitude of other feelings and emotions that are all overwhelming. "

731,1,"So this is what it's like to not have a best friend?

I am so grateful because I have so many friends. I love them all so dearly too. But I don't have a best friend and I don't think they'd consider me theirs. 

I want to have that connection again. I want to be able to talk to someone all day everyday. Hangout all the time. A friend who I can talk to about my relationship when I need to.

I get so jealous of my boyfriend because hes constantly texting his best friends and he sees them every weekend. But I never hang out with my friends and I don't have a deep emotional connection with any of them. 

It hurts and I feel lonely, even though technically I have plenty of friends and when I see them we have a blast. But that's what makes it worse because now I feel like an ungrateful bitch for not appreciating my friends. "
732,1,"Is there anyone who would be willing to talk with me? I'm afraid that things are now even worse than when I first posted this below; my sorrow is almost beyond measure. My original post from last week is below...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I (51M) have arrived at a place I never thought I'd come to, where all the dissatisfactions of life now crowd around me. I haven't anyone to confide in, so I'm throwing this electronic airplane out into the void:

I've always been a lonely man; even as a child I found it difficult to find other people to relate to. I've spent most of my life reading/writing (and later became a translator). Books, ideas, and creative energy have been the forces that kept me alive and enjoying life. However, it's rare to find other people I feel I can have a meaningful conversation with. I've never looked down on other people if they weren't avid readers (I detest intellectual and academic snobbery), but so much of my world has revolved around the pursuit of meaning or making something out of whatever life gave me. I've made a few deep friendships in my life, but they are few and far between. Even worse, since the pandemic, most of the friends I have in my area have moved away. I've felt more and more isolated as the past few years have gone by.

Romantic relationships have been even fewer and farther between. Sometimes other people have found me in some way interesting enough to demonstrate some degree of attraction but it has rarely moved beyond that. Sometimes I did strike up a brief connection to someone else, but those experiences frequently ended in my disappointment, rejection, or worse. The last time I was in a genuinely fulfilling relationship was about 15 years ago. I have lived with a mostly Platonic partner for several years now, which has kept me from feeling wholly alone, but our relationship lacks the fiery intimacy that I haven't felt from anyone in years. I was never a very handsome guy (average in about all ways possible), and before I met my current partner, I felt an immense emptiness that nothing would remove. I spent a few years in therapy, which helped me find a lot of clarity about my sorrow, but I've never been able to leave behind the feeling of unending loneliness I've had almost all of my life. I went no-contact with my parents and most of my extended family about twenty years ago, due to a lifetime of pervasive and persistent emotional abuse. That decision was terrible to contemplate, but doing that saved my life, as I couldn't stand even to engage through email with people who had been so uncomprehending of what I needed as a child and then an adult.

Now I've arrived at an even greater emptiness. My partner left for some part-time work a week ago, and has postponed the return to some indefinite future date. I strongly suspect that the relationship won't continue afterwards, and I'll again be without family, friends, or even someone to spend time with. I've tried to examine my life and my person from all possible angles, using as much objectivity as I've been able to muster. I'm not a bad person, I'm not unkind or unpleasant, I'm not boring or dependent on others, having learned to live for myself a long time ago. The few people who really know me have told me that I'm calm, compassionate, generous, at times full of laughter, and at others, able to use words to help other people make sense of themselves. I no longer know how to find others who might be able see some common ground within me. My consolations are the books I read and the lovely animals I live with. Everything else lacks any meaning in world right now: in short, I feel pathetic.

Sometimes all I want is to sit with someone and talk about what I feel inside myself. I don't want to burden anyone with my sorrow, and I know enough about my own consciousness to know that more therapy isn't going to resolve my unhappiness. Just a slow, gradual dissolution has started inside myself. I'm pragmatic, so I've not given up on life at all. I'm just aware of how much I've lacked the love and attention of others and I have no idea how to restore myself to some kind of balance with the emptiness I have felt.

No one in my daily life knows how empty I feel or how lonely I've been. \[Any replies gratefully welcome.\]"
733,0,"Hey, as the title says, I'm looking for someone to talk to, just about any interests, day to day life, and so on. I specifically want to talk instead of texting. I'm 25M, a good listener.

735,1,"My father abused, battered and hit me all till I turned 21. Which is when I left his house. He did the same to my mother. I see videos of my mother and I when I was younger, and the contrast between her and now, she’s not the same. She doesn’t have hope. My mother was 23 when she had me. 

I may not be someone that has been through the worst things in life but what I can tell you is, With what I’ve been through, me personally, I’ve struggled to stay steady through it all. 

I don’t know what I’m fighting for. I’ve asked myself this question many times. But then I really looked at myself today after a long term friendship betrayal that made me really question, what am I really fighting for. I’ve used the friends I’ve made to keep me going through all my father’s abuse, my teachers bullying and so much more I can’t even say on here. My father has interrogated me, recorded me while beating me and threatened to release the video in school. I lived in a third world country so noone would’ve questioned his actions. My father has smashed my head against the wall and caused my gums to bleed on multiple occasions. And all I get… is disappointment. And disappoint. I know it sounds like I’m the victim and whatever but do what you must with this information. I’ve gotten a lot of “you’re overreacting” from people and to be honest, it’s whatever.


I genuinely feel my enthusiasm is bait for people that have no hope in this world. I let them in because I want to be hope for people. Hope I wish I had when I was a child. People are aware of my story. Friends. And then decide to take more from me. When I barely have anything left. 

I’ve longed for someone that has been through 10% of what I’ve been through. A friend, an acquaintance, a stranger. But in my world view, it’s almost like. Everyone is the same. And I’m just waiting on when I have nothing left. 

 I’ve never been more at peace with death.
The fear of death vanished a few days ago. And no, I’m not going to do anything to myself. I just think the idea of life is exhausting. 

 I can’t believe I’ve turned into a pessimist now."
736,2,"I'm 20 year old trans boy. This is a vent about my dysfunctional family and dad’s passing, which happened 4 months ago.

I have experienced many types of abuse from my family, which includes sexual abuse from parents, cyberstalking from sister, harassment, gaslighting, victim intimidation, scapegoating and transphobia from all of them. 

Since dad passed, I’ve been thinking about times when he showed love and when he abused me. I found one recording from few recordings recently of parents verbally abusing and blaming me again for what their actions caused (I ran away with police a year ago because of abuse) and dad sounds disgusting. He says ''You never listen when others talk to you. You’ll change clothes too, you’ll change your walk too and you’ll look like human, it won’t work any other way''. These words still haunt me. 

Relatives and people outside of family who were told that I called the police believe lies about me. A week ago, on my birthday, some of people on FB wished me to make mom and other people I love happy, said that that dad prays for me in afterlife and I should be strong, brave and smart how he wanted. 

While I know they mean well these messages only cause me to feel more isolated. My dad wasn’t as perfect as they think, and my family is extremely dysfunctional. He did many kindness to others but I was treated poorly. He would spend time with me watching TV, teaching me backgammon, playing cards and fishing but he was abuser and him not being against abuse from mom and sister is also abuse. 

On the day he passed I posted our 2 photos on FB and made one of them background. I question how it's perceived.

On the day he passed away, mom told me that he was very worried about me. Few days later, she told me that dad lost half of his life that day I called police, that he was embarrassed about my unshaven legs and he said that worrying about me would end his life. This manipulation makes me question how he interacted with my mom, sister, and others when I wasn’t around. 

Sometimes I wonder what would happen if he was still alive. My mom and especially sister constantly created drama and I know my dad would never admit the abuse I suffered. Based on many things, I feel like he saw extension of himself in my sister how it commonly happens in narcissistic families. 

In his final days he got home at night when I was going to sleep and my sister was arguing like always and he told me that I'm not like my screaming sister. This gives me hope he realized I wasn't the problem but I can't understand his actions. At first, I was focused on the good times we spend together, but as time has passed, I’ve started feeling more anger towards him and whole family. It’s frustrating how my family is messed up."
737,2,I had a bad breakup last year and I've spent the last year working really hard to build myself up. A friend of mine invited me to a holiday that I was really looking forward to. Today he revealed to me that my ex is also coming along. I told him as nicely as a I could that I don't feel comfortable coming when she's there but we can hang out at another time. For some reason though this has got me on the verge of breakdown and I don't know why. I just would really like someone to talk to just work through my thoughts

So, I've made a pretty huge MISTAKE the other day and fessed up to it but he wasn't happy obviously. It's not unfixable but it's a work thing I should've done and forgot to. I called him to apologise. 

Anyway, I'm scared I broke his trust in my abilities with the recent mistake I've made, scared he'll remove me from future projects or doubt my work.

On top of that, my engagement, which started in 2020, recently came to an end in 2025. I never thought she would leave me, but the injury took a toll on our relationship, and it’s been incredibly hard for me emotionally. I feel like I’m navigating through a lot right now.

I’m reaching out because I’m looking for someone to talk to who can relate to what I’m feeling. If anyone has experienced something similar or just wants to chat, I would really appreciate your support. Thank you for listening."""
745,1,"Many nights recently I struggle lying in bed, feeling super alone I kinda wondered why when I do go out to interact with people in situations I enjoy / events I'm into but I am not really connecting with people. My friends and I had a falling out earlier this week, not really a falling out but I think one friend kinda jumped the gun and got a bit flippant when my other friend and I were just trying to make a plan that would accomedate her because she was going through a lot. I only feel super sad about it cause I've had friendships crash and burn over the course of one year or more, while they flipped between being my friend or not and ultimately dropping out in a blase of metaphoric shit.

So my friend just kinda suddenly being flippant and directing it at me particularly really hurt. 

I know she is going through a lot but she said she was feeling ok and was down to hang out a bit that night but then just , it just suddenly became like I wasmaking things difficult, even though I kept trying to adjust the plan to fit her needs etc. 



I kinda want to talk to her maybe tomorrow or the next day, but I'm worried she'll think she didn't say anything wrong / wasnt mad and I'm overreacting and I will jsut exhaust her even more. Too used to people becoming quickly just, clammy when I unintentionally make them upset, and even after giving space, they just, ultimately closed up. This hasnt happened in a while but IDK. Tryiung not to say too much but damn man I just feel alone."
746,3,"Hi everyone. This is very out of my comfort zone but I truly have no one to talk to and can't afford therapy right now either.

I feel like I am breaking down. It's like I am being hit over the head with a sledgehammer and the cracks are running through me from my skull down to the soles of my feet. Some days the feeling is so intense I don't know how to lift my head any longer. 

I am a caregiver to my sister, and my parents. I am constantly on hand to deal with them physically and emotionally, the latter of which is truly taking a massive mental toll. I take care of everything to do with the household, both inside and out. All of my time (outside of my job) is taken up with taking care of them or running errands. The only time I get to myself is driving to and from the supermarket. I am also working basically 3 jobs to better my career prospects which leaves even less time for myself. My family, my cousins, who I have loved and made excuses for my entire life, have basically shown they don't give a fuck and would rather get on with their own lives than check to see if I'm dead or alive. I don't go anywhere or do anything because I have people who rely on me and feel extremely guilty doing anything as little as venturing into town for a few hours to browse a bookstore or have a coffee. Meanwhile my peers are getting into relationships, getting married, travelling the world and living their twenties to the fullest... I know comparison is the thief of joy and social media is only shows one side of a person's life, but the side I'm seeing is way fucking better than anything I've experienced in the last few years. Honestly, it's not even just social media. People will casually mention how they got away to a spa on the weekend or went out with the family for a nice dinner or the zoo and it rips me apart because I can't remember the last time I did anything like that. I can't even fucking begin to put it into words. Even if I had the time, having the money is another problem. I want to do more than to live hand to mouth or constantly delay getting myself a bloody phone case because I never have enough or I want to save. And somehow still eat healthily (because I hate the way I look) whilst actual organic food becomes more expensive by the day. Starving myself is usually the cheapest option, which is just sad, I know.

Wow. Sorry for the word vomit and lack of coherence. I needed to get it out.If you've read any of that, thank you.

I suffered from depression some time ago, but it got better some years ago. I was in therapy multiple times and finished the last one about a year ago. 

Recently I moved to a new place with my bf. Far away from home. And my mental health got really bad. I don't really have anyone to talk to. 

Option 1: my boyfriend. We have some serious relationship issues. I can't talk about all of it here since it would be too much. The thing is, he often makes it worse. He gets angry a lot. ""Just"" loud and annoyed and disrespectful. When I criticise him even a tiny bit, he gets angry. When I am sad about something (doesn't have to be about him!), he gets angry. I literally can not talk to him when I feel bad. He will make me feel even worse and then not even say sorry or asking if I feel better. 

Option 2: my friends. Since I moved away far from my home, I need some new friends here, and I'm not at the point where I feel comfortable about talking to anyone new here about my depression and all these dark thoughts. I have some old friends too, but the ones I usually talk to kinda.. Ghost me? Not exactly that, but I don't get messages from them. For the last few months or even years, I feel like they don't really care that much about me anymore. So no, I'm not asking them. 

Option 3: family. Well my family is really broken. They all have enough to worry about. I can't make it worse so I'm not asking them for help. 

Option 4: therapy. This is the most responsible option from all of them, but I can't find anything. I already called multiple therapist and I can be lucky if even someone answers the phone. Noone is taking new patients. And I really can't wait. Every day feels really hard for me currently. 

Now, the most stupid thing is.. I can't even really leave. I feel bad at this new place because of multiple reasons. But (and now please don't tell me how stupid this was, because it's too late anyway and won't help) we signed the contract of the new apartment for 3 years. I felt under pressure because of my bf got, well, angry again. And here we are. I just feel alone and I don't know how to get help anymore. 

Not sure what the point of this post is.. Maybe a kind voice could help me feel at least a tiny bit better. "
748,1,I recently completed my masters degree which took me day and night to write my thesis and so I came back home from college. I just wanted to rest for like a month since college was so hectic wanted to do my own stuff get back into some habits and hobbies but my mom signed me up to join work the day after I completed my masters. I didn’t actually wanted to join the job but then I thought since it’s easy money why not. I was convinced. So I joined the job. I also had personal plans to study for some other exams for other better jobs by next month since this month I wanted to take a break. My brother called and asked if I was studying since I told him about the exams and stuff. My parents said “no she doesn’t study she doesn’t even open a book. Don’t know what she’s up to. She only sleeps. Does she even have any plans for anything?” I know my parents love and care for me but when they said that I felt very sad. They don’t know how hard I worked day and night for my masters thesis and I just slept a lot recently for the last two weeks to make up my sleep which I lost for months I just wanted to rest what’s wrong with that. I felt so looked down upon. I cried alone in the bathroom. I don’t have anyone to talk to. I worry about my future every day and I feel depressed sometimes when I think about it. Why do parents always say hurtful things. I think it’s better if I make my presence minimal in the house and just do my own thing and what’s good for me. Thank you for reading.

I'm currently practicing self love. I'm not fully loving myself but enough to go out and doing things. But today I'm tired both physically and mentally, and I dont have the energy to love myself. Its moments like these that makes me wanted to be loved by someone. Like I'm exhausted now. Is it too much to ask for a person to be lying besides me, just randomly doing something. I can rest peacefully knowing I'm safe in someone's arms. I cant, I've tried everything almost, but whenever I try I get disappointed and depressed. Help me"

For the past 3 years my family has been dealing with a financial crisis my father lost his job and our family business is struggling. But in that suffering I discovered so much about myself, I started to improve myself as a person eg joining Rotaract, helping out my community and I am in the process of creating a startup in which it has been chosen to be presented on an international olympiad convention in which I'll be representing my country (Zimbabwe). Things have not been easy for me in the slightest but im thankful that for some time my mental resilience was top notch as there were days when I would go to bed on an empty stomach but will be mentally content. (I was doing my attachment out of town) Our financial situation got so bad that my family could (and still) afford to even send a single dollar, mind you this is coming from a family that used to have it all (so the transition was rough) especially on my mom with her health severly deteriorating. But again I'm grateful for the tough times as they molded me to push myself and view life from a different scope, I even managed to find love. But it can only take you so far, I'm now in my final year of uni and my parents couldn't afford to pay for my registration. Now I'm back to square one, no money right now my mental health is finally caving in. Words of encouragement don't help no more, lost my touch with God. I just need a break, I just need help. I don't know what to do anymore. But I will carry on, my family needs me, my friends need me and I need me. Just wish I wasn't this broke. I want to die but I can't simply do it as I love my family and friends dearly it just sucks. Been trying to engage in multiple reddit groups but no one replys . Can't sleep just close my eyes. 
NB. I live in a third world country so 1st world methods like therapy and the sort don't particularly work "
751,0,"hi sweethearts, it’s okay to feel deeply, and you’re never alone in that. I know it can get heavy sometimes, but try to hold onto it. that part of you, your sensitivity, is what makes you uniquely YOU. 

don’t change yourself just because someone else doesn’t understand or appreciate it. stay true to who you are, your heart is full of love, and that’s something really beautiful. take a deep breath, let your emotions flow, and don’t keep them bottled up. your feelings are your strength, not your weakness. there’s so much beauty in the way you care.

here’s a big, warm hug for you. take care of yourself💞."

754,1,"I've just felt like shit for so long I don't know what to do anymore. I'm fourteen, I can only make friends over the internet but there's no one to talk to. There's no one my fucking age with my shitty interests who genuinely cares. I can't even hold the little chances I have to make friends. I'll unknowingly say something wrong or make them uncomfortable by being happy or wanting to talk and they'll never message me again. I'm too emotionally dependent on people and I'm too much of a fuck-up and I don't know what to do anymore. I don't feel comfortable talking to my family about anything like this, the farthest I've went so far was telling my mom I wanted therapy. I guess I'll have to see how that goes. I haven't talked to my family members in so fucking long. I think the two friends that I have on Discord find me annoying so I'm damn near sick of communicating with them and walking on eggshells all of the time because I'm too much of an emotional piece of shit to be normal around them and not ruin the relationship. It's just so worthless. I'm a worthless human being. I don't understand the piece of shit adults that are so busy and normal and can just function in front of other people. They make me so mad. ""You just don't understand right now because you're a teenager,"" then why am I constantly self-aware when it comes to my age? Why have I always been worried about how I was perceived by adults so that I could gain validation from them? The internet is the only hope I have left, and I can't even have meaningful connections on it without constantly blaming myself for stupid shit, feeling like I'm always annoying people and being too negative all of the time. I'm sick of constantly worrying about what other people think or feeling like I have to be super mature all the time. there's no point. I can't win. I can't make people happy or comfortable or receive validation from anyone. Idek anymore. Stupid fucking edgy pity party post, what's the point. I'm sorry if you're reading this. I'm genuinely sorry. Please someone just. At least make it known that this was read. Please I'm sorry"
755,2,"And it bothers me more than it probably should because I still worry about her 

After she left me, she cut off most of her friends and she made connections with new people. She turned to weed, partying, alcohol, and random hookups. 

This morning I found out she hooked up with 2 guys while she was high at a drinking party, and it concerns me in every way imaginable. One, I know both of the guys and I know their intent was not innocent, and two, it pains me to see someone as valuable as her get used like she was just made as some object to pleasure other men. 

I still remember her as one of the most  kind, loving and intelligent people I know, and it really just fucks me in the head knowing she has reached such a low point of self worth where she has resorted to objectifying herself to other men for validation. Shes always struggled with insecurity but I know she is worth so much more than she thinks, and so much more than the standards she holds herself too.

Not sure why I feel this way, it’s been a while since we talked and maybe it’s a little controlling to think of it this way, but I really wish I could help her. Maybe it’s just jealousy too, the thought of other guys doing those things to her makes me sick. Idk if anyone has help it would be appreciated "
756,3,"Hi I'm in my late 20s f and still living with my parents due to financial struggles and I'm really having a hard time dealing with life atm. I've been relying on my parents too much and have been trying to distance myself from them and it's been leading to a lot of arguments about boundaries. Such as, not entering my room and stop touching my things.
I want to move out but cannot get a large enough mortgage to afford a place of my own and renting is too expensive. 
I am dealing with undiagnosed adhd (I went to a therapist who basically said my problems stem from that and I am currently waiting for an assessment). I'm really suffering from all the pressure to continue as normal when I find myself unable to cope with the helplessness I'm feeling all the time.
I have friends but always find it so difficult to talk to them about my problems as I get so overwhelmed by my emotions all the time and can't convey to them what I need.
My work is also putting pressure on me to do more things and I'm unable to keep up with all the demands.
Its like I can't see a way forward and coping with my day to day is becoming increasingly harder.
I don't know if what I'm feeling will ever go away. I really need some support but don't know how to find it.

758,1,I'm not sure what I'm searching for here. I just feel helpless. My dog is staring at me right now as he wants to play. Part of me thinks he needs to learn we can't play all the time and had a walk yesterday and has a whole house with toys to play. He's not barking constantly for attention and can go outside whenever he wants. The other half of me is saying just because he stopped barking doesn't mean he doesn't want attention it means he gave up and is just sad now. The self sabotage is high and the confidence to keep and hold a conversation is low.

760,2,"I (17M) have a hard time trusting in my feelings. It all started when i broke up with my girlfriend last year. We were together in school for almost a year before i had to move to another city. We tried dating LDR but that wasn't what i wanted for me. Some time later i realized i was ""falling out of love"", this flooded me with anxiety and guilt because I didn't wanted to hurt her. I tried fighting those thoughts but ended up breaking up with her. Now i don't trust in any type of romantical feeling and this is starting to bother me. Yesterday i had a great first date with a girl i met and i really want to go out with her again, but im scared it will end in the same way. I overana.lyze (really? I can't write a word that happens to have a.n.a.l in the middle?) and overthink every single thought i have, like ""yeah, i didn't woke up  with a excruciating longing for this girl i met last week, so it's obviously over for us"".

Hi everyone,  
I’m going through a really tough time right now and could use some kindness or advice from people who understand. Lately, I’ve been feeling like everyone hates me, even though I try my best to be kind. I fixate on things about my appearance, my mind never feels calm, and I’m terrified of my own emotions. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve lost all sense of meaning in life, and going to school (or even daily tasks) feels impossible.  

I’m writing this because I don’t want to feel alone anymore. If anyone has felt this way and found ways to cope, I’d love to hear your story. Or if you’re also struggling right now, maybe we can support each other? I’m open to making friends here—someone to talk to when things get dark or just to share small wins with.  

A few things I’m working on:  
- Trying to challenge self-hatred (it’s SO hard).  
- Testing mindfulness/grounding techniques (but my brain fights it).  
- Looking for tiny joys again (walks, music, etc.).  

If you’ve been through something similar, how did you start healing? Or if you’re in the same boat, what helps you keep going?  

Thank you for reading. Even a small comment would mean a lot. 💛

769,1,"I’m so bad at actually taking people up on it when they offer a kind voice because I tend to deflect and ask about the other person more… but honestly, I need help. I am really bad at being gentle with myself, so I’ve just been struggling a lot with all these feelings and lack of energy or motivation to do anything about them, and I just need a metaphorical hug with words or whatever.

The support I respond to best is active listening, realistic reassurance, and gentle advice if needed, though honestly at this moment I just need to vent because nobody in my life knows how bad my mental health is these days. Don’t be afraid to “pressure” me to talk about my problems, because that’s kind of what I need. (TW for potential topics I am struggling with: ideation, loneliness, existential dread)

And for the record, I am in therapy, I just need a little peer support between sessions :)"

771,1,"2014. 11 years ago. Almost exactly as that year ended, the one person I ever had some semblance of a loving relationship with was gone from my life. Over the years, I built a strange sense of stoicism around this topic, to the point of almost completely forgetting about it at times. The standard has always been this and I haven't truly experienced the opposite.

About a year ago I was randomly looking through the files in my phone and I came across a screenshot from that time (I'm not very sure why I took it, but it wasn't because of the message itself) with a message from her saying ""I love you"". That hit me like a knife. It has been very long, man. Far too long since I heard/read that from someone. The tough shell I built around me would probably crumble to pieces if I ever heard that again. I learned that I've been carrying this vacuum inside of me and I taught myself very well to ignore it completely. At the same time, I realize the damage it's been doing inside of me (which in contrast there's no way to ignore) and how I should really change this. Maybe, because after all I didn't really learn how to cope well with. I guess I've been miserable all this time and I could barely tell. Maybe I haven't listened to myself all along.

Fast forward to today. I technically still follow her on Instagram but I ""shadow banned"" her from me by setting everything up so that I won't see anything she posts. I'm scrolling through some reels and, with the new feature where you can see when people you follow liked something, I saw her pfp. I peeked at her profile for the first time in maybe years just out of curiosity. I'm going to be honest with you, I moved on from her in particular and in no way I want to get her back - even because she's married now. It's not about her in particular. But I remembered that that person once was someone who I loved and who loved me back. Who wanted me well and provided me with the amazing sense of comfort that is to be emotionally accepted by someone. To trust your feelings with them. To have this great friend you can share anything with.

I just wanted to tell you that I felt this fragility in me once again. It gets tiring to just power through and keep a pokerface through life. To find motivation and energy out of thin air. I feel I just need someone who I can be completely vulnerable with and leave my guards down, and just be my 100% pure self for once.

Thanks"
772,1,"A few weeks ago, I came home from the worst year of my life. Mandatory military service for a country I now hate. I'm Greek.

And I just... no reward, no recognition. I'm almost suicidal. I'm depressed. I hate it. The humiliation of the ceremony after basic... Marching, the stupid national anthem, saluting people I have zero respect for. In front of my parents. People saying they're proud.

Prior to this, I did have a job for a year, but it was in my hometown, so I stayed with my parents, and naturally had a very easy experience. Due to this, I never really learned how to live life by myself, since everything was already taken care of for me. But now that I have to deal with stuff like rent, bills, groceries, finding myself a job, AND dealing with studies at the same time? I’m finding it very difficult.

Would like some advice on how to go about everything, specifically on money management, how to balance everything in a day, and how to reduce distractions so that I don’t spend the whole day just scrolling through TikTok or something.

I still love him even though he did not treat me right. The nights are really hard and I am feeling really lonely and just crying and crying, I need a kind voice. 

EDIT: Using a throw away because my ex knows my real account. "
775,1,"
I've not had a lot of luck with relationships, and I do realize that it takes two to tango but I've tried my best in every aspect to treat people right. I think I just have a habit of choosing emotionally unavailable people so the longest relationship I've ever had was 5 days. 

I actually felt happy, like I had purpose, and was supported in all the ways I never was before. I'm 25 now and that was the first time I truly felt that way, honeymoon phase or not. It worked, we worked. 5 great days later they broke down wanting to end it because they didn't feel ready for a relationship, even tho they also really enjoyed those days and felt so supported and cared fot they felt scared to enter a new long term relationship. I tried to diswade her fears but she still wanted to end it. As much as it hurt I obliged, and it almost broke me. A part of me kept holding on to her saying that she hoped to see me in the future while we were spliting. But that's just false hope, I know it's never going to happen and holding onto that hope will emotionally stunt me.

A large part of me wants to go to her door and beg. But she'll never say yes to that.

I'm just so tired, I have an empty hole in my heart and everytine I try to fill it I get hurt so badly I my life stops moving again. 

I'm so tired of being told you're a great guy and you deserve better. Why can't they just be the ones to do it... am I worth so little...

I know my needs just aren't being met, but I'm out of ways to try and I'm losing any and all steam to make my life better anymore. They didn't cause this I was always like this, stuck with a depression that makes me unmotivated and undesirable regardless of how hard I try...

I don't have any irl friends, I have terrible social skills and attachment issues, any friends I make online I end up pushing away because I'm too clingy. And I talk to them about shit nobody cares about because I don't know how to talk without sounding generic and robotic. I completely lack the ability to read peoples emotions so I don't know when I'm annoying them and when I'm not. I was cursed with the inability to talk to people and I don't know what to fucking do anymore. I just hate myself for the way I am."
778,1,"Some important context, probably...

I'm 30M. My first relationship lasted from the time I was 17 to 26. After that, didn't date anyone for about a year and a half as I was utterly in the pits and had zero confidence honestly.

Then I met someone, and things came together so fast. A month later I was in my second relationship. This went on for about 1.5 year, ending in 2024.

Since then I've become the happiest, most self confident and self loving version of myself that's ever existed. I've been more confidently putting myself out there and meeting people. Most of the connections I've had only lasted a date or two before I decided I wasn't really feeling it and I let them know very politely.

I was seeing someone for almost a month back in the summer, but long story short - we both mutually parted ways. So it wasn't that difficult for me to process and move on from, even though I do tend to be a very emotionally driven person, and feel things very strongly. I also do probably tend to get attached to people because I want so badly to have a deep connection.

Anyways, December I started talking to someone. Instantly there was so much to like about her and what I wanted in a partner. She's beautiful, has the same values and goals, and similar interests/mannerisms. Then we meet, and things seem to be going well. The next couple weeks we're seeing each other once or twice a week. Then she caught pneumonia, and around that time it felt like things shifted. Like, I know she was sick and she was starting a new job, but something just felt off over texting. She was responding slower, seeming less engaged, not flirting as much, etc...but I chose to write it off as she may just be busy/dealing with sickness and doesn't have the energy. Admittedly I started kind of stepping back a little bit and tried to match her energy so that I guess it'd hurt less.

We finally had our first date in 3 weeks today (I asked her out again after she said she was feeling pretty well again) and it felt a little awkward but I thought that was normal because of the gap. But soon enough we were yapping and laughing. I took her back to her place and she kissed me before leaving. I thought it went well.

Then after a handful of hours, she texts me saying that she thinks I'm great, thinks I'm funny, thinks I have the best intentions,  thinks we have a lot in common - but she doesn't feel a romantic connection/feelings. She did tell me earlier on that for her, feelings develop slowly and then rapidly get strong. So I guess for her that didn't happen.

Now, because of my dating history... I've never been in this situation. Like, I know her and I weren't a thing...but I can't help but feel this deep sadness. It's already making me sad knowing that I'm not gonna get a good morning text from her anymore. That there's now no chance to explore things further in what I thought had potential. 

This just sucks. Sorry I know this is a basic part of dating but damn. I hate this."

It feels so uncomfortable, I can't even fall asleep at night because my heart keeps pounding out of anxiety and dread for the next day.

The marriage i dedicated my entire self to, has been unrecognizable for years now. The last person i trusted, even after all the devastations, turned out to be a narcissistic asshole with an ego bigger than the Everest. 

Noone gives a fuck. Just a fact that I've been trying to live with but don't know how to. It's taking away my true self, the kind loving trusting naive self. It already has, actually. And I don't know who i am now.

If it were not for my child...

I'm so dead inside and yet this sadness today is so fucking heavy..

When my kid feels sad or hurt or anything not nice, all they have to do is come to me and momma's hugs and kisses and love and cuddles and stories and touch makes things better for them every single time. 

Wish I had someone like that in my life

787,0,[Gay older male with mental health ]problems looking for someone…. 
788,3,"I (34F) have a 2 year old and an 8 year old. For the year of 2024, I was working a very demanding position from Monday to Friday. My day consisted of waking up, getting kids ready, taking them to daycare, going to work, picking kids up, dinner, bath, bed. I typically got 1.5 hours to myself every night. Weekends was just kids all day with no break until bedtime. My husband is as helpful as he can be, but the kids basically cling to me. Especially the little one, who cries any time my husband tries to take her away. 

I white knuckled through last year. I constantly thought about killing myself. It was all just too much. I was burnt out and exhausted. 

This year, I got a new position which is way more laid back, but it's shift work. I work two 12 hour days and two 12 hour nights, then I get 5 days off. It's been amazing. I've actually been able to keep the house clean and also have some time to myself. My husband tells me all the time that the kids are completely different people when I'm not around. They listen and they're not crying or whining constantly. 

But now my husband is feeling overwhelmed. For 4 days that I'm working, he's basically in single parent mode. I help out as much as I can. I get lunches ready when I can and do all the evening chores. I'm trying to make it easy for him. Sometimes I work weekends so he's alone all weekend with them.

I feel like I can't win. I wish I didn't switch to this new pattern. I wish I just put up with the Monday to Friday, but I know my work won't switch me back now that the year has started. I think about quitting my job and finding something else but I'll never make this much money any where else and the life we built can't afford a pay cut. 

Now my mind is trapped in this loop that the only way out is killing myself. I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to opt out. "
789,1,"God, I don’t know why I’m typing this. My friends and family told me to commit since I was 8 and I listened and tried only to fail. Since then, I’ve done countless things for attention. It’s like I’m addicted to it. I tell people countless stories of when I was younger such as how I was really just a puppet and how my future was already planned since I was born. I never wanted to be a doctor or study anything but I had to pretend like I was just an ambitious kid that wanted to be a surgeon and make lots of money. I started hurting myself for relief and afterwards loved it when I was questioned by others. i felt so gross and terrible when I would purposely mention it to get sympathy, yet get too scared to tell my closer friends. I’d tell them fake stories just to get attention and popularity. I don’t know why. I’m just such a terrible person. 

it’s like im tearing apart my family. I just want them to feel what they’ve done to me and how they’ve ruined my life and still control everything. god, sometimes I even wish they’d just disappear from my life and I get to run away or start fresh in a much more violent way then just waking up and seeing them gone. It really disgusts me, god i hate it so much but I just really wish someone could understand and give me like a huge wake up call. I can’t stop my addiction for attention. I really dont deserve to live but I can’t bring myself to go that far. I just wish there was a button I could push to disappear or restart"
790,1,"I am so sad and lonely, i have been like that for some weeks because I had a hard situation that left me hopeless… People around me cannot support me emotionally, due to getting blocked, or not wanting to navigate into emotions due to struggles…

791,2,"There’s a lot of flooding in my region of the US and we live near the river and a creek. So I’m staying up all night to keep a watch on the waters while my parents sleep. They’re older and need rest so I don’t fault them. 

I’m a little scared though and literally no one I know is awake. So I’m just hoping to get some interaction on this post that I can distract myself with. "
792,1,"I know I am a top contender for having the most uneventful life ever. I have only ever had 1 birthday party, 1 dance, 1 sleepover, 1 party. The last time I had someone over at my house was a year ago, and the last time I hung out with someone was 4 months ago. I have never held hands with anyone and I have never even gotten close to my first kiss. I have had a boyfriend and a girlfriend, but neither of those relationships have lasted over a month.

My birthday party was when I turned 10, the dance I went to was in middle school, I was 8 when the sleepover happened, and I was alone in the corner the entire time during the party.

The person I had over at my house was my best friend at the time, but he started lying to me and being extremely rude to me, so we stopped being friends. The last time a hung out with someone was to give my friend his birthday gift.

I know your teenage years are supposed to be the ones where you do just extremely stupid and fun shit, but I have never done any of that. I am extremely introverted and like keeping to myself, but that doesn't mean I want to be contained in my room for supposedly the best years of my life. I feel like I'm wasting my prime life away, but I don't know what to do. I really only have four friends, but I only talk to one of them daily. I'm not good with making friends either; I am socially awkward, have anxiety, hate talking, and autistic.

My days are constant repeats of one another. I've tried stopping my life twice, but both of those attempts haven't worked. I almost tried again in January, but I backed out because I told myself my family needs me. I have a therapist, but I have such social anxiety, that I don't even tell her what's bothering me. I just tell her I'm doing good, and then she says she's proud of me. No one knows I'm slewerslidal, because the last time I told people, they took it as a joke and didn't believe me. I was depressed for a while a year ago and a bit, but now I just feel tired. I am still sewerslidal, but I don't think I'm going to try again unless something train wrecks my already shit life.

I hate being lonely, I hate being introverted, I hate being awkward, I hate being anxious, I hate expressing myself, I hate being autistic, I hate being slewerslidal, I hate being tired, I hate not being a teenager.

I just want to have my teenage dream."
793,3,"Hi everyone, I’m really struggling today. Life has been so tough with my chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia, and lately, it feels like everything is just too much to bear. I’ve tried everything I can to help, but nothing seems to make a difference. The exhaustion is overwhelming, and the noise at night makes it so much worse. I’m doing my best to stay strong, but some days it just feels like too much. I don’t need advice or solutions right now, just some kind words and maybe a little love. I’d really appreciate it. Thanks for listening."
794,2,"Okay...

Greek here. I completed mandatory military service a few weeks ago. Not figuring out that I'm not owed any sort of compensation for it. People say you have a benefit in the civil service, they're more likely to hire people who have military experience, but I'm not going to be working in the civil service.

No. Instead, I lost a years wages and a relationship and have had to move back in with my parents. I'm still unemployed because it's not like I can just get straight back into a job, with interviews, all that.

I'm furious. They owe me something. So I want advice on how to go about this. First, I will try and see if there is any leverage here to get compensated for the year I missed out on, it was the worst year of my life.

If that fails, I want to take something back by force. I'm not sure how."
795,1,"Lately I've been feeling ups and downs. Tonight I feel emotionally numb. Just out of it. Desensitized to heart ache. I'm feeling unphased by it. I'm questioning my self worth, if I'm admirable. If I'd ever be enough. I try to tell myself I am but lately its been so much harder to believe. I just lost someone I liked. She said she's focusing on school right now, which I get. But she probably was just letting me down easily.  I fell into limerence. Badly. I don't know what to feel. I feel despair, but it really doesn't hurt. I'm used to this. I'd say I hate being used to it but I really don't feel anything tonight. I feel blurry. Just not there. I'm only 19. Yes I'm young. I'm not blaming women at all for this. Not at all. Just. I can't be happy. No matter how much I try. I can't win. The universe is against me. Why does it always have to turn into a lesson? Can't I ever win for once?? I don't feel emotion. Hardly. I rarely get excited anymore. I have this intuition to guard my emotions, while at the same time I attach so damn easily. I'm in school clubs. I lift regularly. I study full time. Yet I just feel this pit. I don't want to find anyone else. I don't even wanna bother with dating apps anymore. I just want to feel something for once. That isn't ache. That isn't limerence. I want to be on cloud 9. I want to be young and dumb. Delusional. Not taken for granted.  I wanted to find someone to just melt into their eyes. To be happy with. To have a genuine connection. I'm just not cut out for that. I hate to admit it. I really, don't know how to move forward. I don't want to be seeking someone out like I'm desperate. Yeah I'm lonely. I don't expect a partner to fill out this void entirely. I just want someone I can get through life with together. To lean on. To laugh away time. I keep thinking of song lyrics. Consistently. I can't connect with heart ache songs. Not anymore. No matter how much I try. I keep thinking of this QOTSA song, ""I want something good to die for, to make it beautiful to live"". Consistently. That lyric replays in my mind. I'm not angry. I'm not happy. I'm sad. But not that sad. I'm not going to tell myself what I know. Put myself down further. I'm tired of ranting to ChatGPT about this. I just wanna be seen. Heard. Acknowledged."

798,3,"Does anyone have any methods, or book recommendations for someone to stop being upset about news that is out of my control?

I hate to say this, but sometimes I literally stress over literally nothing, or things I can't change.

For instance, at an engineering firm. Say you're working on a project that goes 200% over budget, completely out of your control. If your boss comes to you and ""complains about the budget"", I feel a normal person would be like ""well yeah, but that part of the project is out of my control...."" get off the call and be perfectly fine.

It will eat at me for at least a day till I go to sleep. I can't stop thinking about it. Angry, frustrated, sad, scared, ashamed etc.

If you have questions please ask them, something I have been trying to get over but can't seem to shake it."

802,1,"
Hi..I had never seen this sub reddit before, but as I lay awake in bed, unable to slow down thinking I went looking for some kind of comfort and found this sub. I'm a 33 year old male and life has been strange for me I guess. To be honest, I guess it's probably strange for a lot of people these days. However, when I was a teenager I got addicted to online videogames. I spent up to 8 hours a day playing. It eventually reached it's breaking point, when my Grandmother confronted me telling me that my Dad just wished for his son back. I got better, tried to be more committed to spending time with my family. During my early twenties, I had plenty of friends and went to some house parties, but a lot of the time my best friends didn't want to do much, so we just sat in our friends room while they smoked and we talked for hours. I imagined someday it'd change and we'd do stuff or travel. We didn't. I got a job at 25 in grocery, where I worked for the next 8 years..It wasn't a great job but I was friends with a lot of my coworkers, and because I was older I was kind of the work big brother. Despite being so social I never had a girlfriend. Part of it was my appearance, a lot of it was self confidence, but I never really put myself out there. I didn't want to bother anyone, and kind of always saw myself as a burden or a monster appearance wise so I kept to myself. At 31 I got into my first relationship, and it turned out to be with a girl with BPD. We were together for almost a year, and it was hell. I tried to keep things together, hoping that eventually we'd hit the bottom and things would finally get better but they didn't. I tried to recover, not putting myself out there, but just trying to rebuild myself. I was angry at myself for putting myself through that. 

Then came the next gut punch. In November of 2023, I felt awful. I was sleeping 12-14 hours a day on my day off. I went to the doctor and they found out I had cancer. It was early enough that the surgery was easy, and I only had to do one round of chemo, but I had so many setbacks. The piccline they put in gave me several blood clots in my arm. While being treated for the blood clots I was given oxygen which reacted negatively with the chemo medicine still in my system resulting in one of my lungs collapsing. 

For the most part I'm okay now, but I had to quit my job. I went from standing on my feet 8 hours a day to barely able to stand for an hour at a time. I kept thinking it'd get better, but it really hasn't. As someone who felt like they wasted their twenties, I was excited to hear a lot of people say they enjoyed their 30s more, but I'm on pace to waste those too. I've never got to travel, I'm so disconnected from society and normal people now, I don't know if I'll ever get back to normal and I know it'll still get worse. My grandparents are both in their mid 80s. They've always played a big part of mine and my family's life. I've seen them slowing down over the years. They're not too bad off, but I know it's inevitable.

So now I stay up all night, until 9-10 in the morning and sleeping until 6-7 P.M. feeling lost and adrift, that I'm wasting even more of my life then I already have. Any kind words or comfort at this point would be greatly appreciated.."
803,1,"I wanna do better for myself, but I feel I can’t. I feel like I’m in such a bad situation that I have no way of getting out of it and I wanna give up the light at the tunnel seems so far away."

805,3,"I'm very chronically ill and dealing with a scary new pain condition impacting my mobility. The partner/ex I live with is struggling to offer emotional support and I got in a conflict with my only close online friend right when I really needed someone to be there for me. 

I really need someone to talk to. Not looking for advice, hope, positivity, or to be fixed or asked a lot of questions about my health. Just someone to listen and be validating or even distract me. Prefer someone close-ish to my age, I'm 37. Text chat only. Must also be left-leaning and LGBTQIA+ friendly for safety reasons. I can offer support and listening too if you need it."
806,2,"Hello, I am a sophomore girl looking for someone to vent to about academic struggles. School has been hard lately and I can’t really open up to my friends. I’m also down to talk about anyone else’s struggles. I would prefer someone that is around my age. (Max 22 years old) Thank you. "
807,1,"Mid-20s male (gen z) living in a big metropolitan city in the US. On the surface, it may seem as though I'm doing great and in some ways I am. I have a job in an interesting and somewhat niche field working from home full time, travel regularly for work or leisure, make great money living comfortably in a HCOL, own a nice car (where most don't own a car at all), have great friends, go out regularly, and partake in hobbies.

But on the inside and when I'm at home or alone, I feel sad, tired, empty, and lonely. It affects me to the point where I don't even have the energy to work or to get out of bed. Haven't been in a relationship in a while and the apps quite frankly yield jack. Very very rarely do I get matches. When I do go on dates, most girls don't have much interest in me or just wants something casual (which isn't my thing). Most usually doesn't go past a second date.

I know everyone says things like you have to appreciate and love yourself first but I'm sick and tired of hearing that. I try to keep myself occupied and happy whether that's traveling solo or partaking in hobbies. But even then, just seeing other couples laughing, smiling, having a great time triggers the sadness and loneliness feelings. Even just on calls with colleagues when they mention what they did with their partner really brings me down. It forces me to reflect on myself and question ""Why am I where I'm at now?""

Maybe its cause of how I look/who I am; I'm an Asian male (tbh Asian males do struggle). Or maybe its cause of where I live. Obviously, I can't change who I am, but I've thought about moving elsewhere in the country where the dating scene might be better but worry that I'll end up digging a bigger hole moving somewhere where I barley or don't know anyone.

I've thought about seeking therapy but decided against it. Long story short, I worry if I see a therapist and they give a diagnosis, it could negatively affect my career and a hobby I love (basically on a regular cadence I have to fill out forms in order to renew stuff and one of the questions asks something like ""have you ever been diagnosed with or seen a mental health professional"" and if yes it's an absolute pain in the a** to deal with and it can take years to resolve)."
808,1,"Hi,  
hope you're well..

\[TW : passive'ish suicidal ideation, self-loathing\]

so I'm not sure why I post this, I kinda hope it's relevent in form with this place..  
I might write something very similar to my therapist right after because I'm not doing well,  
it's not the first time, I've been a fairly sad person for probably two decades now,  
no real diagnostic I feel, I've just heard the words ""depression"" ""anxiety"" thrown here and there from therapists to therapists, and some friends even went as far as ""cPTSD"", ""ADHD"", maybe even being somewhere on the spectrum..  
what I think myself, not sure, yeah depression sure, almost certain I have body dysmorphia disorder..  
This I'm almost certain, I don't see how I could hate the way I look so much without some pathology attached to it..

All I know is I've never been able to totally move on from... when I was younger I would have called it ""love"", now I'm pretty sure I cannot love. I can only fear rejection and be insecure and project my need for attention unto people I meet..

so yes, ""moving on"". there's multiple examples of that, but lately, I kind of fell back into """"obsessing"" I guess is the word, towards an old friend, we didn't speak more than twice a year for years now, we're very much estranged. it's a little bit long, but we met on the internet, had great social chemistry, met a few times, went to concerts, I spent time at hers, and eventually felt like I loved her..

that ""love"" for some reason almost exclusively expressed itself through daydreaming a future with her, and being very very sad whenever she evoked ""cool guys she met"" and when they became ""her boyfriend and/or lover"".

I've been kinda close I guess to be one of those... a couple cuddly nights happened, but that's as close as it got. and now, I wish it never did. I am haunted by the idea I might have done ""just the wrong thing"" ""given just the wrong vibe at the right moment""..

I think it's just overthinking, I think she was just living in the moment, enjoying companionship with a friend and the time just brushed over it. Also at the time I'm almost sure she was seeing someone..

Anyway.. I'm so sorry that it's so long.

It's been a wavy friendship (if I even deserve the term of friend..) highs and very lows, almost exclusively brought by me, for the lows.. because I would get so sad about her seeing people and I guess, not choosing me.. I was a very immature person, I don't think ""today me"" would make scenes, or express sadness in a toxic way.. (nota bene : I never asked her to not see those people, or enjoy her life without me, just asked her to not tell me.. )

we ended up interracting and talking less.. she might have gotten tired with my antics.. And I don't blame her.

I knew I'd always remember this relationship, I'm not good with relation-anything.. always struggled to make and keep friends. let alone romances.. the only person who tried that with me really didn't deserve such a distant and unloving person as me. now I wish she never met me. But the result is, I've always been quite alone. this past decade, I spent 98% of my time in my room. playing video game, recording some shitty covers and watching people react to movies to connect and feel stuffs vicariously, not meeting a whole lot of new people outside of the internet.

So yes, I knew I'd never totally ""move on"", but I didn't expect to be so... \[insert unproductive insult\].  
I don't know...  
I just feel like no matter how much time passes, I just never let go of whatever linked me at a time given to someone...  
in january, we spoke for a few minutes on whatsapp, just ""quick catchup and good wishes for the year"" kinda deal...  
and she told me she was expecting a baby with someone she met on a video game or something..  
and I think it destroyed me a little?  
and I feel SO. MUCH. SHAME. for not being able to move on, for regressing to a state of disarray that deep after all this time.  
I don't even want children.  
I. don't. even. want. children.  
And yet here I am, wanting to be d3@d because someone I wanted to call myself a friend to, is happy and fulfilling life changing events with someone ten year after we stopped even seeing each other..

So I essentially feel like it equates wishing her to be unhappy and unfulfilled.  
and like I'm the worst friend that can exist.

I do not understand what wiring has failed in my brain, I'm just maybe, starting to understand some of the why with therapy, but I really really wish the power goes out asap.

she told me ""in february"" so, it might have happened, or be about to..  
I'm trying very very hard to not add her on instagram to see what's hiding behind the private profile...  
I am especially curious of what ""monsieur"" looks like..

how do people grow the \*\*\*\* up and move on.. ?  
my best guess is.. it's natural. painful, difficult sure, but it still ""just happens"".

I'm almost certain it is too late for me.  
and I'm aware that ""blocking her"" and such things would be the healthy thing to do, but it just feels like it would just make the failure complete.  
maybe you can't have closure without completion.  
but I'm sure the harm is done so it wouldn't change anything except maybe hurt her, if she cares still.

and, I have to insist once more, I do not blame her for anything(maybe.. maybe the talking so much about people she met and slept with at some point but it's 100% ON ME for not asking her to stop explicitly enough.) .

my brain/psyche is the one that causes ALL of it.  
which is probably why I wish it went into hypoxia and stopped running altogether.  
Ideally without me helping it.  
because with all this, I really, really don't want to make the people who care about me go through the trauma of a s\*dee friend.  
Cannot. wait.

I feel utterly abnormal.  
Absolutely repulsive.  
and hateful.

I wish I was normal and could Love.

809,1,my best friend left for his girl we argued a lot he was my one and only best friend
810,0,We can talk about anything you want.
811,1,"My life had completely fallen apart. I lost my dad, then my wife, and honestly, I lost myself too. So, I took some time off and went back to Thailand for four months. I'd lived there before, even planned on moving back eventually. One night, I ended up in one of those girly bars in the tourist area. I met her there. We just clicked. I was lonely, I'll admit it, and we ended up spending the night together. It started like that, transactional. But then it kept happening, only the money stopped. She'd just stay with me, or leave the bar early to hang out. We actually started to connect, emotionally. She invited me to her family's place. It was amazing. They welcomed me like I was one of them. We fell for each other, hard. Talked about the future, kids, everything. It felt so real.

Then my trip ended, and the reality of her life crashed down on us. She hated the bar, called it dirty, but felt like she had no choice. No education, family to support. I understood, but the thought of her going back just killed me. I asked her what she'd do if she had another option, and she mentioned wanting a little coffee shop back home. The startup costs were surprisingly low, less than a thousand bucks. I was desperate, I guess, and maybe a little in love, so I helped her get it started before I left.

Back home, we were constantly video chatting. The coffee shop seemed to be doing okay, enough to get by. Then, a month later, she tells me she's going on a trip with friends. I was immediately uneasy. She’d barely started the business, and it felt like she couldn't afford a trip. But she got defensive, so I let it go. She said she was meeting two friends, one still working in a bar, the other a former bar girl whose boyfriend is Taiwanese and runs those ""karaoke"" bars – you know, the ones that are basically fronts for prostitution.

Two weeks of pure hell later, I found out the truth. She wasn't with friends. She was in Taiwan, working in one of those karaoke bars. I felt sick to my stomach. She was so apologetic, said the coffee shop wasn't making enough, that she lied because she didn't want to burden me, didn't want to lose me.

Then she told me about what it was actually like there. Five, six men a day. The way she talked about it, the disgust, the self-loathing… it just broke me. She called herself bad, dirty. It was awful. I know where she comes from, the poverty, the desperation. I’m just so angry at the people who took advantage of her.

Now she’s back home, but I know it’s only a matter of time before she has to go back. I’m consumed by it. I can’t work, I can’t sleep, I can’t eat. I know people will judge me, judge *her*, but I can’t help how I feel. I see *her*, not just what she’s been through. I’m lost, helpless, and just so incredibly sad. What am I supposed to do? Am I crazy for this? I just need to talk about it."
812,0,"I know things can look bad, but nothing last forever.

If you need a shoulder to cry on, a more neutral opinion, advice, or just to vent (the latter helps a lot), I can try to help without judgement.

I think it's much easier to share your problems with a stranger because you don't feel like they can judge you as much as a friend or family member might. If you just want to talk or make friends, I'm avaliable too.

In the past I wasn't happy and my life was a mess, I know how that feels, now I'm better, so I want to do my bit to make other people's lives a bit better too."

817,1,"I have nobody I can talk to right now. My fiance and I got into an argument earlier about something stupid that revealed deep fault lines in our relationship. We make the worst assumptions about each other. And to add to it all, he told me his mother called me a cheating whore earlier today. I have never cheated, nor will I ever cheat. He couldn’t defend me, because he currently lives with his parents, and they’ll kick him out. He’s currently working towards a financial spot where he can safely move out. But it’s taking a while.

I just feel sad and scared for him. A part of me wants to die to make his life easier, but I stay alive because I know logically it would make his life so much harder and more painful. I just wish for god to care. I’ve never felt so alone. "
818,1,"Every single thing about me screams failure, even though I'm intelligent, somewhat attractive, not abhorrently asocial. I don't get it. Life is ruined by things that other people don't have to deal with. I don't get it."

820,1,"Hi there. Much like the title says, I was seeing this woman for about a week and after 2 dates she called it off. Now I don’t get many women coming up to me so when she matched with me on a dating app and she seemed to be enjoying the conversation I was ecstatic. And when we met in person we just clicked. After the second date we were holding hands and I thought everything was going well, and the Morning after she decided she didn’t want to see me anymore. Ever since then I’ve been so depressed and hopeless. Finding love is one of my big goals in life and it feels so hopeless now. It feels like no one will ever love me. I’m just looking for someone to talk to about this and give some friendly advice to me. Thanks in advance."

Love cheering others up and supporting them through lifes hardships and having a positive impact on others.
I'm a pretty down to earth kinda guy and up for any topics or hardships, seen and heard a bit of everything nowadays.

In case anyone is going through a rough time or just need someone to chat will, feel free to send me a dm.

Can mainly chat / respond outside of work hours in European timezone."
823,0,"I know that feeling. People will embrace sadness easier than rage, and sometimes people meet empathy when they show sadness, but when they show their rage against something unfair they've had to suffer, it's not quite the same. 

I see you. I understand you who feel like this world is not for you, that don't see virtue in letting people stomp on you. I don't want you to have to suck it up, to feel that it's your fault that you're angry. That's why I offer my voice to you who are feeling like this. 

At least, if you hate it it means you're bold enough to acknowledge you don't deserve it. Be proud of that. 

I will be here for you. "
824,1,"I am very sad, and I was scared that the person closest to me listened my feelings, because he gets stressed… Today he told me he wanted to listen to me, and I opened my heart… That I don’t want to work because I will have to talk to people who I don’t want to talk to, that I only want to be in a small place where only I will listen people that tell me something kind…
His answer was that I needed to go to the doctor… And I know pills are not for me, they disconnected me from myself…"
825,1,"Sorry for rambling so much, but for most of my life I’ve felt completely isolated from almost everyone. I’m chronically depressed and anxious. The only times I’ve felt the depression lift has been when I’ve felt I’ve made genuine human connection with others. But unfortunately there’s something about who I am in my very core that makes people want to keep their distance from me. While I have had real friends and a bit of a social life here and there people have hardly ever reached out to me. Rarely do people ask me to hang out or seem to be interested in genuine friendship with me. I’ve hardly ever been asked out by girls. There’s just zero interest in people wanting to form a close relationship of any kind. I DEEPLY crave close physical and emotional connection, but I’ve been starved of it my whole life and it’s driving me to insanity. What really reinforces my inherent repulsiveness is ironically my successes in socializing with people. Almost everywhere I go where I get to know people (school, work, mental health places, etc) they appear to like me. People are constantly saying I’m one of the funniest people they’ve ever met. 

One example would be a place I worked at a few years ago. My coworkers and I were all hanging out drinking after work and I was on a fucking role. I was making my coworkers laugh so hard. One of them commented that she didn’t know how I thought of the things I was saying so quickly. My crush also kept putting her hand on my shoulder and was nearly crying from laughter. My coworkers appeared to genuinely like and appreciate me, especially my sense of humor and one of the girls in particular constantly praised me for it. I’m also praised often for how hard of a worker I am, especially at my current job and people appear to like me for that. I’m also able to just chat and have extended, meaningful conversations with people. I did have a nearly hour long conversation with that same crush in my car once. 

Most people would say that these are good signs that people genuinely like you and want to be your friend and that women especially love men with a good sense of humor, but I’m just not seeing it. While my coworkers all outwardly appeared to like me did they ask me to hang out? No. They certainly hung out with each other outside of work and got in romantic relationships with each other, but not me. I’m always the afterthought. People will say that I need to take initiative and be the one asking to hang out/go on dates, but think of it this way: If you’re socializing with people then ~50% of the time you should be the one who is being asked out. What does that tell you? That if I’m going to have a social life it’s gonna be me initiating 99% of the time. If I’m the one initiating 99% of the time then do you honestly think people genuinely like me that much. No. I’m just an afterthought to people. I’m practically nothing to them. People use me for amusement and work and that’s it. I’d like to know how this isn’t true because I really can’t feel going on like this. I won’t survive the next 5-10 years if it does, at least I really hope I don’t. I hate being alive so much. I hate myself so much. I wish I wasn’t an abnormal. I barely feel human anymore. I just want to be a normal human being. "
826,1,"Lately, the loneliness has really been wearing down on me, and I can't help but feel like nobody would even notice if I were gone. I don't even necessarily mean if I leave existence but if I were to up and go off grid, I don't think anyone would feel my absence, and it's honestly just a devastating feeling. I don't know why, but it hit out of nowhere tonight, where I was just looking at my cat and this wave of sadness washed over me, realizing that she's the only love I have in my life right now. I try to help others and make my friends feel valid and cared for, but when nothing bad is happening or we aren't playing games, nobody reaches out or seems all that enthused to get a message from me.

I know, loneliness is a tale as old as time, and I'm no different from anyone else struggling with this deep abyss in their hearts, but I would just appreciate getting to chat with someone for a little while to at least feel a little less invisible.

Anyway, I'm in therapy/group therapy, and I'm working on things, but a kind voice is what I'm looking for at the moment. Either messaging or vc via Discord would be great.

And if it's at all relevant, I'm 25.

Thanks for reading."

828,1,"I wish I could request a hug. 

Had a tough conversation with the person I've been dating for the last few months. I'm not sure where we're headed next and I'm feeling pretty crushed today about it.

I have very few friends where I currently live and missing my ones back home a lot. It just feels like a lot of compounding things. 

I could just used a kind voice, a listening ear. Just crying a lot today. "
829,2,"hi, i'm sorry 16f here. I don;t know why but a lot just hit me today and i feel so miserable i dont know what to do. im not good in school and my parents are so hardworking and give me so many opportunities yet i keep wasting them. all they ask of me is to study well but i cant even do that.

 im the angry sibling and a below-than-average student. both my siblings do better than i do and it's so obvious that my parents favour them over me. my mom once told me that the only reason i was put on this earth was to make everyone's life miserable and my sister told me that world would be better off without me. i've been closer to ending my life this month than i've ever been in my entire life.

 yesterday, me and my sister were both unwell (we kept throwing up and couldn't even keep water down, i almost passed out as well) we went to urgent care and the entire time we were there, both my parents only stayed by my sisters bed. even when i called them to talk to them, they kept dismissing me and turning back to my sister. i was alone the entire time even when the doctors injected the medicine and iv. it's like they couldnt stand to be near me. my brother called and he stayed on call with me which made me feel better but i really just wanted my mom. it's like she barely cared that i was sick. my sister is younger and i understand that is cause for more concern but i felt so bitter about it. 

i feel terrible about myself and hate the way i look and the way i am. i don't know how to change but i just know i can never be better. i keep making the same mistakes over and over again and i can't remember a time i haven't absolutely hated myself.

i keep lying about stuff or just keep everything to myself because i dont want anyone to worry about me but i kind of wish someone cared. i know it's my own fault -  i can't say there's nothing wrong and expect people to figure out that it's not true. sometimes instead of just lying about being fine, i even make up stuff about being happy just so nobbody suspects anything.

 i've been having a lot of panic/anxiety attacks recently and i know it's because i haven't been studying and have exams coming up, but i can't bring myself to open a book. it feels like everyone is doing better than i am. everyone is ahead of me and are working harder and i feel so stupid and lazy.

it's so hard for me to talk about myself to other people because i feel so attention-seeking and disingenuine. anyone i could possibly open up to, already has too much on their plate and don't need to add my whining to the mix of their actual, real problems. 

I so badly want someone to notice but i want nothing more than to be left alone. it's so tiring to talk to literally anybody and i can't handle that. i just want to be alone but i also hate feeling like nobody cares.

I'm almost positive i have imposter syndrome, i feel every symptom to a bone-deep level but i feel like it's a stupid thing for me to complain about. i don't feel ""unique"" in any of my struggles - or you could say that i don't struggle with anything that nobody else in my social struggle also doesn't struggle with. so it feels pointless to even try.

please i don;t want to hear anything nice about me in particular but just something hopeful. please someone just tell me it will get better."

839,1,"Hi everyone. I'm not one to normally do this sort of thing, but I imagine it's why people come here. 
My name, as mentioned, is Duckie. I'm 27f living in Alabama. 
Let's just get on with it... I'm struggling... Obviously 
My life is...a mess. If you're reading this, to you guys I'd like to lay myself bare anonymously in this space. If you have any questions, comments, criticism or advice. I'd love to hear it. 
Something is happening and I can't quite figure it out. 
I want desperately to be a good person and... I think I am. I try to be there for people and I try to help where I can. I'd give my last if someone were truly in need more than me and I feel that I do. 
But...I'm not so sure of anything anymore...

I was diagnosed with ADHD at a very young age. I fought the medicine in the early 2000's. My reasoning was it made me feel like I was a zombie. Classic, really. But my parents...well my biological ones anyway... I want to be-little it and say ""I wasn't really their priority."" , but in the interest of brute honesty, I'll say my truth which is that my childhood is 70% blocked out. I don't remember much from that hell. 

Needless to say the medicine was also not a priority. Surviving was it. My biological mother was/is a addict. (Hence referred to as Carrie) Carrie was a vapid narcissist and my biological father (Mike) was often no where to be found as an active gang member (or so he said) and drug dealer (of which he bragged). My childhood isn't really something I get to talk about with others, whether it's because I just don't know who I was as a kid (like literally the recollection of being young, the access seems restricted or just not saved at all) or it just...it really genuinely breaks people's hearts to listen to. I have a lot of shame in it...I don't fully understand what happened and so I question where I got certain quirks or traits from. It's all very confusing if you catch my drift and most importantly, extremely unnerving at times. 

The abuse caused CPTSD, of which there was a bounty. I don't like to just sit and talk about it, but my step father was Manic Depressive (Jason, that's his actual name, but like fuck em' ya know?) The name Jason used to strike disgust in my heart, no...fear. Like a literal trigger

""Jason"" from across a room and I would start checking to make sure it wasn't him. Even while he was in prison. He used to come down the hall laughing when I was in trouble or misbehaved slapping a belt on his palm, jabbing at me that I couldn't hide... I try not to think about the pain and the screams, but they haunt me in my dreams. My mother, was either the one sending him after such a ""hateful"" child or she was the victim too. 

I wish I was exaggerating this bit... It seems like it came right out of movie...but it's my memory. 

I was with Carrie and Jason until I was about 10 years old. The cops came to bust them and they ran to the back room and told me to say ""They went out the back."" 
The night before Jason had dragged me by my hair into the living room to beat me in front of company because I did something... I don't remember what.
But these adults did nothing. They just watched like they were scared too. 
But when the police came through the door the next day.. I pointed right at them. I wanted out. I thought... I was convinced Jason was gonna kill me one day and I hated them both. I have a lot of guilt about the hatred I felt for them both. 

I know now they were very sick people. I also understand I did nothing wrong by ""betraying"" her (Carrie). She always told me ""If you leave me, I won't be around long after. And I gave her up knowing that might be the stone cold truth. 
Anyway. So there's a bit of my history. (Again, I welcome questions)

Through all of this, Aunt (Barbara) was desperately trying to save me. Even as young as she was. (She is now 40,f I believe please don't come at me. I have the memory of a goldfish and I don't feel like fact checking it's either 40 or 41) 

She tried and tried but CPS/DHR was not cooperating in such a small town where Jason's cousin was the police chief. They all just saw more trailer Park drama. I always wanted her to be my mother and once she had me....
I think I ruined it. I got it a toxic relationship in highschool and moved in with them... I think I threw away the life I waited so long for. I didn't mean to. I thought... I thought they saw me as stained or tarnished because they were so careful with me, strict, I felt suffocated and like I was my mother's burden. I was broken now. It was too late for me and I should just get out of this house where I'm causing so much stress. 

And I thought it was them... But now.. I'm starting to think, maybe I'm not as good a person as I thought. 

My ADHD, CPTSD and Chronic Depression have all been diagnosed, but I've never been stable enough to maintain treatment and I have all this guilt. 
I want to be better...
There are so many things... I want to tell you all of them. I want to, but God the mountain of shit is so...it's huge

I had a daughter at 21yrs old. The father is your typical he was there for a year and then opted out deadbeat. But...I didn't take good care of her. I went to jail for child endangerment for a night. 

I never wanted to be a mother. But my closest grandfather passed two days before I found out I was pregnant on the night of his funeral and my brain did the whole ""a life reborn thing"". 
So I decided to try to be a mother. Maybe I could after all. But when I was pregnant... I hated it. I was miserable. And then she was born and I came to from my C-section with this precious little girl in my arms ... And at first... I wondered whose baby this was (Because drugs) then after a moment I realized she was mine...and I felt my heart sink... I never even had a mom...how in the fuck was I supposed to be one? And the father wasn't there, just my adopted parents and brother... And I loved her. I just... I was terrified of her.

""Get her as far away from me as possible so I don't hurt her."" Said my brain.
I wanted to disappear. But then I'd laid my own trap, because I had to do for her what my mom didn't for me. 
She deserved a family and stability and so for the next year I tried...and failed miserably. I had left the father 6months into the pregnancy and went back to try and make her family work three months after she was born. And I somehow found myself at the whim of the father in this shitty little house. But I didn't want Barbara having to support us both... I wanted to be it. But then the night came where DHR was called and there was so much weed all over the place. I used it to treat my PTSD. Or at least that was my excuse. 
But let me confess. I was not a good mother. I had a short temper and I just ... I wasn't her mother... Like imposter syndrome. I drank...a lot.

I'm glad whoever called did... I deserved worse than I got... But when I looked at my life... I decided to give her to Barbara. My adopted mom is very successful and stable and my family is a huge network of support. 

I've just never either had that support or just don't know how to accept or navigate it. 
But now my daughter is my sister. Where I was never fully adopted with paperwork, she was within about 2-3 yrs. (I do get in my feelings about that but I know that it is not personal I was 16 by the time they could adopt me and my adopted parents were much better off once they divorced my senior year it just wasn't feasible at the time) 

But she does not remember living with me. I went to jail the night before her 1st bday party and was bailed out to go the next day. Everyone knew... It was the most shameful day of my life... That was the last night I ever was truly her mother...  My heart man... That shit hurts... But she deserved better and I wasn't it. So we talk to the social worker and I didn't want her in the in-between. Her first memories of a mother who can't take of her. 

The best solution was .... I didn't want kids
.. Right?... Loving her so much... It hurts, like physically, in my chest. When the maternal part of me wakes up every now and then. It's honestly crippling, a pain I can't describe. We're sisters now. She's 6 and I'm 27. We have a beautiful relationship and she knows she came from my belly and then I gave her to Mama because Mama couldn't have anymore babies. But I think I see it in her sometimes, how close we are and how much she misses me in between my (most of the time ) several visits a week for dinner or sleepovers. 

But the question of ""Should I have .."" in this case is not an option.
I did for her what my mom didn't. I admitted I wasn't enough and I chose better for her. That's what I tell myself.

I love my family...but I feel a wall in between us.. Maybe that's me.. idk
At the moment I can't afford treatment and I feel like... Because of my life this far... I used up all my help or something...
 Like they saved me and I left them. 
I had a daughter and failed as a mother. 
Don't even get me started on my mess of a marriage....
You guys ... It's all so much. This pain... *catches breathe* I don't want to be a victim. I'm not here because I want you to read my sad story and say ""Woe is Duckie""

Recently people have described a change in me. I feel I'm losing the ability to control my thoughts or actions even though I'm trying desperately to walk the right path... This pain. It hurts to get too happy. It hurts when I feel intense love. It hurts to feel deeply passionate. I cry when I see my little sister and I'm proud. It hurts when I feel close to my mom like I'm scared all the time. And I feel crazy because... I don't want it to hurt and people are careful around me now. Like they don't engage in conversation with me as much and I honestly can't blame them. 

So the thing that has been described is...for some reason I get defensive or I'm overly confident. 
I don't notice it. Not that I'm not trying, but it isn't till someone tells me that I notice and sometimes not even then. They say ""I know you don't mean to be and and when you're corrected, you're accepting of that, it's how you present the information like its fact, it leaves little room for anyone else to be right or comment when you have such strong opinions.""
I hear that and I want to fix it...but how? 

They say ""It seems like a coping mechanism you've developed recently.""
And as you can see above. There's a lot of things that go on in my life and I just... 

I feel really defeated guys. I think I may have a severe version of ADHD and it's getting...worse? 
The CPTSD is a nightmare and I feel like...an alien. Like I came from a different planet and I'll never be quite right. 

The way I type and stuff I can come across as all this is manageable or I'm aware. But I don't feel like I am and I'm really crushed honestly. I'm considering in patient treatment for a while. Like maybe I just need to go and focus on that for a while? But then that feels too much. This post is so long and if you've made it to the end, sincerely thank you for listening. It means the world to me. But I'm just here to admit I'm really scared and my heart hurts really bad... I am an open book, any help is greatly appreciated. 

I'm open to DM's or just conversation here. I don't have anything to hide and with my attention being kinda rough, I'd prefer here to keep track as just one topic if that makes sense. I hope that's alright.

~ Much Love, Duckie  "
840,2,"What the title says. Would appreciate it if i could talk about my issues with someone via private chat. To just open up and lay out all my issues. Coming here because I don’t really have anyone i can genuinely and fully open up to about this. Things have been getting worse lately, with my anxiety issues really affecting me daily and my newly attained anxiety attacks which have also sucked and which i’ve never had before this, and am not sure how to deal with (though ive heard they’re different from panic attacks?). 

Thanks for listening in advance. "
841,2,"Hi i have too many anxiety related issues like an a dog bite or an an a snake bite like in future i am not safe cancer,multiple sclerosis a lot of anxiety my exam issue and all of that is somone is there who can listen me "
842,3,"Today is pretty stressful. Now I'm struggling to sleep with these worrying thoughts. I need someone to wish me good night to sleep. Sorry this is a bit odd. I don't know what about it that makes me instantly sleepy. I just need one little notification. 

and please no dms.

edit: thank you lovely people, I had a good night's rest"
843,1,"Hi, I'm going through an ongoing problem right now. I don't have anyone I can talk to about it. I need support, I need advice, I just need someone to talk to, someone who I can give my thoughts to.

I need to find someone I can continually talk to, who can come to understand me and my situation. They don't need to act as a ""therapist"", this can be a reciprocal friendly relationship. But I just need someone to talk to.

I won't go into the situation here, but it results in me making bad decisions. I'm not looking for someone who will just judge. 

Discord is best for me to talk on. Thank you for just reading this, I appreciate the time even if you don't DM."
844,1,"This is my first post. 

Recently my best friend (F) got married. I'm haapy that she found someone. But, at the same time feeling sad that the bond we share before ever we used text everyday, and share eveything even it is good or bad will be changed since she got husband who can she share everything now. I know priorities changes, but upto what limit. I want to her to be in my life as well as she wants me to be in life no matter as her friend who supports her. 

This is sucking up my mentally and emotionally. 

If anyone had similar experience how did you overcome? "
845,1,"I wish I could explain why, it what I'm looking for. Too many sleepless nights lately. Maybe it's the dark and cold of winter, maybe aging is scaring me. It's certainly uncertainty about the future, not so much me but especially my daughter. 

I guess I just would like to have someone to talk to for a change that just doesn't know me, no preconceived ideas, no assumptions. Just honesty and impartiality. 

I hope that makes sense. I always valued my interactions on here in the past, but I've never gone looking before. 

Anyway thanks for taking the time to read. I'll likely snap it of it and get embarrassed by this post and delete it haha. Until then though please, say hello if you like. Who knows maybe we're future best friends."
846,0,I am trying to find people who feel that deep emotions are important and can accept a person who feels sadness…
847,2,"24F. Was waiting for the elevator in my apartment building lobby when a man I have to assume was in his 40s or 50s started to make small talk. He seemed nice enough so I engaged but when he asked in passing if I lived alone I didn't think twice before I said yes 😭. I know it was so stupid but now I'm terrified it means something is going to happen to me since he knows I live alone. He was perfectly nice and didn't otherwise come off as creepy (and knows I'm in law school, unsure if that comes off as intimidating lol). But I have PTSD from a handful of near-murderer experiences (school shooting, and later a crazy housemate) and I cant talk myself down at all. I feel so so stupid. He knows what floor I live on too because I assume he saw what button I pressed. "
848,0,"Hello everyone!
Like the title says, I (22F) am a compulsive liar who is ready to come clean and do better. As far as I can remember, ever since my early teens I have been making up wild stories or 'facts' about myself which weren't true. It started as just funny stories about things that happened to me that day, which didn't, but did get laughs from people around me. Later, it turned into more 'facts' or 'qualities' about me which I did not even (fully) possess. Many lies were one offs, but I have been lying for a long time about two things in particular: my parents' ethnicity and being vegetarian. The big irony about the latter lie is that I now actually do live as a vegetarian for a while.

I never saw my lies as harmful, as I had convinced myself that I wasn't telling any 'hurtful' lies or lies that 'affected others' in my own eyes, but now I see that hurting my friends' trust is harmful enough on its own. Although, I realise that many of my friends probably do, and always have, suspected that I am telling these lies. About quite a few of the one off lies I have already come clean, and my friends have been really accepting and not really shocked. I am realy grateful for the response they have given me so far, but I have yet to come clean about my two bigger lies and the fact that I clearly have a lying problem. I have told my current partner about all of this, and they have been very supportive and accepting of me as well. I am so infinitely grateful to them and they are honestly the reason I believe there is still good in me. Them and their support is a huge motivation for me to do better, and keep doing better for real this time. No more lies, ever, not even excuses for past lies. I want to be 100% strict and realistic with myself.

Why I did this? I am not fully certain myself. I feel like, as cliche as it sounds, I was chasing after a feeling of attention or belonging which I wasn't receiving at home, as my home situation during my teens was pretty unstable. I don't want to delve into any details on this, as I am not trying to justify my actions or attempting to gain sympathy points in any way. This is my first time in therapy and I haven't discussed the compulsive lying with my therapist yet, as obviously there is a lot in my childhood to work through and to be honest I am still gathering the courage to air out the worst of my lies. I feel like there are so many other things about me which are really weird as well, making this feel like 'too much'.

I know that in the coming time I will need to come clean about these lies with my therapist and my friends. I am quite nervous at the prospect of having this information about my lying problem 'out there'. I know that it's very possible that people may see me as nothing but a liar, and it hurts that, at the moment, they would be right. I am not writing this because I want sympathy from them, because I am very aware that this is the hole I have dug for myself and people (especially those I have lied to) are entitled to their reactions, whatever they may be. I just want some hope that I can become better. That 'this' doesn't have to be all that I am for the rest of my life/I will never be trusted again. Regardless, I am going to do better because keeping up with the lies is not an option. At the moment though, it is weighing on me quite heavily and any advice is welcome. How can I really do and become better? Is there anyone who has been through something like this and can share any insights? Am I as doomed as I feel I am?

Kind regards"

So basically I have two cars that run but one of them is on its last legs and needs a lot of work. The other one runs good the only thing with it is when I go on the interstate to get to school and go over 60 the back of my car feels like it's swerving. So my plan is to try to get my kia that is on its last gets get it fixed up as much as possible starting with the cheapest stuff first and as the year goes on the more expensive stuff. And once I get my kia to where I am not terrified to drive it get rid of my nissan or at least use it till the transmission goes out and take either Uber Lyft or an ethra bus (Only public transportation in my area) until I can put a hefty down payment on another car due to my poor credit right now

862,2,"I'll start by saying, when I was younger, my brother was abusive to me, physically, emotinally, and would be threatening to me, and even though that's a long time ago, when I was 11-12 years old. He has not apologized.

But, later my brother started being with a girl and married who is as bad as he was.

She would make sexual harassing comments to me, asking me if I was having sex in front of others and laugh at me. She did this same thing maybe 200, to 300 times over the years.

My older brother would sit there and giggle.

Then one day my cousins were over, and my dad was angry at me for a verbal argument, and decided to push me with his head and try to threaten to hit me with things.

I stayed at my brothers for 2 weeks, and told him my plans to leave the state, because of my dads behavior, and also ironically cuz of his wife's which I didn't tell him.

My brother told me on the last day I can't stay anymore and I need to go home or find somewhere to go, and they both mocked me for not wanting to go home saying how I chose not to.

I left the state for 2 years, I was in Florida with my uncle, and I was doing better.

My uncle told me I should go back home to get my license to which I refused since I knew I had been protecting myself from abuse.

But, he said okay we will get you a place to stay.

When I got to New York the place was dirty. I was scared to go home and didn't leave until 7 weeks later.

I feel it's my fault for not leaving the dirty apartment. Is it my fault?

I been back home 1 year and 3 months.

I have completely stopped talking to my brother and sister in law: and my dad has changed his ways, but I barely talk to my dad but I have to live with him.

Did I fuck up? Or was I right to wait? Idk if I messed up in the apartment situation."
863,1,"You know, tears... they fall continuously, but they are hindered by my mustache, not reaching my lips. So, that I couldn't taste 'em all at once. My life too, doesn't drown me at once. But a little bit of them still gradually seeps down my mustache. And their taste is really saline. Reminding me gradually of the salt in my wounds... Slow tears, slow pain. 

I don’t know what to say. And maybe that’s the saddest part of all.  Today, I walked into a class for something—just a simple meeting, nothing grand, nothing extraordinary. But behind my back, they whispered, they laughed, they branded me with a label I never asked for. “Gay,” they called me. And I tell you, it wasn’t the word itself that stung. It was the way they said it—the mockery, the sneers, the sheer pleasure they took in tearing me down. You’d think a heart like mine would be made of stone by now, but it isn’t. No, sir. It’s still as breakable as a windowpane in a hailstorm. And today, it shattered again.  

Now, don’t get me wrong. I know what they’ll say—“Be mature, ignore them, rise above it.” And by all means, I would, if I could. But let me tell you something about the back of a man’s heart. It’s where the truth lives, and my truth is this—I am insecure as hell. I am short. But I think—no, I hope—I look good too. And yet, when words like these are thrown at me, I start questioning everything. If they’re right, then what am I? A short, strange-looking outcast with no real friends, no respect, no chance at love? A walking target for betrayal? I know I shouldn’t be so damned pessimistic, but you have to understand—when you’ve spent enough nights talking yourself out of the dark, you start to wonder if there’s any light left at all.  

I do it all myself. Every time I fall, I pull myself up. There’s no hand to reach for me, no arms to wrap around me and say, “It’s okay, you’re not alone.” No reassurance, no comfort, just me and my own reflection in the mirror, trying to convince myself that I’m enough. And I swear, some days, it’s the hardest battle I ever fight.  

This world is not fair to me. But I know—I know—I’m not the only one. There are others, just like me, stumbling through the same storm, looking for shelter in a world that would rather throw stones. And I keep thinking, the answer to all this misery—it has to be love, doesn’t it? Love is the most powerful thing a man can give, and yet, we hoard it like gold and spend our time throwing dirt instead. Why? Why do people choose to hate when love is right there, waiting to be given?  

I don’t have the power to change them. Not today, not tomorrow, maybe not ever. But damn it, it hurts to be overlooked. To be unseen, unheard. I tell myself I don’t need their validation, but the truth? The truth is, every man needs a little kindness, a little encouragement, a little proof that he matters. And yet, they won’t stop for me. They won’t acknowledge me. They won’t admit that maybe, just maybe, I’ve got something good inside of me.  

And maybe—just maybe—they’ll finally admit it when I’m gone.  But tell me, what’s the use then? What’s the good in being loved when you’re no longer there to feel it? Couldn’t you—just for once—do it now? While I’m still here, dying for a little kindness?

864,2,"Just putting my feels on words to get them out, but if someone has some kind words for me I will be happy.

I have been double working since November. I want to quit my old job but am afraid to in case the new job does not last.

Been at the old one for 6 years now and it is 80% good, but one task and one co-worker just keeps me down. Changing tasks is not an option, I asked. Also, there is no chance to grow, and there have been no raises in the last 3 years.

New job as a content mod pays better, it is less work, easier work, more benefits, and has better hours. But my anxiety is making me wary that it may not last.   
  
I believe they may have hired more people than they needed for the task (6 where 4 would do), and sometimes we clear our queue of work by Wednesday, and Thursday and Friday are easier, where we  refresh the queues every couple minutes to see new entries to moderate. I am the sole responsible for handling appeals right now, so that's something to give confidence, but still...

Is it normal for companies to let people go under a year after hiring? Are WFH content moderation positions usually like this? This is my first experience in the field.

Maybe I am just overthinking too much?

TLDR, my fear is that I leave my old job after 6 and a half years just for the new one to not last until the end of the year, and I find myself jobless. No particular indication of that happening tho...

The plan now is to carry on double working until July, save some money, then kit old job if the new one is still going strong.

Not the worse situation of the world, I know, but I am still hitting myself over it...

Anyway, good night everyone, hope everything is good and keeps getting better for anyone who reads this."

866,0,"**Preface:** Despite the title, my aim isn't solely, ""looking for people to talk to,"" though I would certainly enjoy the conversation and absolutely won't bite if you approach. Rather, my aim with this post is to put my life, emotions and some introspection out there completely as a vent for myself but also in the off-chance that someone is able to relate to something here. I will accomplish the former but may never know the latter. And that's okay, it's not my place. Nevertheless, I will hope.

Finally, this will be a lengthy post, a lot of it being exposition. If *you*—a stranger—are willing to take a journey with *me*—also a stranger—through the depths of my human condition, then I acknowledge your time spent on this post, and I give you my sincerest thanks for that.

Let's get started.

**Parents/Childhood Years (0-13)**

I think the most appropriate place to start is with how I viewed my parents growing up, since I am, in large part, a product of their parenting. I grew up in a predominantly non-denominational (which *really* means 'Baptist') Christian household. My mother was the conservative parent who did her best to teach me Christian values: she would pray with me every morning, before meals, and at night. She would take me to church every Sunday and put me through a Christian, private school education from K-12, then through a 4-year program at uni. 

The money for this came entirely from her father (who passed when I was \~5). I was told that he made some very smart investment choices and that he split this money between my mother and my uncle under the condition that it be used solely for their kids' education. Any mother could've taken that money and spent it some other way. But she didn't. She kept to my grandfather's promise.

In terms of work, my mother was an RN. From what I remember growing up (which is fuzzy), she used to work hospice. As such, she wasn't around too much before I started school. When I started school though, she wound up getting a remote job so she was able to be much more present in my life.

With all of this came an overprotective side. Throughout my childhood, I often times wasn't allowed to play with the kids (literally) down the street because, ""it was too far from view"" and, ""they're too rough"". I did play a lot with the kids next door, though, but the restriction was always in the back of my mind. What I was allowed to watch on TV was restricted pretty much to the Disney channel and Nickelodeon. Cartoon Network was ""too violent"" depending on the show. Video games I could play were restricted to ""E"" rating. I was never allowed to swim at the deep end of any pools (where practically *everyone* swam).  I could go on, but this should give you the gist: she was overprotective but not to an extreme extent.

Growing up, I always despised her for her overprotectiveness as I felt it robbed me of a lot of opportunities to build friendships by being just like the others (she would often times try to get me to go out and play or go to social events, but then add caveats that often turned a ""fun time"" into a ""safe time""... *embarrassing).* However, I understand where she was coming from with everything she did. She truly did her best to raise me to be a polite, respectful, God-fearing individual and feared for the safety of her only son. Was she perfect? *No.* But I don't think anyone can be a perfect parent. Even if it were possible, a child may still grow with repressed issues/trauma unrelated to the parents. She did damage, but I don't hold it against her anymore.



Onto my father, he was the polar opposite of my mother: not as strict or conservative. Took a more laidback (but not absent) approach to parenting. Before I was born, I was told that my father owned his own tooling/injection molding company, having never graduated high school. Right before I was born, he had to sell the business as overseas products/labor were becoming the cheaper, more appealing option. However, he had enough money to retire reasonably comfortably.

(I should mention at this point that the age gap between my parents is... *not negligible.* My mother had me in her early 30's whereas my father was in his mid 50's).

As a result, I had a stay-at-home dad. He would always make sure I was cared for in between all of his side projects in the garage (he was always working on his truck, motorcycle, or the occasional woodworking/house renovation project). Getting older, if I wanted something that my mother wouldn't allow (out of overprotectiveness), my father advocated for me with rational argumentation and softened her up on a few accounts, often times buying me a game or letting me do something without restriction just like everyone else. As a juxtaposition to my mother's attitude of trying to get me to go out and ""have a safe time"", my father was of the mind that, ""If he wants to come out and do something, he'll do it"". Like my mother, I love him to death (pun intended—he's dead). Was he perfect? *No.* Did he do his best? Absolutely. I hold nothing against him.



Finally, with the backdrop fleshed out, I can speak on my childhood.

I spent most of my childhood alone wanting to do nothing else but play video games because I was too socially anxious as a result of overprotective restrictions and looking (think bowl cut and baggy jeans). For me, video games were a realm of control and a place where I could feel like a hero. I didn't have to talk to anyone and therefore be subjected to their many possible judgments of me. It felt good beating games because it validated an identity of intelligence that was instilled into me throughout school. Video games made me feel *good* and feel *good at something*.

Unfortunately, there were consequences.

Because I never wanted to go out due to social anxiety/judgment fears, I never truly learned how to make connections with people. In school, I noticed that the funny kids were the popular ones, so I tried to imitate them. Rather than getting results, I more often than not came across as annoying to my peers. I was never truly ""bullied"" per se. But I could feel a constant sense of being ostracized. People often wouldn't go out of their way to talk or hang out with me. I always had to initiate. Unless, of course, we were partnering up for some kind of class exercise. Then *eeeveryone* wanted to be with the ""smart kid"". It gave me my moments in the spotlight, but like everything else in life it quickly fades. Except for the developed habit that made me want to chase that spotlight. *That didn't fade.*

Throw all this in the melting pot and now you have a kid entering high school who has no idea how to form connections with others (and furthermore is quite narcissistic), is socially anxious, looks and acts awkward, and whose only identity/worth comes from their intelligence (which *totally* won't go to their head and cause more problems later).

  
**High School/College Years (14-22)**

  
The header for this section is misleading. *Yes,* these are my high school and college years, but what dominated these years of my life were, above anything else: love, the hard lessons it brings to naive people and the consequences of conflating your worth with your love life.

In my sophomore year of high school, I made some minor changes to my image. Biggest being that I upgraded from a bowl-cut to looking like Jim Carey from *Dumb and Dumber.* ""At least people can see my face."" I thought. I also swapped from glasses to contact lenses (need for distance). So, while I still looked awkward, I didn't look *as* awkward. My sense of clothing style was still abysmal: Baggy jeans, oversized t-shirts (because it felt shameful to admit I was a size small, so size medium felt more soothing to my ego) and off-brand shoes straight from your local Payless. Often I would wear cargo shorts more than the baggy jeans because they looked somewhat more normal—except when I stubbornly worn them throughout winter and looked well out of place.

So, new year of high school, new me. In my sophomore year, I fell in love with a girl who fell in love with me. Not using her real name (good luck guessing, though), I'll refer to her as ""L"". My relationship with ""L"" lasted about 3 years, and we put each other through *hell*. Without going into every single detail (we would be here awhile), I was a controlling and manipulative narcissist towards her, and our relationship was built on nothing but the desire for sex. She wasn't entirely who I wanted in a person (very clingy, always had to be by her side. Couldn't focus on my own hobbies/homework without being guilted out of it), but I couldn't realize that at the time and nor would I have accepted it if it were told to me. So instead of trying to directly communicate with her and express things that I don't like in a healthy manner, I instead would go into depressive bouts, tell her that I wasn't sure if I wanted to be in a relationship anymore and then said that I needed space to think. This, of course, would always devastate her (which validated my sense of belonging/fitting in somewhere), and instead of going off and ""thinking about the relationship"", I would just fantasize about being with another girl in my class. I would then realize that such a fantasy is impossible, get even sadder for about a day, and then come back to my relationship saying, ""Hey, we're all good now. No worries. I promise I'll always love you and do my best moving forward.""

I did not do my best moving forward. That cycle continued for 3 years. In that time, I cheated on her with another girl from another group outside of school. I confessed roughly a year later, and that almost ended things. I vowed to do better and she set her terms, but we would never be able to rebuild that trust again. I still always fantasized about other girls in our class or college (We went long distance for about a year and a half as I went out of state for uni) and always kept her on the ""emotional fence"", as I've come to call it. Eventually, come the finals week of sophomore year of college, I find out she's cheating on me with someone whose kids she used to babysit.

She ended things for good once I found out. Needless to say, I got what I deserved—but I still had the *audacity* to point the finger at her without realizing how many were pointed at myself.

(by this point I should mention that, regarding my fashion sense, I had a friend from high school help me out before I went into college and they really helped me develop a sense of style. No more baggy jeans or oversized t-shirts. Everything is to size and I looked/felt somewhat normal, woo!)

My next relationship came junior year of college with ""A"" (common name, you'd probably guess on the first try). Wasn't a very long one, only about 2 months. I hadn't actually learned any lessons from my time with L as I simply distracted myself by venting, playing games and working on other hobbies without ever taking a moment to introspect. The only thing I learned was that I was incredibly emotionally dependent upon L and that dependency replaced the entirety of my identity (which, bear in mind, I never really had because I spent all my times growing up *not going out*). I identified my problem, outwardly pretended to handle the problem, and then came back to everyone ""reformed"". In my ""reformed"" state, I subconsciously still needed to be romantically involved with someone to feel validated, and A was the type of girl who seemed like she'd never been in a relationship and carried loads of insecurities. So going for her was easy.

Then I quickly realized that her personality, while being kind and sweet, was pretty cringe for me. Such to the point where I withdrew from the relationship almost immediately and formulated how I was going to break up with her. Problem was, I couldn't find out how to do it without looking like an asshole, because then that would potentially ruin my chance with future prospects. But before I could find a way, she confronted me on the ordeal, and I had to break up with her then and there. 

The only lesson I learned there was to slow down. Took crushing a girl's heart just to learn that fact.

Last relationship was with ""E"" (you're not getting this one *at all*). Senior year of college, few months before graduation. I had known her since freshman year and, since then, had my eyes on her despite being in relationships with L and A. E was, in my mind, the most attractive person I'd ever laid eyes on both mentally and physically. Her personality was abrasive and sarcastic (as was mine), so she knew how to be witty and give some pushback. But she also knew how to temper that with a side of sincere kindness and attentiveness, with an incredible amount of emotional maturity. Driving her one January night in heavy snow to a dance rehearsal she was heading, I asked her if she would want to go out on a date, and I will never, *ever* forget the way she looked me in the eyes and said, ""Yes"". It was the kind of affirmation that came with both present thought and forethought, as though she had been waiting for me to ask for some time, but also like she genuinely took the moment to process exactly what I was asking and *still* agreed. It was elation. It was bliss.

It only lasted a month...

A few weeks into the relationship, her parents decided to visit her in the town where uni was at, and E offered me to come and meet her parents over dinner. Was I ready? *No.* Did I do it? *Yes.* I felt that I had really good, stimulating conversation with her father (math nerd) and her mother (missionary), and that all had went well.

A few days later, I got a text from E asking if I could come to her dorm lounge because she was about to cry over what her parents told her. Come to find out that her mother, being somewhat narrow-minded (especially on the topic of mental health as I was told), strict and judgmental, didn't think we were a good match because I, ""was not motivated enough"". Having worked so hard over the years to build a relationship with her mother and reach a common understanding with each other, this broke E—*a lot*. We sat and brainstormed some ideas of what we could do, and concluded that it was best to tackle this head on by me reaching out to the parents to have something of a ""sit down"" about this. We formulated a plan to make it happen after graduation, and I spent the next week before preparing.

That preparation was interrupted when I received an ambiguous, ""Can you come to the lounge? We need to talk."" text. She broke up with me with the reasoning being that, considering we were graduating soon and living in different states, she didn't want me to feel restricted with career opportunities as I would essentially have to move around her area.

(I should mention that, before dating, we spent many nights over dinner discussing what our future would look like together after graduation. Given my hobbies and willingness to work anywhere, I told her I didn't mind moving in proximity to her. ""I can take my life with me wherever. There's no part of it that's constrained to where I live."" I said.)

Naturally, when this conversation happened, it came as a huge shock. So huge that I was way more calm and collected during the breakup conversation than I have ever been in my life... and then I made it to my room and broke down in front of my roommate.

  
I spent the next month in an apartment outside of campus completely alone, getting incredibly drunk every single night. During my time inebriated, I had the bright idea to send her a long-winded message telling her exactly how I felt and that I hated her and never wanted to see her again. What's worse is that, while I wrote that message drunk, I proofread *and* sent it while sober.

  
It was so easy for me to be mature and not emotionally impulsive in that situation, the way it all went down, and I still chose to go out of my way to make it worse. At this point, I closed myself off to all of my friends in college out of anger and out of a sense that I no longer identify with the religion I grew up with and therefore do not want to associate with those whom I had to convince that I did.

  
**Post-Uni (23-25)**

If you've made it this far, congratulations! We're 23/26th of the way through my life. While it may not be interesting, it's honest. And it will set the stage for where I'm at at the time of this post.

Maybe I should've mentioned this earlier, but I went to college for Mechanical Engineering (ME) and graduated with a 3.6 gpa. Why engineering? My identity lies in my intelligence, so I thought, ""What would a smart person major in?"" I like math and science *enough*, so it felt the right choice despite not having a tangible sense of what being an ME really was.

Well now it was time for the rubber to meet the road and for me to get an ME job. So what I did instead after coming home was start working in the Human Services field because Imposter Syndrome.

I had a friend who I was introduced to by a couple of my high school friends whilst I was in uni. This circle became my social circle post-uni. Everyone in the group wanted to hang out all the time, whether going out or chilling at the apartment. It was always a fun time and I felt like this was a group of people I could truly, for the first time in my life, bond with. Problem is, I didn't know how. I was present, involved, and felt included in the group, but I never felt *connected* with them. I struggled to figure out why, but that's a tangential topic to be discussed later. 

This friend (""H"") I was introduced to happened to be management in the human services field, working in a nursing home-like setting with individuals who had developmental disabilities. I had worked as a sub in this home during my breaks from uni. Some time after coming back from uni, H, knowing my character and work ethic, offered me a position as management under him. I decided to take the opportunity, thinking it would be good management experience to put on my resume, whilst also setting my sights on taking my FE Mechanical certification exam (as I believed it would demonstrate on a resume that I was still dedicated to my degree despite not having used it yet)

I won't expound upon the roughly three years I spent in this position, as the dynamics at play are more complicated than explained here, but I will say that it drained my energy and time to the point where I hardly felt like a person anymore. Working at a 24/7 facility while being short staffed translates to long work weeks (most I've ever done in a single week was 110 hours, but typically hours varied from 50 occasionally to 80 often). Couple that with the fact that, in managing a 24/7 facility, I was on-call 24/7 for any questions/issues. Having been woken up from calls around 3-4am or on my weekends, I never learned to leave work at work. I couldn't. I didn't have a choice. And I hated it.

Nevertheless, I stuck it out and aimed to make time at work to sit down and study for my certification exam. I came up with a year-long plan to go through all of my old notes, homework and textbooks from college to prepare, and I chunked it out piece by piece in the midst of all the working. Come March 2024, I took the exam first try and passed. Was a year of studying necessary? Probably not. But I was two years out of college by the time I started and had forgotten a lot.

Unfortunately, I am beholden to a state board to review my application and make my license official. I submitted the application in April last year, and still no luck.

  
**Present (26)**

That brings me to today. Since I passed my exam, I brushed up my resume/LinkedIn and set off to find an ME job while juggling my management position. At this point, however, the work stress was bearing down greatly on me (to the point of slipping into alcohol abuse) and, despite not having a position lined up to jump into, I put in my resignation for my management position in December, telling myself, ""*Hell or high water, kiddo.""* I also let my roommate know (as I was sharing an apartment with a friend from high school for the past couple years) that I was leaving by this past December. 

As the months went by without a single call for an initial interview, I started to realize that I *wasn't* going to get a job in time. Thankfully, my parents were kind enough to let me move back in for some time while I sort things out.

So, where does that leave me at the time of this posting? Currently, I'm jobless trying to work with a four year old degree that's only getting staler and perhaps is too stale at this point for any company to want. I live with my mother and stepdad who can only offer help/advice in the context of a religion I no longer believe in. I can't bear to work a part-time position so I doordash but it's certainly not enough to stop my savings from dwindling down to nothing in slow motion. 

On the flip side, I've also been utilizing the time to self-actualize and develop better habits, like working out (which I've been doing consistently for the longest I ever have. Still pretty nascent, but I haven't given up), working on music (always been a hobby/passion of mine. Currently working on drums and guitar), journaling and reading.

But I'll be honest. The whole reason I felt the need to vent in writing this post was because I'm *still missing something.*

Developing a routine for working out and working on my passions *just isn't enough*. I can already feel myself slipping in terms of my consistency.

What I would hope is evident by all of the above and has permeated and influenced my life since I was a child was that I lack self-confidence. I simply do not have a reason to believe in myself or my abilities. The intelligence I had then is a lie now because I let it get to my head and made it my identity, but I did nothing to grow my intellect. Instead, I chose to fixate on love, mope around impulsively and play games to pass the time. My ego is protected by the shell that I call ""intellect"", and while that shell grew with age, I did not grow with it. As a result, it is largely empty and easily cracked. 

This is why I hung out with my one circle of friends post-uni. *Because I was more interested in using them to validate my false sense of intellect*. I left them silently because I was ultimately too scared to be open and vulnerable with them, because I'd never done it before with people I genuinely trusted. I was too self-absorbed and narcissistic to truly listen and engage with *them* instead of *myself*. Thus I could never have connected with them.

This is why every relationship I've had has gone sour: *because I never knew how to let a good thing breathe.* I had to choke it with every ounce of control I could muster just to feel validated with a sense of artificial worth. I had to throw tantrums when things didn't occur to my design because I grew up in a world of my own design.

Trying to go out and make connections is just utterly impossible for me. The lack of self-confidence, the fear of judgment. I can go out and have basic interactions necessary to survive. But say you put me in a purely social setting, like a bar, and you ask me to go over to someone/a group of people and start a conversation? Can't do that, chief, *no way*. I overthink everything I say, and sometimes two things try to come out at once. I can't articulate for the life of me. 

And yet I want nothing more in life right now than to make connections and gain self-confidence. I have been so utterly disgusted of myself, the things I've done and the people I've hurt. I have forgiven myself, and I believe I have learned enough from the examination of my mistakes, but find myself beholden to my fears and social anxieties such that I cannot take on new opportunities to connect with others. I have been trying so hard to find that one reason that prevails above all that is my reason for breathing. That thing that gets me up in the morning, that motivates me to better myself physically, mentally and emotionally. Because ultimately I'm tired of being a speaker. I want to be a listener. For all the times I've been helped, I want to finally start helping. And yet I don't know how one gains confidence in themselves. I don't know how one connects with others... *I really don't know.*

Despite all of this, though, I know that there are answers. Despite the flaws, despite the mistakes, despite the darker parts of my own humanity, I know there are answers.

  
If you've read through the entirety of what started as a coherent exposition of my life turned semi-cohesive vent, then you truly have my sincerest thanks. You've read through the good and bad of a complete stranger's life to-date. I... I really hope something here resonated with you. Whether you've made the same mistakes or feel the same way about yourself... or you want to get better but don't know how. You're not alone in any of that."

872,2,"i don’t even feel right posting this, but I don’t know what to do and I feel like I can’t be this open about my feelings with any of my family or friends. recently I’ve been spiraling and it’s getting so fucking bad and it’s to the point where I just spend my free time crying alone in random parts of my house and I literally just don’t know what to do anymore 

im an 18 year old guy who was homeschooled up until high school and now after school I live with my sibling and my parents, but it doesn’t even really feel like home anymore if that makes sense. it’s like I don’t know where I want to go, what I want to do, or where I could even find the feeling of “home” again. I used to have such dreams and ambitions of being rich and famous, having all of these plans laid out for my superstar career, and I never came down from my delusional high of thinking that one day id just be magically successful. so now here I am, a year after graduation, not going to college, doing nothing with my life, not having the motivation to set or follow any ambitions, and slowly losing all of my friendships I’ve made over the past 4 years until im just completely alone. i tried pursuing different hobbies, i tried opening my own goddamn business, but my lack of motivation and energy 24/7 has led that to go nowhere too, and so now not only am i a failure im also a disappointment that couldn’t commit to that either.

i can’t see myself going to college, I don’t have the money to leave home, I don’t have friends to move in with, I don’t have a partner to confide in, im really just incredibly lost and cannot find a direction again. ive even failed myself as someone who swore to stay sober and take care of my body as ive taken up a near daily habit of smoking weed to escape my inaction but it only makes it worse and it’s this repeating cycle that I can’t seem to break out of anymore. i really just want true friendships again, a true path, anything to look forward to, but I can’t seem to find it at all. at this point im too fucking scared to pursue any new friendships or to take the leap and try to make any major change in my life so im just stuck here.

anyway if you read this far thanks for taking the time to hear me vent, i don’t expect to gain much from posting this, i feel like I didn’t word all of my thoughts properly, but maybe it’ll turn out to be a good choice. thanks again."
873,1,"Recently, I finished mandatory military service in my country. And I'm kind of struggling right now, because we don't really get any meaningful benefits from it. It was a year of nothing. Before going away, I had a part time job and was in a relationship, I've neither of those things now.

I'm just pissed. I just want... I don't know, a reward? Recognition. Had I have known how easy it was to dodge the draft, I would have done it. I want a reward, I want something tangible for having to essentially waste a year.

And look, I don't want to hear anything about how that year taught me discipline or resilience. I got to go home and see my family for about five days every two months. It fucking sucked, to put it straight. I don't want to hear that I have this time now to give myself the future I want, and that I get to decide what my ""reward"" is because I reject the notion that it's my responsibility. I didn't ask to be there, they put me there, they should be the ones giving me something in return.

I'm Greek. If that gives any context "
874,2,"I got in an argument with my fiancee and I feel awful about it. It was about something so mundane and trivial (which vendor to use for our wedding) and it made her so upset that she slept on the couch. 

I felt conflicted because my brother owns a catering company but my fiancée would like to use another company because of the cost. Admittedly I got defensive and it caused resentment between us both with both of us feeling like bad guys. 

I was pretty nasty with her when she said she was just gonna pick one and go with it. I even said I was going to just cancel our new home purchase and “pack my shit and leave”. I didn’t mean this of course, and she cried all night and wouldn’t let me near her… it’s eating me up inside. I feel like such a POS and I know I fucked up big time. I just love her so much and I hate that I was so horrible.

I’m not mentally stable and I’ve been working on it with psychiatric help as well as therapy. This has taken me off the deep end and I’ve been in constant panic attacks all day. I just could use a friend. Thanks…"
875,1,"I've been working really hard for years to improve my mood, but right now I feel buried under the avalanche of grief and fear. 

It seems like all the psychotherapy and self help always starts with this basis of inherent worth, and I'm really struggling with that concept. I definitely feel like my worth is based on how well I prove it and what other people think of me. I don't assume every person I meet deserves love and compassion (though most of the ones who don't often have more than they know what to do with), and I often find myself resentful of people who aren't aware of people around them. 

I spent a lot of my childhood trying to play peacemaker by being hyper sensitive to everyone around me. 



In the last 5 years, I've lost my 3 closest friendships, 2 romantic relationships, and 2 pets. My family is distant at best and freaked out by me at worst, even though I'm a totally normal person who has a normal level of intelligence and attractiveness and a normal job. I know my life is easy which is why it's even more confounding that I tend to find it so impossibly heavy. My need for validation and comfort is unimaginable, and it's so much that I believe it's a big part of what drives people away. I have worked hard to offer this to myself, to my inner child, and it helps but I don't understand why everyone else has someone in their life to call upon when I do not. Even chatgpt keeps suggesting it like of course EVERY human has another person they can call on. I do not let people in easily, so the fact that I have lost 5 people in as many years means that I'm alone. 

  
I was on prozac for a few years and recently came off it. sure it made the sadness a little more shallow but so was the joy. I couldn't get off and I gained 15 lbs, it wasn't worth it to me to stabilize my mood. I don't think that my emotions are wrong or that I need to fix them, but I definitely need to do something if I'd like to continue to function in society. I can't keep breaking down at work because someone says ""how's it going"" and I feel like that's the first time anyone's even pretended to care about my internal world for months. 

  
I've settled with the mantra that I'm doing the best with what is currently available to me. "
876,0,we can talk about anything you want

878,2,"Hello!  Just a warning before you read this, it's going to be LONG and detailed:)

  
First, to provide some context, I am now 20 years old, and I was diagnosed with ADHD at nineteen (also already diagnosed with ASD and OCD).  I got put on 10 mg of Adderall XR at the end of 2023, and it worked great.  I stayed consistent with this dosage up until December of 2024.  I spoke with my psychiatrist and mentioned how I noticed the effectiveness of the medication going down on/around my period.  She suggested that we up it to 20 mg (still XR), and now it has been about a month and a half of me taking it.

  
I feel like this increase in dosage has been LIFE-CHANGING in the best way possible.  It lasts longer in my system, I feel twice as productive, and when I've gotten my period, I notice that I'm not as distracted and unmotivated as I was previously.  I still feel like myself, just a version that's more organized, happier, and way less anxiety/overthinking.  It's like it has calmed my system to the point that I now understand what being non-ADHD is like (to an extent, of course).

  
Another factor that I feel has contributed to my overall improvement is deleting my social media.  I deleted everything, and I only use Reddit now to look for advice (like right now).  I originally deleted all of the apps on 12/29, and I've surprisingly kept my word (probably thanks to the Adderall helping my attention span).  I've have previously never been able to keep myself off social media this long before I simply could not handle the lack of stimulation and immediately got it all back.

  
Since deleting social media, I've kept a journal to track how I feel mentally and how I'm doing.  The biggest difference I've noticed is that if I do try to scroll (watching tiktoks with friends, scrolling through Pinterest, even), I become SO overwhelmed with the amount of stimulation coming at me, whereas before, I was totally numb to it.

  
I've also noticed that I'm able to sit and ""do nothing"" now, which basically means that I'm able to sit with my thoughts and let myself be ""bored"" without always being glued to my phone.  However, this is where the anxiety comes in:  I was so proud of myself for finally starting the journey to ""de-brain rot"" myself, and now I'm starting to wonder if it really is just the Adderall, and not ME.

  
I'm also starting to feel anxious because of my lack of anxiety (ironic).  I overthink way less, I have basically zero social anxiety, I have somewhat of an attention span now, and I feel like one of those hippie dudes that are like ""just go with the flow man"".  Because I am genuinely just so content with myself.  I'm terrified of going back to the way I used to feel, which was anxious, depressed, exhausted, bored, the list goes on.

  
There are TONS of other little things I could go into that have improved, but I think y'all get the point here.  Anyway, I'm saying all this because I want to know if anyone else has experienced what I just explained, and basically how to ""stay"" this way.  I feel like I've made an insane amount of progress with my mental health in such a short time, and I can't imagine how upset I'd be if the feeling of existential doom comes creeping back.

  
Also, I'd like everyone's opinions on how much the Adderall/deleting socials has contributed to this mental 180.  If I stopped taking Adderall, would I be phone addicted again?  Thank you soooo much for reading :D"

883,1,"Hi, my name is Olivia and I'm 22. I was born in a sheltered family, and growing up I was the black sheep of the family (I have many siblings). This is because I had transsex medical condition where I needed to fix it. Now it's all done and I feel relieved. But also I guess I felt bewildered, because I was totally isolated for 5 years and wasn't able to do school in my teenage years. Then I broke out of that and became a really fun and healed person, which was wonderful. Then I went back to my exbf and my little bits of joy left me. So I left him, and now I'm completely alone. Confused, and feeling like such a terrible person. I crave guidance but can't ever find any stability.

Worst part is, I meet people (especially men as romantic prospects) and they say I'm an angel sent down from God, but when I tell them of my past condition they abandon me, leaving me utterly confused as to whether I am enough or not. My parents aren't supportive. I've dealt with this all alone and no one can relate. I want to be good or like a Christian, but I can't even go to church. They'd tell me I need to be a guy. I'm missing genuine love in my life, that's why I feel so lost. And I try to talk to people and get out of my shell, but my sister (who's basically my only friend) shames me for talking to so many people. Partly because it happens to be guys, and I feel shame even though I dont even do (!) stuff with anyone anymore. But my ex shamed me so much for that. I have a lot of feelings and I can't help but feel so broken, so useless, so worthless, despite all my efforts. It's leading me to break down and cry, I can't fall asleep on time or fix my schedule because I just am too emotional at night. I need a hug!

I feel so embarrassed to ask this, but I need, like... someone to feel safe around.

I often was a therapist for my friends. I'm questioning if I ever was on the right path. I see often advice on what is ""good for a woman to do"" and following it leads me to feeling like I'm never enough. I'm losing myself here. I don't want advice, I want humanity, I want people surrounding me... I need a kind voice"
884,2,"Hi, I'm 20 (M) and I’m feeling a bit lost right now. To be honest, it all started back in 2020 when I was in 10th grade. I was a pretty wild and confident guy who wasn’t shy at all. But the people I thought were my friends started ignoring me and excluding me from the group. At first, I didn’t think it was a big deal, but as the semester went on, they all stopped talking to me for no reason. I felt so lost. They even posted stories about me with false allegations. I kept questioning myself—had I done something wrong?

Then I started to look back on everything that happened that year and decided to stop communicating with them. About a month later, one of them realized her mistake and apologized to me in person. She was the first to apologize, so I forgave her. She even tried to help make things right, and in the end, she did. I didn’t really want to, but the best decision at that time was to stop acting immaturely and just move forward. Things changed, but the relationship we had was never the same again. I set an imaginary boundary between us.

Around the time of our final exams, the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown happened, which is when everything started falling apart. I had no one to talk to, so I turned to anime to cope with the loneliness. The entire year passed, and eventually, the lockdown was lifted. That’s when I realized my social skills had drastically changed. I had become shy, introverted, lacked confidence, and developed trust issues. I couldn’t initiate a conversation anymore.

By 2023, I started trying to rebuild myself. I had two friends, and one of them told me I should open up to others. So, I thought I’d start by opening up to them. One of them, was studying abroad. Every month, I’d text her to check in and see how she was doing, but her replies were always short and she never continued the conversation. As the year passed, I started to feel like I was bothering her, so I just straight-up asked her, “Is there a problem?” At first, she denied it, but after some prodding, she admitted that my posts were making her feel depressed. After that, we stopped talking. This was the second time I tried to trust someone, and once again, it didn’t work out. We eventually had a falling out over text.

At that point, my mind was completely blank. I had no one to talk to again. In 2024, I made a new friend, and we talked, played games together, and opened up to each other. But just a few days ago, in January 2025, she blocked me without giving any reason. It feels like the same thing keeps happening over and over again. Now, I just don’t know who to trust anymore. It’s as if people come into my life only to leave, and I’m left feeling empty.

885,2,"I just got notified that i got my PR application rejected. I don't know what to do next.

This country that i have been working in, i've been here since 2018. If not here then where? I would prefer to not go back to my home country. And I feel very confused on, if i am not meant to settle down here then why did God (or thr universe or whatever that you believe in) led me here? 
I have been saving, and idk. I thought i would buy a house here. If im just gonna go back to my home country then i wouldnt need to buy a house i will just live together with my parents.

And oh, every rejection sucks, it stings whenever i see people finding their soulmate too. Everytime a relationship ends, everytime my PR application is rejected (this is my 2nd time applying), it left me feeling lost.
Some people have a dream of being a mom, some people have a dream of being an astronaut, etc. It seems like i only have few dreams left 1. Knowing where to settle down 2. Owning a house. 3. (Not a must but i'm open to it) finding my soulmate.

I don't know why. Maybe it's got to do with that movie I've personally never watched, no idea. 

If it's one of the signs of where this world is moving towards - towards a colder, separated world where your country, race and culture once again matter and not in a positive way, then it's truly a sad future to live in.

893,0,"I know there must be people that, just like me, right in this moment, are browsing through posts, as a last resort or not, trying to find someone that matches them on at least one important criterion.

If so, do not hesitate to create an account and message me or leave a comment, there's nothing to lose, but on the contrary, only to gain.

What's to tell about me is I'm 22, I work, I play games, as a matter of fact it would be neat meeting someone to play Project Zomboid or some coop, multiplayer games with, but it's not compulsory, and more you'll find out asking.

What I'm looking for is someone that actually has an incentive to talk, I do respond to all messages, so don't be reluctant, and is either happy or completely depressed - I'm somewhere in the middle myself, being a pessimist and all. We both know we won't find someone that scratches every spot, but even if you're struggling with something, you can help me understand and I can help you afterwards. We can play, we can talk, we can do whatever.

I don't care about minute details such as location, let's just speak. So tell me about yourself."

It seems like most messages here are in the ""Looking"" category so I decided to offer my ears.


For the next 12 hours, I'll be available to hear you. I can just listen or I could give you my advice, if you're interested.


I'm most comfortable with Telegram, but I also got a Discord. I'm fine with both voice calls and chatting. 


I have dealt with some messed up stuff so don't worry about disturbing me.


I hope I can make you feel better."

So for a bit of a back story, I work at an assisted living facility for long term care, so I work with older adults. I am an activity director, so I see the residents pretty frequently and make visits to the ones that don’t attend the scheduled activities I have planned.

I recently learned a bit more about one of the residents (we’ll call him Ted) that doesn’t usually come to my activities that has made me feel horrified and disgusted. I recently conducted an assessment with Ted, so I talked to him a bit more. During this time, he seemed typical of what you’d expect an older man to be like; doesn’t have much to say and when he does, it’s usually a compliment being slipped into a conversation. Again, it’s typical, annoying but very typical so I ignored it and continued the assessment as normal.

So fast forward to yesterday, I was speaking to one of my coworkers that I’ve become friends with and asked her if there is anything I should know about any of the residents and fellow staff. Upon asking this, she said “yeah actually, there’s something you should know about Ted”. 

She informed me that in 2006, he was arrested for molesting a 6 year old.

Since learning about this, I have not been able to bring myself to look at this man and talk to him in the kind way that I have prided myself on speaking to every resident and staff member at this facility. Now, I have not spoken to him in a harsh way or ignored him, but I have noticed that since he has seen what I look like, Ted goes out of his way to find where I am in the building and initiate a conversation with to me. I absolutely hate it and keep conversations to a minimum.

He absolutely disgusts me, I feel nauseous and horrified by him. I love where I work and adore my other residents, but I have no idea what to do with myself and how to continue working with things as normal."

900,2,Help having very scary thoughts 
901,1,I've been very down and life seems to keep me that way. I would like to talk to someone and hear me out. I don't really feel like I have much to live for
902,1,"I’m really struggling and could use someone to talk to. I can’t share too much about myself or where I’m from, but I love drawing and playing video games, even though I’m not great at either. I also enjoy reading comics and manga and watching cartoons and anime.

Lately, I’ve been feeling like I’m just a mess. I’m clumsy, lazy, and can’t seem to focus. I’ve never been good at helping people—whenever I try, I end up making things worse. I feel useless at home and in life in general. My family went through some really tough times, and I wasn’t able to do anything to help. Now we’re all split up, and I can’t stop blaming myself.

I have dreams, but I feel like I’ll never achieve them. I wanted to be an animator, writer, storyboard artist, cartoonist, or producer, but I’m not good at any of those things. I’ve been practicing drawing—working on anatomy, proportions, and shading—but my progress feels painfully slow. I’ve also tried coming up with story ideas, but I feel like none of them are any good.

Making friends has always been hard for me, too. When I moved to a new place, it took me months to make friends, and even then, it didn’t last. One time, I drew a picture for my friends to show how much I appreciated them, but it turned out so bad that they all unfriended me. After that, I moved schools again, but the few friendships I made there eventually faded away. Now I’m completely alone. I even tried befriending a librarian once, but it didn’t work, and I realize now it was inappropriate.

I feel lost and don’t know what to do with my life."

Shcools been tough and I already feel burnt out even though I've barely started,and I've got a lot of personal stuff that's been weighing down on me which just makes me feel even worse. I've started using a nail file and ruler with a teethed edge to hurt my self. I know it's not a health way to cope at all, but I feel like it's the only thing I can do to distract myself from how I'm feeling especially when everything builds up but it only makes me feel worse. I'm feeling really angry sad confused and self conscious.

The marks on my chest are getting deeper, but there hasn't been any blood, or at least not much. I'm scared that they'll scar, and I'm not sure how to stop. I just feel really lost and I don't want to tell anybody about it, I can't tell my family and friends because I'm afraid of how they'll react.

Has anyone else felt this way or similarly before? How do you deal with these feelings without hurting yourself? I'm not sure how to break the habit, and it's been hard to stop myself.

I'd really appreciate any advice or thoughts thanks for listening.

904,1,"I just got diagnosed with yet another incurable, treatment-resistant pain condition and this one impacts my mobility. I already have conditions impacting most normal human functions and now I can't even walk without limping or pain.

I tried to get support from one online friend and it was the final straw and he got toxic positive, dismissive, and pushed me away. The partner/ex I have to live with keeps doing similar things. Either no one believes me or takes it seriously, or they take it so seriously it scares them and they try to fix it when I'm already doing all I can and there is no fixing it beyond that. Or get really pitying and make me feel like a freak.

It's nearly impossible to find people who will just accept this and me, sit with the hopelessness with me, let me be scared and grieve.

I have been feeling really low for the past months, especially since breaking up with my boyfriend. I'm seeing professional help so in time I'm hopeful it'll get better, but right now I'm honestly really struggling with life. Last weekend I made a pretty poor decision to go home with a guy after a party. We had bad sex and he wasn't very nice to me. I feel so ashamed about going home with him when some of my colleagues were also at the party and know him. I didn't even like him, I feel so stupid for sleeping with someone when the only motivation was feeling really low and lonely. Obviously it hasn't helped a bit and now I just feel worse. 

I am so scared everyone judges me for being so easy about sex, especially with a not so great guy. And I don't know how to stop being angry at myself. I wish I were kinder for myself as this poor decision was mostly because I'm really struggling "

911,1,"Reddit, 

I don’t really have anyone to be vulnerable with. So I thought I would confess this.

To be honest, I’m not very happy with my post grad life so far. I feel so overwhelmed about the future and underwhelmed with the present at the same time. It’s funny because I’ve worked so hard in high school and college to get where I am today, I’ve longed for this moment but now I feel extremely depressed and I miss being in school. I’ve chosen accounting because it seemed like an ok job and it pays a decent wage nor because I’m super passionate about it my parents had a say in it. All of my motivation is gone. I only have energy to do the bare minimum now when it comes to socializing and even my job,

I don’t think my coworkers really like me that much. I’m just so socially awkward around people. Every time I make a mistake I feel like a disappointment, could get fired any time, and occasionally get the urge to cry. I felt happy working part time but I don’t think I’m cut out for this job. 

I wanted to do industry accounting did job interviews but nobody would hire me, so I’m stuck here and it feels bizarre still. I know I don’t want a cpa since I don’t have a strong passion for accounting.

It feels so weird being on coworker level with people that have known me since birth it doesn’t feel right. I never wanted to be born into a world where I’m forced to do things I don’t like and age. I dont understand what my purpose is. 

I feel the urge to breakaway, get out of this town away from everyone I know and start the life I have always wanted to live. 

I’ve always felt waves of unhappiness. My time at my first job which was at a bakery,  I longed for an office job, but now I miss my old jobs family like atmosphere it had and it was way more fun. 

After work, I don’t want to be around anyone, I want to get as far away from my coworkers as possible. 

It think my current job is too uptight and serious for me. I honestly don’t handle stress super well and get easily upset when I do things wrong.

I also lived at home during college which did save money but my social skills are for sure stunted because I was too focused on getting good grades and going to class and interacting with other students from group projects was a lot for me. 

 I really just want a party phase where I can act like a sl^t and do drugs and f$ck a bunch of men. Hell I wanna be a stripper at times. I feel like I am not ready to commit to a holy Christian lifestyle yet I have urges to do good things for people. I have a desperate need to get very drunk and smoke a lot.

The only things keeping me alive are my teddy bears and my hobbies.

Sorry for the ramble, but I have been feeling this way for a long time. I have known my whole life that I didn’t want to be an adult but I’m stuck here on this planet not knowing if life will ever get better, and nobody really knows what they are doing. 

The only thing I know to do is to take birth control to prevent having a child because I don’t want them born into a world wheee your a slave to money until death and the world is burning and so much violence is happening. I struggle with anxiety and am neurodivergent, so I don’t wanna pass those genes down.

I have so much in my mind I just can’t handle this anymore. I already wanna give up and die. 

Let me know your thoughts,"
912,3,Hello there and right now I'm just going to vent so I have a pretty satisfactory life but no way to fulfil the time I have all my friends have objectives in their lives but I am lackking in motivation to actually live my life and be successful even tho it's in my hands I don't understand why it's just I feel so fed up of myself and would just like to be in a hybernative state for the rest of my life. My mind is horrible cuz I just want to be happy in my life and accomplish but I am lazy to do so. I don't know what to do about that and I'm just trying to find my way but no one understands that. It's just pretty hard being an Asian and just trying to live the life and accomplishing goals and what not just to be happy in life 
913,1,"Idk how to start this, but I will get straight to the point. I hope people will be understanding and no one will judge negatively. If anyone has any advice, I will be very grateful.

When I was very young, I was very good at school and I was always among the top students (I wasn't the top student, but my dream was to be so) until I was in the sixth grade. I finally achieved something I had been dreaming of and I came first at school. After that, I kept coming first at school, but on the other hand, there was no interest or reward from my mother, I was doing everything to get her to love me and accept me and it was as if I was literally doing nothing. Just because I had OCD and couldn't get myself off the books, I kept coming first at school, without any motivation or incentive. My mother never cared about anything I did, and she never really talked to me or had a deep conversation or advised me about anything. She always ignored me and literally distanced herself from me, to the point that when she would distance herself from me, I would ask her, ""Mom...do I smell bad?""  She used to say, ""No, I just don't like anyone to come near me."" I would always call her and she wouldn't answer if she was in the kitchen or watching TV, although she would answer any of my other siblings normally, to the point that we would have a lot of fights because of her not answering me. I would run to my grandmother and complain to her, but nothing would change in the end. Now that I've grown up a bit, I'm 17 years old. I no longer like my mom or hate her. I discovered the ""Mommy's Issues"" thing and found that everything applies to me. I've never been attracted to girls my age. I always imagine an older woman hugging me or even putting me to sleep in bed, and this issue is causing me to hate myself because sometimes it arouses me and makes me even more upset with myself. I no longer think about sexual thoughts, nor do I have anything to do with girls at all. All my thoughts are about hugs and having a maternal figure in my life to whom I can return and cry when life becomes too much for me. If anyone has the same issue, please share so i feel less lonely. Note that I’ve literally never talked to a girl, and that might be because of my mommy issues. I don’t know how I’ll manage to get into a relationship with a girl until I marry her, and that makes me feel like I’ll live and die alone."

917,1,"Not sure if it's the right subreddit but I feel alone.

TL;DR: People don't like me.

So I was at an event recently, met a few people. Continued texting some of them even after the event.

But I feel like people don't really want to chat with me. I can see them texting in group chats but ignoring my personal messages.

Delayed replies, left on seen. Even when the conversation is light hearted and does not require much thinking to respond to.

It has been very similar in the past where I feel like the other person is weirded out by me and try to distance themselves from me.

And the irony is I'm an introvert who is always asked ""Why are you so quiet?"" at gatherings. As soon as I get a bit comfortable with people, they distance themselves.

I can swear that my texts are never ""creepy"" or sexual in nature. Just light hearted texts about life and work.

Or maybe am I not fun enough?

I've always tried to brush this off in the past thinking it's the other person but I can see a pattern now where somewhere I'm at the fault. And this is really affecting my mental peace now to an extent I cry before sleeping at nights.

Dont have many friends. Those who are, they just call me when they need help but don't ask me out for having fun or just random gossips.

What do I even do?

Please point to the right subreddit if this ain't the one. Thanks!"
918,2,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice about something that’s been bothering me. I was planning to attend a convention soon to meet some of my favorite celebrities. I’ve been really excited about it, but something happened recently that has me second-guessing everything.

Long story short, I ended up talking to someone online who I thought was one of the celebrities I admire. It turned out to be a scammer. Things didn’t end well, and now I feel really embarrassed and hesitant about the whole idea of going to the convention.

Part of me still wants to go because I know how fun and exciting these events can be. But another part of me is nervous and wonders if I should just let it go. Has anyone else been in a situation like this or had doubts before attending a convention? How did you handle it?

I’d really appreciate any advice or thoughts. Thanks in advance!"

920,1,"So usually i become depressed every month around the same time, courtesy of my cycle. This month however, it went on for longer than I expected and I realised that I can no longer avoid the actual issue by blaming the time of the month. I am into self help, astrology, religion (Hinduism), spirituality and manifestation and I feel like I have utilised every available resource to feel better. Yet every month I still become depressed and I don’t like my body, think im undesirable and i feel very alone. I am tired of this cycle. I think it went on longer this month because I was actually alone bc school ended and I wasn't in contact with my friends as much (yes they're school friend and we don't really keep in contact otherwise). I have a complicated relationship with my family who I live with and I don't talk to them for pleasure. I had a difficult chilhood and sometimes interactions with my family is hard as I am not completely at peace with the experiences I have had with them. I haven’t ever spoken to anyone about this and I no longer have any close friends to speak to this about. Recently, feeling defeated, I expressed to myself how i dont wish to be al1ve anymore just so I can finally stop feeling like this. I didn’t flesh out the thought as I have felt suicidal before and I don’t want to experience it in totality again. I know I have a choice; to commit to feeling better or to end it. However I feel like I don’t want to choose either. Both are exhausting to deal with and I dont even think I can reach the end goal of either."

925,1,"I'm a romantic, and single at the moment. I've had some very good relationships in the past and have been in love before, but my last relationship was different. It was a 6 month relationship, and in hindsight I can easily see that we had completely different and opposing views on things, plus some things that we never really agreed on at all. She was transphobic, constantly working on stocks, had very strong opinions on who should not have the right to vote, and we were generally not a fit sexually or personality wise. In those 6 months she didn't want to meet any of my friends, and I didn't meet any of hers despite my asking. She told me that she didn't believe in romance, and started to treat me badly as time went on. She also had never cooked a meal in her life, which is just odd. 

In the end, I broke up with her, and she agreed it was for the best. I don't hate her, and I wish her well in the future. We had some good times, and the time that we actually spent together was generally nice but I'm also very, very aware of the fact that I spent 6 months in a relationship with somebody who I was fundamentally a mismatch for, I knew it at times, but it didn't crash into me fully until towards the end. I was absolutely not the perfect partner either, I was finishing uni and in a difficult place there, plus struggling financially, which can't have been fun for her if she wanted to make plans.

My concern is, what if I find somebody again who I don't agree with, but I sort of trick myself into a situation I'm unhappy in because ""it's better than being alone"", which I know is not the case. What if I just want to feel desired or loved, even if the situation isn't right. 

What if I don't find my love?"
926,1,"I’m 22M, autistic, and I graduated college 6 months ago and moved back home with my parents and it’s been rough. All I do for the most part is go to work, put on a fake smile, and come home to do absolutely nothing. My parents barely interact with me and vice versa. I’ve been feeling more like a caretaker than a son and I feel taken for granted. It doesn’t help that I’m far away from my friends as well and I don’t have many friends to begin with, so most of my weekends are lonely. Lately I’ve been craving a romantic connection again and have been debating installing dating apps as per recommendations from therapists, but I don’t think they’ll work. I’ve tried looking for activities to do but there’s nothing going on or it’s for older people. Because of this, I’ve become extremely depressed and have broken down crying. It feels like I’m gonna be single forever and I’ll die alone, which feels like a life prison sentence for me. I just want to feel close to someone and for someone to truly see me. It hurts being alone all the time and not having someone to really talk to."
927,1,"""I don’t know when it started, but somewhere along the way, I began to feel invisible. Every time I try to connect with someone, it feels like I’m just a background character in their story, never the protagonist of my own. I give my time, my attention, and my care freely to others, but when I need someone, it’s like I’m speaking into a void. I’ve spent so many nights staring at my phone, waiting for a message, a call, or just a sign that someone out there actually cares about me. But the reality is that people only reach out when they need something—whether it’s help with something, a favor, or when it’s convenient for them. And each time that happens, I can’t help but wonder: Does anyone truly want to know me for who I am? Do they even care about my thoughts, my feelings, or my well-being, or am I just a means to an end?

I remember countless moments when I tried so hard to make meaningful connections—whether it was in college, where I met so many people who I thought would understand, or in smaller, everyday situations. I would try to reach out, hoping to bond, share a laugh, or just talk about life. But the conversations felt empty, the interactions surface-level. It felt like I was doing all the work, constantly trying to maintain a connection, but the other person’s effort was always lacking. I’d walk away from those moments feeling worse, like I was giving a piece of myself without receiving anything in return. I would wonder if I was being too much or too little, if I was saying the wrong thing, or if maybe I just didn’t matter enough for someone to care about me the way I care about them.

It’s not just with friends either. When it comes to love, it’s even harder to make sense of. I’ve loved so deeply, so unconditionally, and yet, it’s always been one-sided. I’ve poured my heart into people, only to be met with indifference or shallow affection. The love I give has never felt truly reciprocated. I’ve felt like I was running in circles, hoping for someone to catch up, but always left behind, wondering if love is something that will always slip through my fingers. It’s like I’m just unlucky when it comes to love. People come and go, but no one stays for the real, deep connection. I’ve given and given, hoping one day it’ll be enough for someone to stay, but every time, it just doesn’t work out. And with each failed attempt, I feel more convinced that love is simply not meant for me—that I’ll never experience the kind of love that fills the heart, the kind that stays, the kind that makes you feel truly seen.

Even in college, where I should be making lifelong friends, I feel like an outsider. I attend social gatherings, try to engage in conversations, but I often feel like no one really cares to know me. They’re polite, but polite isn’t the same as genuine. I’ve seen others bond, laugh, and share stories while I sit on the sidelines, wishing I could be part of that. But no matter how much I try, it’s like I’m always invisible, always left out. The people I thought I could lean on, the people I tried to be close to, are often the ones who drift away when I need them the most. And when I reach out, I’m met with the same indifference I’ve always felt—like I’m nothing more than an afterthought. Every time I try, it’s as if I’m chasing something that just slips further away.

It’s hard not to feel like I’m the only one in the world who’s always on the outside looking in. I want to matter. I want to feel like my presence, my voice, my love, and my efforts mean something to someone. But instead, I feel like I’m trapped in a never-ending cycle of giving without receiving. It’s exhausting, and it makes me question if I’m truly worthy of the love and care I give so freely to others. Maybe I’m just not enough. Maybe no one will ever love me the way I’ve loved them. Maybe, for some reason, I’ll always be alone. But what hurts the most is the constant feeling that I’m not even worth the effort of someone else’s love. And that feeling, that deep loneliness, is what I carry with me every day.

Every time I think things might change, every time I try to make myself visible, I’m reminded that no matter how much I give, it’s never enough. And maybe, that’s what hurts the most—the realization that, despite everything I’ve done and tried, I might never find the love and connection I so desperately seek. So here I am, wondering if it’s all just a dream—if maybe I’ll never find my place in this world where love feels so far out of reach."""

Even just going out for a walk makes me very nervous. I don’t have logical reasons why—it’s not that I think something bad will happen to me nor is it due to social anxiety. I just get uncomfortable having to be outside, or perhaps I avoid it because of my chronic fatigue. And yet I’m probably also easily tired because I don’t get out enough. It’s all a viscous loop. 

Is the solution simply to force myself out? Are there ways that might encourage my brain to be less anxious about getting out? "

938,3,"So I’ve realized that I’m in school for something and I’m not sure it’s what I thought it was. I thought I’d love the job, so I tried really hard to get into this program, but after some experience it isn’t what I thought. The job has good benefits and pay, but only if you put in the work, and I’m not sure I can do what they want me to do. I’m not sure if I should finish the program to try and get the benefit at the sacrifice of my sense of self, or give up now. However, if I give up on it I’m not sure what else I would do, this was my main plan.
I considered getting tutoring jobs, but they don’t pay well or have good hours, I considered grad school but I don’t know if I’d get accepted or could afford it. I feel stuck. I feel like I’ve made a big mistake and there’s nothing I can do about it.

I had plans to meet up with someone I'd connected with on a different subreddit and and then just before the day got ghosted and blocked. I think. Pretty sure.

I just can't deal with ghosting. Even short periods with no communication is hard without being told that it's happening. My late husband used to give me the silent treatment when he was mad at me so it really ramps up my anxiety. 

And I know I should just accept it but...idk it just seems rude and hurtful? And completely out of left-field, too. Everything was going very well, I thought. I felt comfortable with this person and enjoyed our conversations. And I know I have a tendency to overthink and my first instinct is to think that it's something wrong with me so I spent a lot of time yesterday and this morning reframing the story in my head but it seems like possibly my first instinct was the right one.

And I get angry at my family a good amount (it’s hard to control your anger when you’ve had a brain injury like me). My little siblings are 10+ years younger than me, and I used to at least feel kinda “cool” in their eyes. Well, now they see me as someone who gets angry a lot and is immature.

I had moderate depression prior to my brain injury, and now it’s not only worse, but it’s harder to not feel sad and self-hate when you’re like this. It’s also really hard to find the energy to get out of bed.

I will be turning 18 this year

I look at this world, rising house prices and wage stagnation, and all this other things that's happening, I know I am only one man and I can't do much to solve anything so all I can do is just try my best to survive but I don't know.

I'm turning 18 halfway into this year and I feel like I can never have a relatively stress free life again, I see the house prices and feel like I have to work non stop to even have a chance of renting, not to mention buying.

I have no idea how to get a good paying job, and with all the things I see with people having degrees and still struggling I'm scared.

I still have one year of highschool and I want to invest in myself but the more I exist the more dread I feel. It feels like you playing a game and you get to the stage where everyone say it's hard.

Adulting seems hell, sure it's freedom, but so much responsibilitiea, bills, rent, food. I know I can't avoid them and yet I have to get through it, every single moment where I have down time and indulge in like video games or other things, I feel like I'm just escaping, just trying to cope even though I know I'm not doing shit.

I feel like I will be alone, my family has told me as such, saying a man needs to be able to rely on themselves, I have dreams, not even particularly ambitious ones and yet I feel like they are so far away, like not living paycheck to paycheck. Because I can see myself going through that.

I know I have to face it head on, I know I have to, time doesn't stop for anyone, and yet I don't know why but I can't see a bright future for myself, I just can't even though my life is comfortable now, I know it's because of my family's work, I'm useless in this, I feel so helpless when I grow up. I'll learn things as I grow but, I just feel so alone and helpless, it feels I don't have many reliable people around me for long term advice, it just seems like everyone is struggling, I try to tell myself I'm pessimistic and it won't be that bad but another side is saying how Im just being realistic.

The way I see myself in the future is someone in their mid twenties slaving away at an office job, living paycheck to paycheck alone in a small apartment, wasting my life away I try to tell myself no, it won't be like this I'll find a way, but so many people have tried before me, I'll give it my best shot but what makes me special to achieve more success than them, do I really have to give up so much, relationships, and hobbies, and ability to explore, just for a financially stable and decent life.

I have good grades, Im a well behaved kid and yet I feel like I will be  taking a nosedive once I hit 18, not sure if I'm up to the task of this damn life, it seems impossible for your job not to be your whole life.

952,3,"So I 23M have two  best friends  A and B and both are 22F.We have became friends in college 3yrs back and soon after our bond got stronger every passing day. They both are my best friends. A is more like a sister figure and B well I love her romantically.. I am emotionally attached to them mainly from last 2yrs. A is also too much emotionally attach to me but like I said before between A and me it's more like siblings.. Around three months back they both went to different states for their Master's whereas I didn't and decided to rather do self studies online. B was in completely and madly in love with a married person and was in a relationship with him for at least 2yrs after his marriage.. He was giving her false hopes that he will do second marriage with her and all that shitty talks.. Me and our whole friend groups tried many times to explain to B how she is in a fked up situation which she knew but couldn't get out cz she was madly obsessed with him.. I have crushed her the moment I saw her and loved her soon after.. I proposed her in March 2024 which offcourse she rejected cz she wanted only him (a married person).. I didn't cared about her past or present and I really wanted for her to get out of her shitty relationship..And she knew I loved her even before I proposed her.. But she rejected me saying ""You deserve someone better I only want him and I know my future it's either him or no one else"" she kept saying this for multiple months.. Well then like I said A and B went to different universities in different states and well 1 month back I gotta know from A that B is in a relationship and that guy cares for her and handles her very well and that I shouldn't worry about her.. I couldn't believe it like how can someone who told me that she knows her future bla bla changed so fast.. I didn't asked B about this.. Another important thing was I stopped talking on phone calls with A and B and told them not to call me unless it's something important.. If it's not important then to simply message me, I did this cz I thought I will maybe stop loving B and also maybe stop being emotionally attached to both A and B..Well I guess the above sums up about B.. From last from days I am thinking of completely cutting off contact and blocking both A and B from everywhere.. B cz I feel like I am hurting myself by loving someone who only wants me to be her best friend, I tried for more than 2yrs but I can't anymore it really hurts to act just as a friend when what I really want is more.. and the reason for blocking A is cause she wants to call and talk with me everyday like before.. But the thing is I have lost my energy and feel too drained to even talk for a min with anyone..  So I feel like B deserves a better friend who won't love her romantically and A deserves a better friend who will actually talk with her daily without any excuses.. 

So plz if someone can guide me.. Am I doing something wrong here..? Am I acting selfish and cowardly..? Should I or should I not block then..? And if I should block them then should I do it directly without saying a goodbye..? What must I do.. I am so confused.. "

954,1,"Hi everyone,
I’m really struggling with loneliness right now, and I’m hoping for advice on how to make friends. I have a lot on my mind, and I don’t know who to talk to. I don’t find it easy to open up, but here goes.

I enjoy playing video games and drawing (even though I’m not very good at either). I also love watching cartoons and anime. Making friends has never been easy for me. When I moved to a new place a while ago, it took me months to connect with classmates. I even once tried to express my gratitude by drawing a picture of my friends, but it didn’t turn out well, and they unfriended me afterward. That experience really hurt me.

I’ve had other friendships since then, but they eventually faded. Now I feel like I’m back to square one, completely alone. I’ve even tried befriending people like librarians, but I realize that wasn’t the right way to go about it.

I’m not in university yet, and I’m trying to attend meeting events to connect with people, but I feel clueless about how to start conversations or form meaningful relationships.

I’d really appreciate any tips or stories about how you’ve made friends or overcome loneliness. Thanks for reading."

957,1,"Hey everyone,

I don’t really know how to start this, but I’ve been feeling really alone lately and just needed to get this off my chest. I have a lot on my mind, and it feels like there’s no one around who truly understands or wants to listen.

A little about me: I love playing video games and drawing, even though I’m not very good at either. I also enjoy watching cartoons and anime—they’re kind of my escape from everything. But making friends has always been hard for me.

When I moved to a new place, it took months to make friends with my classmates. Later, I drew a picture of all my friends to thank them for their friendship, but the drawing wasn’t great, and they all unfriended me because of it. That really hurt, and since then, I’ve struggled even more with connecting to people.

When I switched schools again, I made a few friends, but over time, we drifted apart. Now, I’m completely alone. At one point, I even tried talking to a librarian to make a connection, but it didn’t work out and ended up feeling inappropriate.

I’m just at a point where I feel like I don’t belong anywhere, and I wish I could just find someone who gets it. If you’ve ever felt this way or have any advice, I’d really appreciate hearing from you.

Thanks for reading this."

959,2,"Hi, 
I am 23 f and I started dating someone (28M) month ago. We texted each other months prior to dating And I started to fall in love with him. I am uni student, he has stable job and flat. We saw each other once a week in december, bc we live cca 150 km from each other. When I was in Uni in november we saw each other like 2-3x a week. Today he sent me a post abt kitten who needs home, and I was like wtf bc I can't take her in (I am in dorms) And he never talked abt wanting a cat, or abt other animal. But he texted me that he is considering adopting her. And it sent me into spiral😅. I am ashamed to admit that, but why now? Why when we started dating ?  He Is my first serious relationship and I hoped that we will be each other first priority for just some time, but if he adopts the kitten, then she will be his priority, not me and why I am jealous of some cat? Why I feel abandoned by him? We arent dating that long, si I can't rlly say anything abt it. But why now? Am I not enough for  him, that he needs cat? I want to cry 😓
Also I can't talk to literally anyone in my family, bc they dont know I am dating and my friends can't keep secret for life. I have 3 friends that dont know each other and not one od them could keep it a secret😢 and not tell him, when they meet."
960,1,"In Elementary through early high school I was bullied. I was always the tiny quiet white kid so I was a target for bullying that wasn't exactly severe but it was continuous for most of my life. I think this has been the root of much of my issues. 

One I got into high school I always had a deep need for connection and yearning. After COVID we came back and I got into a big friend group. I didn't realize how bad of an influence many of those kids were at the time because I was still a dumb teen like we all were, but I expectedly got into trouble due to hanging out with them. 

I started skipping classes, got into fights, got obsessed with following drama. I never had friends like that, that at the time seemed great because they were the only people in my life to give me lots of ""respect"" and affection.

I hungout with the group before and sometimes after school, at the parking lot across the street. It was a big group, probably the biggest group of the school. If you were in it, you knew almost everyone and almost everyone knew you. Until I met them, I never had any meaningful connections with people. I never had a girlfriend until then, only had a few friends every grade at the most.



I have had a severe feeling of loneliness for years. This resulted in a lot of embarrassing moments. For one example; a girl in the group that I was friends with, who I'll call A. I had a crush on A and developed an obsessive relationship that makes me cringe so much when I look back on it. 

Whenever she wouldn't answer my texts immediately, I would fly into a silent rage and yelled at her one time through text. This whole thing caused some of the group to be divided over my reactions to everything, some thought (knew) I overreacted to put it lightly. Some got her to apologize to me which was bs.

When A started dating one of my friends, I got jealous. I wanted to be with her so bad that I got nightmares of her having sex with him, and was always scared that they would end up doing it. When I eventually found out they did, my heart was pounding and I got depressed over it. 

Eventually I got over it and didn't care anymore once the relationship wasn't relevant to me and there was never a chance. Also she cheated on her boyfriend so I dodged a bullet there. Though I guess she also dodged me, to be fair. 

I think this whole obsession towards being with someone and whatnot, started in 8th grade. There was this one girl who had a crush on me so hard that she basically sexually harassed me the whole year. I won't go into detail here, the stories with her are kind of funny thinking about it, but if the roles were reversed I'd be getting a teacher's meeting lol.

At first I didn't like her but after while I developed a crush, obsessing and fantasizing over her. Never got with her obviously, but all of that must have awakened something in me because I never even cared about relationships or sex until that point.



In Junior year of HS, there was another girl in the group. She was a crazy goth chick, who I'll call Z. She hated men and wanted them to go extinct, yet she got ran through by half the guys in the school. She started drama and fights with all of her exes and claimed all of her 300 exes were abusive or rapists. To be fair to myself, most of this info I didn't know until long after I broke up with her, but the red flags were still bright and waving in the sky. I was so desperate for love that I accepted when she asked me out.

Z was my first girlfriend and sadly my first kiss. I was so unused to affection that whenever any girl would hug me I would freeze and my mind would short-circuit. She found out about my lack of affection so she put up some type of act about caring about me, she made it her job to always give me affection (hugs, forehead kisses). Looking back I know she just did all that to make her last ex (who I was friends with at the time) jealous. But then that all got me hooked onto not just her but that friend group.

It didn't take long for drama to start. Basically, one of her exes apparently raped her once and after they broke up he kept following her around like a lost puppy, also his sister was talking about killing everyone in the group. This was all her words because she was yapping to the group about this. So what decision do I automatically take? I want to fight the guy 🤣. At this time I wasn't dating Z or even liked her, we were just acquaintances. I knew the fight was a stupid decision, and I kept debating with myself if I should be doing that or not, kept thinking on how to get away with it.

Some force kept making me ignore the rational thinking. Looking back, it was clearly because due to my past of being bullied, my life was riddled with experiences of being put down and made to feel weak. That fight was my chance to finally earn respect and feel tough like everyone else. So I went for it. Me and some of the group waited to catch him outside one day, and one day we finally did, but I hesitated and he ran away. I spent that whole week building up a false confidence to fight him. Then, one other day, we finally caught him off guard at a location across the street.

He was sitting at a bench and I went over and punched him and the fight started. It was a pretty boring fight, I threw haymakers every once in awhile and chased him as he tried to run away. I never even noticed because the memory is so blurry but he was actually throwing punches, I couldn't tell because the dude was comically weak but he was actually hitting me with his phone. He was one of the football players at the school so he finally hit me with a little tackle and we fell to the ground. 

For some reason even though he had me on the ground, he just sat there and let me punch his face in from the ground. Two girls came over, held him up and positioned him for me to punch him again. Jumping is pussy as hell but I was blinded by anger so I hit him one more time. I walked over to the group and noticed some looking at me in horror as I felt something cold on my forehead. 

Since he used his phone as a weapon on me, I got cut on the head and was bleeding like crazy, I looked like I got shot in the face. But despite all that I was smiling because I felt I was going to get a lot of so-called respect from it. The scar on my forehead healed and is no longer visible but I still have a wonky looking finger from my bad punching form.

I became a bit of a celebrity in the group and let it all go to my head. When I started dating Z, it was just weeks until drama happened again. That friend that I mentioned earlier who was one of her exes, he got into some goofy drama with her so I went through the same motions as the last time, it was just deja vu on steroids. I knew that fighting him wasn't a good idea but I did it anyways.

However this fight was different. I didn't lose exactly but we both basically looked like toddlers fighting. It was embarassing and the respect I had immediately disappeared. Even people who weren't in that group or had anything to do with the fight ditched me or just changed personalities out of nowhere.

 There were two ""friends"" I had that acted normal with me until that fight, then all of a sudden they started picking on me, constantly belittling me and bragging about how I'm small and they'd send me to the hospital if we ever fought because they were at least 100 pounds heavier. It was non-stop.

I broke up with Z right after the fight. While I brought the entire situation on myself when you think about it, the sheer domino effect that resulted from that situation still affects me now.



I became extremely insecure about my ability to fight and defend myself. I became untrusting, wary, and angry at people around me. I got obsessed with following martial arts and wanted to be a magically unstoppable god because I didn't like that anybody on Earth could beat me in a fight. I know this all sounds like a supervillain backstory but this was my mind. 

I would get angry at seeing violence in media where someone gets beat up when they didn't deserve it. I hate words like ""ass beating"", ""ass whooping"", ""ass kicking"". I hate words like that because I know what it's like to be in a vulnerable spot like that and to have people say you ""Got your ass beat"", especially if you were a victim, is extremely hurtful but I've never heard of anyone having that same pet peeve as me. It makes me feel alone. 

I wanted to go to the gym, bulk up, and get into fighting. It became a daily obsession that I couldn't get over. I didn't have the drive to actually hit the gym so I just gained an appetite after getting onto a blue-collar job and went from 120 pounds to 160 in a few years. After the next relationship and inevitable breakup, I lost the obsession or drive to fight and become the ""magically unstoppable god"", but the above paragraph still holds true to me now. 

Whenever I would vent about my fighting obsession to people or of how the two ""friends"" I mentioned before treated me, people just invalidated my problem and basically told me to get over it because it was ""tough love and just the way boys talk to each other"".



The issue of the fighting obsession would follow me into the next relationship. In the summer of 2022 I met one of the girls that used to be my elementary school classmate. I'll call her S. We found each other on Instagram and we met at our old elementary. We got together shortly afterwards and the relationship actually started out great. 

It started out loving and caring. She would tell me a lot about her past trauma and family issues. Her dad, Curtis, used to beat her and her brother when they were little. She got cornered by a boy in elementary, in the restroom, she didn't tell me any more details, all the kids at school made fun of her over it and called her weird. She would tell me about her ex problems, like one about how she broke up with a guy who proceeded to stalk her at her house and Curtis chased him away and threatened to shove a gun up his ass.

There were a couple things that weren't clear to me at first; How the abuse and trauma affected S and how her dad was treating her. The turmoil that would happen in the relationship comes down to my unresolved problems and hers as well. Also a lack of meeting in person. Most of the relationship was on Instagram because we could barely get any chances to see each other.

At first, I didn't recognize the terrible way her dad was treating her. He was always nice to me the whole time and at the beginning of the relationship the verbal abuse was very subtle, but it quickly became a lot less so. He would always yell and scream at S for any little reason possible, and always framed it as tough love and ""telling it how it is"". He said one time ""life is too short to be nice to people"".

Apparently the physical abuse of her childhood stopped when her mom got fed up with it but it just turned into verbal abuse afterwards. However, one time while we were together (in the relationship) her dad hit her, pulled her hair, and hit her mom over a stupid argument. 

She had lots of health problems for someone who was 19, like arthritis, carpel tunnel, and alpha gal syndrome. She couldn't eat much meat and her health was going downhill. They had an argument about medicine and I guess he got mad enough to hit people.

It was awkward having to go over to his house and pretend nothing happened. I wanted to fight him but I had finally learned from the first two fights that it wouldn't be worth it. I'd either get beat up, or shot. I hated that all I could do was just ignore the whole situation, I hate the powerlessness of it.

That was the gist of that whole situation, but the relationship still remained strong for awhile. However the honeymoon phase ended in just a few months, and as the arguments began, the relationship became chaotic from there. The arguments looking back were very minor, in a normal relationship these would not have been big deals at all. 

One example, I had vented to her one time about my fighting obsession and she gave me advice, but part of the advice was that you can't win every fight and that to become a better fighter you have to get ""fucked up to fuck somebody up"". I didn't want to hear that because I wanted to instantly be unstoppable. I never wanted to feel the embarrassment and other people's shame at me losing a fight. 

She said that if I didn't like the advice and didn't want to lose, then I didn't want to fight. She was basically saying that if I couldn't handle losing, I shouldn't be a fighter, which is true, but the issue here is that I don't think she fully comprehended my problem, and I didn't at the time either. 

Everything I'm writing here I'm able to because I've had a lot of time to personally grow and figure out my own mind. I never wanted to be a fighter, I just wanted to be left alone for once in my life. She thought I just wanted to fight but that was just all a way of coping. The argument escalated and I got exhausted from it and cut it off. She got upset about that and asked ""Are you going to go to sleep every time we have an argument?"". 

I basically said ""No but this argument is stressing me out too much, I need a break"" and she called me a dickhead and said if I didn't want to talk to her then I shouldn't ever talk to her. Then all of that ended. I could barely sleep that night, when I woke up I sent an apology to her and went to work dreading the breakup to happen. 

She texted me back eventually and said ""I want to give you a hug. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have called you a dickhead I was just so upset"". We made up after that and the relationship actually seemed stronger afterwards, but now that I can look back I know that it was a big crack in the foundation. That was the beginning of a chaotic and up-and-down rest of the relationship. We didn't have many arguments, but they were all pretty stupid.

There was one where me, S, and her friends were in a group chat. I almost had to go to jury duty one time but I wasn't picked. I sent the chat the pic of the confirmation but S let me know I had my address in there on accident so I deleted it. 

She told me to be careful and not give out info like that and I was like ""Ok, but it's alright. If you're friends with them I'm sure it wouldn't have ended bad"". Then she repeated what she said and I repeated and we kept going over and over about it. When the argument was finally over we apologized again and that was the end of that.

Another argument was a really goofy one, about what you call different Japanese swords. It's hard to remember what this was all about. We were talking about katanas and somehow we got into it about that and she kept calling different swords different names, but you try and look them up the names are nowhere to be found. 

We kept going on and on about it and it escalated. I sent her a Wikipedia article about Japanese swords and she dismissed it like ""Wikipedia is an unreliable source"", like every single article is incorrect, to the point where even definitions of words are all incorrect just because it's Wikipedia 🤣. 

We went on and on and I got so tired of it that I said something that was admittedly stupid. I was like ""Are you on drugs?"" That made her angry and she said ""You're making me feel stupid, I know what I'm talking about"". I don't remember anything else from that confusing argument, but it ended the same way the others did. 

Now, onto what ended the relationship. I went over to her dad's house and he was talking about fighting, how we grew up small so he had to learn how to fight. He bragged about being 140 pounds, and being in over 200 fights and only losing 4. 

He talked about how his son accidentially knocked into him once which made him black out in rage and threw his son against the wall. He talked about almost knocking his son out one time. He'd always say he never hits women even though that evidently wasn't true and one time he had an attitude with S, which she gave back to him and he got mad and said ""I'd never hit a woman but I want to"".

In the discussion about fighting, he said ""If any of my kids get their asses beat they can't come home"". That threw me off but I just acted one ear and out the other. When I got home I texted her and complained about the shit he was saying. She said ""Yeah but I wouldn't have it any other way, it's just tough love"". 

She always complained about her dad's parenting and how he contributed to her trauma. But now all of a sudden a switch is flipped and she defends him? I always felt like people just toy with me all of my life, and this triggered that feeling. 

I got upset about that and kept asking what he could mean by that. I said he's a piece of shit who'd abandon his kids (I didn't say the piece of shit part but I wanted to). She kept arguing that I ""Didn't understand, he doesn't just mean physical, but mental fights as well"" like that makes anything better. I kept asking what any of that even means and said that was all bullshit and she kept repeating herself. So it escalated and I eventually gave up and shut the argument down.

The relationship was hanging by a thread at that point. The last straw was when I was on my first time on call at work. I was very nervous because I haven't done it before and never had to communicate with people like that. It was nearing the 4th of July so S asked me to take time off of on call to go to her brother's house for the party. 

I didn't know at the time that you could ask a coworker to switch with you, so I just told her ""I don't know if my dad (who's my boss) will allow that, but I'll check later and see what he says"" and then she said ""Well go check now"" and I said ""I will in a little bit"". 

Then she said ""No go check now because you won't"". I repeated what I said and she repeated again, then we kept on repeating and repeating. I eventually got fed up and told her to ""Stop bugging me about this"". Then she got angry and told me I'm ""Acting like a little kid"". Awhile after that I got a call and had my completely stressed mind preoccupied on that so I left her on read accidentially and when I got back home she had texted me to ""Never talk to her again and don't dare to go to her brother's house"". 

I told her I got called so I couldn't reply, and she told me ""if you won't get therapy this relationship won't last long"". I frantically tried to salvage the relationship so I agreed to go to therapy and to get into martial arts. The argument ended there and she thanked me.

But a day or two after that, she texted that she ""wanted to talk"" so I immediately knew what that meant and was filled with dread. She sent me the breakup text. I started begging, ""That was the last argument! I swear I'm going to get help, I'm sorry"" to which she said ""Stop saying you're sorry I hate when people say they're sorry, you just don't want to lose me"". 

That was correct. I told her I wanted to still be friends and she said ""It'll take awhile to trust you again but I think eventually we could be friends again"". But I didn't want to be friends, that was a desperate act to be with her again in any way. Right after the breakup, I just stared and dissociated for multiple minutes until I finally got up and told my mom. We went on vacation the week after, to Wyoming/Utah/Colorado. Great vacation.

I didn't want to tell anyone about the situation because I couldn't explain or wrap my head around it. She made me feel like I was the bad guy the whole time. I've had a couple years to wrap my head around it and now I know the reality of the situation is just very grey. I'm still angry about this, why did I have to go through relationship troubles all because everyone wants to treat me like trash, then I get blamed for it, told I'm just overreacting to everything?

I kept S in contact but a week or two after we broke up she had already put ""Taken"" on her Instagram. I don't know if it was real or not but that reaffirmed the feeling of being manipulated and played with by everybody, so I instantly blocked her and haven't heard from her since. 



Post-breakup, the desperation and yearning for a new relationship immediately surfaced again, and hasn't went away. Even almost two years later, I can't stop thinking about the past relationship, I still get dreams about her or her dad. Every girl I see that's even slightly attractive, I fantasize about having sex and being in a relationship with them. 

I wish I didn't view every girl with desires, but I can't get any of it out of my head. Whenever I find out a girl I'm interested in is already in a relationship, I get depressed. I'm depressed, lonely, and touch-starved every day. Every weekend I ruminate and cry, while holding myself, playing with my own hair, and hugging the pillow, wishing it was a person.

In the absense of connection with others, I have imagined the perfect friends, who always give me affection, who listen to all of my problems, who have similar values and minds as me. I don't get any of this with anybody I know. I feel disconnected from everyone. It feels like everybody is secretly plotting against me, like I'm in The Truman Show. Despite this, I still keep a side of hoping I'm wrong and a public act of seeming normal to everybody else.

I saw someone online talking about how they have a friend group that sleeps over together and cuddles to sleep every night. That story stuck with me, that is another aspect of the ""perfect friends"" I dream of. I wish I had that.

I had a dream of these friends once. It was us going on some type of adventure at some indescribable fantasy city. Every person there was made up, I've never seen them before, but one was familiar. 

There was a girl at my high school I was friends with because they were friends with someone I knew. I didn't know them much but when she killed herself, I cried and still to this day I imagine if she was still alive. I don't know why I care about her that much but I guess it's because she's the only one who asked how I was after a breakup. 

Nobody else even cared to ask how I was doing or of what happened, other than my mom, but she did. Why did one of the only people in my life who showed such care to me have to die?

I never get the opportunity to vent and tell my stories to anyone, and whenever I did, it always felt like they weren't actually listening. I don't just feel alone socially, but mentally, I have never seen or heard of anyone with issues particularly like mine, or viewpoints like mine. Is there nobody else like me in the world?



Going back in time a bit, I've heard about a lot of people who have suffered brain fog or some type of cognitive decline when COVID happened. This is relevant because I have suffered a bit of a decline as well. Not during COVID, I was actually doing better than ever when the pandemic happened, but nearing the end of high school, my mind just suddenly weakened.

My grades slipped and I barely graduated, my short-term memory tanked, and since graduating and especially since the last breakup, I have felt like I entered a different dimension. ""Reality"" since the pandemic feels like a simulation. I'm being kept prisoner in my mind, and in a world I don't recognize. My brain seems like an old computer with tons of malware. I don't process information correctly and it makes working difficult.

Not only does it seem like my mind is slowly rotting away, but physically I feel like I'm rotting away. Every time I've gotten sick since last year, I keep having Bronchitis attacks, coughing and gagging on mucas forever until I get medication for it. I don't know why this keeps happening to me. 

There's always red bumps (like bug bites or something) that pop up on my body and they'll stay for a long time. I don't have any bed bugs in the house so I have no idea where these bites come from.



I grew up on the internet since I was 10 years old back in 2013, using it for hours every day. Being on the internet for that long is an indescribable experience, you feel like you have lived another life concurrent with your normal life. Just recently, 11 years later, I have finally started to withdrawl from this addiction and have made steps to replace social media.

I think all the drama and failed relationships, as well as the years-long buildup of feeling a lack of connection with other people finally woke me up to start rethinking everything in my life. I always used the internet to make life more exciting, to have more connection with people, but it never gave me any connection. All of my internet life has been spent on scrolling, watching videos, and arguing with people. 

I never realized how toxic this all was until this year, when I would try to vent to people and to my ""friends"" about everything and would either be ignored or invalidated. I got tired of being ignored, constantly arguing with people online about stupid shit, and viewing brain rot ""content"". 

I deleted Twitter (I'm not calling it X, fuck off with that porn name, Elon) and Instagram. I used Reddit religiously and subbed to over a hundred subreddits but I cut it down to a few. The only reason I still use Reddit is because I'm big into Lostwave so I follow those communities but other than that I don't use it much. I mainly still use YouTube a lot which I'm trying to decrease. I watched a ton of commentary slop and political channels and I've cut those out and refined everything I watch.

If only I had those friends I dream of, I could finally gain the will to cut the internet out entirely. That's all hard to do when technology is all you have to make life worth living."
961,0,"hi all, just pretty much as the title says, im really bored and wanna talk to some folks. If feel free to drop a message and id love to chat, thanks!!"
962,0,Just looking for someone to talk/rant to lol. 
963,3,"So... long story short I have PTSD (diagnosed). I'm on disability benefits in my country. I'm 29 and I've had it almost a decade.

I have it because I've endured a lifetime of sexual violence and other forms of abuse. I got diagnosed at 19.

I was in college full time when my first rape as an adult happened, it happened around January. I struggled through, made it to my second year. Transferred colleges, moved out to escape my family at 20. 

I ended up with someone (a woman) at 21, I got married at 23. The marraige was abusive and I got out when I was 27, after she raped me. I was in refuge for 3 months after.

Currently she stalks me and I can do nothing. (Yes I'm in touch with the domestic violence charity that helped me escape, and I've gone to the police and I've sought legal advice. Her stalking isn't ""bad"" enough for me to get any help so all I do is document stuff).

Additionally I went no contact with my family 4 years ago (and its been great) but they stalk me too. (Frequency has decreased and last time I heard from them was xmas).

They don't know I'm separated from my wife and I can only get divorced later this year. (Mandatory seperation of 2 years before divorce). I have no intention of telling them because I know for a fact they will physically show up here and ramp up the stalking if they know I'm alone. Again, nothing I can legally do. I've _tried_. 

In addition my mental health issues have gotten worse over time, (being trans and being stuck in transition limbo doesn't help) and I had physical health issues that are only recently becoming manageable.

I have minimal mental health help because my psychologist died two years ago and finding one I can afford isn't on the cards for me right now. I have my medication from a doctor and I see an outreach worker from the DV charity every 2 or 3 weeks.

Throughout all of this, I ended up an external repeat student. Over the years and through the constant stress I've chipped away at my modules and exams and passed them.

I _love_ my course. I literally need to pass two exams to make it to my final year. This is my dream career. I've known it since I was a child and this is right now, the one light in my life.

But recently I've done so badly mentally. I got into an unintentional situationship with an asshole who was super racist (matters because I'm brown) and transphobic last year. (I've avoided relationships since I got separated, he was a client who requested a commission from me. I'm an artist). He did a number on my already fragile mental health. (In particular, one comment he made about me being on neetbux hurt very deeply, given I'm trying my _hardest_ to just wake up every single day. I am in education and even if I wasnt being disabled isnt something I can control). (Additionally sensitive subject because after I got out of refuge, my landlord made catty comments about my situation like _""oh I'm sure you make good decisions sometimes""_ and _""wow you'll be very well educated by the time you finally get out of college.""_ etc.

And January is a terrible month for me. It's my birthday later this month. (I'll be 29). Its when my rape ten years ago happened. It's when my wife caused trouble multiple times around now. It's when as a kid my father would always kick the shit out of my mother. And there's more. It's my worst month. Snow is also a major trigger for me due to it having associations with something terrible. It's snowing.

And I had an exam today. One that I'm prepared for. One that I was looking forward to. I know it's not a question of ability. And I didn't go. I couldn't get out of bed due to anxiety, misery, exhaustion and fear. I can get a form filled out by my doctor explaining the situation and I'll have a chance to repeat in August. Next exam is in May. 
I want to go back full time before I'm 30 next year.

I feel like such a failure. Everyone from good and supportive families I know of are much more functional adults than me.

And all I've got to show for the last ten years is a divorce. (Which I'll have to handle in the summer).

I want to finish my degree and get my masters. I have done well before, I know I can again. I don't want this to be my life. 

But with the fact I'm completely isolated irl (and I dont want to make irl friendships due to safety, the last girl I was friends with tried to get me drunk to sleep with her, WHILE I was married) and the people tearing me down is just messing me up deeply inside. I'm not exactly ashamed or feeling like a worthless or bad person, it's... that I'm conscious of my own vulnerability. And I _am_ vulnerable with my history, the fact I'm brown in a white majority country, my queerness, transness, disability and isolation. I have managed to fumble all the markers of adult life most people have at this age _and_ while I don't feel inherently bad about myself, I've learned the hard way that people who are less valuable than others (socially) become a lightning rod and punching bag for others around them, as well as a fly trap for ill intentioned people. And with my family and wife circling around this amplifies things.

I have understanding and close friends online but  they all have their own problems right now.

I want to keep going with my studies, its what I want, what I need and it's all I have. 

I'm not looking for practical solutions, you can't tell me anything I haven't tried myself. 

I'm looking for emotional support, commiseration, kind words from other late bloomers in life. Thanks in advance and thanks for reading all of this.

 (Sadly this is the most concise summary of my situation I can manage.) "
964,3,"Since September I have been moving with my father for study. Now I live with my father, his girlfriend and her daughter. the problem is that, first, she has no job and has not bothered to have one. I had to make a rather ridiculous resume that was useless. But certainly the worst of all is that she thinks she owns the house, when my father is the one who pays her absolutely everything. She is dedicated to shouting at everyone, from my father to her daughter, for whatever reason, becoming the ""very stressed woman"" when she only stays in bed to sleep 24/7. And we have to settle her head since arguing with her only led to insults and more screams, so we must pay attention to her so that she does not get angry anymore. My father already told me that he would like to cut with her (even her relatives asked him for his sanity) but he does not want to, because he does not know the fate that this lady's daughter will suffer, because her mother is not ready to live alone even if she is 30 years old, since she acts like a little girl of 7. We are stressed, everyone from my father to my family, and I ask for urgent advice for me and especially for my father "
965,2,"We don’t even talk anymore.  It feels like it’s just moments away before I’m kicked out for one reason or another.  I’m scared

Can someone chat with me? Can’t really fix anything but Maybe take my mind off of things? I can only try to be positive. "
966,1,"I really hope this works. I'm trying to find someone that is lonely like me. Someone that continues to struggle to make any friends. Someone who struggles keeping up with all these countless social rules and trends. I'm exhausted trying to be some ideal person, trying to tip toe around and say the exact right things in the exact right way because if I make one tiny mistake, if I do one small thing that doesn't match up to their idea of a perfect person then the other person will just toss me aside and walk away. I hope to find one person out there that isn't so picky and doesn't put unrealistic expectations on me. I'm just a gentle soul trying to find my place in the world. Trying to find my people, my family, my lifelong friendships. I don't live an exciting life so most people find me boring and that apparently means I'm not deserving of love because I'm not entertaining enough. I would like to find someone that doesn't judge me based on my entertainment value. Anyway, for some easy conversation starters here are some of my favorite things. Shows: Doctor Who, One Piece, Steven Universe, The Good Place, Bojack Horseman. Games: League of Legends, Path of Exile, Rocket League, Magic The Gathering. Music: John Mayer, Sara Bareilles, Hozier, Joey Pecoraro, Balmorhea, Icon for Hire, Paramore, Against the Current. But know that I need more than a simple conversation, I need a genuine emotional connection that lasts a lifetime. I need to know that at least one person actually wants me to be here in this world."
967,2,"Someone who I know from college got a job in my field. I didn't want to apply to it (half because of social anxiety). He's a lovely guy who I knew 100% deserved the role.

I had a good day yesterday, I was about to go to sleep and I found out they got the job and I was absolutely devastated. I kept re-reading begging I was misreading or that this moment wasn't real, dreaming made more sense than the level of stress I was experiencing. Jealousy isn't a very sympathetic emotion so it's difficult for me to admit it to myself. It's my fault for having such an apathetic response to it and believing I was above it. All day I've felt inferior and pathetic since.

I don't think it's just jealousy if it is at all because it doesn't just hurt my perception of myself but him. I've always valued kindness and people with big hearts which describes him a lot. I once said I was mildly stressed about something, he sent a paragraph back telling me not to worry and they're like that with everyone. Kindness isn't a value to me anymore, it's more a compulsive fear of people losing it. I've been developing a state of mind where anything I value that can go wrong already has and it's a matter of anxiously waiting forever.

Pretty much as soon as I found out, my irrational self attributed the job to this person's future potential grind over heart personality. Everyone is capable of change or corruption and this might be the start, and if not this job something else. I don't even know this person that well, I don't want to know them and I wish I never did just because they're nice. Regardless of what happens, I'm more intimidated by them than I was the day before.

I know none of this makes sense, I have no control over my feelings anymore, it doesn't matter how much sense it makes that they got the job or that objectively speaking I am happy for him because from an angle I am. But I'm really dreading meeting him again. I'll act normally and congratulate him but the irrational me is always signalling signs of change and it hurts. It's not something that will go away as long as he is around.

There's so much going in the world that I should be worried about, what happens when something happens to me that actually matters?

Other than not being able to eat, these feelings don't hold any power over my everyday life like treating people respectfully. Because my feelings are completely disconnected from my thoughts and personality, I'm having a hard time believing anything will get rid of this negative association I have with this person. If anyone somewhere relates to this or knows what I can do, I'd really appreciate it."
968,2,"I moved in yesterday and have been FREAKING OUT! I’ve never shared a room with someone before, this overwhelmingly social setting is more than I thought I could handle, I feel unsafe and uncomfortable and like I really don’t belong here, I’m forgetting why I’m here, I’m so scared! I’m so scared I feel like bad things are gonna happen every day, like my life is gonna be ruined, like I’m gonna die, please someone help me I don’t have a therapy appointment for 2 days and I don’t know how I’m gonna have it cause it’s online and I’m scared of someone hearing me…"
