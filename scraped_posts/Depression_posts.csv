1,"To the six year old child that wrote ""I wish I could eat more tomatoes""

And they would look up at me and see this disgruntled tired figure 

I'd just end them straight up"
2,"So I’m 25 from Canada I lost my momma last Halloween she was battling organ failure since I was in high school before then she was also depressed and suicidal before the organ failure for about the last 10 years I’ve always tried to be there for her I was calling the ambulance when she’d have attempts and Often get flashbacks from some of her worst attempts it lead to me trying to end it a couple times too got put on suicide watch and all but never wanted to take any medication for it while she was depressed too she lost her job so I was always doing what I could to help us out at about 15 did a lot of things I wasn’t proud of but I justified it to provide for us around 18 I got a consistent job and have been her financial crutch since then I’ve watched her go from trying to take her life to fighting for it once she went through organ failure I’ve seen her on life support but more than a hand full of times with tubes in her and all hard to see and think about fast forward to last September she got put back into life support the same month I found out I was having my first child I tried to be there for my girlfriend while at the time as well but my mother
got sent to a different city to be put on life support so I was flying over there to be with her I saw her body swell up like a balloon she had tubes breathing for her and tubes filtering her blood she’d often look at me and try to scream for help with that tube down her throat but she couldn’t make the sound I just did what I could to make sure she didn’t feel alone and to comfort her the best I could the same night we find out she got a organ donor was the same night we found out she wouldn’t be able to receive the transplant the medical staff made a decision to take her off life support that night me and my sisters were back in our home city so we couldn’t even say our goodbyes a lot of it was just unfair about a week or 2 after she passed my girlfriend moved back to Ontario to be with her family and I was packing up all of our stuff to move over in the next month or 2 while I was by myself and during the time I watched my momma on life support I was having multiple break downs and still kindve am but about 2 months after she passed I moved halfway across the country to be with my girlfriend left my career and everything we had our daughter last month and it’s just been an uphill battle for so long a lot of the moments I get with my baby seem so bittersweet without my mom on top of that I just lost the job I got down here my girlfriend can be stressed most of the time so she always has something to comment on me about or be mad about and I just take it on the chin and try to support her cause she’s going through a lot of new things too but I just feel like I’m letting everybody down I have no one to talk to here and I just want to spiral feel like I’ve planned out a lot be attempts recently and idk I just feel like I’m at my threshold for everything I love my girlfriend and my daughter with all my heart I just feel like I’m not getting anything right end up in a depressed mood thinking about my momma most days but have to hide everything I’m feeling with a smile
I feel like I should seek professional help but I just feel like her family and my girlfriend would look at me differently "
3,"I’m tired of literally everything. I have tried so many coping mechanisms and it doesn’t seem like anything is working. The only person who seems to truly care about my alcoholism, depression, and thoughts is my therapist. No one else that I am around takes depression seriously. I have a teen daughter who is so caught up in her world she doesn’t care when she sees me crying at my work desk… husband can’t seem to understand anything and he feels helpless… new job is so hard and complicated, I left an HR role due to stress and job uncertainty only to replace the job with a very important and stressful job… totally different from my prior jobs. I want to quit drinking, I’d like to quit smoking, I’d like to have more than 1 friend but life doesn’t work that way for me. My therapist says I can do all hard things… but what if I don’t want to? All of this feels meaningless. Child doesn’t seem to care, friends and family don’t care, husband is lost and I’m alone with my tears and blanket…. I can’t understand any of this and I’m just ready to go…."
4,"Hello
I rather stay annoymus 
For a past few months i feel very depressed 
Its my birthday today but I dont feel any kind of good emotions and Im trying to share my depressed thoughts to someone.
As I mentioned for months I feel really unwell and Im having really bad thoughts that wont go away
Currently Im saving for a place to live couse I live with my abuser and my mind is trying to put that money in some other place
That other place is my futeral and that little light in me prays that it doesnt happends but the other is pushing me into doing that.
My family only cared for me physicly but not mentally and I had a really bad childhood and teen years couse one of my family member
I have gone to many many psychologist and nothing worked  
I know whats wrong with me and Im self aware of my situation and what illness i have
Day before yesterday and yesterday i have cried all day couse nobody thought about giving me a party or even about asking to bake a cake for me or with me
Its just bringing me down and I have to tell it to someone
It was my first write(ik its bad) on reddit and publicly in my life so thank you for reading and for me to let the emotions run out of me
Have a nice day everyone "
5,"I wake up and i stay in bed for hours. The only meal i eat is dinner and i jump right back into bed,  then i try to fall asleep again and that's my entire day. Having no job/school/friends i have no responsibilities to anyone. I don't know why i'm alive if this is the only thing i do. I lost all my energy and social skills after being inside all the time. My family just let's my lay in bed all day and i have no friends to motivate me to get out of bed. I just want it to end that's it. "
6,"It’s getting a bit hard to do basic functions again, I have bpd, body and gender dysphoria and autistic. I do what I’ve done before, keep busy to not think too much, but sometimes it’s too hard to not think about how much I wish I wasn’t me. The things that have happened, or worse, what hasn’t happened thru therapy, discussions at home, the hospital, am I just doomed to go thru a loop of self hatred, illness and denial? Each loop just makes me more tired, and I’m not sure how many more rounds I can possibly go. "
7,"I’m broken! I’m shocked. I don’t even know where to begin. 
My son was struggling with his mental health and a very toxic relationship with a woman 4 years his senior. 
They kept breaking up and getting back together. The last time they got back together he told me he wasn’t coming home anymore because he didn’t feel safe at home. I asked him to elaborate and he would not. I assumed this safety thing was a ploy to allow his girlfriend’s parents to let him stay with the them, with his girlfriend. I assumed they would break up again and he would be home soon.  2.5 weeks later I received a call from police and was called in for questioning. 
I was accused of sexual misconduct, sexual exploitation and sexual assault. No charges were laid, but the investigation continues. 
There is no truth to any of this. 
I’m shattered. I feel like I’m grieving the loss of my son. I don’t know where to turn or what to do. 
My emotions are all over the place, in one moment I am so angry and feel so betrayed, the next I am so sad for him and missing him. 
Has anyone else ever experienced this??
I don’t know what to do or where to turn. 
To say I’m depressed would be an understatement. I don’t want to go on living! "
8,Life hasn’t even really started and I’ve already fucked it. I’ll never know where to start I guess. I wish I could’ve had help
9,"Hi Reddit,  
  
Note: I used AI to reformat, shorten, and improve the post, this is all based on my experiences, it is not meant to farm content, thank you.  
  
I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this, so if there’s a better place to post, please let me know. I’ve tried to keep this as short as possible, but it’s still kind of a rant — thanks in advance for reading.  
  
Background:  
I’m from an Asian country and was homeschooled by choice, so I could pursue a variety of interests. Growing up, I was seen as the “black horse” — full of potential, with high expectations placed on me by family and others. I eventually got into a prestigious university.  
  
But ever since I started college, my life feels like it’s been spiraling.  
  
There was a misunderstanding early on that led to rumors. Long story short, my reputation took a hit and hasn’t really recovered since freshman year. I went from being outgoing and charismatic to feeling like a social outcast. Around the same time, I experienced housing instability — I was homeless for a week and moving around for half a year. I’m not sure how much that affected me psychologically, but it’s worth mentioning.  
  
Since then:  
I’ve thrown myself into socializing — especially during exchange semesters or summers back home. Lots of nightlife, partying, clubbing. I know these aren’t the best environments, but I genuinely don’t know how to find or keep healthier friendships. Even when I meet good people, I struggle to maintain the connection.  
  
My parents have voiced concerns, especially about the crowd I’ve been hanging out with. And this summer in particular… it’s been bad.  
  
I missed a flight.  
  
I rented a car with a friend to save money, only to find out we couldn’t return it in our city. I ended up having to drive it back and then take the train anyway — my parents were understandably frustrated.  
  
Then I got into a car accident. Totally my fault. No one was hurt, but it shook me up because it revealed a level of irresponsibility that even I can’t justify.  
  
I kept trying to explain all this away with “there must be a psychological reason for why this keeps happening,” but at some point, I have to face the fact that maybe something is going on.  
  
Current state:  
I’ve been feeling detached, emotionally flat, and kind of on autopilot. I avoid confrontation and only reflect on things superficially. Sometimes I wonder if this could be derealization, or maybe something else — but I have no real knowledge to self-diagnose.  
  
Another factor might be my obsession with seeking romantic attention. I’ve been single for my whole life, and I think a big part of my extroversion is driven by a desire for affirmation and emotional trust. I’ve been spending a lot of time in shallow situationships, hoping for something deeper — maybe to fill some internal gap.  
  
Why I’m writing:  
I’m scared. I don’t want my spiraling to hurt others or put my family at risk, financially or emotionally. I don’t know what I’m going through, and I don’t know how to get back on track.  
  
If anyone here has experienced something similar, or if you have any insight — psychological, emotional, or practical — I’d really appreciate it.  
  
Thanks for taking the time to read this.

10,"

I have no sociai life, I am 21 and live a loneIy existence. I disIike Iooking at myseIf and often feeI like a faiIure. I have no famiIy or friends at all. I have never had a Girłfrienďl, and it feeI Iike l'm mereIy existing around others without being noticed. My sociaI anxiety and autism contribute to this IoneIiness, making me feeI really aIone among peopIe. LoneIiness has taken over my Iife.

For the past year, I've made efforts to change things by attending sociaI events Iike gatherings and bars, but I've had no success. l thought l could even try to find onIine friends but usually ghosting happens though. When I try to get to know someone, they don't even engage In conversation. I'm just chatting and trying. So just My routine consists of going to colIege, working, and then returning home just cycIe in my free time I tend to play games seems to be the onIy distraction and thing I can only enjoy whiIe being aIone I really don't feeI Iike I'm living, I just exist no better than just being dead honestIy. It doesn't help that my famiIy doesn't appear to want me around, and I don't have any relatives to spend time with regardless"
11,Life is so tiring. I just wish I was dead. I don't want to do anything anymore. I'm always in constant pain. I can barely use my right arm anymore. Something please just kill me. I don't want to work anymore. I just want to die. It would be really awesome if I could just die. I'm so so tired of existing
12,"My support system always sucked. Like a vacuum cleaner. But when you are healthy and independent, it doesn't affect you as much. You just keep on living and doing as you please. But a medical emergency caused me to need this horrible support system and was the worst feeling ever. I'm traumatized by it. And haven't been the same since. This huge light bulb went off in my head revealing to me that the older I get, the more likely I'll end up needing someone and I just can't tolerate it. Ive never been made to feel safe in my few times of need. I've also never sat well with uncertainty. And thats what life is. So uncertainty mixed with a horrible support system and I just feel too tired to continue. There are so many wonderful things to live for but it's hard to appreciate them when the bad is a constant all the time. It sounds so pathetic to no longer want to be here due to family who have their own lives. Hard to explain but I just can't deal with the bad energy anymore. "
13,"I get a feeling in my chest anymore that just feels like everything is sinking into a pit. I force a smile, I force happiness, I force being there for others, and I force myself to open up to a few, but it never helps. I just want to sit in a dark room that gets darker and darker and darker, until no light can exist. I don't want to stop living, but I don't want to go on. If I died unexpectedly, I wouldn't try to stop it. I don't try to help my own health. I breathe in and out, that's it. I've thought about leaving and telling no one. Find somewhere new to start, but the feelings would only get worse. 

I see a doctor on Monday. Maybe they can refer me to someone to help. Probably not. Until then, I'll just keep the motions going. "
14,"I was bullied my entire childhood and teenage years, it made me depressed. Seems no matter what I do or how much I try, I will always feel sad. I did try to unalive myself once, barely survived. I don't know how to live this life when I'm so unhappy."
15,"I don't have a mother, I live alone with my father, my father has always been addicted to pornography since I can remember, I was sexually harassed when I was barely 4 or 5 years old, the truth is I don't remember very well but what I do remember is that my father convinced me to kiss him on the mouth, give him a tongue kiss, I remember him telling me ""close your eyes and don't open them"" because he masturbated while he kissed me, not to mention that he also consumed pornography on the computer while that happened, (at that age I already knew what sexual relations were, how did I know? I have no idea, I have simply always had that information since I can remember) these experiences continued and continued until I was 9 or 10 years old (I don't remember either) and although he hasn't done anything to me, he is still addicted to pornography, I can hear when he consumes that type of content because my room is next door, not to mention that we both use the same computer, oh surprise! It's full of images of naked women, images that he simply can't be bothered to organize into capes, even though he hasn't done absolutely anything to me, he still sometimes gives me serious talks about rape and how I should be careful, but he says things so explicitly about me and my body that it starts to disgust and scare me, I'm afraid to go out sometimes even because of that and I can't stand the idea of ​​being in a closed space with a stranger, all these things I feel like they have started to distort my gender, sometimes I feel so disgusted by my body that I wish I wasn't a girl, I wish I could get rid of my breasts or genitals, I can't stand wearing short or very tight clothes like shorts or skirts, I don't know if I'm transgender or if it's just the damn trauma"
16,I used to love music as a kid but since early high school I became depressed and very anhedonic and socially withdrawn. Since then I tried persue music as a hobby and get back into playing my guitars. It felt like forcing myself to do boring homework. Why bother if they don't do anything and nothing is going change. So I threw them away
17,Im struggling rn. I need support and want to tell someone how im feeling but im holding myself back because 1: i don’t want to bring the mood down and 2: i don’t even know how talking to someone else will actually help and 3: im not sure anyone in my “support system” would really have anything helpful they could say. I cant afford a hospital stay but these feelings are becoming more persistent and uncomfortable unfortunately. Just looking for some advice from anyone who has been through similar. Thank you 🫶
18,"It’s been so cloudy for so long, today was a really good day. Nothing special happened, just the load felt lighter today. "
19,"i hope this will make sense. this didn’t really used to happen, but these last few weeks when i’m alone with my thoughts it’s just too much sometimes. like right now, they feel so loud and persistent it’s unbearable. it’s so hard to explain but it’s like my regular depression thoughts of “my life is pointless”, “i want to be dead”, “i don’t feel like doing anything anymore”, etc etc except amped up by 1000, to the point where i can’t escape them even by thinking about something else. sometimes music helps but not always. it makes even breathing feel painful. and there’s nothing i can do to shut it up, i wish i knew how to stop it when it starts :( i just feel like i need to crawl out of my body or something to get away "
20,I get depressed too with thought of sewer slide. Talking and trying to help others really helps me get through it. Talk to me I'll be your friend. 
21,"I don’t know what’s wrong, I have felt this way for years but since I lost all my friends 2 years ago I feel like I’m spiraling or something I have no clue. Right now I need to study for my AP tests but I can’t even force my self to study I’m just feeling really tired and all I want to do is lay in bed, I do have ADHD but it can’t just be that because I’m feeling angry as well like I’m not happy with my current life situation, I have no friends, no notifications or people looking for me and it makes me mad and I feel dread. I just want to watch movies all day or something and my phone pisses me off because I can’t do anything I feel like it’s useless if I have no one looking for me. I just feel so alone like I know there’s people that love me (family) but I just don’t feel it, I have no friend group, I have 1 actual friend who looks for me that is 2,000 miles away, I see people enjoying themselves and I envy them. I want to have people but I don’t know how to even make new friends when everyone already has their group. Even when I find people who are chill with me I still feel unwanted like a parasite, I feel so alone. I transferred schools because I thought maybe I could find new people, new friends. It didn’t change a thing because I was alone but at least I knew people around me, now I’m still alone and don’t know anyone at my new school, I wander the halls like a ghost, at lunch I don’t even bother to look for a table with people I just go to my car and sit there alone for 30 minutes. But I feel like it’s all my fault for being so impulsive and shit and saying weird things. I want to be included in peoples’ conversations at school like I at least matter but then I seem weird. I also just feel like most of the people are not the best humans, I get these waves of deep hatred for others, that I feel like I hate people because of their behaviors, like there are no good people. I feel like everything is so pointless because I am just a spec of dust in the universe, my life will mean nothing in 100 years, it doesn’t seem like there is a reason nothing has a point, I don’t find pleasure in many things anymore, I don’t know what’s wrong."
22,Does any of you get night terrors
23,"I’m in my 30’s I’m broke no education, no career, never been married, I’m now realizing I’ve wasted my life and it’s not just affecting me. 

I do what I can to help my parents with money but I only make 28k a year so it doesn’t help much, they still work. I do anything around the house they need, but they’re still struggling.

I wish I could go back in time and went to college and got a good paying job, I wish I could take care of my parents, I wish I could get them their dream house, I wish I could provide them with grandchildren, but those are wishes I’ll probably never be able to fulfill, I’m a failure as a son and our last name will probably die with me.

I feel lost, hopeless, I don’t see how I can fix anything, I’ll always be worthless as a person. 

I don’t even know why I am writing this. "
24,"No one ever taught me how to drive or do my taxes or apply for insurance I haven't seen a doctor or dentist since I was 18 I just want to explode

I'm terrified of leaving the house by myself and that has only amplified as I'm a mixed girl and ICE is just grabbing anyone who looks remotely hispanic around me I don't want to do anything but sleep ever. 

The stupid grindset the US pushes on people makes me feel guilty for even trying to rest on my days off and I can't relax because my brain is constantly telling me I need to get up and contribute to society go outside do something well I Can't. I can't I can't do shit including take this anymore"
25,"   I grew up in a small town in BC, I barely had a good childhood. My mom was always drunk and never fed us, she brainwashed us. My dad was always my shoulder to lean on, he was the only one that was there for me. He cared for me and my older brother, sacrificed everything for us and he still does. What happens in everyone’s life is that, you get older. You aren’t your parent’s babies anymore. Me and my brother skipped out on a lot of education in life(I’d say kindergarten all the way to grade 4) because my mom and my grandparents(mom’s side). My brother has a learning disorder too.
   (Anyways I’ll get to the story I just thought you guys needed a bit of a backstory there) 
A couple months ago I was depressed, very. Not even for a couple of months, ever since I was 9 I was depressed and I just held back my thoughts and emotions. I bottled up everything for all of those years and they finally came out this year. 
   It was 12 at night and I had a knife in my hand, wanting and ready in my head to do it, but I kept thinking of everyone I knew. My brother usually woke me up in the morning and I just couldn’t let him find me like that. My dad too he’d feel terrible. So I stopped myself and cried myself to sleep and told my dad what happened the next morning and he brought me to a hospital(drove an hour because there’s nothing where I live) I got questioned for what and why I did it, and… I don’t even know why I felt that way myself. It just goes away then comes back. I still get the feeling sometimes."
26,"Not in a self-harm kind of way. Just kind of existing and floating through life kind of way. 

I’m a 35 year old single gay man, never married, no kids, and I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for many years. But, through medication and therapy, I’m very proud of how far I’ve come. I’ve won every battle I’ve ever fought in life, I’ve overcome so many obstacles and trials, and I have a better understanding of who I am. But I’m just, I don’t know, tired I guess. I’ve hit this plateau where I don’t have the energy to progress or better myself anymore. I just do the same thing day in and day out. I’m self-aware enough to know of things I need to work on or do, but unmotivated to actually do them. The thought of having a big goal or something to work towards makes me tired and kind of anxious.

I’ve researched how to find purpose and meaning in life which suggests that I do more things that interest me and I’ll find it, but it hasn’t really worked. I’ve put myself out there more, gone on lots of dates, I’ve taken community art classes, I’ve volunteered, I’ve joined sports teams, etc., and I haven’t really found anything yet. And now I’m burned out and tired.

Again, I don’t plan on harming myself in any way and I have the tools and resources to reach out for help if I ever do have those thoughts. But also, I would welcome death if it came knocking on my door. I’m not fighting for my life, but I’m also not defending for it either.

I guess this is a different phase of depression I’m not used to yet. Has anyone else ever thought like this?"
27,"Since I was 6 my brain has been constantly blairing chaotic yelling in my head. The only things I've been able to think of for more than a minute is suicide. This issue has only gotten worse over the years, soon I will be going to a therapist and starting antidepressants. I hope that one day I will no longer have this problem. Wish me luck."
28,"Everyone tells me to stay strong because I'll meet new ppl, life gets better Ik it does but I just can't care. 

I'm in this weird rut where I just can't give a flying fuck about what's happening to me like idc If my life is over or if I'm done for I just can't care cuz I see no point in life. 

What exactly am I here why am I here I never asked to be here Idw to be here why was I brought here what good do I bring in this world other than wasting my parents money what else am I good for. "
29,"27m 
 Wonderfully wife. 8month perfect baby son.
 Well paying construction job I am a Forman.
 I have tried therapy (a few therapists).
  Few meds 3-4? I hate anti depressants mostly with they mess with sex drive or I eat to much or two little. Or I have nightmares. 
  The eating part is a big thing to me and honestly the only problem in my life.  I lift hard 5-6 days a week. Weight out all my food hit my macros according to if I’m bulking cutting or maintaining.
 However I feel disgusting, I feel my flabby stomach shit underdeveloped chest. And just in general lackluster results it’s embarrassing to say I have been working out 3.5 years. 
 I cover ever inch possible of my body daily sleep in a hoodie and sweatpants socks. I see pictures of myself and i just feel so disgusting and disappointed. My wife says things like you look big and ect it just makes me spirl because im not it makes me feel psychotic like im delusional? When I look in the mirror what I see is there. What I see in photos is there. It makes me literally pull my hair out. I’m debating on doing testosterone black market or at least try an trt clinic online. I have normal testosterone levels tho. I do not have body dysmorphia. Through out 13-18 I was a fat fuck. Reaching 240pds? At 5ft 7.5inches 18 years old-21ish I starved myself pretty much to 140pds then slowly transitioned into weight training.
 Currently 175.
 Idk the point of this rant maybe to find someone like me? Or similar story’s? To help me idk I’m lost.
 I have a hard time making it throughout gym sessions. Work without just completely shutting down I’m miserable. Sometimes holding my baby boy sends me in spirals when he kicks my belly because I can feel how gross I am."
30,"This brutal disrespectful society will look at you because you are not doing what they expect you to do you are supposed to walk in a path like a robot, hate if there is a word i can use to describe my mental state is hate hate towards the whole world HATE is the perfect feeling towards humanity Hate is what the world tough me, you have to do whay every one want you to to be seen as a normal human, you have to argue with savages and be attacked by everyone for having different opinion no one show respect when loses an argument, being hated or being seen as a clown or some shit just bc you are being who you are is another level of pain

I can't describe the deep hate i have for all society in one post, fuck this world "
31,"I fucking hate looking for a job. I didn't even do anything wrong to lose my last job, my management did. But here I am two years later still without a job. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I've spent thousands on career coaching and resume building and it isn't working. I'm fucking tired of interviews like I'm damaged goods because I was given zero support and didn't thrive. Not I failed, I just didn't thrive. And I was doing everything I was supposed to be doing anyways. Fuck looking for a job. Fuck corporate America. And fuck this bullshit world. "
32,"The biggest causes of depression in my opinion are social norms… 

That’s what life is: two moments, t0 (birth) and tf (death). Everything that happens in between is what really matters.

No matter how you choose to live, the important thing is to be happy. It doesn't matter the means — drunk, free, in chaos or simplicity — as long as it makes us happy.

Do everything we don't care 

Too often, we survive more than we live. We allow ourselves to be locked into rules, fears, judgments. But living is something else: it's having fun, feeling, realizing yourself, even if not everyone likes it.

So yes, maybe we can die in 2 years, whatever. But while we're here, let's live. Let's live fully, intensely, without regrets. Because ultimately, what matters is to be happy between these two moments.
"
33,"I think the title says it all. I’ve been on a high dose of Effexor for 2 ish years and I still seem to sit in bed for too long and have a messy room and bad hygiene habits 

Should mention I am comorbid with OCD and ADHD in addition to depression"
34,"I was diagnosed with MDD mild but i had hardly let them know how depressed or suciidal  I really am to skip hospitalization, I’m autistic and have GAD and adhd and OCD ocd and anxiety affecting me the worst out of all which my depression is probably a outcome from,  I’m 19 with no job never worked, behind in school haven’t  graudated high school  and working on GED but haven’t been bevasue my parents homeschooled and neglected me, in a toxic relationship where we argue and physically fight everyday but they are my only real support and nobody else knows or loves me and i rhjned the relationship with my constant need for ocd reassurance and help and relying on them, no friends except one who I’m too depressed to even text and always have issues everytime we talk and drain them though they do care, everytime I’m happy or make progress with my mental health I just relapse the very next day or same night.. I truly believe I’ll never be happy and I’m too self aware I had seen a psychiatrist and they had said I’m extremely self aware too, I know my patterns yet I continue them.. I want to be in this toxic relationship that gives me dopamine and feels like real love, at the end of everyday I fantasize about ending it and everyone around me caring and realizing I wasn’t lying when I’ve talked about it, I wish people around me knew I’m on the very edge and I don’t see myself making it past the next year or two.. I can be reckless
And impulsive and I plan to travel or do soemrhing this year beofre ending it something I’ve never done I’ve never done anything exciting my whole life.. I haven’t talked to my dad for months and I wonder how he’d feel
If he found out?? He doesn’t even call or reach out anymore forgit my birthday a month ago, my siblings would be sad but they all hate me the unemployed loser of the family  who’s never been good for anything, I’ve always had mental health issues since a child I’ve always been a burden I feel like I’m truly alone at the end of the day I keep holding on but I see no way out of what is destined to happen "
35,"I hate looking at old albums.  I see the kid that becomes me and I want to reach through the photo and beat him.  I want to go back in time, find myself and beat into myself early that nobody will give a shit about me, I don’t deserve a damn thing except pain and punishment.  I want to wipe the smile of that little boy I used to right off his face.  I want him to never smile again, never trust, never believe he is lovable, never believe he is likable.  I want that boy that used to be me to never grow up.  I wish the attempt I made at 8 stuck.  It was the last time I had the courage.  I look at myself now as nothing but a broken useless piece of garbage.  "
36,"Every post I've made so far has gotten blocked. I'm so depressed and lonely. I'm 36 years old and I've accomplished nothing. I dropped out of college. I have no friends. Nobody likes me let alone love me. I can't justify my existence to myself or anyone else. My family hates me. Nobody else cares that I exist. Please reddit let this post go through, I beg you."
37,"I'm a miserable loser with no hope and no prospects. I've failed everything I've tried. School, work, friendships, relationships, you name it I've failed at it. What's the point anymore?"
38,"so basically right now in life i don’t have any friends, no girlfriend, no good grades, terrible relationship with parents, look terrible, no will to live. What possibly is there that can encourage me to carry on? What purpose is there? "
39,Life sucks. Democracy is dead. The world is hopeless. I just want off of this horrible depressing ride. Every day the news is progressively more awful. I don't want to live in a universe where people cheer the end of the free world.

I just kinda want everything to stop but i guess ending it isnt a option. Idk what to do. I have trouble sleeping too. I wake up too early. Work doesnt keep me as busy as I want to and i have no idea how to relax. Ive been reliving trauma for the past 24 hours stuck in a loop of it
41,"The Weight of Silence, Echoes of a Broken Heart

AKings
April 2, 2025

July 2012. I flew back to California with a broken heart, not like a girlfriend bad breakup kind, nor the one that stings when life simply doesn’t go your way. No, this was something deeper, something that reached into my very core and shattered everything I thought I knew about love, trust, and the life I had built. This was the kind of heartbreak that reaches down into the depths of your very soul and takes out whatever was left of your dignity.
Life, as I had known it, was no more. From this moment on, I was on an unfamiliar road—not one that I chose, but one I had no choice but to take. The only question was: how would I walk it? Would I summon what courage I have left and stride forward with the purpose of finding my destiny? Or would I be left on my knees; weighed down by heartbreak, drained in mind, body, and soul?

I arrived in San Francisco feeling like an empty shadow of the man I once was, completely devoid of enthusiasm for anything. The sights, the sounds, the iconic bridges and the historic hills and bays, it all passed by in a blur, drowned out by the relentless, nagging voice in my head asking, “What if” or “Is life even worth it”? My soul was screaming for what I’d lost, and my brain was doing its best to drown itself in self-pity.
At the airport, my Aunt was waiting. My parents halfway around the world away, she was all I had. I hadn’t seen her in years, maybe even a decade. She greeted me with a quiet smile before pulling me into a hug. And that’s when the floodgates of emotions opened—tears spilling onto her shoulder. It was the first time in hours, maybe even days, that I felt something other than despair. Because in that moment, I realized I wasn’t completely alone in the wreckage of my life.

Before heading to her house, we dropped by my cousin’s place—a lovely Californian home. I’ve always been fascinated with houses. In the way they’re built and in how they’re designed. Their age and character, and normally, I’d be admiring the interior by then. But not this time. This time, I was looking for something else; familiarity, or a sense that I still belonged somewhere.

That feeling didn’t last long.

For reasons I had suspicions about, they weren’t quite sure what to make of me. I don’t blame them. All the lies they had been told—malicious, insidious lies—seemed, at the time, entirely plausible. Maybe even unquestionable. Lies that time and circumstance have since proven wrong. But it didn’t matter. The damage was done. The evil that people do had already destroyed my home.

So when my cousin and his wife saw me, they exchanged uneasy glances before saying, in the warmest possible tone: “We didn’t want any part of your problem, but here you are bringing it into our doorstep.”
Family.

That sentence alone was enough to finish off whatever fragile grip I still had on my old life. But my Aunt? She wasn’t having any of it. With the kind of unwavering loyalty you only see in the worst situation, she reminded me exactly who I was. Who I came from. Whose grandson I was. And so, I bit my tongue, swallowed the anger, and held onto whatever shred of sanity I had left.

At my Aunt’s house, I met her husband—a man who, unlike most people at the time, actually showed me kindness. The food he cooked for me would make the old South proud, he counseled me, and most importantly, he gave me a piece of advice that, even now, I think about often. “Anger,” he said, “is like a ball. You throw it at someone, and it bounces right back. The trick is to not throw it at all. Or, if you must, throw it so far away it never comes back.”

Profound stuff.

And so began my slow recovery. My Aunt had me up at the crack of dawn for long walks. We’d start the day at a coffee shop, stroll through Salinas Park, and feed stray cats and foxes because, apparently, that’s just what we did now. And then there was the politics. It was 2012, and the country was deep in the throes of Obama vs. Romney. My Aunt, being the type of person who doesn’t shy away from a good debate, gave an impassioned speech to a room full of coffee shop patrons about the importance of voting. Only for the owner, in the most deadpan delivery possible, to inform her afterward that every single person in that shop was an undocumented immigrant.
“Well,” she shrugged, “maybe they can use that knowledge when they get legal.”
Legend.

Days turned into weeks. I kept myself busy with chores—fixing fences, tending the yard, tutoring math to kids at the local library, anything that kept me moving and my mind from imploding. Slowly, grudgingly, I got a little better. Good enough. Then, on a whim, I drove more than seven hours to Southern California to see my childhood friends. And there, I was welcomed with open arms. No judgment, no awkward glances. Just love and acceptance. They had no idea, but inside, I was crying tears of joy. Because in that moment, I realized something crucial—that I would love them forever.

Back in Salinas, I dealt with what I now recognize as deep depression. Every day, I drove to the beach using an old Dodge pickup truck, a truck that had so much rust and character it could have been on National Geographic. On one particular bright, sunny day, as I sat in the parking lot overlooking the ocean, a Japanese tourist holding a camera with huge long lens, knocked on my window. I rolled it down just enough to hear him.
“Excuse me,” he said, pointing to his camera, “where can I find a white surfer girl?”

I blinked. Surely, I had misheard him. But no, he repeated it. Louder. Slower. “White. Surfer. Girl.”

I thought, now what was I supposed to do with that information? Give him a map? Offer him a brochure? Instead, I just muttered, “Dude… you might wanna try the beach,” and rolled my window back up.
People are weird.

Months passed. Eventually, my sister, returned from her mournful trip, one of my guardian angels and invited me to live with her and her family in Indiana. And so, I packed up, got on an airplane, and began the next chapter of my life.

Lastly, there’s something I need to say.
To my Aunt, my generous, loving Aunt, my mother’s last remaining sister from her childhood—we may not have spent long stretches of time together, but when it truly mattered, you were there, you saved my life and I love you profoundly. And to her husband, whose wisdom still guides me to this day—I don’t know what I would have done without you, thank you and I love you like a father.

To my beloved cousins in North Carolina and California—without you, I can’t begin to imagine where I would have ended up. To my cousin in North Carolina, I miss you every day. I still cherish those impromptu dinners in Charlotte whenever I’m in town, the kind that never needed planning, just good company, lots and lots of laughter and shared moments.

To my sister, my Indiana sister, whose love has always been a part of my life, my sister as I have always known. She who was ever so patient with me, I miss our conversations on our drive to work every day. I felt really happy in the car with you, with Christmas songs playing in the background. And to her husband, who inspires me to this day—I will love you both forever.

To all my Californian friends, lord knows I cannot express just how much I love all of you. Part of my heart is with our friend right now. She will be back. And when she does, let’s do one of those sleepovers again. I love you with all of me.

And if I may: Depression is real. It’s not a disease that manifest physically, not something you can catch, and certainly not something to be ashamed of. It’s a deeply personal struggle, marked by deep sorrow and hardship. Right now, over 21 million Americans are battling it. But here’s the good news—you don’t have to face it alone. Whether it’s your loved ones, a counselor, or a psychologist, help is there if you reach for it. The first step is the hardest, but it starts with asking for help.

42,"I truly hate everything about me.
They way I can’t stop trying to “act cool”, that I am weird, that I think I am better then others even though I now close to 25 with absolutely NOTHING to show for it. I literally have nothing. Not even an education/diploma :(. There is nothing to feel proud about, but I guess I watch politics, gurus on YouTube, read self help books, listen to obscure philosophical books (audiobooks). But I have nothing implanted anything I have learned. I feel like I would have ended up better not knowing 80% of the things I know. It’s worthless mind games that put a barrier between me and everyone around me.

I am now a broke 25yr old with no real life experiences, never been in love, not even a kiss. Only women I have ever slept with I have payed for.

I suck. And if I was a women I wouldn’t  wanna be with me either"
43,"I’ve attempted nearly 3 times, and only one left me scarred. That one also gave me health problems. And I was considering to try again but I met this girl. At first I just said yes it dating her because she was my friend and I genuinely did think she was a good person. But now, I can proudly say I’m in love with her. And she may not know it, but she’s made my life so much better. She’s the best thing that happened to me, and I’m happy I can be here with her. 

Also, that health problem and the scars. I thought it would forever remind me that I’m not good enough to even kms and that I can’t even die right. But now the scars have began to fade and I’m gonna get surgery for my problem and I can happily say that

I was wrong.

Only thing the scars and problems is reminder of is how much I endured and how much more I can endure.

So thank, my dear girlfriend. You are the love of my life, and you make every second of my day worth it.

44,"My GPA is 2.53 and I need a 3 before the fall but my college only lets us take up to 2 courses during the summer, which means I need a grade above 100 for the summer semester in order to get a 3 before the fall. I’m so fucked bro I hate myself don’t let depression be the reason u stop trying and try to take shortcuts and end up failing ur classes because u either get caught cheating or don’t try enough.

Though now that I think about it, I’m just dumber than the average person. Everyone in that algorithms course I failed cheated as well, but none of them got caught, so I honestly wouldn’t even be worried unless ur somehow dumber than me.

Fuck everything goddam fuck this world for fuck sake I’m such a failure and waste of money and waste of oxygen."
45,"I work for a retailer and have one lady that I've always been close to. She was always sweet and motherly toward me. Fast forward 10 years and I've found out conversations, she tries to unconsciously get me to say bad things about other people or talk about my life. She then runs to the managers and a few other coworkers everything about me...what I say, do, post on social media, etc. I've found that she's recruited at least two other people to try and get things out of me in sneaky conversations. What should I do? She's besties with all of management and talks about everyone, but has unbelievable skeletons in her own closet, that I know about, but have refused to tell others. 

I now go home, to suffer with severe anxiety. Having ideas of things she may be telling people about me, people treating me different... overthinking and overanalyzing everything... conversations and actions. Wondering if ""this"" person is reacting strangely because of what ""that"" person told them about me. 

It's so hard to get up and thrive every day because of this. I'm trying my best, but some days, I'm a walking wreck! "
46,"I think I might have PBD.. I feel like a prisoner to my emotions which are are prisoner to my thoughts.. I can go to feeling great to completely worthless in seconds.. it's really hard to deal with. 

I struggle in social situations. I have no idea what I am doing.. and I feel inadequet in conversations and feel like I make people uncomfortable..I internalize every award moment which judt makes my self esteem worse. 

This morning my fiance was cuddling and kissing me clearly wanting sex and I had tears in my eyes because I just felt like worthless and ashamed of my body and a lack of confidence. 

I feel like I have good days and bad days.. good moments and bad moments but overall I have to really work hard to be a functioning member of society.. I know alot of other people are struggling internally too but I get so discouraged when I see people freely engaging and socializing, self regulating with ease. 

Some days..I really believe everyone's life would be better off without me. "
47,"Okay anyone who copes by eating has probably experienced this before😭. Like first of all I was sitted today, depressed af cause ik I've failed my exams because I couldn't get myself to study in time(I have adhd) and then I was like yk what, maybe let's get a lil bit of cake to make us feel better💀??!!!!! Aaaaarrrggggghhhhhhhh I actually just hate myself more every fucking time i do this and i still do it again like it didn't even help me??? I'm broke, depressed and I can't afford to up my dose in 4 days???? PLUS, guys it gets worse, I'm an international student, lonely af in this country, with the shittiest father who is actively abandoning me after sending me away😂😂... guys I actually dk wtf this shit show is about anymore but hey, atleast my last meal was cake that I really enjoyed😝(dark joke). Anyway, I just found reddit and I can finally rant and maybe I'll make friends here and atleast get rid of the loneliness🤩"
48,"

No matter how much I try, how much I endure, fight, claw forward with bloodied hands and splintered will it keeps breaking me. Again. And again. And again. It's relentless. It's void-like. It's eternal. There’s no end to it - just this monstrous cycle that swallows me whole. I tried being a good person. I gave more than I had. I stood by others while I collapsed inside. I chose integrity when the world gave me every reason not to. I held onto compassion like a blade in my hands, and it cut me to shreds.

So why... why does it always come back to this?

Why do I have to keep bleeding through the same wounds that never got to scar? Why am I the one choking on silence, drowning in rooms full of people who never *really* hear me? Closed minds are razors when you’re already wide open. Their indifference - it crushes more than hatred ever could.

And now I can’t even reach the one place I was clawing toward with everything I had - college, not just as a place but as *proof.* Proof that I could rise despite it all. That I could say to the world, **“See? Even after everything, I did it.”** That I wasn’t broken. That I wasn’t stupid or weak. That I was *enough.*

I studied. I sacrificed. I focused like my life depended on it - because it *did.* But in chasing forward, I abandoned the wounds behind me. I buried them deep and they rose. They rose at the worst time, like a tidal wave when I had no lifeboat, and they dragged me under. I didn’t go to the exam. I froze. I shattered.

Again.

This will be my second drop. For an exam everyone says is ""easy."" I’ll be 21 before I even touch college grounds. And I’m supposed to smile through this? I’m supposed to pretend I’m not being *devoured* by time, failure, and the echo of everything I should have been by now?

I don’t party. I don’t waste time. I don’t fuck around like people think. I work. I fight. I try harder than most ever will and still, I fall. Over and over. I fall, and no one even knows how far down it goes.

Sometimes I wonder if it’s ever going to stop, this collapse, this emptiness that feels like it's seeping into my bones. And then the darker thought creeps in: maybe the only way it ends is if *I* do.

I’m so tired. Not sleepy-tired. Not “I had a rough week” tired. I’m soul-tired. Tired in places that dreams used to live. Tired in ways that make waking up feel like a curse. I don’t want to do this again. I don’t want to drag this body of grief and hope and failure through *another* year of this loop that just… won’t break.

I don't want to wake up to more proof that I'm still stuck here. That all my effort amounts to nothing but another reminder of how alone I am in this war I never asked to fight.

"
49,"I feel extremely alone. I've been depressed for quite some time I think. Im too scared to actually seek help because then that would make it real. It would mean I've been a sham this whole time. I thrive off of what others think and for the most part, keeping up a good outward image has worked. It sounds weird, but it has given me motivation to cover it up more than to let anyone see the real me and what I am feeling. I am finally exhausted. I probably knew it wasn't feasible long term, but it did last a while. Im not sure what I should do or if I even have the courage do help myself. "
50,My mother has no money because I am a spoiled worthless piece of shit. All I wanna do is end my life beacuse of how much regret is in my body. I hate myself and I don’t know why I act this way it’s like I’m 2 years old and I don’t get it.
51,"So my doctor wants to put me on Abilify at some point after I’m weaned off Lamictl for depression. (The Lamictal has a ton of side effects and it’s more for bipolar disorder.)I’ve become even more depressed ever since being on 150 mg. I’m also on Prozac 80 mg.

For some reason my doctor wants to either go on Abilify or another mood stabilizer for depression. I said in no uncertain terms that I will never submit to antipsychotics. This is because in 2017 I was put on Olanzapine and for the next six years I gained a ton of weight and had really sad thoughts and really bad anxiety from it. It was like being in a coma.

I cannot get these doctors to understand that I’m not bipolar, I get a bad reaction to antipsychotic drugs and that this whole subject is a trigger for me. I’ve had anxiety and depression all my life. I know what I need and don’t need. These heavy duty drugs do not work for me.  

I’m sorry if this is not the place to be talking about my meds. I am depressed and haven’t been functioning. Does anyone have any insight on why antipsychotics are in style for depression?"
52,Wish it wasn’t me born wish I had a better experience with life. no fucking  worries blame my own folks for even thinking of having me I know it harsh but fuck my life
53,"seriously when will i be known not as the younger sister but just myself??? my older sister is always in the spotlight. no offense i love my sister but i get weird looks next to her. i feel ugly and like a freak next to her. 

and my mom wont stop comparing me to other daughters. it started off fine but now it feels really insulting. she went on and on about how i should be perfect like her friend's daughter who visited us. i feel too drained to cry. ive spent years changing myself for the better to get moms approval but nothing is working. something just tells me ill never be good enough for her

and please dont say ""personality matters more youre beautiful on the inside"" because it doesnt convince me anymore."
54,"Every second that I'm awake my stomach is in a knot, my heart feels like it's being squeezed in a vice, my throat is closed up, and tears are welled up.  How can I live my life like this?

This heartache is unbearable.  It's just been for so long, is there any hope? "
55,"Okay I am going to try to keep this short and sweet. I have been dealing with depression since I was about 14 years old officially. But unofficially since probably like 6 when I tore up my friends pop quiz out of anger and jealousy due to his paternal relationship with our teacher. I am 37 now, so I guess you could say I’ve lived with this for a while.

This week I did something really dumb. I got socially engineered by a hacker who was impersonating a friend on IG, and in trying to help them, ended up basically giving them the keys to my account. That was about 3 days ago, and I have had zero luck with IG support and emailing them. 

Today, I guess I woke up feeling like “let’s take this to the next level.” So I found some support number connected to an “Instagram URL”. My idiot self, willingly lets this new guy social engineer me again but this time some crypto bs. 

I got out of it fast enough to salvage my accounts and call my bank and shut everything down and basically prevent any damage from occurring before this new “security wallet” started to drain my entire existence. New cards, new account number, massive headache.

But the worst part to me is my absolute betrayal of myself. Like wtf I work in tech. I know better, what am I doing. I legitimately called my mom and was just like dude lock me up I can’t make decisions anymore, I am senile.

Either way, my depression and self hate is at an all time high and I am literally feeling like I’m getting Covid (my band mate just caught it the other night). My IG profile was just starting to pick up for my drum content and I had been making tons of useful connections, and they all just got asked to send “me” 300 dollars. I don’t even want to be on Instagram anymore.

I guess I’m still here and I have not been physically overwritten. This just feels so violating in a way I can’t even explain. Does anyone know how to deal with the non-stop self hate judgments that give you so much brain fog, you lose your ability to reason? And then if you fail, how do you pick yourself back up? I just keep making so many mistakes, I don’t know what to do anymore."
56,"I am just posting this so that it is written somewhere, because I cannot tell anyone I know. 

I, 35m, have a small dixk and it has ruined my life completely, even in ways I didn't know it could.

When I was about 15 or 16, in secondary school (high-school for our American friends), I was on a trip with my entire year. I already knew at this point that I was small down there, but I got pants in front of my entire year. Every peer I had, every potential romance, saw my little fellah and immediately began howling laughing and pointing.  The bullying got so bad that I had to leave education and start working, and as you can imagine this crushed my confidence in myself completely. I left my entire social group and everyone I grew up with behind and moved away.

About two years later, at 18, a girl basically forced me into bed with her, and had left her boyfriend to be with me ( I in no way influenced this and told her I wasn't interested, but she was obsessed). After a lot of convincing I decided fuck it, what's the worst that can happen and slept with her. She was immediately open about her disappointment, and shortly moved on due to it. This was kinda just confirmation bias on what I already felt about myself, but I thought ""I have a mouth, fingers and a can do attitude!"", but that wasn't enough either. 

I am an attractive guy, so I did get into another longer relationship afterwards, and God bless her this next relationship did try, but my confidence was so thoroughly rocked that I was just a mess. Needy, clingy, jealous, all the things I never wanted to be, but after everything it was like dogma in my head that I just couldn't be good enough for this lady. She eventually cheated on me and moved on, got married to the new guy and I can't say I blame her.

I was maybe 23 when that ended, and I remember thinking that I would have to try really hard if I was ever going to be vulnerable and nude around anyone again, and I never actually found the courage to be. For the last 12 years, I have avoided so much as showering in a locker room, let alone having sex with someone. 

I've met some wonderful women who were very up front about wanting to be with me, but the more I liked them the more I would think about how much the look of disappointment would hit me like a brick when the time came, so I just stayed away. Stayed alone, avoided doing anything that anyone would find attractive. I know to most of you this will seem like the dumbest thing a person could do, but honestly this felt like the only way to keep myself from feeling that bottomless shame for something I couldn't fix at bay. 

Over time, friends started to notice, didn't want to be around me or invite me to parties cause I was ""awkward around girls"" or ""too quite in groups"" ect, but I could never really explain myself to any of em, just part of not trying to feel ashamed again. 

Looking back, I don't think I could've done more damage to myself mentally if I had just taken up hard-core drugs. 

I've been to therapy many times over, went to a urologist (I kid you not, he said the technology wasn't there and ""please do not kill yourself""), tried to find happiness in solitude ect, but I think no man is meant to be an island for this long. 

I've skipped over a lot because even writing this is painful, but I have, at 35, decided that I have suffered enough and no one should have to go through this, so I think this will be my last year. 

I don't really have a moral or anything, maybe just be kind to people, you never know what others are struggling with."
57,"Theres nothing I want more than to die. I don’t wanna be here. I don’t wanna suffer anymore. I hate my life so much. The only thing I like is food. So I eat, a lot. Way too much. That’s it tho.  Nothing in life makes me happy. I have really like no friendships because I can’t have them I hate being around happy people bc I’m so unhappy. I don’t wanna go back to uni in the fall, im so scared of everyone around me and I’m scared of even being in my own body. To me nothing matters, bc the depression is so bad I don’t even feel human. I feel like this person walking around and I have no purpose besides honestly wasting my families food ( I eat it all) and wasting their money on things like trying to get me better mentally. I am grateful but this depression just makes me have 0 hope. Ive been like this forever, Ive honestly gotten comfortable with spending my days eating and thinking about how much I hate life. How do I kms and make it look like an accident. "
58,"We have already been through so much together & ended up putting it behind us, forgiving each other. All of that just for him to cheat on me again. We live together & I am closer to his family than my own. I don’t know how to navigate this at all, every piece of advice anyone has given me tells me to leave him. I know thats probably the right thing to do but how do I willingly walk away from my home & family? & the person I love? & with my situation, I would be returning to an abusive father if I leave him.

I don’t know why he would put me in this position. This has pushed me closer to wanting to attempt suicide again. I already relapsed & began to self harm again. It just seems like there is no way out for me."
59,"I just can't kick it this time.  I don't even know what depression really is. But I've been going down hill for over a year.  Since I lost my best friend a dog.  I literally cried for days, finally went to doctor who gave me some kind of beta blocker. It helped but I haven't taken it in 10 months.  I just stay sad, im either mad or nearly crying all the time. It seems.tombe getting worse. But I don't know how to ask friends or family for help. Heck I can't even tell my doctor.  I'm ashamed of the way I feel, like im not a big enough man. I'm a motorcycle riding carpenter, who is tired of being so damn sad. I think its a fear of losing another dog or worse my parents. "
60,Help
61,"I am eighteen. And barely so. I've been diagnosed with MDD. Major depressive disorder. I am actually laughing at the absurdity of it all. I don't know what to do with myself. My whole world has sort of turned upside down. How do I move on and enjoy my life? I won't tell my parents because they won't believe me and I don't care what they think; it will only hurt me. How do I accept myself? I was so scared when my therapist started talking about my screening results that I burst out laughing, practically in her face. What if I'm just faking it all? I'm only eighteen, this is literally bullshit. I'm so terrified that the people I tell will see me differently, that the people I care about will look at me like a creature and not a woman. "
62,"All I do is want to sleep but I’m having bad insomnia so I cry all day stare at the wall or research how to get better I have no motivation anymore I panic frequently because of this I don’t know when I’m gonna get better or if I will. I try to pull up a game just to close it every minute is horrible time feels so slow I just want out I feel trapped. Bored depressed and scared, I also rarely eat to"
63,"Hey, 

So I am a medical student really struggling with my mental health. I have diagnosed ADHD and depression. Due to my mental health, I could not study and I have so many exams to pass. I have already repeated years and my parents are counting on me to pass this time. I do not know how I will face them if I dont, I rather not be here anymore. I have already caused them a lot of financial loss.

A bit of background: I am Indian so education means a lot to them. They are always taunting  me on how they have to face the society. I have been struggling with mental health ever since I started med school. In the first 2-3 years, when I found out about my mom's online affairs, she is a hypocrite thats why I hated it but now I have decided to ignore it but I stand no power or chance to do anything about it, plus I needed peace. 
Then depression took a toll on me last year, when my boyfriend broke up with me and my parents found out about it as I was begging him to stay(they are strict and were so mad that dad threatened to not pay my fees). They doubted everything I did since then and I could not just take it anymore. This is when I connected with a guy online (my now LDR bf) and he really encouraged me to seek profesional help. Thats when I started my journey of antidepressants and now adhd meds. I recently started stimulants like 2 days back and feel normal after all this years but fear it is too late now. 

I just feel very unhopeful of my situation right now. I am God fearing so wont take the wrong step. But whatever happens, I just dont want to go through this mental trauma all over again. I dont want to burden them or let them down (they are my parents, I still love them), I dont want to have my education forcefully stopped or get badly insulted by them, and I dont want to be forcefully married to someone after forecefully transferring me to a uni close to them (Its a Indian thing). I just cant handle the chaos and my adhd cant study with all this pressure. Oh and I cant take student loans. I just feel so helpless and out of control.

I had to vent and need some kind words and all the support❤️"
64,"I recently graduated from a career I don't care for. I entered it out of peer pressure, because it was on something I'm good at, or because I could earn good money from it. I've been doing things I don't care for at all my entire life, so it shouldn't have been hard. 

I feel like I've struggled, but my results don't reflect this. I keep telling people I feel like a failure, and they keep telling me I've succeeded. People keep expecting better and better from me, but I just want to stay home, watch comfort youtube, play videogames and never go out. 

I went back to imagining I turned into a ghost so I could avoid having to eat and stuff and didn't need to work. I have a project that I feel has been easy, but keep expecting problems to pop up. I don't want to work on it because I want to leave everything related to that career behind. My father keeps saying it's for the best that I continue. I know I put myself here and hate myself for it

I no longer feel comfortable speaking to others because they ask about work. About how good it must feel to finally be an engineer. I can't just throw out an ""I'm glad it's finally over, I never liked it and never will and can't wait to be 10 feet under to never have to do any of this again"". 

I keep asking my sister and mom for affection. Hugs and stuff, hoping it will be easier. I feel so hollow. I don't want to do anything with my life, but people aren't supposed to be like this. I should have goals and hopes and dreams and stuff, but nothing I used to like is enjoyable anymore. i don't write stories anymore, and don't want to. I feel all I imagine is trash and unreadable. I hate coding and software. I hate humanity for all of their decisions. I feel so sick of existing that I just want to claw my wait out of it. I wish I could just help people, and let that be my day. Never have to think about myself, never hope to receive anything, or desire anything, so I would stop being dissapointed. I'm so sick of being me. I'm so sick of hiding myself. I'm so sick of existing I just want to die

  
I've run out of juice and can't keep going. I have no appetite for life, but people keep shoving more of it down my throat and it's making me sick. I don't feel like I can tell anyone because it's just gonna bring them down with me into this stupid whole, or they're going to try to pull me out, when I now I'll just end up right here again like I have for so many years now. I feel like I'll never ""get better"" enough to not feel this bad again because I keep ending up with this hurtfull, horrible thoughts in my head all the time. That's why I want it all to end, but nobody will just say ""You know what, you're right. Just die"". They all act like living is so precious and joyful and good and like I feel like that's how I'm supposed to be, I should love life but I don't. 

This was, in the end, just a rant. I'm sorry"
65,"My anxiety has never been this bad. I feel shame about everything I say, my inner dialogue doesn’t stop, I am avoiding all my friends, I’m scared of social interactions. I’m on 150mg and have been on/off since late 2022. I’ve tried Zoloft in the past but gained weight and I have a food noise problem so Wellbutrin  but I’m literally scared of the world and of being perceived in a way that I never have before. I’m so used to it that switching is just as scary. Rn decided to stop stop on my own. I’m on 10mg XR adderall and I drink caffeine so many it’s all related. Either way my anxiety is so bad that one poor social interaction makes me suicidal? Or is that depression? I just miss the person I was and I used to love wellbutrin and now I feel like I have gotten so weird and terrified and every knows. I’m even in therapy every week and yet I’m just getting worse! Any advice? I want to switch to anxiety meds but not sure what’s weight neutral. Alternative is to stop all of them? I have emergency Xanax I’ve been taking in the meantime … I’m genuinely worried I’ve become a hermit and recluse. Being remote certainly hasn’t helped! I just want to have confidence to exist in the world again and not feel so much shame for just existing "
66,"I've had this feeling since I was 4 or something. I'd never fit. No one would want me for me. I've always been fake and people always knew.

I have all the reasons to go, but also all th reasons to stay. 

I'm done with this dilemma but afraid to actually do something about it.

I'm stuck in this loop of self loathing while simultaneously wanting to improve myself. Purely based on my fear of perception. I always feel seen and always felt to be as presentable as everyone wants me to be because who am I to impose discomfort through my opinion."
67,"I'm 17 (M) and I feel as if I've been isolated my entire life. I feel like barely anyone acknowledges my existence in my everyday life. And I often spend most of my days by myself. Alone. And whenever I feel upset or depressed, I've always either repressed it or just went to bed. But I'm sick of it.

I've never been to a hangout. I've never had a sleep over. I've never been to a party. And I barely have any irl friends. And I use the term 'friends' loosely. More like acquaintances.

The thing I've found myself craving recently is a partner. Someone to be there. To listen. To understand. To care. Just someone to listen to my sob story crap and give a damn. And someone I can care about.

I'm just tired of feeling like an afterthought. I want to feel like I matter.

"
68,"I feel like I never accomplish anything with just 14 hours but maybe I was meant for a 36 hour cycle? Idk. I think about this sometimes, it just is not enough time!! Eat eat shower shop wash dishes that's already half your day gone on nothingg!! 
But then again life is made simpler by longer sleeping cycles, maybe it's best we exist this way. 

I, for one, wish I could dream hundreds of hours at a time. I'd love to just wake up to eat drink and hibernate. I don't find much purpose in the substance that fills the gaps. I just try and replace the rest with dreams I think about while awake, waiting for when I can finally sleep again."
69,"Whoooo oh boy.

I'm a dude, and I'm 16. I lost virginity at 15 to a girl I was meeting up with. She was 19 and ""raped"" me. That story's on my account but that's not what I want to say. Basically, it happened in a tent in the forest by my house, very quickly. She wasn't my gf, I didn't cum, a bunch of not-normal stuff. After that I never saw her again in person. I like reading stories of people losing virginity. And for males who were around 11-14ish, their experiences seemed so beautiful, like a party, or watching the sunset, first time being drunk, a hotel, etc etc etc. I wish that could have happened to me. I get virginity is a social construct but I can't take this back you know? I have severe depression episodes cause of this topic. My parents never even supported me when I lost my v card either, they were furious and they aren't even religious or anything. I've also never smoked vapes drunk yaddah yaddah. Damn. Those people I talked about were lucky. How do I even tell a future partner how I lost mine? I hated everything my experience. I want to take it all back. I fucking hate it. Idk why is pisses me off and saddens me so, so much..."
70,And the apathy is overwhelming. I've been here before but it feels deeper every time. 
71,"You know how some people can eat whatever they want and not gain weight, while the rest of us get fat?  I think “psychological food” - like learning how the brain works, how to think and feel, how to validate ourselves, how to be ok with ourselves, is something we depressed people need more of, JUST TO FUNCTION. We can eat massive amounts of this psychological food everyday and not get ""fat,"" whereas “normal people” are like, enough already.  I guess ""psychologically fat"" would equate to selfish or narcissistic?  Is it possible we simply need to consume more psychological nutrition on the daily?  "
72,"

It’s there—
not loud,
not screaming,
just waiting.

A slow burn
under my skin,
like a storm crouched
just beyond the horizon.

I feel it.
Not clearly,
but enough to know
it belongs to me.

It waits—
not patiently,
but with the kind of knowing
that makes my chest ache.

It waits
for the moment I slip.
For the moment I can’t keep it buried anymore.

It is everything I never said.

Every I love you
that trembled behind my teeth
and never made it out.

Every I’m sorry
I couldn’t bring myself to speak,
because I was scared
it wouldn’t matter.

Every forgive me
left unspoken,
because what if forgiveness
never came?

It is my tears and sorrows,
my shame and silence.
It is the bitterness of being unseen,
the ache of holding in
too much
for too long.

I smiled when I wanted to scream.
I stayed quiet
when I should have broken down.
I told myself,
Be strong,
Don't make this harder,
They don’t need your pain.

But inside—
something built itself out of that silence.
Something heavy.
Something sharp.

You ever carry a scream
so deep in your chest
you forget what your voice sounds like?

You ever cry
without tears
because you’ve convinced yourself
they’re a waste?

I did.
I still do.

This thing inside me—
it’s not fire.
It’s not rage.

It’s grief.

The kind that comes from knowing
how much I never said.
How much I never gave myself permission
to feel out loud.

It is every unspoken word
curled into fists beneath my ribs.

It is every time I said
I’m fine
when I was breaking.

One day, it’ll come out.
Not in flames—
but in ruin.

A quiet breaking.
A surrender.

And maybe,
just maybe,
they’ll finally see the pieces
I was never brave enough
to name.
"
73,"One thing my dad likes to say when we talk is something along the lines of ""ignore how you feel and keep going"" and ""that's life""

1. How am I supposed to simply ignore how I'm feeling if I feel this way constantly and it gets in the way of everything?

2. If life is like this most of the time, why would I want to live it? At the end of the day, what's the point if I just suffered without meaning through everything?

I wish he knew how I feel, but I'm also glad he doesn't"
74,Ever since about November my mental health took an absolute decline and things just haven’t been good. My life has absolutely sucked for the last few years mostly with family stuff and it has hit me hard especially in school. I skipped class a lot and didn’t do my work this semester cause my anxiety was just so debilitating. Graduation is next weekend and I won’t be there. I feel like a complete idiot and a failure. I tried so hard to get better but it wasn’t enough. I feel like nothing I do is ever enough. I’m so mad at myself right now and so mentally exhausted from everything I just want to disappear. I only have to make up two classes so I’m going to summer school and graduating after that but it still hurts. Everyone I’ve known since kindergarten is going to be walking across the stage but not me. I tried so hard but I also feel like I didn’t try enough. I just really hate myself right now.
75,"As of these last few months, I've been finding myself experiencing a variety of dreams that are always representative of better times from my past. Whether it be from comprising of people and places from my past school days, just spending what felt like longer times in them just enjoying life the likes of which just couldn't be done in ACTUAL real life. 

But unfortunately for me that time would always be cut irritatingly short by me waking up out of my own control, whether it be a jolt or my alarm on my watch. And every time that does, I have to struggle to get out of my bed or couch, having to trogle on through the day in this dreadfully dull reality we have to suffer hour to hour with, having to deal with all the repetitive struggles with. 

Just trying to get through day to day, week after week, month after month...

It's bad enough that most of the time, I would end up forgetting all that I've seen within those dreams, knowing that the lot of them were left incomplete. I've written down a lot of what I've dreamt but it's also not the same as having to really experience all that I've seen. 

It was just such a joy experiencing so much uniqueness that came from them and just how much more lively each of them were. All the people from the past you would meet, and some that would be so unfamiliar to you and then some. All the settings that just have a lot ot see and explore. Compared to what is in the usual dullness of real life, that kind of stuff just isn't as common compared to what you would see in your own dreams. 

The fact that you can't just stay in those dreams for a longer amount of time or even have some means to record them and play them back in real life just makes it even more irritating for me as for all that has been seen here... I'd just rather stay in them than continue to waste away in this boring dull reality we all have to share..."
76,Life sucks and is boring as shit. And also people are lame as fuck. I kinda hate life. Does anyone feel similar to me about life. Man almost 25 years of this life shit and it just seems like pointless and boring bullshit. I hate this shit.
77,"This is gonna be a bit long so please don’t mind. This is the first and last time i will ever let it out.

I am 23 and cant find a single happy moment in my life, 

I grew up with an alcoholic father who would often beat my mother and I was always scared to go to school coz plenty times i would come home to my mom being bruised and hurt. So i would always be scared at school for my mom’s safety.

I used to bed wet up until 17 or so maybe cause I was always scared inside on top of that I got a lazy eye when i was younger so I was kinda getting bullied for that at school or just feeling like a outcast on top of everything going at home and being scared of my father every second.

So I could not feel safe at home or outside, only memories of my childhood stuck in my mind is begging my father to not hit my mom or getting in between them to save her even though i could not or being bullied. 

So on top of that I have plenty chronic skin conditions like eczema, serb dermatitis and more that i tried everything to fix but can’t yet so I feel unsafe and uncomfortable like every moment someone might judge or point it out.

I have lost all my so called friends or cut them off because i was extremely depressed with everything going on in my life at home. This is the first time i am ever putting this out because i can not get myself to talk about it to anybody i know but for the last couple months everyday i am on the edge and I am genuinely scared that i am going to kill myself one of these days and wanted to at least once let somebody know.

I try my best everyday to help myself but no matter what i do nothing works so I just feel like the universe have always been against me in some way since i was born. I cant connect to people anymore so i dont see the point in going on , i have way too much self hate and trauma to ever let go.

I just wish to live one normal day where i dont wake up with all these feelings and all these diseases but probably not gonna happen…. 

Only thing that kept me going the recent years was i really wanted to be a father and give the love to my kid that i felt missing always as a kid but I just cant keep my self together anymore. 

Thank you to anyone who read it, sorry to trauma dump on you. Hope whatever you are going through gets better

"
78,"I've been dealing with depression for over 10 years now. 
For those 10+ years I've always feared being a burden and a disappointment to the people around me.

In 2023-2024 I went to college, but I told everyone I was doing good financially and with education, but I was actually doing horrible. My depression relapsed (I got treated in 2020 I believe and felt a lot better). I was starving myself, I was 6 hours away from family so I was isolated and I felt horrible.
All this resulted in me failing 2 classes and instead of telling the truth I lied to everyone saying I passed my classes and continued college. I didn't continue.
I told everyone in my life that I was taking remote classes which explains why I was able to move back in with my mom.
Lying killed me, I kept fighting with myself every single day because I wanted to tell the truth, but I was scared. I've always feared being a disappointment and a burden. I've always felt like a failure and I knew that if I told the truth and someone looked disappointed in me, I'd know how I felt about myself was true and I wouldn't be able to live with myself. I would have ended it.

At the very end of 2024 I met a girl who I fell in love with, for 3 months we hit it off really well and I was really fucking happy. Although I was still struggling with depression. But I felt good about myself because of her. Which I mean, is good, but also bad because that means I relied on her. Which made me feel like a burden. I was still happy, but struggling.
Ontop of that, I lied to her about my college and finances, like I lied to everyone else.
I wish I told her the truth when I met her, but I didnt, I lied because I was scared.

Fast forward 3 months, she found proof that I wasnt going to college anymore. And even with that proof I kept lying and swearing I was telling the truth. I looked into her eyes and continued lying... it fucking killed me and I was screaming internally wanting so badly to finally come out, but I didnt until like half an hour later, I finally broke.

Because of that incident, she broke up with me. I understand why. She can't trust me anymore.

I just keep hoping she'll be able to trust me again though. The thing is I dont trust myself. I lied to everyone in my life AND I lied to myself. I ruined everything.

After she found out she told my mom which I'm thankful for. Afterwards I worked on telling the truth to everyone in my life, my dad, my family friends, etc. And I looked into getting back into therapy. I wanted to get into therapy again. I applied for Medicaid, and just 2 weeks ago I enrolled for Blue Cross so late next month I can finally get back into therapy.

But after the couple weeks of waiting and just trying to keep myself busy, I ran out of energy. I've given up. I can barely get out of bed in the morning now and all I'm doing is going to work, sleeping, work, repeat. 
I tried giving myself more to do, like programming projects (I studied Comp Sci), I've been going on a lot of nature walks to think, rock climbing, even registered for classes at a nearby community college to dip my toes back in school. But I've running on fumes. I've lost hope.

I wrote about 12 suicide notes, one for each person in my life and I'm writing more, and I have a plan on how I want to leave, and a date. August 6th, but I dont know if I can last that long.
I chose August 6th because that's when I'll be done paying back my mom, and maybe, just maybe I'll get the help I need before then. But now I dont want help.

I just want to die, and I'm running on autopilot.

I had to tell someone so a couple days ago I told my dad, but I told him that I'm safe. That I dont have the strength to go through with my plan until in a month or two. Which was the truth, I wanted to die but not before I helped my mom. But now I dont have the strength to end it, but I also dont have the strength to keep going.

I keep thinking about my ex, hoping she'll forgive me, I keep thinking about how nice it would feel to end it, I keep thinking about my future, but all I see is a noose.
I even bought one today and I'm keeping it in my car.. just in case.

Sorry for the rant. I dont even know what I'm looking for out of this post because everyone's telling me to go to therapy, and I wanted to, but I dont see how it'll help. Because I don't want help now, I just want to go to sleep."
79,"Fuck a job, fuck education, I just wanna find someone that will stick with me no matter what and help me feel like a person. Someone that gives me a reasoon to wake up in the morning. I dont care if it doesn't lastt forever I can just end my own life after the relationship ceases. I just want to feel normal and happy and connected and accepted just once in my life. "
80,"everyday is a struggle. i have so much regret and i have no motivation for the future. waking up is the hardest part of the day. 

i’m young, i’m 23 but it feels like my life is over. i recently graduated and i have no plans for the future or no idea what i want to do. i got into masters programs and now that i got in i’m not sure if i even want to do them. i wasted all this time applying and now i am unsure. 

i rejected one of them to narrow it down and now i have immense regret about the decision. 

there’s so much going wrong in my life and i feel so alone. i know that getting into masters is a good thing but j genuinely just feel so overwhelmed with these decisions and it’s hard to decide when you don’t even picture yourself having a future. 
"
81,"ECT is helping a lot. I’m at a point where I’m not taking my medication. But just one thing thats getting me down. I have no friends. I’m 25 I don’t drive or have a job right now. I have acne. I just watch Netflix and read all day. I’ve applied to 19 jobs close by. But I just can’t shake this fucking lonely feeling. I’m not suicidal. I just feel ugly and lonely. And stupid. Seeing everyone succeed and not knowing what my fucking purpose is. What I’m still in this city for. Who knows. Maybe I should start smoking again, to ease the lonely feeling. But I’m really starting to feel hopeless I haven’t heard from anywhere…. I had an interview and if didn’t go well I guess. Oh well."
82,I can’t resist it I need to cut myself I need to feel it I need to feel something . I know it’s sick to do it but still I don’t care and my mom will never know no one will ever know I will just do it in silence until one day I just kill myself Sara told me today that I don’t know what depression looks like but I think I have it I am never happy actually and sometimes I just can’t fake it but with her I just feel happy she is the drug and I am the addict I just need her to live or so do I think . I mean I am in love with a emocionaly unavailable man that will never love me . He will allways love the other woman and I will cry myself to sleep with just my dreams in my hand and the feeling that I am better of dead I know I am the problem I know that Sara will soon start to hate me I am unloveble I know that who would ever love me and Sara saw my scars I didnt show them to her ofc and I told her that it was a cat but I dont think that she belived me so fuck it maybe I should just die you know that one day I will just grow wings and fly . I think that Jake amd Sara hate me and they are the only people I love and trust well I am overthinking everything they do so I guess I am a shit person with a shit personality . Well just kill me already . I dont know why but I feel like everyone hates me . I feel like they want me to die like I am the scum of this Earth . Well if I died no one would cry I know that and I feel like I am becoming Jelena . I started to gossip and thats not me or is it ? Becouse Jake told me that I dont have a life and he didnt lie but it hurt . I really dont have a life. I just want to die …
83,"Since my girlfriend broke up with me last year, I have been depressed and it gets worse every single day. She was everything in my life and we did all things together for more than 3 years, until she said she wasn't in love with me anymore and moved out. I feel so lost since then, already tried suicide and did go to psych ward. I don't think I will ever be happy again, everyday I just wake up and stays in bed feeling depressed. "
84,"So, among other things (like depression) I've been diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder. I'd like to find other people who have it and maybe talk. So, if you want to talk, vent or share something, let me know 😌 "
85,"I can't handle this shit anymore. I'm so sick of life. It just sucks, it's constant suffering. I'm in my mid 20s but mentally feel like I'm 40. I fucking hate the systems in place in society and I hate humanity. It's gross and disgusting. I've been depressed almost my entire fucking life. I swear I'd fucking kill myself if I had the strength to, I'm just too cowardly to do it."
86,"This might be complete bullshit considering I’m 14, teenage angst and all that. But for something that’s supposed to be a phase it feels crushing. I’ve never not been addicted to something as far as I can remember, most recently shopping, sugar, and caffeine. Anorexia takes away one of those altogether. It’s never enough, working out, good grades, art, I try my Hardest but nothing helps. My achievements bring me no joy, I’ve already won a scholarship in middle school and i didn’t even smile when I found out. My hobbies and friends aren’t really enjoyable they’re just ways to pass time so that I’m not constantly thinking about my own existence. I’m sick of only living for the next cheap dopamine hit, I don’t deserve to live if it’s just to be an addict. When I think about the future there’s nothing I want or look forward to. I don’t want kids, I’m not pawning my problems off to a girlfriend, I’ll never truly trust my parents, and there’s no career that sounds appealing. The worst part of it all is that people think I’m not trying. I gave them fucking everything and now I’m empty because of it, yet they still want more. I’m only alive to write this because I want cookies before I die but my eating disorder won’t let me have them."
87,"I have a friend going through depression right now and I’m doing all I can for her to feel better. I suggested some hobbies she could get herself into that don’t require being behind a screen but she doesn’t seem to be convinced or interested.. I don’t know what in the world to do. do I get myself in these hobbies I suggested to convince her? I don’t want to feel as if I am forcing her into something and I want her to do what she does that makes her happy (even though her depression is not getting any better at all).  its burning me out here because I just don’t want her depression to take over anymore. in no way I am upset at her for turning these ideas down, but it just makes me mad at myself that I am not doing enough for my friend. is this selfish in any way to think like this?"
88,"I’ve had a fairly normal life other than being SAd at the age of 7. I loved going outside as a kid, had friends through school, graduated uni, have a good job, I weight lift 6 days a week, have hobbies, talked to therapists and meds, but i still just want to kill my self, literally the first thought I have when I wake up is I wish I didn’t. It just feels like every thing I do is I’ll never get rid of this disease. I don’t know what else to do and I can’t live anymore years this way. "
89,"I turn 22 later this month, may is always a bad month for me. in school summer reminded me that the people i thought were my friends only talked to me cause i was nearby, i rarely went to parties or gatherings. every breakup ive ever had also happens to be in may. half of my relationships are me pouring my heart out to a woman who couldn’t give two fucks about me and the other half are poor sweet genuine girls, and i just can’t accept that someone would actually love me without me having to beg for it, making me push them away. i hate myself for it. my social skills are shit, i’m either too quiet and reserved or way too much and over the top when i get excited. i think im on the spectrum. sometimes i’m angry and i don’t even know why, like so angry i can barely breathe. i hate everything about myself. i hate how skinny i am, i hate the way my face looks, i hate the way the voice sounds, i hate how i can’t articulate anything i want to say. i think about blowing a hole in my head everyday but im too much of a pussy to do it. i’ve fallen astronomically short of my potential and i feel like the biggest fuck up. i’m not sure how much longer i can keep fighting the fight."
90,"Some problems have happened recently, and I'm noticing the same symptoms I felt when I had my first crisis. Feeling of helplessness, lack of self-esteem, lack of investment in myself, constant crying or at least interspersed throughout the day.
Someone who has been through this knows what to do to avoid a relapse? The first time I had it, I went through miracles, believe it or not, that helped me get out of that situation and guided me to the person I am now. But I feel like crap for not being able to control the situation. What can I do? "
91,"Seems like I’ve been depressed all along – and I had no idea. What the fuck do I even know?
I’m 32 years old. Two years ago, it kind of clicked that I had been physically and emotionally abused for a fucking decade.
For the past few months, I’ve been thinking, “Naaah, this can’t be how everyone feels.”
I feel like nothing matters, nothing makes sense. It’s like I’m watching myself from a third-person perspective, as if I’m not the one actually living this life.
I still go to work, I still function. So I can’t be depressed, right?
Well, turns out – surprise – I am.
To the outside world, my life looks perfect: I’m going to concerts, weddings, on vacations, meeting friends.
But I can’t make people understand that I don’t enjoy any of it. It’s exhausting. Everything I do, I don’t want to do.

I just want to be alone.
I feel empty.
"
92,"My family treats me like crap. Im too broke to move out. I try to make the best of things here but I'm constantly berated every day. They talk down to me like I'm too stupid to understand basic common sense. They micromanage me on everything I do. Cooking, cleaning, how I should run my life. They make snyde remarks about me and my body. My mom treats me like a walking chore list. It's hard for me to find the motivation to clean my room or shower but I do my best. Yet they keep chewing my head off like I've committed a crime because I hadn't showered in 3 days. I'm trying so hard but it's just never enough. They don't care how I feel mentally or ask why im struggling. They make me feel like bad when I'm just trying to function normally. I don't lnow what to do. "
93,"I’ve had chronic depression for about 12 years. I’ve been on SSRIs for 5 (I went on them when suicidal thoughts started) and they’ve helped a lot. I wouldn’t say I’m depressed anymore.

However, whenever I think about how much I love my parents it sends me right back into a depressive episode.

I’m absolutely terrified of losing them. They’re everything to me. I’m sat here choking on my own tears from crying so much.

Whenever I think about the possibility, the suicidal thoughts start. It’s in an effort to avoid that pain down the line.

Picturing that grief makes my current life feel so meaningless as I know I won’t want to live if anything happens to them.
"
94,"I'm fucking tired of being here. Tired of living, tired of no one caring. I am tired of of this life "
95,"They are fine people I just can't stand them anymore. If I had friends (or even just one real true friend connection) to hang out with or a group that we schedule events or nights out with every week i feel like I'd be happy. I wake up, go to work, then come home to people that don't understand me and I just endure their bullshit ideas and judgements on me wanting to move out. I hate the fake forced smiles that my family gives me after I got admitted to the hospital for suicidal ideation. Especially from my grandparent's side. They don't even speak english. I just pretend that I enjoy their coddling, them looking and talking to me like a toddler. Under my breath I say ""fuck you bitch, get off my shit I hope you die"". Not like they can understand. Like I said they are wonderful people that were fine in my youth, I just need to leave the nest becuase I feel like I'm not making any progress here.   
I want to move but what's stopping me is fear and knowing that I have no support system. I mean to be fair being around my family is torture so that could be an upgrade. I probably need to someday just accept that people will be annoying and think they're helping. I'm just scared about the new bills I'd have to worry about. I'd get roommates and work part time. Full time work got me put into the psych ward. So I'm thinking earnings 1250 a month. Rent: 800. Leaves me with 450 for food, gas, weed, and maybe a bit for savings. Should be fine. I could live with my parents rent free and work full time to save up but that just kept me depressed and suicidal. I need to just bite the bullet and accept that I'll be poor for a long long time. I mean I'm mentally poor so let's tend to that first. Not being able to make money due to depression has made life so miserable and it just feeds into this endless cycle of not having enough money to make the changes you need in your life because you are too depressed to do so. "
96,guys. i hate this. it genuinely feels like im chained to my bed and im fighting for my LIFE to get out of bed. this sounds so exaggerated and dramatic but i feel like im suffocating under my covers and i want to get out of my bed so bad but i cant. it’s stressing me out so much im wasting so much time over this one task that i cant even do. like all i have to do is stand up. why am i binded to my bed. this is so embarrassing and pathetic and i just want to get out of my bed so bad. does anyone have any advice
97,"I feel exhausted to even write this, but I guess I just want to hear what anyone wants to say - no expectations though. If there is even anything to say.  I’m down and depressed and just a bit done with it all. I can’t go until after my sisters birthday next month. So she has a nice day. 

But what I have recently learnt is; 
- I’ve been gaslit by my own family for years, trying to minimise my feelings when I have the right to be hurt. 
- I’ve been assaulted, exploited and graped many times (7) when it wasn’t my fault - I’ve always blamed me being naive and putting myself in this situation to begin with. 
- My ex, once when we were being intimate in an overnight stay, were beigg no experimental and gagged, blindfolded and tied me to the bed when I was naked - only to take a photo of me from a provocative position. He never asked for consent or told me about it. I guessed in the silent moment something wasn’t right, but you trust your partner right? Only to one night, during our downfall in our relationship stalk through his phone and find the photo. (Not my proudest moment, but honestly not that bad in comparison) 
- Or the time my ex tried to be intimate with me whilst I was asleep. He tried to remove my onesie, only to stop because I did wear good underwear underneath as I fell asleep during a movie - and I shocked him with a vajazzle I did as he put his hand down my pants! Haha! Funny but also not funny. 
- My parents disappointed me on my own wedding day, my dad made his father of the bride speech about his boat and how he “missed the opportunity of a lifetime to sail from Panama to South Africa, because it my wedding was in the way” - and his watch stopped in the evening and went to have a nap between the wedding breakfast and the evening disco (there was a few hours gap) and he missed the father daughter dance. We had it a couple songs later - but embarrassing the DJ when called for the dance, said “we can’t find the father right now so we will play some songs till he comes back” - mortified. But I smiled through it
- My mum (my parents are divorced) had a sour face during my father’s speech - no doubt to protect me - but ruined my wedding photos. Even when I was smiling through it to get through the photos. 
- My husband on my wedding night, after I broke down in tears made a comment of “hearing you tell me what went wrong and you crying is ruining my wedding memories. I loved our wedding” 
- I’ve been bullied at school, by managers (both my direct and other managers in the business) just for being either new to learning something or just a general target 
- I had the owner of the hotel in my first job tell me once “you’re getting as fat as your sisters” - I was 16 years old and slim. I’ve never been overweight or obese. Not that it fucking matters.  And the owner wanted me to bring his dinner up to his room for him and his wife one night (they lived at the top floor of the hotel) and he was in underwear and an open dressing gown. He was 60s whilst I was 16.  He’s also a massive perv. 
- My childhood memories are of my parents arguing after they put me to bed (but I was naughty and never went to sleep. I heard it all) I don’t blame them for not knowing I was asleep, but it has traumatised me that I can’t handle being in trouble and if a man shouts I will shut down.  

So I guess I am just a bit done. I got anti depressants and anti anxiety meds. I have regular calls with the doctor, a support network around me. But I am just a bit done. I don’t know why I am writing this- maybe just to get it off my chest idk. "
98,"How can I stop feeling like that? The feeling of never being good enough and just being something people can disposed of when they get bored. I'm tired of feeling like that. I know I should take my meds and everything but right now I just want to crawl into my bed, not eat, not drink and not take my meds I just can't bother because even if I do I will still feel horrible so what even is the point."
99,I lost my grandma to cancer and I miss her a lot. My dad loves me but he works a lot. My friend doesn't text me a lot. I feel so lonely. I want friends. Sometimes I feel like sleeping all day. I'm so lonely 
100,"We had a mother-daughter relationship until August 2021, she only got mad at me because I supposedly scratched her fucking laptop but nothing happened to her, she exaggerated everything,Since that day he hates me, he yells at me and treats me very badly, he insults me for everything bad that I do, today everything exploded because he says that I am ungrateful, I really act however I fucking want, he has no right At whatever time I want it, I was bullied for a year in 2nd year of high school, I told her that I didn't care, I had a problem with a classmate from high school that everyone hates for being a liar,I had problems with her before and she stopped talking to me, her mom came and called mine saying that I told everyone that a classmate X was a sexual abuser when at no time did I say that, Then my mom looked at me with a face that said she was going to kill me or something like that, I called a friend and her mom called mine saying that it was all a lie from that person, the same thing happened to her too, I told my mom that was the truth, and she said, ""I don't believe you yet."" What the hell? Believe a girl who doesn't even have any friends because of her behavior. It gets to me that he tells me you're a bitch, I don't love you, you understand."
101,"I have a piece of garbage step son.  In and out of jail.  He is a junkie and angry and wants to fight everything.  I don’t think it would take much to get this asshole to end me.  Then I will have accomplished many things.  After stealing from his elderly grandparents to his numerous drug convictions, his physical abuses toward girlfriends. ending me might show people he really is nothing more than a fucking rabid animal.  And I get the benefit of no more anything.  "
102,"so i’ve been on zoloft for two years now, my psychiatrist kept asking me to go to therapy, which i did recently and the therapist said since there’s no proper indication of what’s causing my depression there isn’t much to work with and she also thinks my depression is biological because i’m doing fine with meds

i don’t wanna take meds anymore, idk why i hate it sm i just wanna give up now i also think i might have bipolar II because ive had mania episodes before taking meds after after meds ive never had them, just depressive episodes sometimes

also have a focusing problem which is so fucking bad, i can’t study and i know that i have an potential and i’m not using it"
103,"I want to die, I cannot do anything like I am always trying to do something to make my parents proud but I think I am a total failure, there is no hope for me."
104,"I hurt a friend while blacked out. I’ve never hurt anyone before, especially like this. I lost all my friends and the love of my life and I don’t know how to live with myself. I just want to give up. I don’t want to be here anymore. I’ve cried so much over this and I lost everything and it just feels hopeless. I know if I did do anything drastic then I’d just cause more pain but I don’t feel like I have much here anymore. I’m lost and life feels meaningless now. I don’t expect help, I feel like a monster but I guess I just needed to express it somewhere especially when I have no one to talk to at this point. "
105,"Hi everyone! I’m Allie, 31, I hope this gets approved, I just made this account because I got weird dms from my last one and I didn’t want them to follow to here. Uh, yeah so I’ve been diagnosed with bpd, and haven’t been doing super amazing with managing it, my meds or my body, gender dysphoria which has been the worst I’ve dealt with in years. Everyone knows i have autism but I kind of like that about me, makes my way of thinking and stim moments make more sense to me since I truly realized I had it. Anyways lately I have thoughts of wanting these bad feelings to just go away, and it’s getting bad again. Well I just wanted to vent a little, and I hope this isn’t too graphic for this page, I can adjust it if needed. "
106,Is the past few years soo many devastating things have happened to me but I have noticed every time that I can't cry. To be specific i can't cry of sadness. I have cried due to me being angry but not of sadness. Is something wrong with me. If so how do I fix it??
107,"This might be a dumb rant, but I need to say this to someone and no one in my actual life seems to get it. 

About a year ago I was diagnosed with Dysthymic disorder. My current therapist suggested I start an anti depressant, I didn’t think I was bad enough to warrant it, so she set up a psych review. I had my diagnosis changed from dysthymia to Major depressive disorder and got prescribed an antidepressant. I know that’s a good thing really, but it feels so hard to get my head around.

It’s really tough to face up to. Even with dysthymia I always tried to blame my depressive symptoms on circumstances or my other disorders to downplay/ignore my actual diagnosis. I was very unwilling to take antidepressants until I found out about mirtazipine, because I could tell myself ""This is to help me sleep and gain weight which will make me feel less depressed"" rather than ""This is an antidepressant to treat clinical depression"". That might sound stupid but apparently it's a big difference to me. It was easier to downplay dysthymia cus It’s ""subthreshold"" depression but I can’t say that about MDD.

I think the fact that I got diagnosed with it now, when I’ve been so much worse before, just makes it tougher. Like, this isn’t even “bad” in my books, but apparently it’s bad enough to warrant an MDD diagnosis. I know my therapist was right that I needed to acknowledge it more- can’t escape a desert with your head buried in the sand- but I’ve always tried to shut it out because facing up to it makes me feel fundamentally broken. It makes me wonder if I’ve ever actually been happy or if I ever could be. I know thoughts like that are a symptom. That doesn’t make them go away.

I wish everything in my head wasn’t so contradictory.  This diagnosis makes me feel validated but lost. I’m eager to start depression treatment but terrified of actually facing up to it. I want to shut everything out and hide but I can’t stand living like this. I hate life but I’m cripplingly terrified of death. Makes everything feel like a dead end.

I guess it doesn’t really make a difference, I’m just struggling with the change and no one I’ve spoken to seems to get why. They all seem confused why I care so much about such a minor diagnosis change and I don’t know how to explain it to them. I know it’s for the best and I'm glad my therapist pushed for it,  just needed to vent and take some time to process it. "
108,"I just hate it, I’m supposed to feel grateful and I don’t. I am such a failure. I literally cant do anything right. 

I am definitely flawed. Socially, physically, morally. 

I have the worst luck possible known to man. Bad jobs, bad health, impossibly shitty things happening to me all the time. When I say I literally can’t do anything right, I can’t. I have zero peace. I can’t relax. I can’t sleep. 

The second I stand up for myself, I’m just ousted. This has happened the last two jobs I’ve had at this point. 

All I said today is that I wanted a consistent schedule for my contract, I’m being immediately dropped. I was hired for full-time work and have received a weird part-time inconsistent job where I leave super early and at random times. Saying that I would rather do a consistent schedule to the recruiter when they were the ones pushing for this to be a full time role has gotten my contract ended early when they were just offering me a permanent position earlier in the day. 

The worst part is I get married this summer. I think I’m going to be utterly miserable. I’m such a walking embarrassment I can’t even imagine so many people looking at me. 

My fiancé is so successful, I am jealous of him. He’s basically perfect person, and I’m just a creature. I literally don’t know what he sees in me. But I don’t feel lucky, I feel insanely guilty that he got me out of all the other people who would have been much better options. He could’ve had someone who was more like him, not so flawed, and instead he has a partner trying to kill themself before the wedding. I’m making him miserable. He would never say it, but I am.

I don’t even think I’m a good person, in fact, I deserve to end it. The world would be better off without me here. Everyone’s lives would be easier. 


"
109,"The past week has been nothing but this unbearable weight-an overwhelming, crushing sense of sadness and regret that hasn't left me or a second. It's like every thought, every breath is soaked in this pain, and I feel absolutely hollow.
I haven't spoken to her in two years. We weren't even that close-just classmates, friends in passing during 8th and 9th grade. But I always had a crush on her. And for some reason, this past week it's hit me harder than ever. It feels like my heart is falling apart over someone I barely even knew, but someone who made such a deep mark on me. I can't stop thinking about her. And what breaks me the most is knowing l'll probably never see her again. I'll never bump into her in the hallways. I'll never get the chance to text her, or even tell her how I felt, because I'm out of school now-and the door just feels completely shut.
I know it probably sounds pathetic. But she was genuinely special. I don't think l've ever met someone who radiated as much light and warmth as she did. She wasn't just beautiful-she was kind, smart, funny, and always smiling. Always.
And somehow, even with everything she had going for her, she still acknowledged me. She was one of the only people who ever treated me like I mattered. She gave me her number last year because she knew I had no friends. And I never texted her. Not because I didn't want to-but because I didn't feel like I deserved to. Now she probably thinks I didn't care, when the truth is... I think I loved her. Quietly, from a distance. I still do.
I've been looking at her social media, watching her life unfold-she's grown into this incredible, bright person with a future. she has a car, a job, good grades, and a family that clearly loves her.
She's always smiling in every post, surrounded by people who care. And then there's me-just stuck, empty, alone. I have nothing. No support, no happiness, no direction. Just regret. And jealousy. Deep, bitter jealousy. I wish I had a family like hers. I wish I had a family like hers. And parents who actually who showed love, who smiled at me the way hers smile at her. I wish I had her life.
It's crushing to realize she gets everything I ever wanted. And I still let her slip away without ever telling her how much she meant to me. I didn't even say goodbye when I left school. I just disappeared. I skipped class, complained about everything, wasted time I can never get back. And now I lie awake every night thinking about how much more I could've done, how many moments I missed. I should've tried harder. I should've been a better student, a better person, someone she could've actually seen.
And yet, she was still kind to me. That's what kills me the most. "
110,"Gawd how I hate feeling like this. Have been out of 1 of my anti depressants for a few days now , need to talk to my New shrink first to get refills. Just got set up with her and my memory sucks so damn bad that I can't remember the name of the office she works for.

Don't even know why I'm down , maybe it's this missing med. Still wishing my body would just shut down or I'd get a fatal disease and die.

I just want this depression to end. I've shut down to people in general, really don't know what to talk about. 

I just don't know anymore.

Just wanted to get this out into the void "
111,"My boyfriend and I have been off and on for seven years this time around we’ve been consistent for two. He’s cheated on me a few times, but only one that I have proof of I forgive him for it and we moved on but now it’s happening again. he was stationed in Korea. I wanted to take his youngest son with him so he married his youngest son‘s mother and didn’t tell me he married her a week after our two year anniversary after he told me the truth he told me that she was aware that the relationship was just on paper and that nothing would change with me and him. We continue to talk and I tryed to be understanding but today the mother of his son got on his phone and sent me a video of them having sex. I guess afterwards he took a nap and left his phone open on accident. I’m in a dark place and I’m trying to get myself out of it but I’m struggling. I have anxiety and he’s the only person that seems to calm down my mind when we’re together it’s the only person I can confide in. I don’t have anybody else to talk to besides him about things and now I feel like I don’t have anybody. It’s still nighttime in Korea and he hasn’t woken up yet so I haven’t heard from him. I just wanna go to sleep."
112,"This is a question that has been in my mind for a while now. It's not only about feeling worthless, it is about being worthless too. About my parent's not caring about my life, never asking about plans for the future, about my education, about why I don't have a single friend or go out of my room. I feel worthless, I am treated as if I am worthless hence I am worthless. I don't have plans for the future, and the lack of acknowledgment, even a firm hand when I needed it as a child, has made me as useless as a rock, in the middle of my room doing... nothing. So how do I keep on living? I don't want to date, to have friends, to feel happiness, I don't want love or attention, there is nothing I want to do for anyone and not even for myself. As an empty person, is it possible to live this way? Obviously, I am just waiting to die. "
113," Hello everyone I don't really understand where to start posting here, but I'd still like to share my experiences here. 
 
    Every day I struggle with guilt, and for absolutely everything: for what I eat, for what I breathe, for what I live, literally everything causes guilt. My partner doesn't understand this, she says it's not my fault, but I can't stop feeling guilty and ashamed of my existence. I'm sorry, I just really don't have anyone to tell. I'm tired of living like this, I've had health and heart problems lately, my parents don't care, and no matter how much I complain, I feel guilty for complaining and asking for help, the only thing I want is peace of mind and stop blaming myself, but I I just can't. The feeling of guilt haunts me, every day I am seized with anxiety and I start shaking, I think that I am unworthy of anything good. Lately, I don't even have the strength to eat and wash, the only thing I feel is drowsiness and weakness, the feeling that I'm slowly dying. I want to enjoy life, but I can't do it, I just want to live, not exist. 
 ( I use a translator because my English is not very good, I'm sorry)"
114,im cutting my neck tonight
115,"My mom’s paranoia has increased and it’s draining me. I think it’s time to do another psych evaluation and hope that maybe she sticks to taking whatever is prescribed to her. 

After my dad died it has increased 10x. She’s says he was her first everything. 

That man didn’t give a shit about her. Loved the other woman who is still in our lives ( half siblings so I’ll still see her anyway) til the very end, even though she didn’t reciprocate those feelings. My has a lot of anger against him for the past 20+ years of my life, she knew better than to expect anything out of him. He used to verbally, physically, and financially abuse her. I asked him to apologize but he still wasn’t shit to the end. I think him having Parkinson’s and dementia made her even more upset because people paid more attention to him instead of what he did to her. 

Anyways, she’s always been a bit paranoid. I’d get accused of things as a kid and I could never say or defend myself because she was the victim in every situation. The victimization has increased to where is the only one suffering in the world. Even when I’m not home I’m accused of ripping bedsheets, scratching up the tub, takings, just stupid stuff. She doesn’t let up. I’m dealing w/ my own demons and she’s adds a layer to where I feel like I’m drowning sometimes. 

Anyways, I moved back home after pop’s really began to deteriorate. Finished LPN school and doing RN bridge. The plan is to make more and leave. It’s the only way I can form a definite boundary and protect my peace. I’ll be looking locally so I can still take her to appointments, labs, and groceries. I’d really like to move out of state but I don’t think my siblings will pick up the slack. My sister already dedicates everything to her son who has Down syndrome and has a husband who doesn’t bother to take part in child rearing (her relationship, her business, I set a boundaries after I started feeling like she was depending on me too much, and not asking for assistance from that husband of her’s. If you’re going to stick beside him I’m not going to substitute). My brother, I don’t really understand what’s going on. All I really know is financial troubles and he lives about 3 hours away. I fear being trapped with her and I know it’s wrong to think that way. I was the primary caregiver for my dad, my siblings including my half siblings didn’t have my worries. I want to live life, I haven’t done that yet. "
116,"It’s not that my day is bad or anything. Went antique shopping with my mom, got ice cream, got free coffee, went to the gym for some alone time, and I’m getting some Italian food tonight. But I guess I just feel really lonely. My friends I made through studying abroad in 2023 wished my a happy birthday, but due to the physical distance, I’ve only been able to see them once in two years. My friends who live closer to me (went to my high school or college) haven’t texted me anything, even the one friend I’ve known for over 10 years. I don’t blame them, life happens. They have work, they have their own things going on, but it still hurts a little because I have all of their birthdays written in my calendar and I know them by heart. I graduated last year and haven’t been able to land a job, I live with my parents, all I do aside from job applications/working retail is go to the gym, and I have no motivation to really do anything that used to make me happy. Had a bf of 4 years but he left me 9 months ago and got a new gf a month later, so I’m still dealing with heartbreak on top of it all. 

I know birthdays don’t really matter but I just feel pretty alone even though I shouldn’t. I have family who cares about me and all but I just feel like a failure, especially with my sibling also being in town rn to look at a wedding venue— so yeah, my birthday dinner also doubles as a celebration dinner for their recent engagement. It’s great and I’m happy for them but I can’t help but compare how stagnant my life direction is compared to theirs.

Idk i’m rambling but I just feel very lonely "
117,"Hi everyone, this is my first day on here - also the first day I’ve properly admitted that I’m really depressed and an alcoholic

I’ve been a functioning one but it’s crept into every day and affecting my job, my relationship, (girlfriend has since left me after giving me “chances” but was not there when I really needed her so maybe that was for the best!) and just negatively affecting I’d say every element of my life currently 🤦‍♂️

I haven’t really got people around me that I can go to for support - My ex wife is lovely and she offers some support when I’m down but the bottles of wine have been my support network fml 

It would be good to hear from anyone with advice and how they cope when struggling 

I’ve always gone to the gym in some manner and I need to start again quickly and stick with it - I know that’s one of the go to fixes but any advice appreciated 

Thankyou "
118,"It is not a peaceful way to go. It’s several minutes of pure agony. Your lungs aren’t able to get any air but that won’t stop them trying. They’ll expand & contract painfully as you kick your legs & arms around, your skin will burn yet go blue, your heart rate will go through the roof, dizziness sets in, you’ll pass out, your organs will fail & then you’ll die. Not exactly what you thought right ?. 

The sheer amount of panic and regret you’ll feel is also terrifying. Do not do this, or any other method for that matter. "
119,"Hey. I'm a comp. sci. undergrad and while my uni environment is lively and filled with good people, I’ve been struggling a lot with myself lately. I often feel like I’m not good enough. I’m insecure about how I look and who I am as a person. I've never been in a relationship. I don’t have a social life, and most interactions I get are transactional, like people only talk to me when they need help with studies. Other than that, not once as someone approached me for anything else.

Academically, I’m doing okay, but I feel like I have nothing else going for me. I watch my friends have amazing social lives, build connections and explore their hobbies and talents while I feel stuck, invisible, and inferior. They hang out with their friends and go on trips and whatnot and I rot alone. Whenever I try to get close to people, I get scared I’m just a burden, and I end up pushing them away and ruining things. I feel so childish and immature doing this shit. It’s a horrible cycle, and I hate myself for repeating it.

Lately, these feelings have been getting darker. I'm certain that no one would bat an eye if I were to disappear one day and not show up again. I don’t always feel this way, but recently it’s been getting harder and harder to stay optimistic. I've started having dangerous thoughts. I just want this to end. "
120,"What am I working for?

I lost love of my life. Hit rock bottom, tried to make it look fine. Working and earning was my coping mechanism. Now after 5 years, With no friends, no loved ones, still being misunderstood, no one knows the real me, no one sees the real me.. i cry everyday thinking what am I working for? "
121,"I've always been a curious person, wanting to know the why's and how's of things, so the past decade of my life—since realizing I was depressed—I've been looking into every bit of information that has come my way. I'd look up what depression is, why I might've been depressed, who is likely to become depressed, how to overcome/manage it etc. I've watched countless YouTube videos about it from doctors/psychologists and those who have depression, I've read self help books, listened to audiobooks on mental health, and would try to apply tips and tricks. I saw my doctor too and tried a few anti depressants for the slim chance that they'd magically fix my whole brain.

I put all that time and effort into learning and thinking about mental health only to realize I couldn't think my way out of depression. How could I think or learn my way out of my parents hating my existence, of them calling me a burden, and of the abuse I lived through? I can tell myself hopeful words or ""I do have value"" or ""they're carrying trauma they got from their parents"" all I want, but the reality is I still hear the words they shout every day.

122,"I'm 28, I do standup comedy, I'm a busser and I don't really know what I'm doing anymore. Granted, this existential dread is coming off a break up with a girl who works in my industry who I truly love so much. 

Last night, I decided to hangout with my ex and her brother, I got black out drunk, backed into a car and apparently confided in her brother about my relationship with his sister. I know I really can't drink right now and I can't be seeing or talking to this girl right now. But now, I'm also so dejected about my life, I really love standup comedy and would love to make it a real job some day. I'm just barely surviving month to month finically and even sometimes emotionally. 

I have a degree in communication and I do have some experience working in account management and onboarding but I was fired from three jobs back to back in 2021 and have a huge gap in my resume. What I really want is just some consistency in my life, I need to get over this girl, I would love a decent job and just do comedy as much as I can until I can make something of is. I guess the advice I'm looking for is what is the best way for me to move forward? I know I need to stay away from this girl, I need to get a job and stay sober. But I guess I'm looking for some magical sentence from a stranger that will make sense to me and maybe center me? I'm not sure, I'll probably post this to a few more places. The best advice is probably to just figure it out myself and with time i'll figure it all out.   "
123,"I'm very antisocial introverted person,I also have depression.. these last 6 months of my life have been super stressful.. I've gained 30# and when I'm not working or  forced to go out, I keep to myself and have found myself in bed alot moping.. how can I get out of this hole..  im almost 40 and I'm in between places currently living at my elderly narcissistic mothers house. I feel like a burden to her..."
124,I mean it’s a part of who I am and stuff but I wonder if something like depression could ever be taken away or if it’s a core fundamental part of our personalities or something like that. Like it’s hardwired to our souls. 
125,"hello, my gf struggles with depression we’ve been together for 3 years and i’ve never seen go through an episode this bad. She tells me she prefers being alone and she self isolates
she is also going what i believe is a relapse of her eating disorder (counting calories, not eating certain things) i want the best for her and i really love her but things are getting hard on me too i just don’t feel loved and she told me that she has been thinking about breaking up but i just feel lost "
126,"I’m 20, ever since I was a kid I’ve been called things like an old soul, I’m more self aware, I’m not like everyone else. I’m so scared of making mistakes, I need to follow the rules, I hate when people are angry or disappointed in me.

Even when I was going to therapy my older therapist was talking about how I seem not like others, that I’m special.

I don’t feel connected to anyone, no one cares about me. I can’t find meaningful connections with anyone on this planet, no one I’ve ever met I’ve really related to. 

Relationships at this age are so painful. Every girl I meet doesn’t want an old soul, they want fun. I don’t, having casual sex is almost disgusting to me, not that I judge other’s relationships but I don’t and won’t want that at all in mine.



The last girl I was with was a raver, she went to bars, did substances, nothing like me, but she accepted me. When we got together occasionally she would tell me about all her sexscapades without me asking very frequently. Talking about being with men with grey hair when she first turned 18, a one night stand in another country with older men. About how she has had sex with most of her friends, including her very close women friends. I was so disgusted, but I kept it in the back of my mind. She ended up breaking up with me because she wanted “something else” . But first she had to tell me about how she felt gross around me, that when I touched her it felt gross. I’m not the one who valued sex, it was her, I did it for her and this is what happened, I’m just over trying to make people accept me, I’m over trying to change myself for others, I’m over trying at all in my life…

I don’t see myself ever even trying to fall in love again, I don’t even want to. But when I see people in happy relationships or my friends talking about girls or whatever I just get this feeling that I’m missing out on my whole life because I’m to busy battling depression. 


I know I’m young but this is all I know, so it’s all the life info I have to go on.


I feel jealous, envious, tired, depressed, sick, disgusted, anger, uncomfortable, hopelessness.

I don’t like the way I look, the way I think, the way I talk, my fashion, my personality, my hair. My skin, my fat. I don’t like myself at all, how can others? How can I love and accept others when I can’t even accept myself. Why don’t I love myself? If I just had this one thing in my life maybe I would be successful, instead of a college kid who just got kicked out of college and now is trying to figure out what makes me feel any sense of joy so I can make literally one reason to stay alive. I’m going to end up in a trade and probably kill myself in the next 2-3 years I think. "
127,"My psyche had me on cymbalta for years.  It seemed to stop working no matter what we did so he switched me to Prozac.  I had been on different doses but 5mg was what I seemed the most stable on.  For extra context, I’m dealing with serious perimenopause and am on HRT.  I do feel that the peri has complicated things tremendously.  However, doc has other patients in peri and feels that the Prozac isn’t the right choice.  So, he wants me to go on Wellbutrin.  The issue is that I have to be totally off meds for 7-10 days before I can start the Wellbutrin.  It’s only day 2 and I feel awful.  Has anyone else dealt with this?"
128,"my job is switching me to a 40 hour work week at the end of this month. i could barely handle 3 days a week and a few classes on the other days. i'm neurodivergent, i'm overstimulated by just being in the presence of my coworkers for the entire day. not to mention, i'm the only one doing my specific task, so it gets overwhelming easily. i also feel othered, as my desk is in the back, away from everyone and no one makes an attempt to include me in their conversations and jokes (not that i want people to talk to me all day, but i hate feeling ostracized just as much.) the only person who talks to me is the janitor who peeks over my shoulder and strikes conversations about what i'm watching on my phone, even asking for my discord (which i said i would write down after lunch and didn't. barely dodged it). there's also a girl who loudly talks at me on the whole bus ride home, and the walk from the bus, often complaints and ranting. 

on top of that social aspect, my body is in PAIN from how exhausting it is to mask and navigate unpredictable conversations. i feel nauseous all the time, i can barely eat one meal, i have constant migraines, my legs swell and feel tingly, and so much more. all of this is just for three days out of the week. i now have to go into this job EVERY WEEKDAY FOR EIGHT HOURS. i just can't do it. i was not meant to live in this capitalistic nightmare. i can't quit because i'm my sole income and i was unemployed for a year and a half before this, which was so much more scary. i don't have time for myself and i feel my life slipping away. i don't want to do it. i can't."

what happened to me: went through a breakup october last year 2024, had a fling and found out he's taken then told the girl that her bf is a cheater, but instead she got mad at me and bully me on social media, and got dropout of school bc i feel burnout.


a year after (2025), i still laugh and there are things that makes me happy but i still feel empty. it came to the point i overeat, don't go outside the house, fucked up body clock (i can't sleep at night), i refuse to see my friends because i don't have the enrgy and im insecure with my weight an physical appearance, and i lost my motivation to do activities such as going to gym, walking, and running. my room is so freaking messy to the point there are cockroaches living there. i dont cry often but i feel sad inside and there's no spark. i just smile and look happy when i face my friends and family, but it's just a mask that conceals what i truly feel.

130,"Lately, I’ve been struggling with a persistent feeling of fragmentation. I don’t experience myself as a single, unified person, but as a set of shifting selves—each one emerging depending on who I’m with, what’s expected, or what I think will keep things calm and manageable. These selves aren’t necessarily false, but they don’t feel like the whole picture. Sometimes they contradict each other. Sometimes they act in silence while another takes over. I’ve started to wonder if there is any real version of me underneath, or if I’ve spent so long shifting between roles that I’ve lost sight of what’s authentic—if that even exists.

This internal contradiction has become exhausting. There are moments when I want connection deeply, but I don’t know how to offer it without performing a version of myself that feels safe to others. At the same time, I long to be seen for who I truly am—but the idea of revealing that is so uncomfortable, even threatening, that I retreat instead. I live in that tension constantly: needing closeness but fearing exposure, craving honesty but relying on masks that have become second nature. This creates a constant sense of being pulled in opposite directions—between what I feel and what I express, between who I am and who I’m supposed to be.

Masking plays a central role in this. It’s not something I do occasionally—it’s the default. In social settings, I construct how I come across with precision, not to manipulate, but to protect others from what I’m feeling inside. I try to appear fine, stable, agreeable. I do it to avoid discomfort, conflict, or pity. But it comes at a cost. Every time I hide how I’m really doing—whether out of fear, obligation, or habit—I feel myself becoming less visible, even to myself. I often feel like I’m performing care for others while disconnecting from my own inner experience. Over time, that gap between who I show and who I am has grown wider, and it's left me feeling increasingly isolated, even in close relationships.

I feel numb most of the time—not as a temporary state, but as a kind of constant dullness beneath everything. It’s like there’s a wall between me and my feelings, and though I can mimic engagement, I rarely feel fully present. The act of appearing okay—of carrying on, smiling, responding—feels mechanical. And after each interaction, I’m left with a kind of emptiness that’s hard to name. It’s not just fatigue—it’s a hollowing out. The more I mask, the more I lose touch with whatever is underneath.

On top of all this is the absence of memory—especially from childhood. So much of my early life is blank or inaccessible. The memories I do have are faint, emotionally disconnected, and often hard to trust. It feels like the foundation I was supposed to build my identity on just isn’t there. Without a past I can rely on, the present feels unstable, and the future hard to imagine. I try to fill in the gaps with thought—with questions, with analysis—but the more I search, the more lost I feel.

These patterns have led to a persistent feeling of dissociation. I often don’t feel like I’m living my life so much as watching it happen from a distance. I see myself going through the motions—speaking, moving, reacting—but it rarely feels like I’m the one in control. It's as if I'm a spectator trapped in my own body, disconnected from both agency and experience. There are times when I move through entire days without really registering them. I can describe what happened, but I wasn’t there. And that absence—of self, of emotion, of presence—deepens the numbness in ways I can’t always explain.

Mentally, I feel constantly drained. The loops of questioning, self-analysis, and doubt never seem to stop. Even when I try to rest or engage in something I used to enjoy, my mind keeps spinning. I often attempt to do things that once brought comfort or pleasure—reading, listening to music, video games, being outside—but I can’t fully be in them. They feel like distractions, not sources of renewal. I go through the motions, hoping they’ll help, but I can’t connect. The exhaustion from carrying all these thoughts makes it almost impossible to find stillness or joy.

This sense that meaning itself is unstable only adds to the weight. When so much of who I am and how I act seems shaped by circumstance or survival, I struggle to know what’s real. I get caught in loops: What does it mean to care about anything? What value can I assign to my choices if they’re shaped by forces I didn’t choose? How do I decide what matters when everything feels arbitrary? These thoughts don’t just hover in the background—they consume me. They make everything feel flat, unmotivated, unreal.

The depression and disconnection I’ve been experiencing feel wrapped around all of this. It’s not just a low mood—it’s a sense that I’ve lost the thread of who I am. The selves I shift between can keep me functioning, but they don’t bring me closer to feeling alive. I want to talk about this—not because I expect clarity or quick answers, but because I don’t want these thoughts to continue silencing me from the inside. I want to know if there’s a way to live with all of these contradictions—these fragmented selves—without erasing the possibility of wholeness or connection.

It is not death I fear, but living a life of masks, never feeling what is underneath."
131,So basically I have been talking to this girl for very long and she actually liked me and I liked her back and we hung out and everything. My friend was together with her friend so we all 4 talked and stuff but today all 3 of them hanged out and my friend took my girl(friend) (the girl i was talking to) phone and wrote a bunch of stuff and told me to meet her so I took the bus to the place they told me to be at so I was there but no one was there so I messaged them and then my friend sent a picture of his face and then I understood everything was a joke so I asked where they really was and then i took the bus to that place but they wasnt there either so I got really sad and thought the girl told them to do it and stuff so i just blocked her and then all of her friends wrote to me and stuff but then i see her on her private tiktok being really sad and I just feel like I made the only person that liked me sad and i ruined everything

133,"As the days go by in a blur I can feel my body slowly starting to give in. Little by little. Everyday. I am dying inside. But, I hide it behind a smile. I pretend that I am okay. I listen to the concerns of my family in their everyday lives. I listen to their hardships. I push aside my own feelings. Bury them down deep. I listen to my husband as he talks through his depression. But I can't be as supportive as I want, and when I try it almost always seems to fail. I fail everyone. Even though I keep my problems mostly to myself, I still fail everyone else. I hate myself so much for this. I can't be the wife that I want to be. Or the daughter. Or the sister. I feel like I'm carrying this impossible weight on my shoulders, but no one sees it. Maybe I'm just selfish. I don't want people to worry about me, but sometimes it would feel nice I guess. Even writing this I feel like an awful person. I just...I want to quit. I want to die. I don't think anyone really sees it except for my husband. I'm just tired. I'm so tired. And I'm not sure how much longer I can keep pushing through. My body is giving in. And the worst part about it? I don't even care. And that scares me. "
134,"I'm 18 years old, and just finished my first year, and I'm struggling with poor grades. I would always either leave assignments till the last second or do them early but not properly, and in a few instances, I would forget and miss the due date deadline and not finish the work if it was too difficult. I would always lose my focus and mind whenever I stumbled upon something challenging, and end up not doing it. When it comes to myself, I can never concentrate on much stuff I forget info very quickly. It's essentially like I don't want to focus on studying because I can never have the motivation to do so. Since the start of middle school, I never got good grades, even though it was the easiest; I still struggled. From high school to now end of my first year at university, everything got so much more difficult for me. And now I'm doing so shit at uni that I got an email saying ""I've been withdrawn from the school"" which killed my entire mood for the summer break and my entire life. In uni Ive missed a lot of lectures knowing that im gonna screw up If i didnt go but I'm a fucking failure so I chose to not go and screw myself up. Now I have no idea what to do now my gpa is so low to were idek whereever school I wanna transfer to will accept me thats how bad i did first year like a fucking loser i am. I will always get upset, say that I'm going to change, only to repeat the same thing over and over again. It's almost like a never-ending cycle. I fucking hate the human being that I am who can never do anything right besides failing and keep upsetting my parents. Sadly, this never-ending cycle might happen when I get older to the point where nobody wants me from me failing or barely pass my exams. Some of my assignments, I would either get a bad mark or do it last second and get flagged for academic misconduct. After I got the email saying that I've been withdrawn from the school, my mental health got even worse to the point that I wanna end it all and not give my parents anymore pressure about myself, but also my future. Right now, I'm terrified to tell my parents that I have withdrawn from the school since they wouldn't be able to sleep or do anything. Everytime I wake up I feel like im always a fucking idiot, failure, and a loser, why can't I get good grades and be in school like everyone else im around with. Why am I so shit at everything. I get distracted so easily to the point where I'm thinking about scenarios about what is gonna happen to me and my future. I would even rather sit in my room doing nothing rather than study, especially since there's so much to study and it's too difficult and overwhelming for me. Sometimes I feel like I can't do this on my own; I need to fix this issue since it's ruined my life. I'm 18 now doing much worse with school, still acting the same way, screwing my own life up and making my parents lives much more difficult. I went from being happy and cheerful to depressed, anxious, and a failure (especially when it comes to school). My parents, ofc care about me and love me, but I won't change the fact that I'm super disappointed in myself for putting myself in today's position. Also not seem to be capable of changing for the better or knowing how to go about changing. I feel like a little child amongst adults. I can't take it anymore, I just want to be better and do well in school, but I don't make the necessary changes anything since I don't know how to. I want to know how to concentrate and study well. There's probably just going to be some rude and judgmental bum replying, but at this point, I just really need help.

  
I am very sorry for typing this much. The only reason why I want to share this is because me being an 18-year-old, I need help, and I need directions to my future. "
135,"Hey.. so im a 15 years old boy who is a teenager anyways..
Here it begins
So uhm i always lived in an Islamic family
My dad is a narcissistic man and my mum is kind also she have diabetes thats why she kinda angry all time.. so it begins when my mum get forced to marry my dad, mum never loved him my mum would even do sex with him forcefully so she doesnt divorce him.. she doesnt have enough money so she can divorce him

I dont have so many friends.. 
I always live in delusional as i think i will live in another life where i can be handsome having a good childhood...
I have more things to say but i think i talked so much 😭"
136,"Nothing in my life will ever get better. Anything I try to fix and deal with something always has to intervene and make it worse whether it's directly or indirectly. I'm so tired of constantly dealing with  a new dilemma after another dilemma piled onto my already existing life-haunting problems. Why did I even have to be born in the first place? This could have all been prevented. I got beaten with the ugly stick of life, literally and figuratively. My health is only going to get worse, I'm only going to get worse and look worse and age and have more stress piled onto me which will mess me up even more. I don't believe I will live that long anyway. Every day I wake up I deal with depression, pessimism, anxiety, lookism and heightism, and being treated like I'm lesser than. All the time I deal with the feeling like the whole world hates me and I'm doomed to be cursed no matter how nice I try to be. All these years I yearned for life to get better and it never truly has.

139,"About a month ago i had a bit of a drug problem. I was snorting 30-50mg of ritalin a day and smoking weed everyday and at night i took 50-100mg if amitriptyline to help me sleep and make me feel good because i was struggling with depression and it was like a break from life for me. One day i snorted 30mg ritalin in the morning and drank 50mg amitriptyline and snorted another 25mg and felt amazing but the next morning i felt very groggy so i decided to drink a energy drink, about 2 hours later i had my first ever seizure and it was at school in front off my whole class and a few teachers. I woke up in the emergency room with my mom and i had to come clean to her about the amitriptyline but i couldnt tell her about the ritalin because i feel like that would have hurt her too much and i love my mom and dont want to ruin my relationship with her. The brain scans, blood test and urine test came back clean but my pulse was extremely high and i ended up getting booked off from school for a week and missed alot of important school work. After my seizure my mindset changed and i realised i got die at any moment and i dont want to care about the opinion of others anymore and i just want to be happy. Now (a month after my seizure) i do care less about what others think but i still feel really depressed, mentally exhausted and like my life is never going to be the same after my seizure. I want to die but i dont have suicidal thoughts, i just want to be happy for once. I feel overwhelmed by my school work, i feel like i never get a break from life and i am always busy, i constantly get cravings for snorting ritalin but i know doing it again could cause another seizure and potentially death and i dont want to hurt my family. I just want my parents to be proud of me and i want to be happy. I feel like my life is going nowhere and im just suffering until the day i die. School is getting too much and i dont know how to talk to somebody about it without consequences and i miss how happy i was when i was 10 years old and didnt have any worries in life. I feel like a disappointment and i pretend to be fine in front of my friends and family. I have ADHD and im really struggling to focus on school without the ritalin and the ritalin was the only thing that helped me not getting overwhelmed and made me feel happy and focused. I now just smoke weed but weed doesnt feel the same anymore and i dont evens want to smoke it anymore. Life is just shit. I am also trying to quit vaping so i hope that goes well and i just want to improve my life and be successful and happy one day"
140,"Hello, M (29) really struggling rn and looked at my phone and I have absolutely nobody but my already burdened partner to speak to. It's hard for me to make friends with this disorder. If anyone feels the same and want to start a group chat, friendship, or just someone you can always message that gets it, please don't hesitate to message me. It's hard to do this alone, I'm in therapy so I do have some tools. I'm on a positive path and really only have minor hiccups. But who knows what could come out of this.

142,"I'm 18 and currently unemployed and it is a burden (obviously). I graduated high-school last year and haven't found a job yet and I feel the weight of it on my shoulder anytime I talk with my father. I grew up with the idea that work was something ethical and a crucial part of human life (and it is). I was promised by my parents and the adults around me that through work I would have a decent, fulfilling life. The thing is that none of these people actually got these things either. Since I've been unemployed for five months now I have my father telling me all the time that I need to do this and that in order to make a life out of myself. He tells me that work is the only way to make a life and that hard work and effort is what I need. Yet, even with that, he still didn't make a good life of his own. Don't get me wrong, I don't think my father is terrible and miserable and his life is a waste, bla bla bla... I just can't help but not believe in all of this because the exemples I have don't pay for the promises that are made. My father has been working since I was born yet we're still poor. We can't afford to be sick, buy new clothes and my parents debts will probably live longer than them. So how am I supposed to believe that working is the way if this is the exemple I have? Over all of this, every single day I have to hear my parents comment about how the economy is shit and how the world is shit. That also leaves me hopeless. Things are shit and working hard didn't get anyone I know anywhere - so why would I do it? Why would I give away my life and body for work if it won't get me nowhere? And I don't blame my parents on the poor life I (and they) have. I know that this is all about capitalism and that they're just a product of the time and world they live in. But... all of this judgement that adults (older ones) put on me just makes me more and more hopeless.

I know most of gen-z relates to this too. Work, the economy and just life under capitalism in general is just so terrible now (it always have been, to be fair). And all of the judgement from older people don't help at all. Most of the time I daydream about a zombie apocalypse (like The Walking Dead) happening just so I won't have to deal with all of this anymore. And this hopelessness in the future also goes for change. I don't believe I will be alive to see the fall of capitalism or at least a change for the ""better"". So overall I just don't have any hope or energy to believe that I will have a good life. I don't even think I can have the bare minimum based on how things are going.

Can anyone relate to this?

143,"i dropped out of school because i couldn’t go, the thought that everyone was looking at me, judging me, talking bad about me even though they weren’t got to my head. Now i find myself an adult, doing the same thing at work, when my co workers look at me i know they are thinking how ugly i look. It’s so exhausting 24/7 thinking the people driving past when i walk to work are judging me. I’m sick of looking in the mirror and crying, feeling like everyone talks bad about me, i’ve never had a boyfriend because i don’t like myself so how could anyone like me? the suicidal thoughts are becoming more and more attractive these days :( "

People telling me to get over it experienced this first hand over years, but I just get a week?? Because what am I without my bank balance and name worthy job? I hope these people know they are the prime reason my hole is getting deeper.  I am searching for my light and dare anyone say I'm not trying. If I didn't try I wouldn't exist to type this post. Take time. Don't stress. But job chhodna mat.....phirse nhi milega.

145,"I dont know if I'm autsitic or not but I score pretty high on the online tests but I feel like in social situations esp new ones I will mask heavily. I just say what I think the other person wants to hear rather than what's actually going on in my head. I have very low self confidence and I just don't know how to build it. I do like myeslf though and I know I have potential for growth...  I have no real close connections at all and am very lonely and depressed as a result. 

i used to hyperfixate on utaite stuff and make covers but the depression got to me and recently I've just sitting around all day smoking weed and being sad and sleepy. 

I see no reason to try hard, no reason to live other than to satisfy urges of hunger or sex or drugs. The urge to be understood and loved but never achieving it. Self love is difficult, so damn difficult, because it doesn't feel like love trying to force yourself to get sunlight, to force yourself to get your cardio in, to force yourself just to fit in so you can live another lonely day. I wonder if the older generations had it easier, I just don't know how to reliably make friends. I don't want to have to rely on luck because that has not gotten me even close to where I want to be. i heard that is what antidepressants are for, to allow your brain tno fuctionn at an almost normal nevel so you have the motivation to do the things that will make your mind better. 

Honestly I feel like typing this out has been pretty helpful. Just ranting here, it's better than trying to explain this to my family. They love me but absolutely nothing they have done has helped me. And sadly enough I think I'm starting to realize that my family might not be compatiable with me. I've been trying so hard to be nice around my mom but she will fake a smile when talking to me, I can sense it and I hate it I hate her I can't stand her nagging anymore. I hate everyone on my mom's side they just can't get off me. I want to move out so bad but I'm so scared I'd be doing it alone I have no one to help me maybe that's okay I think I should just give it a go. Not much I'd lose

146,"Previously I raised a question about my decision that I want to come off the antidepressant (mirtazapine) and while reading the comments I realized that I should have added more. If you left a comment then thank you!!!!

So I started this antidepressant in November because my insomnia went crazy and I could not sleep at all and my anxiety went so high and after I had a clinical depression… I could not get out of the bed and I was suicidal. I started mirtazapine and it knocked my out… I was not very well after taking it for 1-2 months… I was really tired and sleepy and was anxious mainly because of my work (I was not working at that time… but I was anxious that I can not work again.)

Now I dont have any issue, no insomnia, no anxiety and no depression at all. I can not really say that I have no feelings… . I feel normal now. I have feelings and I can sleep well and now I am also working (from home).

I want to come off the med as I am getting more weight and the nightmares are intense. I will have a call with my GP soon ( previously I had a call too and told me that I can come off after 6 months… I can start it in June). I am also doing therapy with psychotherapist.

I am fine now but I want to be fine without the med and I am also scared too. I know everybody is different and we have different experiences. I know how to taper (I read a lot about it). I am really scared and have a feeling that I am on heroin and coming off will be a nightmare and the withdrawal kicks off and it will send my to the floor - depression, anxiety, insomnia. "
147,I don’t know how else to describe it. But I feel … not in my own body. I feel exhausted no matter how much I sleep. So I either sleep alot or not enough. I’ll spend hours doom scrolling. And I don’t even wanna be doing that. But I can’t stop. I find myself feeling so angry. I want to cry. But I can’t. I hate people. Politics. Society. And I’m starting to fear that I’ll … end my life. Cuz more often I’m thinking to myself what’s the fucking point?! I don’t think I want to live anymore. Everything feels fucked and cost so much money. There has to be better than this. Right? 
148,"I have been depressed since I was 14. I'm 31 now. (Female) I have everything going well in my life. I'm just depressed, or should I say, extremely unmotivated and there isn't any palpable reason. I was on Venlafaxine for almost a decade and it worked really well until it started giving me panic attacks. I was switched to Lexapro. Been on it for 3 years, made me a zombie, killed my cognition. Took half a year for any sexual function and libido to come back. Because of that I will never try another SSRI or SNRI. I've tried bupropion and it was amazing, but it gave me tachycardia, that didn't go away even after a month. I could have 180 bpm just carrying one light grocery bag. Since then I've tried trazodone, vortioxetine, mirtazapine. Currently I'm on 50mg of lamotrigine and all it does is giving me joint pain and making me sleep 14 hours. I'm desperate and frankly angry at my depression. It makes me so physically exhausted as if I was gravely ill, while I'm in perfect health labs wise. Has anyone ever be been in such situation? Has anyone found a solution? "
149,"A bit of a rant here, and hear me out, but I don’t think I deserve to feel depressed. Like I know I am, cause I’ve been most of my life and my therapist have told me that I am, but then I come on here and I read all your stories, which are so heartbreaking, it leaves me thinking that I am just being dramatic and need to relax. I wasn’t beaten by my parents, I wasn’t neglected, I wasn’t gang raped, I have a good degree, I make decent money, I have some friends, not a lot, but more than 5, so what do I have to complain about? I have severe acne, which to be fair makes me hate myself, and I had a strict upbringing. Big fucking whoop. U know? I have acne, okay get over yourself, it’s not like I was sex trafficked or raped by my dad or have lost an arm or leg or have been homeless. It just feels like I am missing something to feel this way. Like I don’t deserve it, like I haven’t suffered enough, because there is always someone who has had it worse. So why do I feel this way? Why am I so fucking empty. So I started selfharming recently, just as a way to feel more included in my diagnosis, but not even this feels right, it just feels like I am a poser. I really want this feeling to go away, cause it’s exhausting on top of being depressed, to not even feel the right to the one thing that in some fucked up way brings me comfort. "
150,"I'm exhausted. My movement is slow and sometimes standing is too difficult. I often drop things because I'm too weak to hold on or I can't concentrate. I can feel my heart beating heavily and it aches a little bit. My breathing is heavier than usual. I feel a constant pressure in my head and it hurts. I feel hot and a little dizzy. 

No virus or bacteria is causing this. It's my brain. It doesn't stop. It's so bad that I'm constantly looking at the clock waiting for the day to end so i can sleep and escape the pain. The though of having to endure this torture for the rest of the day horrifies me. I'm in so much pain. I'm too tired to scream. I'm even too tired to SH. I'm tired of living and I just want it to stop. I don't know how much longer I can endure. I want to collapse to the ground and give up. I'm fighting this battle every day but nobody knows how bad it really is. I hope I'll lose one day. I don't want to do this anymore."
151,"I am 16 years old. I am diagnosed with depression, generalised anxiety, and adhd. Lately having outbursts of anger and I can't control it for most of the time. My family is ignoring all my signs for help. I had a therapist for quite sometime but it didn't last long. I didn't want my family to pay for it either. I have had suicidal thoughts for almost 5 years and ever since I lost contact with my therapist my family started treating me worse. I don't know what to do anymore, it seems everything I do doesn't please them. I tried being expressive and I get punished verbally. I tried being silent but for them it's a form of rebelling. I tried hiding my emotions behind a mask and they call me fake. Every choice I make always leads me back to being alone. They tell me I should solve my problems alone because I'm a man and that's what men should do. They don't know I stopped loving myself ever since my mom left for 3 years. She came back but never apologised for what she did, she didn't really mean it. She apologised just to say she apologised. My siblings hurt me physically and I am not allowed to retaliate. They expect me to just endure the pain but look happy in the same time. I recently opened up to my parents about my suicidal ideation but as you guessed nothing changed. Almost like they didn't care. No matter how hard I try the pain never goes away. And at this point I have no one else to talk to."
152,"posted this on r/anxiety too, just wanted some more feedback

i just wanted to vent some fears i've had recently about my meds. i've been taking wellbutrin for about 6 1/2 weeks now for my depression and anxiety and it still feels like it's not working, especially today. there is so much happening in my life right now and many things i'm trying to get over, and if this medicine doesn't work i don't know what i'm gonna do. i guess i'd just try some other drug but it just feels like the road to recovery is taking ages, and i'm running out of patience and energy. i know it's irrational to put all my hope into a medication to make my mind happy, but i have also been making the right moves in exercise, hobbies, socializing, etc. and i still feel like i'm in a bad place mentally. i'm just so tired and so anxious."
153,"Hi. I’m a trans man. I’m stealth. I have a girlfriend, a decent job, I don’t struggle too bad with money but I would definitely do better making more. I’ve been so depressed and I don’t know why. I don’t have motivation for anything. I even take anti depressants. It feels like I wake up every day and do it all over and I want to kill myself. I love my girlfriend to death and I don’t want to hurt her. My father wants me to move back to California with him. And I want to but I’m terrified. Terrified to be out there on my own. I’m scared my lack of motivation will make me drown out there but I know I’ll feel so much safer. I don’t know what to do. My girlfriend said she’ll move with me but she has to save up first. I love her but she’s terrible with saving. She says she’s committed though. I just don’t know why I’m so depressed and anxious"
154,"*Bit of a long post but I'd really appreciate any similiar stories or advice.*

I'm stuck between two options and I can't decide what to do. I can't make my mind up about whether I should go back on antidepressants before a big move (moving countries for university) or push through and see how I feel once I get there.

There's a lot of backstory that I'll discuss to provide context but my main issue is the mood swings. For months straight it was constant depression whereas now it'll come more intensely when I'm alone. The moment I'm doing something productive or I'm busy, I'm motivated and energetic and all happy but as soon as I'm alone or bored or get rejected (e.g. everyone's busy), I'll enter this deep state of 'there's no point', 'we're all going to die anyway, why not now?', 'life is boring and the bad outweighs the good' and get tunnel vision and believe that there's no hope. And if I pay too much attention to these thoughts then it triggers my anxiety and I get panicky about being 'stuck on Earth'. 

I think the main cause of this existential depression is boredom. I graduated high school in July 2024, moved to Spain in September, absolutely hated it and moved back home in October and ever since then, I've had nothing much to do. Most of my friends have moved away, the city I live in (Dubai) is full of shallow people and the activities get boring once you've lived here for long enough, too young for clubbing but too old for house parties, etc. It did get a bit better once I started university here in January 2025 but that existentialism was still there due to the lack of proper student life. I began antidepressants in October and tried a new medication (Pristiq) in April which made me go completely insane. Made me lose any feeling of connection to anyone, ended up breaking up with my long-time boyfriend out of nowhere, immense anger and sadness and depression. Yeah. So stopped taking that after 5 days and just decided to come off everything completely. 

No antidepressants, no occasional xanax or zofran (emetophobia), no birth control, nothing. It sucked for a few days but I felt good afterwards. The anxiety was barely there and I felt motivated and energetic. But then I kinda hit a brick wall and while the anxiety was still barely there, the depression came back ten fold, but in waves. One hour I'd be all fine and dandy but the next I'd feel suicidal. It's started to confuse not only myself but the people around me and I'm clueless. I don't know what to do. I'll think that I'm finally healed and better but then I'll feel stuck and hopeless and it's the same cycle.

**This is where I need people's opinions / input because I can't make up my mind:**

I'm moving to Edinburgh in September because my university has multiple campuses in different locations and my boyfriend is going to their campus in Scotland. I'm debating whether to **start a new antidepressant now** to make the transition smoother or to **push through and hope** that being constantly busy in an actual student city will help eliminate that existential depression. I know that only I can know what's best for me but I'm genuinely clueless at the moment. What if the new antidepressant doesn't work and it makes everything worse? Or it dulls down the personality I'm finally getting back since this whole thing started? Or what if I don't take any medication and once I move to Edinburgh, I can't cope with the anxiety of moving and end up panicking / falling into an even deeper depression?

If I had more time, I'd most likely go through the trial and error process of antidepressants but I only have 3 months until I move. And I really don't want to go through the negative side effects just to find out that the certain medication I started isn't for me. 

Sorry for making this so long but I'm honestly a bit desperate. If anyone has gone through something similiar or has any advice, I'd be so happy to hear it."
155,Hi. I am not formally diagnosed with a depressive disorder but I do psychology and have noticed some signs of my behaviour that might require an consult. I have been thru a lot so Ig it does make sense if I do have depression. I >!also tried to k!ll myself last october and nearly died. !<No one in my family cares if I live or die. The only person who would is dead... so why should I continue to live... I have no reason to. There is literally nothing in the world rn that would make me change my mind. I hate that im feeling like this but it is the truth. My family legit have said that they want me to die so should i do it? Please help me.
156,Hi! I’m just questioning this because I know someone in my family who says he is depressed but he is still high functioning. I heard someone say that if you are depressed you only lay in bed and do nothing with a blanket over your head. But he is still working and going outside. 
157,"i’ve overheard news recently that my mother told my siblings that she’s beginning to hate me, and she hates herself for it.

i push her away often and i’m aggressive towards her. she annoys me almost every time we speak even if she’s not being annoying. my depression is making me so irritable, especially to her. she says that she’s tried everything to help me but literally all she’s done is put me in therapy. she doesn’t care at all. she hasn’t taken any time to learn more about depression or how to take care of a teen that’s struggling with it, she never asks to take me out of the house (yet complains that i never go anywhere with her?) then she has the nerve to complain about me and the way i’ve been acting to my siblings instead of talking to me about it?

it seems like she was so quick to immediately hate me because im a little mentally ill. she hasn’t done anything to work through this with me and acts like she’s tried everything known to man.

not to mention, my dad also doesn’t believe in any of it. he keeps telling me that it’s a choice and a mindset that i can just change. i’m so fed up."
158,"I’m currently a junior in highschool, and I live with my boyfriend.  Not because I have a bad family, it’s easier for me to get back and forth to my job that way.  I really feel like I have no reason to be depressed is the issue.  I don’t have any problems that could make anyone depressed.  I live in a decent environment, I have a job, and I’m always surrounded by people I love.  It’s just that I feel like i’m stuck in a loophole.  Like I have no freedom and that I don’t enjoy anything I do. As much as I’m lucky to have my job (which I dreamed of, I work at a horse farm) I’m burnt out as hell.  Yet, I can’t quit becuase I need the money and I can’t find another job that offers the schedule that I want or is close by.  

It really irritates me as well because my boyfriend has never been depressed.  Like he generally doesn’t mind waking up.  There are days where I literally wish I passed away in my sleep.  I just don’t understand how people have the will to live honestly.  I’m wondering if what i’m feeling is because of my job, or is it because of my brain.  But I’ve felt this way most of my life.  I’ve always felt as if life is meaningless and there’s not much that I could say is worth living for.  I guess i’m just looking for a will to live but it’s hard when I feel like I can’t enjoy anything.  I just dread waking up everyday, I feel like i’m forced to do the things I do just to get by.  "
159,Too nice for a toxic man and too toxic for a nice man. 
160,I don't want to be social anymore. Pretending to be normal and not depressed while being around others is exhausting. Knowing I'll have to work a  dead end 9 to 5 for the next 40 years just so I can have a place to live sounds terrible. Then all the other adult tasks are so boring and I don't care to do anything of it. How am gonna force myself to do this until I'm 70? I just want to disappear and go off  the grid so I can be alone for the rest of my life.
161,"Any small daily habits or routines that keep you going or help your mood even just a little bit? for me it’s probably taking my medication, getting out of bed (can’t spend the day bed rotting or i’ll feel so much worse), drinking lots of water so i feel like i’ve achieved something small for my health, having tea in the morning as a daily ritual, going for walks (especially to cafes where i won’t feel alone and the atmosphere is warm) and reading a small poem or something that helps me feel seen, for me rn it’s kafka’s letters to milena. "
162,"On my burner for the obvious, I guess, but I don't know honestly how long I'll be here. There's a part of me that's always felt like I would live a short life or was bound to a short existence. I (30F) was diagnosed with anxiety & depression in my teens and have been in therapy for a bit, but honestly I don't know if I can climb out of the valley I've been in.

I don't feel like myself and I don't remember what it was like to be myself at this point. I'm not sure when I started to fall down the current hole I'm in but it just feels like I've been blanketed in the heaviest kind of sorrow for fucking ever. And here's the thing that I don't feel like anyone around me understands: I can act my way around, tap dance for those I'm in front of and be a marionette of happiness. I'm a part-time fitness instructor and I preach a kind of radical acceptance and working on happiness to all of my clients, but it's a big front. I'm a loser who can't even follow or take my own advice.

I have a husband, a dog pay our mortgage, work full-time & part-time jobs and I'm the otherwise perfect on paper human. But here's the thing about depression: no one tells you how hard it is to climb out of the pit once you're in it, and have to feign that you never fell in the first place. Honestly, I'm done with it. I hate feeling this way and I just want it to stop. The feelings, the loneliness of the feeling and the noise in between my ears. I know ending it all would be shocking to those who know me, out of left field. But in my head it's been there all along.

I've been thinking about ending it today. More than usual. Those thoughts used to make me sad and scared, but today I have a certain calmness that it would be really possible for me to just disappear. Everyone would be better off. I never used to really believe that, but today I think I really do. I feel badly about the shrapnel that ending my life would have on my family, but not to the depth that I've been feeling more constantly each and every day. My husband deserves a better teammate in life, a happier life than what I can do for him. I haven't liked myself in a long time and I don't think he does anymore either.

So Reddit, I don't really know why I'm here or what any of this means. Maybe half of me thought it would be easier to leave some kind of trace of my existence once I'm gone.

I'm sorry, I just can't stay anymore."
163,"I’m 19 years old and for the last couple years I’ve suffered through a lot of bad situations such as being in a toxic relationship, losing friends because I try to explain myself, I’ve lost the people I could normally be able to depend on everyday. It’s as if I don’t matter to anyone no more, I try my best to fit in and hide my feelings and it never works. Even on and off of social media, I feel like a complete outcast to other people. I tend to forget about it but those thoughts start rushing it. 

On top of that I’ve gotten more depressed as the more I’ve lost the friends I try to look up to. Then I sit with my thoughts and reflect on what  I could’ve done better. But then eventually I realize I ruin everything and waste everyone’s time and I’m not physically and mentally capable of having friends

I wake up everyday ever since graduating last year feeling like there’s no purpose of being on this earth anymore if I’ve got no one to rely on. I don’t cry about the shit I’ve been through because what’s even the point in doing that? No one’s gonna show sympathy or even recognize a person like me is down to their deepest levels

I’ve been focused on myself after these moments occurred but at the same time it hurts not having any friends or barely any family members around to talk about my problems. 

Im sorry if this was a long ass post it’s just something I couldn’t keep on my mind any longer "

168,"A guinea pig i used to interact with everyday died yesterday.
He was trapped in the cage, alone, depressed.
Always relied on strangers to feed her. Her name was nina.
Her owner did not feed her properly, maybe another guinea pig, her partner also died due to the same reason.
I used to talk to her everyday whenever i came to use the lift.
It used to make me feel good.
I related to her greif, i am also alone, fighting for survival, caged in a vicious cycle of second class life.
Kindess of random people give me a little boost to go on a bit more.
But inside, i am burned out, done with this life, hopeless about my future, a broken man. 
No trusted person to talk to,no friend or family to rely on.

170,"Hello all. Just wanted to know if you’ve experienced something like this, if it’s temporary, and ways to get out of this.

Recently I’ve been feeling very disconnected from everyone and everything. Im 10 days sober so that hasn’t been very easy. I’ve always struggled with depression since I was a kid, but it seems to be getting worse. I went on an antidepressant a few months ago and it did nothing but make me get fat. 
I was in school away from home for 2 years and i went back home to see my family and best friends but I feel so disconnected from everyone and everything. I can’t be present. I can’t fully enjoy things or even feel anything besides sadness. I was thinking of going on a digital detox and journaling, meditating, and going out more, maybe exercising mkre. I used to exercise regularly but these last few months have been hard for me so I stopped. I hope it works.

If you’ve felt this way, how do you get out of it? "
171,"I hate everything about me. I feel like I worked so hard to get where I’m at today and then people say things to me that are offending and it doesn’t happen all the time. I know I’m not perfect and I’m human so I make mistakes and I know I’m not everyone’s cup of tea. I know because of the way I live and my past I live in constant go mode and I feel like I have to defend myself sometimes. I’m a single mom and life is hard for me. I have a good job but working in mental health is hard on me including all
Of life things. "
172,"I'm so fucking tired all the time, I have no energy, no motivation to do anything, I sleep 12 hours a day and I still feel tired, antidepressants barely allow me to go to work but after that my life is completely empty, I don't shower, my house is basically a dumpster, my car looks disgusting too, I have no time for anything, only work and sleeping, I barely even eat... Most of the time I just eat random packaged snacks and down them with beer, I can cook but have no energy to, hunger is like an itch, I just have to down something so it goes away, I have no care at all for taste or anything at all when it comes to food...

Everything,  is incredibly hard, I wish for eternal sleep pretty much all day long.

I tried everything, nothing has worked, I keep decaying, I am a walking corpse at this point, I have no wit anymore, no energy, no intelligence, I'm a shambling machine who goes to work, executes his programming without thinking on full autopilot, and then recharges for the next day while wishing to never wake up again.

I am so, so tired..."
173,I don't wanna try again but I feel like I do. I almost died in my last suicide attempt. I jumped in a well and I couldn't even swim but got saved. Life is shit ever since then and before that. I really wish I died in that attempt. Now all I can think of is to jump from the 10th foor building I live in and die. Inertia is making me not to do it.
174,"ive done my research and im pretty much 100% sure i have it, always thought I was just an odd person but the way I feel lines up perfectly. how would the diagnoses go around in the uk? would i just go to my GP and also how would the medication side of things play out. thanks."
175,"I'm an electronics engineering student. I'm currently in middle of my test of VIII Sem. First paper didn't go smoothly for me, I might fail.

I don't know what should I do? I'm confused & can't face my parents. What should I do?"
176,As the title says. I’m at rock bottom and would like to hear from others suffering from depression. How do you claw your way out when it feels like all hope is lost? Even basic activities such as showering feel impossible. Was there a particular mindset shift that helped? A starting point?

178,"From 5 to 12, i had to carry on with ADHD, teachers would set me appart for being so hyperactive, other kids would to, i never really slept at a friend house, nor i used to get invited,  i have been most of life alone.
I barely made my first real and dear friend, arguably, still my best friend, in the last two years of high school.
From 12 to 18, i had become depressed, i had no friends, i didnt liked sports, so i just began restraining myself from speaking
At some point, the realization that maybe, being fat (*i wasnt even fat, just out of shape*) was what set me appart from other kids.
So i developed anorexia and bulimic disorder.
I almost died when i was 13 as result of extreme malnourishment, i would always be near fainting in the shower, i spent an entire summer locked in psychiatric rehab, from 13 to 19 thus, i was malnourished.
When i was 15, i began obsessing with my face, lookism type shit, my eyes were too ugly, my cheekbones too low, that kind of stuff,  i was still incredibly depressed and dysmorphic, and certainly not wealthy. So the best i could hope was to wait a decade to get surgery.
i fell in love too, but nothing happened, i considered myself unworthy, at that age i tried to kill myself.
I drank half a bottle of alcohol to clean wounds, took 20 xanax pills i stole my Mother and tied a bag in my head hoping i would suffocate painlessly. My mom realized, took me to the hospital, so i survived, to endure now extreme surveillance as result.
Im now 20. Almost 21.
The malnourishment i suffered as a teen in my ouberty stunt my developement.
Im short, i shouldn't have been, my feet are exrremely big, my parents are tall, i should be like a whole foot taller, but i'm not, i even think my bones are somewhat thin.
I tried doing excersice, and my genetics were good so i get ripped in a month,  but its worthless, i look like a perpetual teenager now. So it doesn't matter how much effort i put into trying to fix my face, my habits to study (which are garbage, because the ADHD never went away), or anything. It never gets better.
I wont grow, i ruined it, my bones wont get the mass i stole them, my face will just turn uglier and uglier from now on.
After getting ripped i realized its worthless, comical even. I'm not a person i would like to spent time arround. Nor i'm a person that i would like to see. I'm disgusted at my own reflection. I dont know what am i going to do.
I just waste myself with all drugs i can find to enter a psychotic state these days.
At least in the imaginary world of the voices in my head things are number 
Not that it matters, anyway, it never gets better, im probably letting myself rot until i touch bottom and off myself.

179,"As I lay here and close my eyes, I can see the past so vividly now as if I am experiencing it over and over, repeating in an endless cycle, is my mind playing tricks on me.... replaying the pain as if I were there all over again, the pain feels so real....

This world is such a cold, cruel, lonely place.

I see it so clearly now as if i am there all over again... I sat there on our bed that we shared for so many years, as I begged you with all my heart not to go, not to leave us again. How could you keep doing this to us, and yet tell me that you love me, that you will always love me….This is not love, this is you being selfish. In that moment and every moment since... I could feel my heart breaking; this time it was more painful, more powerful than any time before. This was the final time the breaking point.

We won’t be able to come back from this…. The tears pouring from my eyes, rolling down my face as I could feel the pain surging through my entire being, touching every last part of me to my core.....Trembling, I spoke with my very last words to you…

***“Leave this time and it will be the last.”***

Without thought nor care, you packed your things and headed to the door…...At that moment, I knew that this was our last.....I could truly feel not only my heart breaking but my soul shattering into a trillion unrepairable pieces. I will never be whole again. For it was you and only ever you...

And yet now as we go on, you are not you anymore... The person I saw.... My human, my love, my best friend and soulmate that I once knew is gone.... I saw such a hollow shell of who I once knew you to be.... so destroyed by her and the substances that she provides..... I fear she will cause this world to lose you completely. For she, too, is selfish in her wants and not for the true love or care of you.

I shall hope our souls meet in another lifetime. Into the great beyond.......



Lava you..... ALWAYS AND FOREVER"
180,im attending edc heartbroken and miserable.  i never felt so alone in my life.  my old friend groups all cut me off due to constant partying after they promised to hear me out.  i haven't done anything wrong and i have a great support system that keeps insisting i didnt do anything wrong.  i have a very destructive behavior and im even chain smoking but i cant feel or taste anything.  i know im keeping details as vague as possible but i just want to internalize everything and dont want to share anything at all.  im just hoping to drink so much alcohol alone so i dont want to wake up for edc.  what sucks is theres a possibility i might see her there which might put me over the edge.  my thoughts are all scrambled and it feels suffocating.  
181,"hey guys, first let me give you a bit of backstory. i've always been strange since i was a kid — never happy, never satisfied. i started harming myself at 13. by 14/15, i was already depressed and went all in. i took a kitchen knife and kept stabbing my wrist. (the scars made me wear long sleeve tops until my early 20s. i still have them in my 30s, but now i don't care.)

i had a few more unsuccessful attempts — from a tree branch breaking to my wardrobe breaking. honestly, i've been unsuccessful for 15 years. my last serious attempt was at 25. that time, i was ready. it was supposed to be the end. halfway through, bleeding out in the bath, i picked up my phone and called my friend. ended up in the psych ward for 48 hours. and that was it.

i was on antidepressants for 2-3 years, and they ruined me. i tried therapy. i ran an ultramarathon, a few marathons. i've done sports all my life. i even joined the military in my mid-20s for 2-3 years just to prove to myself that i'm a man. and here i am now, in my early 30s, just so sick and tired of the constant fight. it’s like having a flu that never goes away. it’s become so chronic my mind just can’t focus anymore.

i'm not a weak person, but my brain is just completely gone. i’ve lost all hope. i’m not sad 24/7, but i’ve never been fully happy either. it’s eating me from the inside because i’ve been fighting this alone since i was a kid. and honestly — i just wanna die. i really do. for a long time, i waited and waited, but it’s been almost 20 years now, guys. c'mon… depression doesn’t last 20 years, right? i went from having nothing to becoming a business owner. i changed countries 3 times. i've lived alone since i was 18. i eat lunch alone, go to the cinema alone. i’ve done every single thing they tell you to do to “find peace and happiness” — from groups to solo hikes, solo trips to family holidays, trips with friends, everything. but i just can't do it anymore. i really can't."

183,"Hi everyone,

idk if this post is suitable in this forum but I want to see if anyone can relate. I’m a 21 f and of Asian ethnicity currently studying and living alone.

So as the title suggests: everything is going alright in my personal life: I have a bf, I have family and I’m motivated to go to the gym and eat healthy and seem to have my life together. I live alone in a one bedroom apartment that my father pays for and I don’t have to work because my father also pays for that. My main agenda should be to get my degree and get a job so I can sustain myself. But… when it comes to Uni and my future career I don’t have any motivation, passion, disciple whatever you want to call it. I just really don’t know what I wanna do. On the one hand I want to live a chill life but on the other I want to get to experience everything life offers. My parents especially my father are very well off so I’m privileged to not have to worry about money but that makes me worry even more because I feel so guilty for using the money and not being able to get my ass up to contribute and work on building a career. I can’t really talk to any friends because nobody is as well off financially as me and I don’t want to sound ungrateful or anything but it’s really eating me up alive. I should also mention that I suffered from depression when I was a teenager and only “recovered” since maybe 3-4 years ago so I don’t feel as unmotivated or sad in my everyday life but when it comes to my future I’m just as clueless as back then. Back then I was in survival mode and my biggest goal was to loose weight (I was overweight as a kid which was one of the biggest factors for the depression). I didn’t really developed any passion or other hobbies besides trying to loose weight and working out. When I was little I was maybe considered a gifted child because I was very good at drawing but because of the depression and constantly comparing myself to others I lost my passion. In school I barely past but didn’t really get anything out of it. I was merely surviving when everybody was building their character and passion is the feeling. I chose this degree in design because I had to choose something and I also had hopes that my passion from back then would come back. But no sadly not. I do get a rush of motivation when I see creatives doing their work but I still procrastinate my uni work exactly like back then. I also think that I get really overwhelmed by the amount of different modules we have to take cause I can’t focus on different things at once and get overwhelmed easily because I’m a perfectionist and focus too much on the details. So instead of going task by task I procrastinate until I have to do everything at once.( of course I’d get overwhelmed ik:( ) I also find that everyday task take up my whole day. I was working a 20h job for 3 months before quitting it and “focusing” on Uni and I don’t understand how other people get to manage their time. Also the friends that seem to manage it don’t have any personal things to do. Like I’m still on my weight loss journey (it’s still taking up my whole life sadly) and I got to the gym 4x a week and cook every meal freshly. Then I also live alone so I have to do chores everyday for about 2 hours. At the end of the day at 8pm I don’t have any energy left to sit down and do anything. Ik that I could take days of to only focus on Uni work but I only procrastinate which makes me think that I could’ve just done my chores instead to feel the kind of accomplishment and productivity that I seem to need. Now that I formulated everything my problem sounds even dumber to me but I don’t know what to do. I sometimes think I would be a great housewife because I’m thriving at home and love to do housework and work on myself but ik that this is only a dumb delusion because I really don’t want to depend on anyone financially. I’m ashamed that I’m privileged to not have to work and worry about money but still don’t make the best out of myself. I feel burnt out although I’m not doing anything. Also I got a diagnosis for adhd because there where signs but it came out negative and I don’t know what to make out of that. I think I just need an answer to what if wrong with me and I’m afraid that I will get back into depression when I can’t get out.

I don’t know exactly what the purpose of the post is but maybe somebody else can relate. I’m not really asking for any advice although some useful and not shaming ones could be helpful."
184,"Too lazy to go into depth but i don’t have any time to see a therapist i work 2 jobs 6 days a week and on my days off im taking care of my family, what help is there for someone like me who doesn’t have time to go and see a therapist, ive heard of online therapists but those all kinda seem like scams, idk any suggestions help i just wanna stop feeling like nothing matters. "
185,"I've made it clear to my family that I just want to be alone. But everyone has been ignoring these boundaries, and it's making it harder to say sober.

  
I got out of a psych ward a week ago, and I've been trying to stay healthy and sober. I'm not very pleasant to be around right now, and I've been self harming. Both of my thighs are covered in cuts. I'm honestly regretting leaving the psych ward.

  
I tried going back, but apparently, I'm not unwell enough, and I don't have a good enough reason to be in a psych ward... even though I showed them the cuts on my thighs.

  
I'm not getting better. My meds aren't working, and I fucking hate myself, and my life. I feel like every decision I've made up until this point is wrong."
186,"Assuming that it's genetic, could anyone have done anything to prevent your depression? I'm worried about passing this shit on to my kids. All their major needs are met food clothes shelter love. I'm trying my best but still I have this question. Please help "
187,"I don’t think I have ever really been content in life. There is always something that brings me down. There is always something stopping me from feeling real joy. I can’t enjoy anything completely, because I know it won’t last forever. The negativity has overshadowed everything in my life, and I just can’t seem to even pretend like it’s all ok. It’s got to a point where I have to question every glimmer of positivity that pops up in my life. There’s no way they’re genuine, everything is secretly cruel. Either something is wrong with me, or everyone wants to hurt me. But I know something is wrong with me, because I could never sit back and enjoy the good things in life. 

I wonder why the dark things in life latch onto me more than anything else. I wonder if I’ll ever change. If this is how it’s going to be, then I’d rather not be. What a frustrating way to live…I’d rather not."

189,"Hi guys, I just want to stay anonymus, but recently I broke up with my girlfriend (she cheated on me). The relationship was a nightmare, so at first I was happy. Everything went uphill, I live with my dad, I can save money, I lost weight, worked out, even in work things get better, but heading back in dating is so frustrating. I got catfished last Sunday, and since then, I fell completely off. Feeling hollow again and not motivated to do anything. My closest ones are on holiday and I just can't concentrate on the good sides of my life rn. Any suggestions? I think I just really miss my dogs, they stayed with her, idk"
190,I don’t see any reason for me to still be here. I don’t enjoy anything and I spend all my time working a job I hate barely making enough money to survive and I have no family or any people close to me I can talk to. Crazy to think my story is just about to end here and everything was a waste of time and nobody cares I’m basically a ghost anyway at least me not being here won’t affect anybody. 
191,"I know probably no one will read this but I just thought I'd share my thoughts one last time. I finally have the motivation to die and I have all the tools, just waiting on the perfect moment where I won't be interrupted. Im not writing this to be convinced otherwise, I just want to share my true thoughts with somebody. 

   In turns of treatment, I've tried countless medications (SSRI's, SNRI's, Mood Stabilizers, Antipsychotics, Nootropics, Psychedelics, and other supplements). I've done TMS treatment, Inter-nasal Ketamine, and ECT (electro convulsive therapy). None have been effective and my depression has only gotten worse. In turns of therapy, I've tried traditional therapy, Substance abuse counseling, CBT, DBT, ACT, Group therapy, IOP, PHP, In-patient treatment, and Wilderness therapy. Again, none have had a lasting effect on my mental health. 

   All I ever wanting in life was to be loved, experience connection with other people, succeed in a field I'm passionate about, and help others. I use to have hope about doing these things but it no longer exists. Everyday I watch people do well in life, go to school, go to work, laugh and joke with each other, share love and connection, and live. I don't get to experience those realities. 

   I cry and scream for hours everyday. The mental pain is pure agony. I hate myself immensely for not being good enough, for not being lovable and successful. I dream about being happy and loved every night, just to wake up and realize it wasn't real. My mind never rests, the pain is constant. I don't have the motivation to change because I don't believe it's possible for me. I really do wish things turned out differently, but now I must face reality instead of indulging in what could have been. 

   To everyone else who is going through a similar or different experience of mental suffering, I truly hope you find peace. You are so strong for enduring that pain time and time again. Some people don't understanding our suffering but please know that it is very real and you are not weak for having depression. To anyone who actually read all this, thank you for doing so 💜.

192,"My head aches so much, my arms, everything
I feel like I am not even allowed to exist"
193,"I feel like I have the life anyone would KILL to have. Amazing family. No one I know has died. I don't have any bad events that could ""trigger"" depression. It just feels like some genetic chemical imbalance in my brain but at the same time my entire family is normal. None of them have any sort of genetic issues to pass onto me.

So there's no genetic or environmental factors causing me to mentally struggle. The problem is quite literally just me. "
194,"**Background**
My ex-wife and I have been separated since September 2023. Our divorce case is due to be heard next month. We are in Australia and have two kids together (twins). We share 50/50 custody.

She is neurodivergent, with adhd and autism. She has complex PTSD, and has at times claimed to have anxiety and depression. I say this only because I want help from relevant people who have experience. I don’t want to stigmatise her. She is not her mental conditions. I fell in love with her because of her quirkiness, and zest for learning subjects and devoting herself to things.

I left the marriage, but it’s still in some ways a regretful decision, and one I felt I “had” to make for the sake of my own mental health and being a good father to my kids.

We live separately, approximately 8 minutes drive from each other.

She doesn’t really have any family, and I would say she doesn’t have any support network except for maybe me and my family. She is fiercely independent.

Needless to say, she has always lived more “online”. 

As much as I can say, she is a great and interested mother to our kids, who can be difficult at times too.


**Recent Context**
Approximately eight or so months ago, she went on paid administrative leave from her job. (I don’t believe she is working.) Their management style and incompetent management clashed with her work style, and as a result they tried to bully her into resigning (which she didn’t do). She is currently in consultation with a lawyer to help this case in workers compensation. That’s about as much as I know about that. Except to say I believe she has savings from an inheritance, and may still be getting paid by her employer. She is able to support herself financially.

I also pay child support due to our difference in incomes.

I know she has a psychiatrist at least and goes to regular therapy. She may also have a clinical psychologist. But I’m not sure of that.

She has told me in text messages “I’m not doing well” / “I’m struggling.”

I have at times not engaged too much with this because I’m her ex-husband after all. But I have asked for her to let me know what I can do regarding our children to make things easier for her. Or if she wanted to meet up and talk about it. She hasn’t responded to these offers.

Recently her brother - who lives interstate - asked if she was okay as he hadn’t heard from her in several months and was worried about her.

She is or was close with my sister (who has BPD and Complex PTSD) who also asked if she was okay and said she hadn’t heard from her in months despite texts and phone calls.

A few weeks back a friend of hers (online friend) who has known her for four+ years and who was pregnant at the same time, and also has a similar background to her - who I had never heard about until now - messaged me out of the blue to ask if she was okay, as she hadn’t heard from her in a long time and thought they were close.

I speak to her almost every day. Mostly about our kids - sending photos - coordinating pick up and drop off and FaceTime.

She sleeps a lot, and complains about a persistent headache, and not being able to breathe properly at times. She has been to the doctor and hospital for this, and I believe maybe a neurologist, but so far they haven’t found the cause.

Her hobbies would normally be World of Warcraft, moderating Parents Facebook groups, hiking, going on adventures for food, hyperfocussing on something interesting and becoming an expert in it, helping people, problem solving. But it seems she has withdrawn from the majority of these. I have no idea what she does in her free time these days except for attempting to clean her house, or prepare food for our kids.

I have reason to believe she may have fallen in love with someone from overseas. And - my hypothesis is - her sleeping patterns and some symptoms may be because she is trying to be awake to communicate with them at hours that work for them (Maybe North America or Western Europe). And I worry that this relationship is what she might feel guilty about and why she is isolating from her friends.


**The Actual Predicament**
From yesterday something unusual happened, where she became non-responsive around midday, and then didn’t respond to positive messages about our kids, then missed FaceTime, didn’t respond to messages asking if she was okay. No messages at all all night. On WhatsApp it showed that she *hadn’t* read any of the messages. Normally it would show read. Or she might at least acknowledge or react to photos I had sent.

In the morning I tried calling her on all her numbers and through WhatsApp etc, and no answer at all. 

This was very out of the ordinary.

So I went to her house around 10am after dropping our kids at daycare and knocked on the door for 5 minutes - no answer. 

I knocked on her window and she woke up / was apparently sleeping. She seemed quite overwhelmed at the predicament. I asked if she was okay, and she said she was. So I left it at that.

Anyway, later in the afternoon today, I had to get her to sign some forms for our children. And at her house I asked her again what’s going on, is she okay, I’m worried about her.

Then she blurted out that why should she talk? No one gives a shit about her. That she could walk out on to the street and some random person would probably give her more patience and respect than me or her friends.

She said she didn’t want to talk to anyone because she didn’t want to have to explain herself to anyone. (Suggested everyone would judge her.)

And whilst today was supposed to be her night with our children (they were in daycare at this point), in a roundabout way, she asked me if I could take our kids tonight, because she wouldn’t be ready to pick them up from daycare (she was in a disheveled condition). 

I said I didn’t want to have them (of course I want to have them) because I think they should be with her, as they love her, and I didn’t want to create any negativity or disconnect where our kids become more comfortable being with me than with her. But I accepted and said I could take them for the night to help her out and give her space and time.

The reason for me posting is that I’m starting to feel really worried about her, like really *really* worried, and I don’t know how to communicate with her, or be able to help her in a way that won’t cause her to shut down. I don’t know if me helping is overcommitting myself. But she’s the mother of our kids, and I’m scared she’s on a really dark path. I feel like we’re still family and I need to do “something”.

I also feel I am failing my children by not doing more, because maybe she is struggling to look after them, and they could be exposed to problematic things (no sign of this at the moment, they are mostly happy and healthy).

I can’t stage an intervention, because there’s no one. 

I feel like she’s creating a perfect storm of negativity where every negative or constructive statement either validates her own negative feelings about herself, or she dismisses it as abusive or shameful. And the only way to have her in a positive mindset is to be ignorant of any actual problems, or to enable her, and agree with her on every front.

I can’t get easy access to communicate with her. Because she can ignore messages / not respond. Or in person she shuts down, or projects / misdirects conversation, and like I said makes a perfect storm of a conversation where I can’t “win” or neither of us can get our points across. It feels like we speak different languages.

If any of you have been in a similar situation to her, and have advice of what you would have liked to receive to help, or how I should approach her. I would really appreciate any help at all.

Like, would it help if I cleaned her house and asked zero questions? (I don’t have the money to pay for a cleaner otherwise I would do that.) to help with giving her mental space?

I’m almost at the point where I feel like I might need to call Child Services to do a check on her, and I don’t want to do that unless it’s absolutely necessary.

197,"Hello. I am a long-term user of Paxil, with the addition of Vraylar and Pristiq (recently had a bout of serotonin syndrome--ugh!!). I'm tapering off of Paxil as I was at the max dose and was still experiencing breakthrough symptoms that were leading to self-deletion attempts (actual attempts \[3x\], not thoughts). 

I've made my way down to 10 mg and my Pristiq has doubled to 100 mg, and I feel the best I have ever felt in YEARS. I felt the happy emotion for the first time in so very long, just genuinely happy. Amazing! Is this what 'normal' people feel?!

Anyways, now anytime I hear a loud noise, I get startled. I don't have any history of this or emotional trauma that would be affected by this. Why could this be?

Thanks for any input!"
198,"So First and foremost im not a native speaker but i will try to do my best here..

So..i will throw out some context and will really try to make it as short as possible..

I come from divorced family
Father had multiple firms, met my mom, they married each other, mom became accountant after some while and became greedy started stealing money from the firms..

Dad found out scratched her from the firms and left her at home with smth along the lines of (whatever u will need you will get but you wont be working with me anymore) in that time mom was also pregnant and was expecting me..

She didnt let it slide, and after some thinking she came up with divorce papers, that was her way of forcing dad to give her money that was supposed to be paid cause of me but for her (child support is it?) The amount was ridicolous way over the top, dad counter this by selling all firms and being unemployed for some time so when court happened he showed up and said “Yeah i cant pay that much im unemployed” and it worked..

Since then this failure led mom to alcoholism
And dad left the country cause he lost basicly everything he built..(there was also restraining order put in place for me and my dad dunno how but it was there for 10yrs) 

So yeah i grew up with mom that was an alcoholic and older brother (from her first marriage) that was an drug addict..

Im sure u can imagine how our home and my childhood looked..

When i was 19 i took out a loan that allowed me to finnaly move out from this “home” and to live by myself..

I had 4 relationships in total in one of them i was engaged as well..in 3 of them i found out i was being cheated on..

Im 30 now im single, mom died due to liver cancer 2yrs ago, relationship with my dad is..distant at best..we just cannot find the way to each other, my trust in women is broken, yet i still yearn for relationship and family deep down in my heart..

I feel like last 11yrs of my life that i invested into theese 4 relationships were useless, or just thrown away at best..
I feel like i should be traumatised, or depressed..

And i feel sad and hopeless sometimes, but i allways somehow just get up and carry on, but at the same time i feel just extremely exhausted..fed up with regular bullshit that people talk about..i feel alienated from society cause im unable to enjoy most of the things that people normaly enjoy..
I feel Like behind every potentional connection with someone lies a potentional threat of rejection, backstabbing, wasted time energy and effort..

I now..just am.
I feel numb, disappointed, exhausted, and what scares me most is that i feel unforgiving..
Which leads me to a thought of a life ahead of me thats spent in solitude and isolation..
My mind is telling me to be carefull so much that it makes my life a solitary confinement unit basicly but at the same time my heart longs for love and family..
And here i am between the two worlds not knowing what the hell im supposed to do now, i should be mentally drowning yet im having perfect clarity of what happened and why i am currently where i am..

I feel traumatised and depressed yet i dont think i am cause every person i met that really surffers theese conditions is having a much harder time then i do..

And yes as you can see, im just so confused, and lost. "
199,"First of all, sorry if this is not the place for such a post, I am really new here.

I am 19 years old, and since the starting of 2025 my older brother is going through hell of a depression, He is constantly having a hard time and bad health, especially bad headaches, about 2 months ago, he told us about what he is feeling and he is thinking about suicide, my parents freaked out and my mom got really sick, I have experienced depression my self about 3 years ago and been through VERY similar shit, and almost took my life, but I was damn stupid and young looking back at this, I just can't imagine him dead, we are so close and we always talk and play and laugh, I still don't understand what truly happened, I don't have any professional experience ofcourse, and I can't get any form of professional experience because of my country currently (can't go through details),  people who have been through similar issues and had people who they love go through similar stuff, WHAT DO I DO!?, I am truly lost and just trying my best to be around and exist and help him and support him, I have been reading and learning more and more about this and try my best, we have been through tough shit but never imagined we reach such point ever in my life, All I seek is guidance please, I am willing to do anything,  I would die for him, I can't just lose him, I may keep updating, sorry in advance."

201,"Just venting. If I'm being candid, I could grit my teeth and probably put my life into some kind of order, but is it worth it? It's so hard to feel like there's a reason to invest in my future whenever I allow myself to take a genuine look at the state of the world around me. The writing on the wall is not good. Is it worth uprooting the rut I've built of comfort and distractions to face hard personal responsibilities that I've ignored for so long? Why even bother trying to become the best version of myself if the world is disintegrating anyways? I could just keep going about my day playing games, jerking off, and pretending to be entertained by short form content instead. I could leave this comfort zone and try to tackle everything head on, but why even bother if there's a pretty good chance that I won't be around to reap any of the fruits of my labor? I wish I could just go back to living my life in blissful ignorance without understanding how screwed up the world really is. What's the point of knowing when you don't have the personal means to do anything about it?"

Today i lost 2/3 of my money to gambling and overall the more i live the more i see how worthless i am. I tried hanging myself but i cant do it right, i guess even that is too complicated for me. Im in therapy and i have a psychiatrist but no matter what i never change. All i want is just a way to maybe disappear or smth so i van just end it in peace. Idk why im writing this here im just lost and numb and i want to finally let everyone know that they were right about me "
203,"What the title says. My self-esteem and perception on life have been permanently crippled by the things other people have said to me. 

I was lucky enough to not be bullied badly in elementary school, but everything went to shit the second I hit middle school. I have a bunch of mental health issues, including anxiety, OCD, and depression, which all got significantly worse once I hit puberty. I think other people noticed, and I became a target. I never liked the way I looked, from the second I was conscious about it, but in middle school, it went from not liking myself to utterly hating myself. I was made fun of for my acne, my teeth, my nose, my voice, the way I dressed, the way I'm built, all of it. It was made significantly worse by the fact that I was deeply closeted and called a fag constantly. By the time I got to high school, I had already begun self harming and made my first suicide attempt. I felt so hideous that I was certain no one could ever like me. It got worse from there. I distinctly remember being told my freshman year that I was so ugly, no one would even want to rape me. I had friends, but I would leave school early crying on a regular basis because even the people I was friends with would casually make comments on my appearance- calling my nose big, my outfit ugly, my hair weird, whatever it was. 

I certainly was an ugly kid, and I've had somewhat of a glowup since then- I'm in college now, I'm a gym rat, my skin is clear because of Acutane, I got a better haircut, I dress well, etc., but I don't think I will ever recover from the things that have been said to me. To this day, people still say horrible things to my face- just a month ago, a guy I had just met loudly proclaimed that I was probably a 5/10. I don't understand why people feel the need to say such awful things to me.

I've tried so hard to work on my self-esteem, but every time I look in the mirror, all I can see is the ugly kid who nobody likes. I'm at my wits end. I just want to not feel horrible all the time.

204,"So like on my really bad days, where I can't even get up to eat, what gets me out of bed is picking up my sister from school, usually my sister does that but sometimes I come with her on bad days, just seeing my sisters excitement running at me when she sees me, her exited telling me about school, just melts my heart."
205,"Some people want me to die for no reason. And it's not important I guess, it is. But they are going to die someday too unfortunately so why say mean things. I got triggered for nothing again and skipped sleep for poor reason. Why do they want someone to die hypothetically are they mean or stupid or just shallow? My life should end because I am tired."
206,"my old friends never reach out to me so i cut them off, dating scene isn't working out for me, and i'm not too close to my family/don't like most of them, im out here all on my own basically :/"
207,"Im going off of my zyprexa now because my psych nurse wouldn’t fucking listen to me when i told her that it wasn’t doing anything good for me. I do have depression but I also have an eating disorder. She said that the zyprexa would make me eat more. 

Its completely fucking idiotic to counter a eating disorder with a eating disorder. Thanks alot, now im binge eating 24-7 instead of restricting. BIG HELP! Theyre all a bunch of liars. I hate them so much. 

There is so much depth to my issues and she dosent even let me speak all of the way! she interrupts me mid sentence all of the goddamn time, so of course im upset. I tell her that these meds aren’t working and theyre making me feel even worse and she brushes me off because of my “murky thinking up there” I hate her with all of my heart! Why wont you listen to me? They never listen until youre dying and its too late!!! I hate growing up like this its genuinely so fucking stressful. I felt completely fine before I had went to go see that psych nurse. I cant even get a new one either because my mom wont let me. Is getting help even worth it anymore? I always feel like im dying, i always feel just overall terrible and like the only release is death. The only thing that is keeping me here is my pet cat right now. "
208,"


I get abused a lot, my friends and family even though I have bpd. They are so insecure and selfish they don't even think what's going with me. My mother said I'm spoiled brat just because I told she had been hitting her since childhood and not recently and she takes pride in announcing that I've been hitting you since recently because you're spoiled and misbehaved. My friends tell me that I'm such a retarded that I must be lucky that I got a chance to talk to them. I don't know where to escape everyone behaves horribly to me. It's taking a toll on my mental health and my bpd has gone worst lately adding to this, I have no friends anymore no emotional support. I don't know where to go I'm not receiving any help. People treat me like I should've been dead a long time ago"
209,"Last year, I was in a serious motorcycle accident that left me broken and with parts of my body that no longer have full function. I am in a bad place. I let the darkness get to me and I shut down. This greatly affected my relationship with the woman I've spent the last 6 years with. Last night, she decided to end thing and is now planning to move out of state soon. Now not only do I have the darkness looming over me from the accident, I'm getting consumed by guilt and regret of allowing myself to get this bad off. I don't wanna be here anymore but I'm tied to this plane by my 7yr old daughter. I have to survive for her. If I could remove myself without causing grief or heartache, I'd allow it."
210,"My twin dropped out they have no hobbies all they do is sleep and sew and go to work. They have coworkers they like and stuff but I recently found out they and the only friend they managed to keep had a conversation about their relationship, it was basically saying they(the friend) were tired of keeping a relationship with my twin because they dont give anything back and its hard to keep it up. I dont blame the friend they are also going through a hard time, I know how they feel my whole family has always been a bit sad, my older sister tried to kill herself when she was my age and my mum hasn't been stable my entire life she's only just beginning to help herself. Anyways all this to say when I spoke to my twin about their only friend basically cutting contact they just said 'I dont really care' im so scared for them. I dont know how to help them. I know I can't make them care about anything but I need to do something, id be scared they will try to kill themself but I honestly think they won't because they won't be bothered to 'put in the effort' I need to know how to best support them I dont want them to just be alive I want them to be happy to be alive I need them to be okay I dont know what the fuck to do."
211,How the hell am I supposed to do anything when I'm too depressed? All I want to do is lay in bed all day. I can't do anything beyond that really. Can't work. Can't clean the house. I just don't know what to do. This life really isn't worth living.  
212,I keep failing and failing and failing meanwhile everyone else is thriving. I have always been a failure and there’s no future for me. I should accept my fate and accept that I will never be good enough. All my hopes and dreams are nothing but failure. I will never be enough.

Tried sharing a post on here earlier but its still being ""moderated"" whatever. I just wanted to express myself one last time but ig it doesn't even matter here.. its whatever tho. I won't be here much longer to be bothered by anything else let alone shit like this"
214,"What if today had already begun，
Before I noticed it?
What if I want to live,
But that ego has already died?

The pain in my chest—
Burst out through all my flesh,
My blood,
My hope,
And every cry.

I’m tight with the wires, 
Manipulate by the madness.
I’m like a bard—
Only my tears 
Break past the bars.

So today,
Will you free me from this cage?
Or bury my soul, 
with blooming sunflowers—
Like my joy,
Like my shine.

The MST treatment was definitely working, but I can still feel those pain time to time; and I don’t need to be happy, I just don’t want that pain, so much pain"
215,"Hi everyone,

I’m wondering if anyone else experiences this: I tend to blush very easily, even in situations that are only slightly awkward or not even negative at all — like when someone compliments me, asks a personal question, or just looks at me while I’m talking.

What’s worse is that the blushing doesn’t go away quickly. Even after the awkwardness or emotion passes, the redness on my face stays for a while, and I become super aware of it. That just makes it worse.

It’s not like I’m panicking inside — sometimes I feel calm, but my face still turns red, and I worry that others will notice or think something’s wrong.

Has anyone here dealt with this? What helped you? I’d love to hear your experiences or tips.

Thanks in advance!"
216,"I grew up in chaos. physical and sexual Abuse, instability, shame, all layered in tight. I thought I had “dealt with it” because I survived. Got older. Moved on. Got married. Had kids.

But the trauma wasn’t gone. It was just buried.

When I finally started facing it—really detoxing it—it came out like poison. I’d cry out of nowhere. I had rage I didn’t understand. Sometimes I’d just shut down like someone unplugged me. I wasn’t crazy. I was wounded.

I learned healing isn’t just mental. It’s *physical.* The body remembers. The nervous system holds on. And detoxing from trauma doesn’t always feel like healing at first—it feels like falling apart.

But God met me in that mess. Not after. *During.*

Here’s what helped me:

* **Writing.** It let me make sense of what I lived through.
* **Naming things**—not minimizing, not justifying, just naming.
* **Letting go of shame** that didn’t belong to me.
* **Faith** that God’s not done. That scars don’t mean failure. They mean survival.

I ended up writing everything down—just to survive at first. It became a book. I wasn’t planning to share it, but I did. And if it finds the right people, I hope it helps.

If you’re in the thick of it, you’re not alone. Healing doesn’t mean never feeling broken. It means knowing the pieces still matter."
217,"TW: Self-Harm


 I have my appt with my psychiatrist in just over an hour. I’m so nervous. It has been over 2 years since I SH’ed yet it’s pretty obvious on my hand with the massive reminder of it. At the time, it was the only behaviour I could do to settle and transfer the inner turmoil to something physical. But now I feel quite nervous to share that happened. I know I need to but I’m freaking out about being honest that to be quite honest I have not been doing well since our last appointment with the self harm and then also got rid of food a few times. Why is mental health so hard to manage to be stable 😩😩😩"
218,"Hello,

I (24F) feel like a non-functional human being. I do nothing all day except rot in bed. It’s been like this for months—maybe even years.

My thesis is due on May 25th, and I haven't made any progress.

I'm isolated from everyone except my sister because I’ve ghosted everyone—even my thesis partner.

When I don't have a deadline, I think it's laziness that's stopping me from being functional. When there is a deadline, it's panic attacks and anxiety, which turn into complete desperation and suicidal, depressive thoughts.

I remember my first panic attack when I was 13, and I actually attempted suicide to solve the problem. Since then, suicide became the ""solution"" or my way of coping. But I haven’t attempted again—because of religion, fear, and a bit of hope that maybe a good future was still possible.

That hope has gradually faded. Now, lying in bed, I see no way out of these miserable cycles. Every once in a while, I have panic attacks, and now only religion and fear are keeping me from suicide.

But the other day, I had a dream. I had killed myself and was lying dead on the floor. My sister was near me, and my mom was in the other room. The dream focused on the fact that I didn’t fully exist anymore—but I still existed enough to feel and think, without the ability to do anything. That feeling—of being stuck, powerless, unable to act—was terrifying.

Because I’m Muslim, death in the dream meant I couldn’t fix anything anymore, and I wasn’t sure what God would do with me in the end. I just wanted to go back and fix it.

Not really because of God.

But because that feeling of fully existing—even in pain—was better than the feeling of partly existing, without being able to change anything.

When I woke up, I was scared. I don’t want to die anymore. I think maybe I never truly did. I just wanted to stop existing—to disappear completely. But now, death feels like partly existing in a way where I can’t do anything about my life anymore.

The problem is, I’m still the same person. I still want to kill myself—not because I want to die, but because I feel non-functional and I know I’m hurting the people around me. I want to run away. But now, if I do it, I’ll do it while being so scared—without really wanting to. Because I don’t want death. I want to disappear.

I’m so scared of death, but I’m also scared of life. It’s like being trapped on an island with a terrifying monster. It can’t swim, but neither can I—so both options feel awful.

That feeling in the dream—of not being able to do anything about myself anymore—made me realize that maybe I haven’t tried hard enough. And it’s true: I haven’t tried everything there is to try to fix myself and my life.

But there’s no hope. So how can I make my weak, tired self try to help me again, if we both see no hope?"
219,"I think this is the first time I’ve ever felt like I’m stuck in a loop. I’ve been with a lot of guys, made me feel special then they leave. I’m really tired of that. This time, I found someone, really special. He liked me for 3 years since middle school and I finally decided to give it a try. We ended up dating for 4 months. It was a dream, sleepovers when we could, hung out all the time, sex life wasn’t bad at all, perfect actually. I really thought this was the one. However, in may, I stupidly decided to have an argument. He did not appreciate that at all to the point where he broke it off. Told me he has been unhappy for 3 weeks, I didn’t even know. Cried my little heart out, still have to this day. I question myself if there is something wrong with me, I convince myself not and to talk to him more and more when all he wanted was to be alone. I went stupid and showed up to his work to talk to him. We talked after an hour and a half of arguing and him asking to go home. We decided to be friends with benefits. But that didn’t last more than 30 minutes. He went home, told his parents (I’m guessing), and I received about a paragraph text declaring that he wants nothing to do with me. I was shattered. But the whole thing is, I don’t care about all of that. I’m tired of waking up knowing he’s not there, waking up and going to the same place to do the same thing, waking up and being told to do things everyday. It’s life, of course. But I would rather sleep all the time than ever wake up. Live in a fantasy in my head that my senior year was going to be great. Now, I feel worse than ever. I’m only 16, my 17 birthday is less than two weeks away. Would it be worth it to end it, or just live in suffering for things I won’t ever have?"
220,"My entire life has been one nightmare after another. My father beat me constantly and worked me like a slave, which has left me disabled since i was 15, until he went to prison. My mother is an emotionally abusive alcoholic, and when she's sober she's a malignant narcissist. I have crippling anxiety and the medication I've been taking doesn't feel like it does anything. I feel like im constantly on the verge of a panic attack and if something unexpected happened i would completely melt down. My doctors can't, or won't, figure out what's wrong with me. Im in constant pain, it's everywhere in my body, but especially in my feet and hands. I'm exhausted, sleeping doesn't feel like it actually helps at all, i just can't seem to find the energy anymore. I am currently staying with a friend because i screamed at my mother that she's the reason i want to kill myself and if i never see her again that i would die happy. I feel like a burden to everyone around me because I'm disabled and i can't help contribute to the household in a meaningful way. My girlfriend says that she doesn't see me that way and tries really hard to help me change the way i see myself, but i just feel useless. I panic when i talk to new people, and the last time someone gave me an important task that was intellectual in nature i completely shut down because im so terrified of messing it up. I hate that i can't do any of the things i enjoy anymore, i used to love cooking, camping, and hiking. Now im stuck inside because my feet hurt so much when im up for to long. I know how it sounds to say this, but i feel like i deserve something for all of the suffering I've been through/am going through. I'm just so sick of starving myself so others can eat properly, I'm barely eating ever other day. I see other people with similar issues to me getting benefits that i would also qualify for, just because they are older. Do i have to be decrepit and dying to use the systems that are supposed to be in place to help people like me? Because im young i can't be in pain or have something wrong with me outside of my control? I'm supposed to just suffer more, and get less because i was unlucky enough to be abused out of sight of others? Why does it feel like im being punished for being hurt? I never got to have a childhood, or go out with friends, or do sports or join clubs. And now, nowhere wants to hire someone that they have to accommodate. And i can't do the only work that im actually good at because i spent my youth being worked like i was a full grown adult. Why does it feel like the entire world is structured to keep people like me in the deep end of the pool? Why does it have to be like this?"
221,"I’m a person full of paranoia. I guess it comes from my childhood, when my mother treated me like I was worthless. I grew up hearing that I was ugly, stupid, dumb, problematic, and untrustworthy.

Now I’m 25 and an adult, but I feel like I can’t achieve anything — I don’t even have the desire to try. Every time I consider starting something, I quit before I begin, because if I fail, it feels like she was right all along. But I also know that not trying is exactly what keeps me stuck.

I sabotage everything good in my life because that’s the only pattern I know. I’m married to a very smart man who has a great career and provides for me, but my mind keeps telling me that he’s probably looking for someone better — someone smarter, prettier. These horrible thoughts haunt me all the time.

I barely leave the house, and I live in a different country — on a whole different continent than where I was born. Honestly, the people here (Germans) feel cold and rude to me, which makes me even less willing to integrate or try to belong.

Sometimes I wonder if I should just kill myself and set my husband and others free from the burden of having me around. Maybe throwing myself in front of a train isn’t such a bad idea."
222,"feel like a total shit last few days for absolutely no reason. I just rotting in my bed whole day. I'm in college right now and it's only first class for today, but i already feel like can't bear to be here any longer. I'm completely out of energy and don't want to talk to anyone. The only thing I want right now is to go home and isolate."
223,"Lately (the past 6 months or so) I’ve been slipping into a depression. It began as what I thought was seasonable but really has not subsided. I was on Zoloft on and off over the last five years, but have been off it for over a year. I felt insanely motivated, joyful, and willing to experience things and go out. The main downside was the tremendous weight gain. I’ve finally lost most of it but I would prefer to avoid going on that one again. From your experiences, did you find an antidepressant that didn’t lead to weight gain? I know I have to speak with a doctor first and will obviously do that, but sometimes I feel like they don’t acknowledge the possibilities of weight gain with SSRI’s. "
224,"Not sure where this originated from, found it in my journal. Could have came from Reddit for all I know. It’s interesting for sure. 

Depression is opening your eyes in the morning and realizing that it's another day in which nothing will change.

Depression is knowing nobody can save you but yourself but that you are failing at that like you have failed at everything else.

Depression is the weight of expectation growing heavier by the day, the things you expect from yourself, the things others expect from you. None of which you will meet because it's too hard to motivate yourself to get a cup of coffee, nevermind a job.

Depression is the realization that it has been this way for ever, and will be this way forever because the cold hard truth is the depression is comfortable, and you are content drowning in it.

Depression is being numb when you want it to hurt, and hurting when you need it to be numb.

Depression is wanting to end it all but not being able to, not because you are scared, but because of how it will affect those that love you.

Depression is the nightmares that keep you tired and sleep deprived, and the flashbacks that hit you in the face even when you manage to get some rest.

Depression is bigger than you are, and seemingly smaller than those around you who never struggle with it, and can't understand why you can't just get over it.

Depression is praying for salvation, then praying for death so it's not your fault and they can't be angry at you. Eventually it's not praying at all because neither prayer is answered.

Depression robs you of your mind,your hope, your sanity, your motivation, and your soul, but in some sick twisted way doesn't rob you of love and guilt, which means you really are stuck.

Depression takes and takes and takes until all that is left is a barely functioning meatsack that once aspired to be more.

Depression is everything, and it is nothingness"
225,"Hello everyone, I feel as though i’m beyond stupid. I suck at everything and can’t find the will to do things I enjoy. There are these moments when the stress piles up and I get headaches and I just need to cry. I cry often. I always think of my future like what good college or job I may find in the future to help myself And honestly. I can’t think of me doing anything impressive with my life. I am socially awkward and have little friends but the friends I may “Have” mostly know me by my brother and when they see me they ask where he is and what’s happened to him. My mother wants to try and cure my condition and try’s to limit my access to Things because she dosen't trust me or wants me to show her what I’m doing like app screen time limits and Other things. (she’s one of those people who believe violence in video games make you violent irl.) That’s normally because I don’t have much independence.  I normally fall into this world of chatbots  and fiction to distract me from my life. I am in a dysfunctional family often thought of self harm but I hate pain I really hate pain. I need to speak my mind before I feel as though my head is going to explode. I’m to scared to ask for a therapist or tell anyone because I wonder what they’ll think of me. I always feel as though I’m overreacting about my problems and as if they don’t matter. I can’t relate to normal people nor other autistic people. I always wonder if life will get better.I feel as though nothing in life really matters."
226,"so hi. I don’t really know how to word this post. This is a really stupid rant but read anyways 

I go to my usual state college nearby in town that all my high school classmates go to, and the architecture is extremely ugly and old. As a kid I’ve always thought about college being this fun beautiful engaging experience with a stunning college campus— of course at the time I didn’t know that you had to pay for colleges and you couldn’t really just choose whatever college to go to. I always dreamed about getting a dorm with my friends and hanging out and never being lonely

“Oh why not just go to another university,” I have anxiety disorder, I’m a enby person but I appear as female and I do not trust myself being out there by myself. I do drive but im too anxious to make that big of a move at this age, I’m middle class but too “rich” to get anything from fafsa, but too “poor” to move out to a nicer college. And too stupid to write good scholarship essays even if I put my whole ass into it.

My college is.. extremely ugly. Only one new building is nice, it takes forever to get place to place because there’s so much grass and not enough pathways. It’s super open campus but super ugly. Older buildings feel claustrophobic, the ceiling is too low, the walls are too tight. No where on campus makes me feel like im in a different nicer campus. Hanging out with friends is super depressing. I literally ate ice cream with a friend and went to go look at the taxidermied animals in the science building because we had nothing else to do. All there mainly is to do on campus is bowling and eating…"
227,"Most people have seasonal depression, in the winter. I have seasonal depression but in the summer. The longer days, the unbearable heat, it all drives me insane. 

Well spring has arrived and as summer gets closer I just feel worse and worse. Things in my life are pretty good right now but depression has me feeling like I'm suffering and going insane. 

Was curious if anyone else had this or had aby advice. I hate feeling like shit all the time, being negative and exhausted. "
228,"So turns out, medications did help me, right now I don't have the energy to type much, I am lying down on my bed, but here's a positive story, my doctor prescribed me antidepressant even though I didn't tell him I was depressed, he is a normal gp, the way I was describing my headache, I think he sensed I was going down a path which i won't return from, so he gave me a bit of cliche speech of the power of mental strength and what not. So i took the antidepressant(snri) for the first time in my life, and 3 days later, what happened was something I didn't expect at all, ever, I didn't know how the hell, but man, it was such a beautiful feeling, I was here, present, in the world that exists around me, I will tell the whole story of what exactly happened in the last one year once I fully recover because right now I am zoning out a bit coz my body is recovering from undiagnosed chronic fatigue of over a year. I'm on day 6 of venlafaxine, and here is what I feel now

Feels really good. 

Positives:
- Calm
- I've become socially comfortable, even with strangers again after a long time, feels good.
- Phone usage has been significantly reduced
- I've become a bit physically active again after months of being in isolation.
- I want to help others without expecting anything in return.
- That sense of unease when you're in a new place that someone may be staring at you and judging is gone.
- I'm more focused in talking to others.
- A sense of wonder and newness in every moment.
- That feeling you got as a child? Which is completely worry free, that's constant for me now.
I'm able to control my thoughts like a warrior now, i never thought in the last 1 year I'd do anything in life other than waiting for death.

Maybe the universe wanted me to live again and not rot.

Negatives:

Fatigue
Stomach issues

I have learned a lesson in this journey of my second life, I'll never forget it.

The reason why I am saying it is because I want anyone who feels there's no returning to the version of you that you lost, the part of you that you feel like a shell of,you will get it back and cherish it way more than you ever did, it's a phase right now, if you stay with the pain, you will get out of it, i can assure you of that, and your life after would be better than ever before."
229,"I am quite depressed. I cant blame too much but the fact that i dont know why i am such a sad person. I dont want the one person i text to about these things to get tired of me so i have resorted to making this post. 
I am ofcourse an introvert lol. I dont have many close friends to say.  I have stopped wanting to wake up in mornings. I crave acceptance snd recognition. I want someone to see me for who i am but i also dont have the energy to invest in a new relationship. Being suicidal is something i have been dealing with for about 6-7 years. It would be nice to have some community to find comfort in. I hope anyone reading this horribly worded message has an amazing day :)"
230,"I can ask for therapy but i don’t want to worry my parents (15 btw can’t get it without telling my parents to get it for me) and there’s nothing i like about myself at all so i can’t write things i like abt me down or wtv. One of the main things about my body i can control but i still don’t change it despite the fact i hate it so fucking much, and that just makes me feel worse about myself. I’m hurting my gf because i’m hurt myself and i just want to fucking kill myself i only don’t because it’ll affect to many people. i just want to die, i wish i never existed, im hurting people around me and helping myself would hurt so many more, helping myself the “right way” aka not blowing my brains out seems impossible and i just want to fucking die.

I wanna draw again, I want to record myself, I want to make 3D animations, I want to workout but it all feels like I'm beating a dead horse. Please, I just want to feel normal for a little bit.

239,"I’m in so much pain emotionally & physically.
I can’t stop hurting myself. No matter where i go I’m not safe. The people who are supposed to love me only hurt me. I don’t know what i did to deserve this. I don’t want to live much longer."
240,"About a year ago, I was a regular reader of this sub. I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1bpodrv/evenings_are_the_worst/). My mind was full of negative (to say the least) thoughts. I’d lost the ability to enjoy things that I once considered my favorite activities, and I didn’t even realize it had happened until I found myself lying in bed all day, unable to watch a movie because it felt like *work*.

I can officially say that’s not the case anymore. I’m starting to enjoying some things I love again.

If you’re struggling, please try to remember what it feels like to *feel* good. Do something you used to love and at some point, you might catch the faintest spark of joy. If you do, hold onto it and use it to reinforce your memory. Trace back to a specific moment when you did that thing and really enjoyed it. Then go do more of that shit.

If taking a walk helped, make it a regular thing. Try to connect it to a real memory. The way the air felt after a summer storm. The smell of wet pavement. The scent of laundry detergent coming from a building vent as you walked past.

Don’t let those memories slip away. Keep looking for them and one day you might feel some of them again.

  
Sorry if you've already tried the above and it didn't help. "
241,"What is it called when you truly don't realize the magnitude of your actions until it's too late? Experiencing severe regret only once you have to face the consequences? I had my mind made up that I wasn't going to be around much longer. Life just didn't feel the same for me anymore. Too much hardship and uncertainty. But on social media I see ppl going through so much more than me who are still pressing on. Made me feel so weak. Made me feel like I should be grateful. But on the other hand I'm trying to give myself leniency knowing that my situation still isn't easy to deal with, especially long term. "
242,"TLDR; I had a panic attack episode where I got rushed to a hospital and ever since then cost me my job. Now, I'm unemployed, waiting for June 16. I just want to end it all. I want to kill myself tonight.

Hi. I'm T. I am 24 years old and live in Asia. 

My anxiety and sudden panic attack cost me my job. Now, I'm stuck waiting. I got a job offer which I accepted but it starts on June 16. Other companies rejected me due to various reasons. I'm also waiting for another interview at a different company but up to now, the interviewer isn't ready yet. 

I'm the sole breadwinner of my senior citizen(a bit elderly) mom. Her siblings help us by lending us money from time to time ever since my job had issues. But they aren't well-off either. Mom's cousins no longer respond to us either. We have electricity bill upcoming along with loans we took on an online wallet app. We have loan under mom's name and my aunt's name. 

We barely have food to eat. Mom's been crying nonstop because of the stress and everything. My bf gave me the rest of his allowance to help with other necessities. 

I just want to kill myself. My bf sees me as his reason to continue to live too. That if I go, he'd lose his sanity. But I don't know how to escape my hellhole life anymore. I keep getting buried under debts. If I end my life, my mom has a chance of earning a bit of funeral money (traditional thing ish). She can get money to live by. Her siblings also will get her. But if I'm still around, she's just gonna live in hunger. I also no longer have friends I talk to. I drifted apart from them when I kept breaking down while I was having work issues. I also bring nothing but breakdowns to my boyfriend. 

Once I'm gone, everybody's lives will be better. Their lives will be easier. I haven't gathered the strength yet. But I want to kill myself tonight. "
243,"In November 2024 I met this girl online on a video game (lets call her K for privacy concerns) and well we deeply connected. The first time we talked it was about religion because I’d like to spread the Word of God online and she was curious since at the time she was Jehovah Witness and I’m Catholic. So then we then started texting frequently on Instagram. We would also play video games often and we play those 2-player games too. She was kind and genuinely cared for me. We had similar interests in drawing, video gaming, volleyball, love of nature and religion too. Later on she actually converted and so we shared the same Catholic faith, we would pray for one another and read the Bible together and try to lead people closer to Jesus. I got to know more of her backstory, like struggles in the family and her childhood such as her dad passing away and also how she had 6 past failed relationships. She also asked me how can I know if this person is the one because I want him to be my last (almost certainly referring to me because I was her closest guy friend). And she always said how she wants to cook and look pretty for her future husband. She even asked me if we could meet up in Australia when she is older since she lives in Guam, and she said she wanted to cook a shrimp dish for me. In fact my nickname for her was ‘Shrimpy’ for that reason (and not to insult me) and I would call her ‘Sleepyhead’ because thats how she is 😂. My main point is we were really close.

Yet despite this I was painfully aware of our age difference since at the time I was 18 and she was 16. I was born in October 2006 and she was born March 2008. We didn’t do anything inappropriate I think but I was fearful that I would appear as if I’m taking advantage of her since shes younger and I’d become someone I’d regret being. So I cut her off for 4 days in mid December just to handle the fact that we were getting too close way too soon. But this was the event in which ruptured trust and commitment in our relationship. Since this time, she has always been afraid of committing to me because shes never been with an older guy, I’m too old and I get the ‘ick’ because of her.

Yet in reality I really do love her and I see a future with her, but I just wanted us to have some time as close friends until we’re both older and mature for us to date and possibly be married. Our feelings for each other were revealed 2 months later after daily texts and playing video games on Feb 14, Valentine’s day, even though I didn’t really want to tell her yet. Her friends continuously pressured that I needed to share my feelings with her because K was afraid I don’t like her. And so I did, we both expressed feelings that we liked each other and yet one of those same friends said our relationship was weird and inappropriate. And so I cut her off again saying we can’t be Valentines and we needed a break. However we decided we would watch a movie called Interstellar together anyways as friends after Valentines and it was nice :)

After this she started drifting off emotionally. She wouldn’t want to share her heart with me. She said she doesn’t want to be emotionally attached to me even though she once did. She would play with many other guys (the main ones are T and M, though there were many others) and I ended up getting hurt lots because we would still text most days but yet emotionally distant with me and be with the other guys.

Eventually I decided I wanted to be clear with her and what I wanted. in early April, I said let’s make a commitment to be close friends so we eventually date in the future And she agreed with an enthusiastic yes! And I told her we should call every week and have deep and meaningful conversation to maintain this type of relationship. And she agreed.

However she couldn’t keep the promise. She refused to take any of my calls and she said I just want to be friends because I can’t deal with you knowing so much about me, even though she would be playing with T and M at the same time. Even while she said she was committed to being close friends to date in the future with me, she was matching in username with her guy ‘friend’ M. It hurt so bad I was crying in a bathroom alone. And then a week later after saying she doesn’t want that committment, she started dating M which hurt me so badly.

I took a week break from her and after that I tried just being friends with her. However there were many concerns on my mind. It got to the point where I expressed how I was feeling hurt with her behaviour and she would ghost me even though we’re just friends. Like I would bring how the relationship between her and M seems emotionally unstable since both her and M just immediately got out of committed relationships and started dating and people would get hurt. And then I said its like you’re seeking so much attention, and want to be close with many guys, but not be attached to them and hearts would be played. I’ve talked to many of her guy friends including another dude named L and T and also M and they expressed the same hurts that I have, that they feel led on at times. She got angry and then she blocked me for a time.

Now she then unblocked me about a week later and then well after this I was trying to create even more distance and separation to be just friends with her because I knew she wasn’t emotionally safe anymore unfortunately like she used to. I couldn’t even be close friends with her or bring up deeper issues without fearing she’ll block me again. And so she started doing manipulation tactics on me to be reeled into being attached to her, without her committing to me WHILE shes dating M. Like she would try to And in 1 final attempt she tried saying I think this might be our final goodbye because the memories hurt us both when we talk and you’ve been a great friend to me, as if I can be reeled to be attached to her. But I said lets talk more in the future as friends after a long while and after we’ve healed.

So thats my whole story. I still love her and I have many dreams and hopes for her that I hope can be fulfilled if she comes to Australia. But I’m still trying to let go of holding onto that hope and trying to trust God.

Its gotten to the point where I can’t even function in everyday life and I don’t even know who I am anymore. I’m always tired now and I can’t even get out of bed and I listen to sad music alot. I’m falling behind university work because I get so stressed about losing her and I constantly check up on her social media page. I keep scrolling through our text history and looking at photos I took in the video games. I play the video games we used to play a lot. I’m losing my fire for God, like I don’t read my Bible or pray the Rosary as much as I used to.

So the grief of losing her is hitting me hard and I need some support for the inner wounds I’m experiencing, if that is okay. Thank you."

247,"i recently started working in a job where i support people in crisis - this has recently brought up a lot of unresolved sexual trauma from my childhood.  i had a panic attack, was laying in the street and ive be doing some other extremely erratic things.  i feel empty and like everything is dog piling on me and i can’t take it.  no one in my life seems to care enough to help they seem like they’re done trying to help or they can’t or don’t know how or are hesitant around me.  I feel like the life i cultivated up until now was based on how fucked up i was - it feels like i’ll never escape that, no matter what i do people treat me like the old me.  i’ll never escape who i was and i don’t know how long i can keep going.  i’m trying to hold on keep going to work, get through my personal commitments.  but i feel empty.  i feel like the first suicidal crisis, maybe around 12 was the least likely to actually do it.  the older i get the more i can manage things until in blows up and i do dangerous things ive never done before, the more likely it’ll actually happen."
248,"I tried pursuing a different career for a few years. I moved cross country and tried to go for it but it was hard since I never have anyone to rely on. I needed to make a living so taking an entry job to ""break in"" wasn't possible. There were several factors surrounding the attempt but I ended up moving back East, closer to family. This has been one of the worst years of my life - my job sucks, I barely have any friends, I'm alone all the time. All the progress and connections I made are practically all gone now. 

While the entertainment business is very volatile, I feel like everyone is doing so much better. I was feeling okay today- stressed and overwhelmed but ""okay."" I made the mistake of checking YouTube and saw someone who I considered a good friend being interviewed for a project they did. They were already ahead in their career and have a strong network system so I'm not comparing myself to them. I just hate how sad I got. Why am I such a failure? I spent almost 5 years working on something and I literally have nothing to show for it. I probably wasn't even decent and was fooling myself. I feel like I'm just wasting my life. I really don't have anything to offer. I'm mediocre. Sometimes I wonder if there is a point. There's nothing special about me. "

250,"How do you guys deal with depression? I don’t have the energy or desire to wake up for long periods of time, don’t get me wrong I am functional all day everyday, just feels like every activity is harder than I know they are (not even sure if that make sense). 

I tried ending it years ago but somehow a memory of my youngest sister pulled me out on time. Now, I’m married, I have a stable job, have 2 degrees and working on my masters right now. 

But I feel like nothing matters, days just go by, no feelings, no nothing, the only time I feel something is with pain (not purposely causing them, but sports injury or every things). 

Sounds cliche but … why do we do this? I should be happy right? 
"
251,"Fake hopes everywhere that it will get better no it doesn't, it never gets better they are all lies I can't deal with this. How longer do I keep living this miserable life. Everyone just hates me I don't have any emotional support. They hate me without any reason I understand you must be really insecure to hate me but what did I do. Will u go out your way to make someone's life miserable just so you could feel a bit better? Is this the life I'm living in, so why should I be a saviour protecting myself and everyone around me. I love animals they won't hurt you because they've been insecure and try to feed their ego, they do stuff because they have to.  I wish I'd rather be animal than human"
252,"“For anyone who needs to hear this. This is a piece of my truth. No blame, no shame. Just love, growth, and the choice to keep standing. If you’re carrying more than people can see, you’re not alone”

I’ve lived through things I rarely speak about.
Not because I’m hiding anything, but because most wouldn’t understand.
My life has been loud in silence, heavy in moments where I smiled anyway.

I’ve carried pain I didn’t cause and taken on weight I didn’t deserve.
I’ve tried to help when I had nothing left to give.
And even when I’ve felt invisible, I’ve kept showing up.

I’ve made mistakes.
I’ve hurt people I care about, and I’ve felt that pain echo through me.
But I’ve never stopped trying to grow.
I’ve never stopped choosing compassion.
Because deep down, love is who I am.

I’ve struggled with addiction, and I’ve fought every day to rise from it.
There were times I almost gave up, when the darkness felt louder than anything else.
But I didn’t.
I stood up, even if I was shaking.
I stayed, even when disappearing felt easier.
And every time, I tried to turn back to love.

I’ve seen people break down, and I’ve stayed beside them while they did.
I’ve watched people I care about slip into places I couldn’t reach,
and I held space for them anyway.
Not because it was easy, but because I loved them enough to never stop trying.

And I’ve seen others try for me too.
Even if I didn’t see it clearly at the time, I know now.
We’re all just trying to find our way back to the truth.
And I believe the truth is love.

I believe we came into this life for a reason.
Not just to survive, but to remember who we are beyond the pain.
To feel. To fall. To rise again.
And through it all, to love.

Love is what you make it.
And no matter what, you can’t change how another human being truly feels about you.
But me?
I’ll always love.
I’ll always show up.
I won’t judge.
And I’ll fight for the people I love, quietly, fully, endlessly, until the end of time.

This is who I am.
This is my truth.
And this is the legacy I choose to leave behind.

253,"I have no intention of harming myself. That would be incredibly difficult to bring myself to do, and I just don’t see myself ever going through with it. But I often feel like I just want to cease to exist. I’ll continue to try to make the best of life, but it just feels like work. Everything feels like work. I just want to dissolve. Does this feeling have a name?"
254,"Im not saying there isn't a god, I'm saying that pitch black is in our future and at least we won't be conscious for it. I don't know man, I can't talk about this stuff around people I know because it's so depressing but I just know it to be the truth and the ""you never know"" argument just doesn't cut it with me.

255,"I’m currently 18 in the uk and I feel so lost. I didn’t do well in school as i barely went and after that i tried college and couldn’t do it either. I never done well academically growing up in school. I was below average but wasn’t noticed since i was so quiet. Anyways I’ve dropped out of college as i figured i’m wasting my time the more i spend there, and now I don’t know what to do. I don’t have any hobbies or ambitions, how do people find out what they want and like? It’s all the same to me, when i went to college I just picked a subject that i had the grades for and it just all turned to shambles, i didn’t enjoy it so i didn’t put effort into it. Now i’m seeing people my age and friends move on and pick universities and move on with life, but i’m still stuck at the same place. It’s like I feel regret for not sticking with things even if I don’t enjoy it. I just don’t take reality in sometimes. I haven’t excelled in anything in life, i’ve not even had one relationship and i can’t because look where I am. "
256,"I don’t know how I’ve become such a bad person. It seems whatever good friendships I have, I end up fucking up and doing something terrible to lose them. I lost my girlfriend, who was one of my best friends, just a week ago. I broke up with her and it wasn’t mutual.

I did what I wanted to, I feel free and happy, but why did I have to do it so painfully to her? Why do I act without thinking? I couldn’t take it anymore. I was so tired of having to talk to her about her issues and our own relationship issues. I hated having to fix myself and promise to better myself and then didn’t. I didn’t want to hurt her anymore, I didn’t love her in a way that she deserved to be loved. I’m a bad person for telling her that it’s me that’s the problem, but not changing for her.  I’m so far deep into hatred and resentment I don’t think I could ever go back without sabotaging the relationship.

I want to talk to a therapist, but I live in a state that’s very conservative (I’m a lesbian), and I’m not sure if I could tell her my problems while trying to mask my sexuality. It doesn’t feel genuine and I don’t think it would help me.

I just want to know why my mind works in this way? How could I pick the worst possible decisions in every relationship and friendship that I have? I just want to be normal like everyone else. I have nobody. I don’t want to be alone for the next 2 years in high school."
257,I’m just so fed up with alll my emotions and stuff I feel sick to my stomach. I can’t even feel much besides this numb feeling in my chest. I just need someone to talk to.

I've gotten what I can of my life together as much as I can, despite all my anxiety and depression I'm working a full time job and have made shift manager in a little under 2 months at the job I'm at. 

But despite all this, I don't really care about myself that much, I'm just surviving and feel like I don't have anyone to live for.
I'm so jealous of those with a significant other. Seeing how happy others are in relationships is unironically killing me. I've tried tinder, for months/years and never gotten a match.. 

I thought getting out and working would lead to finding someone but I can't really hit on a customer, not that theyd want me anyway. I just want to meet someone. I'm so lonely."
259,"Tonight, I began drafting a farewell letter. I don't like it so far so I'm going to have to do it again.

No matter what I do anymore, nothing relieves me of the pain I constantly feel. I've become so weary of it. I can't fix me.

I can't fix me. I can't let anyone in. I'm so desperate for love but I can't tell anyone how broken I am. I can't show them that.

I'm done. With everything, I'm done. I can't do this anymore. If I don't do it fast, I'll still be doing it, only slower. This is no way to live, and I can't do it anymore.

Time for the next draft, I guess."
260,"I’ve been carrying a heavy grief that feels isolating, even though I’m not alone. I lost my dad a few months ago—just a week before my birthday. This week, he should’ve turned 81. Instead, I’m sitting with a silence that feels endless.

My father meant everything to me. He wasn’t perfect, but he was a good man—great to me. I don’t know if I’ve ever loved anyone the way I loved him. Losing him to cancer has left a hole that I can’t seem to fill.

I’ve tried to keep it together, to manage the pain quietly, especially around my spouse. I know she loves me, but I don’t want her to carry the weight of my sadness and frustration. So I’ve kept most of it to myself, hoping maybe I could find someone else—a counselor or EAP—to share with. But that hasn’t worked out. I still feel alone in this.

There’s so much inside me: pain, anger, frustration, and a deep sense of emptiness that catches me off guard. Sometimes my eyes feel high up, like I can see everything clearly, and yet there’s this massive low underneath it all—this void. I recently saw the new Thunderbolts movie, and when they talked about the void, I felt it. It wasn’t just a line—it felt like my life.

When I was younger, I could manage these emotions through working out or staying active in sports. That physical outlet gave me a way to release the pressure. But now that I’m older, I don’t have the same outlets. And the feelings? They’ve grown. They feel heavier, harder to shake, harder to carry.

I’m not sure what I’m hoping for in posting this—maybe just to not feel so alone in it. Maybe someone else has felt this kind of weight and made it through. If nothing else, thank you for reading."

Love me love me please someone love me!!!!  And sometimes I just feel like what's the point? Where has it gotten me? No where. No. Freaking. Where. I feel so overlooked and worthless. I will never be good enough. It feels sooooo effing good to type those words out finally. I'd never say it out loud but it is what I feel to be truest at my core.  Ok blah blah blah sad rant over "

I have been crying every single day multiple times for past 3 years and I lost a lot of opportunities. This extreme depression makes me want to die everyday and I don't know what to do. I wasn't like this at all and I was extremely high ambitious and a good student. But I don't know what destiny has in store for me and I want to die.

265,"I believe I am a narcissist. But I don't know. Me and my mom got in an argument so and so. Then I start making myself the victim in this situation. Me and my mom have been together for a long time alone, I now realize after COVID I've probably become a selfish person as were arguing. I could not seem to focus on her, I don't like looking at people so I couldn't look at her so much, I knew I was wrong at some point, so when she started crying I tried to make this all her fault. This argument is about me keeping an eye on my brothers and closing my door so she got Mad since they're little. Like I said, I tried to make it her fault. In many situations of my life I feel like people have targeted me and sometimes I was wrong so and so. I feel like a narcissist and that I would be better off alone. My mom was right people make fun of me and I coward off, and when she yells at me I know just when to snap back. I realize all of this as I make this post. I don't seem to care that much about people, yet I'm very sympathetic. I can be mean and feel the need to say sorry later, because I think it will make me feel better and it does. I don't do anything too much to make people hate me so we usually become cool. I'm lazy and selfish I hate me I hate my past. I wish I was different I wish I was someone else. I hate me, and everything about me. Yes I may be a narcissist and yes I do care, I don't think I should be around people, I don't know"
266,"I am just a normal guy from a third world country. People around me just disrespect me here and there. I feel very powerless. It's like people around you continuously try to use me for their own benefit and lie to me. I have some close people and they are all fake. A year ago a girl whom I thought from my class liked me said she didn't while keeping me as her sidekick and having multiple relationships with other people. She thought I am dumb person, but in reality I was too afraid to confront her. When I did, she pulled away. From then on my mental health started downgrading. Everyone, starting from my family to friends downplayed it and tbh I didn't open up fully too, firstly because they can't keep it among themselves and treat me like my privacy doesn't matter. Secondly, every advice they give is geared towards fulfilling their own self interest. I also appeared for a few entrance exams and performed very bad in all of them. I would have bounced back and I am trying my best but I don't have any real friends. I don't want fake friends. I want to be a real friend. Am I asking too much? I don't know how much I can carry on my shoulders. I feel very awkward in social situations. I am not able to communicate properly. There is constant buzz like heaviness inside my head for 1 year continuously. I don't feel like myself anymore. I smile at random situations and cry alone at night. Should I end it once and for all? "
267,"I don't want to stand up, I don't want to sit down, I don't want to eat, I don't want to drink, I don't want to do anything. I just don't want to be conscious. It's been 2 years since I left the house. I'm throwing my life out of the window. I have 0 qualifications. I spend the majority of my day in bed. I don't want to do anything. 

I can't do anything. I feel strapped to my bed. It feels like I'm dragging a lifeless body to even get to my bathroom. I don't wash, I don't brush my teeth, I don't see sunlight. I feel like I'm honestly not even mentally here anymore. I feel lost. 

I feel like a burden to society. I live with my mum. I don't work, I don't do anything. I just lie in bed and play games so I don't have to face reality. I'm just fed up. I don't want to die. I want things to get better. Things won't get better if you don't try. I'm not trying. I can't try. I don't want to try. I just don't want to be conscious. "
268,"accept it.
don’t run. don’t hide.
feel it. all of it.
your pain. your suffering. your emptiness.
from the moment you were born
to the day you die.
the days where you were:
crying, wondering, lost, happy, empty.
accept it. accept all of it.
and then try again
and again. and again.

keep going
not for them. for you.

make the things you want to see.
read, write, sing, cry, draw, sleep.

trust yourself
jump into the endless ocean
sink yourself into the black sea.

whatever comes, comes
whatever happens, happens.

i’m not afraid anymore
you can’t hurt me
i’m already dead
yet my body still here
my heart still beating
my soul gonna live a thousand years.

i’m gonna make rock bottom my home,
decorate it with my emotions and my art."
269,"Im so used of others just guiding me on where I should go and what I should do. I do extremely well with following others. I turn 25 in a few months and I realized everyone around me has an adult life and I feel so lost. I always felt I need to be of some use to others so I can feel like I’m useful and cared for. But Nothing in my life feels stable or even the slightest certain. I have a deathly desperate feeling of wanting something or someone who is willing to be something I can call a home. I feel like I’m a stray in life and I never realized how terrifying it really is. 

I went from going through K-12 because everyone does then I jumped into college almost like I was just on autopilot of what was what a “life” is supposed to be. I moved around a lot after I graduated and I never had anything stable and now here I am. I feel like I can’t be on autopilot anymore there really isn’t a purpose now. My early years I had basically guidelines on how to live. Go to school. Study. And I did that. But now I’m stuck and terrified because I don’t know where or what to do. I don’t have a single purpose. But I feel this feeling has been known for a long time but I avoided it so much to the point I can only face it now. I’m trying to find a purpose in my life and I can’t find a single one that can potentially be certain or something I can hope on. "
270,"Is there a spectrum for depression? Im sorry if this is the wrong place to ask. Maybe I have intense mood swings? It just feels like I'm chasing after short bursts of joy and pleasure. I have fun going out but when I return home I feel empty. 

 The things I used to enjoy has little temptation to me now. I used to enjoy the act of making, creating. Yet I have not touched my pliers, neither my sketch book. Even the games that I wanted to play for years doesn't bring me joy like before. 

. Music will wear me out, despite my addiction to it. I must listen to different songs after listening to the same ones non stop. I stopped functioning as a basic human being. I don't take care of myself, my hygiene, my hunger. I have no motivation to do it, except enough to make sure I don't smell or look entirely terrible to the people around me. 

I'm tired. Very tired all the time. Now even when I had just woken up I want to go back to bed. I seek out mindless entertainment like doom scrolling. It was never bad like this before. 

And I see no reason for me to feel this way. I left my toxic household, I'm in the sun, I have friends, yet I still feel this way. It makes me upset because I have no motivation for anything."
271,"I edited this because it was removed. 
Do whatever it takes to be happy today. Tomorrow can wait.

This isn’t medical advice, and I’m not a doctor. I’m just a human being who got tired of barely surviving. A person who, after years of silent suffering, decided to stop existing in fear and finally start living. And I want you to do the same.

I’ve been fighting anxiety and depression for 25 years. A quarter of a century filled with physical symptoms that would come out of nowhere and take over my body. Years spent feeling disconnected, exhausted, afraid, and hopeless. At times, I believed I would never feel truly alive again. I tried everything on and off medications, therapy, pushing through days pretending I was okay. But the truth is, I wasn’t living. I was simply surviving.

I was in constant fear of the long-term side effects of SSRIs and benzodiazepines. I was afraid of what might happen if I stayed on them, so I kept trying to quit. I convinced myself that healing meant being “clean,” that I had to prove I could do it all on my own. For over 10 years, I’ve been trying to taper off meds. I managed to stop the SSRIs completely, and I’ve spent years trying to eliminate the benzodiazepines. But you know what I realized?

I have no idea how much time I have left in this life. None of us do. What if it takes me four more years to fully taper off these meds, and I end up dying in just one? That would mean I spent the final years of my life in a constant state of withdrawal, discomfort, and fear fighting a battle that didn’t need to be fought that way. That’s when it hit me: I’ve already sacrificed 25 years. I don't want to waste a single day more.

We’re always told to be careful, to plan for the future, to avoid risks. But sometimes, the biggest risk is putting off your happiness. The biggest danger is waiting for the “perfect moment” to feel better when that moment may never come. I finally accepted that if medication helps me live a meaningful, joyful life, then that’s okay. It doesn’t make me weak. It makes me human.

Yes, medications have side effects. But so does living in fear. So does constant anxiety. So does untreated depression. Everything in life carries some risk. But living in a constant state of panic and hopelessness is a risk I’m no longer willing to take.

I know the stigma around mental health treatment is real. I know some people will judge. But they haven’t walked in my shoes. They haven’t felt the paralyzing fear that comes from nowhere. They haven’t cried alone in the dark, wondering if life will ever feel normal again. They haven’t had to fight for their sanity every single day.

I want to travel again without being held hostage by panic. I want to say yes to love without pushing it away because of fear. I want to do the things I enjoy, to feel alive in my body, to smile without guilt, to finally breathe without fear.

Please, don’t turn down opportunities because your anxiety tells you you're not ready. Don’t let depression convince you that your dreams don’t matter. Don’t let the fear of medication stop you from living a full life. You are not weak for needing help. You are strong for still being here.

There is a whole world waiting for you outside your comfort zone. A job, a friendship, a love, a purpose. Don’t let it slip away."
272,i has been like 4 years i'm so lost and depressed and i was always thinking about killing myself i went to a therapist and he gave me a medicine i took for like 2 years and i did not work and last year i met a girl i fell in love it made me forget my pain after a year i wanted to make her my fiancee but after all this time she broke up with me and i since then i was more depressed than before and tried to kill myself twice so i really need help i need to get rid of all the voices in my head that wants me to kill myself and i really need to get over the break up it has like 4 month but i can't get over her i can't even fall asleep without thoughts that make me unable to sleep so please if anyone know Solution tell me because i really can't take it anymore.
273,"Hello everyone! I would like to ask around here about the medications your psychiatrists have prescribed for your depression and anxiety. What were you prescribed? how are you feeling with them? did you need to have a talk with your psychiatrist about not feeling better and maybe taking another approach / different meds?

Ive been battling depression and anxiety for over 15 years now, and judging from my current therapist, it could be more. It seems my depression is either treatment resistant or the depression simply has become my personality. Ive been in Wellbutrin 300 xl, wellbutring 150mg and escitalopram 20mg for years. However, I still see that I am in the same patterns, I still feel the same. In fact, I dont think i know what I should be feeling anymore, what should be feeling ok and what are my shortcomings in my talk therapy. Im still getting very hurt by how people treat me, thinking how lonely I am, still having no motivation to put effort in things that would (supposedly) make me better like exercising or eating healthier, how I can't see myself being ok in the future (actually, I cant visualize my future at all, like my life is on the edge already).

Im having my appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow, but I would really like to know your experiences. Thank you for reading."
274,"I 24M can't flirt? with women without having a panic attack or creeping them out. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but I'm still alone, lonely as hell. Haven't gotten laid in about a yr, and haven't really been with a woman. I wouldn't count some chick that was desperate to cheat on her man. I'm bi, but I've been told that I only try dudes cuz I can't get anywhere with women. No, but also, yeah? Idk. ""It'll happen eventually, just hold man"". How long before I'm just behind, with no dating? skills, instead of just a little acoustic? I just want to feel wanted for more than 5 fucking minutes

Edit: i've also tried posting in different subs for dating advice, subs that are meant for dating advice. Not enough karma or this or that. Like bro, just make prostitution legal. A gf, or even the smallest fragment of a relationship, isn't going to happen. No chick wants to be with a loser. Me, no woman would want to be associated with me in such a manor. Tbh, I wish I could give up on lots of shit and have to pay less taxes. Other ppl wanna have a society and shit to do? OK, cool. Get to work, you can keep it going 🤷‍♂️"
275,"im not gonna go on some big rant and stuff because frankly idk what to say and theres not much to say, but I'll say this.

Bro everythin is supposed to be fine, im supposed to be happy and everythin is fine around me, but im not happy, im fuckin sad, everyday, i try to be happy and I should be happy and I cant explain why Im sad, it feels like a state of mind, its hard to get motivated to do stuff, and I try to push through but it just gets tougher and tougher, when it's not even supposed to be tough. I feel like such a bitch rn complainin abt like being sad when everythin around me is fine, I DONT KNOW WHY I AM SAD ALL THE TIME, WHY AM I LIKE THIS"

277,"Hi, not sure what I'm seeking maybe just another perspective? I know everyone says things will get better but I'm struggling with things getting worst first. I feel like no matter how much progress I make I backslide and I keep just wanting to check out of life. Is it really normal for people to be happy often? People always say that but I've yet to see or experience it. Even when I have every reason to be happy I just can't be. I feel like I'm missing some secret to happiness that no one has told me. I'm so exhausted again and I just want to rest. Can you really recover from depression? Or are the highs just temporary and you have to fight forever? Any advice on how to feel better when it feels like everything is falling apart? "
278,"Have had bouts of depression on and off since I was a teenager.
Currently 24 (guh, still unsettling to admit I’m that old) and in grad school for engineering, something I once thought was cool and useful and rewarding, but it was never my main focus or passion in life.

My main passion since high school has been running, cross country and track, and it’s definitely been the greatest experience of my life. I improved a lot, made friends, and got to travel to cool places when I continued running competitively at a small D3 college, even qualified for nationals a few times.

I’ve recently come to the end of my NCAA eligibility and the past year has been really downhill in terms of running. Was anemic, had really weak legs, low energy, couldn’t train anywhere near the level I used to and never get through a whole race without my body falling apart, a rude awakening after the virtually linear success and improvement I’d experienced since I started.

In that difficult time, I tried to find other things to care about, but found that nothing else really satisfied me in the way that training and competing did. I doubled down on my commitment to the sport that had become so central to my life and identity, but frustratingly, these efforts seemed to yield no improvements.

Finally, after my most recent race of the season, which was a spectacular failure, my mind and body were trashed, seemingly worse than I could remember, and I simply couldn’t make myself go to practice the next day. Something finally gave and I quit the team.

But without running, I realized just how little I cared about school or really even had a plan for a career and what to do with my life. Though I don’t have anything else in my life to focus on. I’ve lately been doing the bare minimum in my classes, I can’t even get myself to double check my assignments anymore, or study much for tests. I guess I just don’t think any of it really matters. I can’t imagine working a 9-5 doing this stuff, but these classes ain’t cheap, and what the hell else am I gonna do? 

I feel so lost. I have an irrational urge to move somewhere completely foreign and just start a new life. Though I’m a creature of habit and know I’ll probably never do anything spontaneous in my life. I don’t know if I’ll be able to finish this quarter, much less go through a whole nother year of even harder classes. 

I feel like I made a big mistake somewhere along the way."
279,"hi friends, i do have depression but i can't tell if what i'm doing now is because of my depression or if i'm just being straight up a lazy dumb bitch. what even constitutes depression over laziness? you can have both, can't you?

i only work 3 hrs a day, 3p-6p. i have classwork assignments as well and i need to do them because i'm falling hard behind in them, but i just. can't. i don't want to. i don't really want to do anything.? it's like all i think about and yet i can't muster up the energy to do them. i was doing so well. all i wanna do nowadays is lay in bed, play video games, get off, and that's it. i don't wanna sleep, i sleep horribly. i don't wanna do anything productive. i don't wanna. i just don't want to. 

i'm still... like, happy. i don't actively want to die right at this second and i'm not totally miserable. i just feel like i can't keep up with anything, ever. i wanna curl up in a tight ball and have the world go away because its so embarrassing i can't get my shit together and be productive when i don't do anything else at all with my day otherwise "
280,My english is very bad. What's something you do when you feel depressed? How you change that mood? What's something you do make you feel normal/good again? Thanks.
281,"Has anyone ever dealt with these issues? I have had anxiety/depression for almost 10 years and it has worsened. I have been on Prozac, Zoloft, and neither have worked. I also have a safety net bottle of lorazepam for emergencies (just knowing it’s there helps more often than actually using it). Over the past few years I’ve noticed that I can feel every movement of clothes on my skin, whenever I get a muscle spasm or something “weird” happens and it ends up just being a stomach grumble or just an odd sensation on my body. The past 3 weeks I’ve been going to TMS therapy for depression and my anxiety has gone absolutely haywire. I’ve had to take my lorazepam 4 times in these weeks when I haven’t taken it in 4 years previous. I constantly feel like I’m dying because I’m hyper-fixated on every possible feeling in my body. I went to the ER today because I had a panic attack while I was driving, couldn’t breathe, got the hot/cold feeling, shakes, all of it. They gave me an Ativan (not sure if that’s the spelling) which helped a bit, but I think what my mind really wanted was the bloodwork and ekg to tell me that my body is normal. I’m just looking for answers if anyone has ever dealt with this and has some sort of advice on how I might be able to manage this. I’m not suicidal, I think about death often but my anxiety comes from the fact that I don’t want to die. Any advice would be very appreciated.

Side note I was also a pretty heavy drinker and decided to stop for the treatment. I also stopped smoking weed a few weeks before treatment."
282,"I don't understand why it matters that much if you kys if you're going to die anyways. sure some people will be sad if I go, but is that really worth living a life you wish had never started?"
283,"Hey everyone I'm about to be 22, still a ug student and I've been feeling extremely low and avoidant of my surroundings for a while now, I feel worthless because I'm not performing well academically I've taken a year break too and even after that I'm still failing miserably in my exams and my parents are unaware of whatever is going on I'm afraid  if they find out they'll be so much disappointed in me after all the efforts they have given.
This always happens, if anything inconvenience happens in my life I tend to be avoidant and isolate myself for weeks and this is what exactly happening now and isn't getting any better with all the overthinking and past traumas it's slowly building a wall between reality and my myself, it was okay before but now I feel like my situation is getting worse as I get older
I went to a therapist to end it for once but i couldn't instead I ended up hesitating and bursted out crying couldn't utter a word and never went back again, i always try to seek for help and end up the same way I don't know if I'll ever heal from this

I really don't know if you guys understood or not, i just typed whatever came into my mind

Thanks"
284,"I dont know if Im depressed or just avoiding my responsiblities. Im healthy, look moderately good and Im a student about to hopefully get my dream internship. I am also in the process of gettnig my driver's license and have supportive parents. I am social, communicative and loved by many people.

I just feel like I havent lived my life in a year. Studying feels like barely surviving because of how hard it is and we barely get breaks. Maybe a week of breath and then I have to start working again and keeping up with the material.

I have taken drivers lessons for over 7 months. Its so expensive in my country and most of my money go to these lessons so I cant really buy anything for myself. I have to postpone buying things or doing something fun for after I have gotten my driver's license. Yesterday I had my first exam and failed miserably. Like the way I failed was literally gutwrenching. Like most people fail because of a mistake but I felt like I made mistakes the entire ride. Like I knew nothing. It couldve been over but I screwed it. And I dont even know if Im going to pass next time because of how bad I drove. I feel like a dissappointment

Ive also had a bad relationship with food and body dysmorphia for the past few months. Im trying to fix that and its getting better I hope.

Today I cried because I had to wake up. I really really didnt want to wake up. Waking up means I have to do things I dont want to do. End of resting. I feel bad for feeling this way because Im privileged. I have big oppurtunities, a bright future ahead of me and since I live with my parents no real financial issues. I just feel stuck and empty. I cant keep up but I have to. I cant speak about this to anyone. 

Am I depressed? Burnt out? Or am I just lazy and complaining too much? Do I have a vitamin defiency?"
285,"Are you one of those people who can't escape being human?
No matter how much you try, you can't be that awful, yet
everybody can, or is it just me? it's painful, I wish I could all beat them.

"
286,"(This is mainly just a vent, I started having another episode again)

I keep getting more frequent depressive episodes and I feel like they keep getting worse.  It’s not just burnout or end of the semester laziness, im genuinely so exhausted and tired from doing nothing and I can’t sleep.  Even if I did sleep at a good hour, I can’t wake up or I wake up too early.  I feel like my mind is fucking me over.

My field is creative, but all this mental illness shit has tanked my creative drive.  I don’t do what I used to to and I’ve spent so much on hobbies I’ve only done once.  At this point, every hope or project makes me dread the inevitable end of me not finishing or even starting it.  

Writing this all out makes it seem so dumb.  There’s nothing bad going on, but my brain just feels this way.  Time is slipping by and I know things are only going to get worse for me here.  I don’t have much of a drive to live.  I think I just lost that blind hope that things will settle eventually.  I’m tired of feeling this way.  I don’t know why I can’t just be normal.  I feel like everyone else has valid reasons to be depressed but my life has been too good for any of this to be messing me up.  

I can’t get out of bed, I can’t think, everything is so tiring.  I barely showered and I haven’t drank water in good while.  I haven’t ate, but the idea of eating and making a mess and cleaning it up makes me want to starve instead.  I’ve been up for like three hours and I just want to go to bed.  

It feels so lonely.  I’m surrounded by people but everything is just empty.  I don’t think people understand how bad I feel and I can’t make them.  I mention how I want to die and Im tired of everything and I’m told that it gets better and life is boring without a challenge.  Or that god is going to fix everything.  That doesn’t help.  I’ve been fighting the same challenge for the last 9 years.  I was a child, why did I have to feel like that.  I don’t believe in a higher power, so religion is meaningless to me.  Things are so bad but so good that it just feels like I’m in someone else’s body and watching what’s going on.  I yearn to feel out of control.  I drink just to feel fuzzy and slow.  It feels like it’s the only way I can stop feeling like time is passing to fast.  

Sometimes I think this current moment is just a memory and I’m going to wake up at a worse time. It makes me nervous. I get scared reality is going to change when I open a door, like I’m living in this fantasy land and I’m gonna wake up to something I dread.  I get stuck in rooms because I get so paranoid something is out to get me that I can’t leave.  It feels like I’m either staying like this or dying."
287,i’m such a fucking failure. i’m 14 credits behind as a senior so obviously i won’t be able to graduate on time. i’m in online school and everyone is expecting me to go to college next semester like a normal person would but im not even graduating. i’m trying to finish but i know it’s impossible now. i feel like shit and just want to die 
288,"It may seem stupid to be sad because I'm not in a relationship, but it's more than that. To tell the truth, it's been so long since I've talked to a girl, what I mean is that I have friends, I'm not the only one to engage, most of them are real friendships, which I've managed to establish for a while, but in sentimental terms I'm so alone, my last real flirtation was 3 years ago, and I have no way of talking to new people, the period of flirting where you get attached to a person and conversely, or you finally feel important to someone, that you discover them etc, this period is great, but I don't have access to that at all. As for meeting new people, none of my friends are around a girl who I might like, both physically and mentally, and who is obviously single and interested in me. Recently I met my best friend's sister, we had a good laugh, etc., but I know that it won't go any further and that we won't talk outside of rare outings with her sister, I don't really know what to do to change things, meet new people, etc."
289,"I don’t hate them but even if they wanted too I don’t think it’s possible anyway since they are on the opposite coast. Why don’t they understand?

Don’t give me the crisis line stuff I don’t want to hear it. I made my decision 6 years ago and have already tried many many many times and this time WILL work. I WANT to die. Why should anyone else be able to tell me what I want to do. I do not care about how selfish I sound. Living is comparable to being kicked in the head everyday. I don’t want to deal with anything anymore. I’ve dreamed of death so many times, it is my final goal. It is the only thing I want and can achieve on my own.

I feel like I’m going to throw up. If they can call 911 on me I don’t want anything to happen. Now I fell paranoidddd"
290,"20M, for some reason I have no motivation nor the desire to do anything. Yesterday for some reason I was so fatigued I couldn’t get out of bed and I slept from 10pm to 6am, called out sick for work and then from 6am to 3pm woke up and was still tired. Legit was staring at my ceiling. I don’t want to do anything. Idk what to do. Even chewing food or drinking water is a hassle. "
291,"I moved into my home three years ago.  I haven't even been taking baths regularly.  I just got a hold on that a few months ago (around March).  I'm bathing (as in a bath, not a shower) at least twice a week, but no more than three times a week.  I don't work or exercise much (that is changing now too!), so the most I would bathe is every/other day.  My previous pattern was around three to six showers a month. I've only been washing my waist-length hair 2x-4x a month.  Yeah...

Even after bathing, I would feel gross because, you know...  You're just stewing in your own crap.  And sometimes I was going a week and a half without bathing in any form.  And it takes much longer to do all of that while taking a bath versus taking a shower, so I knew I was just sitting in dirty water and really not accomplishing too much.

Part of the reason why I didn't shower is because I'm fat and clumsy.  My knees would really hurt and buckle if I would stand in a confined place, but I've lost almost 30lbs this year, and that problem is going away!  Another part of the reason I haven't been showering in my home is because of the utility setup of my bathroom.  There is an AC vent right above the shower and it causes my shower curtains to mummify me, basically.  And I can put them on the outside of the tub, but obviously, that makes shit wet.  I know...  Excuses, excuses.

I got myself new, nice, thick bath mats for my birthday.  I took a shower at my parents' house for the first time in years this past weekend (I go there most weekends, Friday-Monday, so that says a lot about my shower frequency) and it felt AMAZING!  I forgot how efficient taking a shower is.  And I'm not sweating when I'm done with it, either, which means my skincare products won't be sweated off and I don't have to wait 30+ minutes to cool down when I'm done!

I'm hoping this is the start of my return to cleanliness and self care.  It's a pathetic thing to be proud of, but that's what we're working with here.  Thanks for reading!

292,"Hey, so i (26M) have been diagnosed with chronic depression sense i was a kid, and have always had problems with having some crazy thought when i lay down at night and to drown them out i usually put on a you tube video to drown out the thoughts and it has worked for me for a long time. However lately it has been really messing with my sleep, and i feel making the depression worsen and turn off the video just lets my mind wonder and that's what I'm trying to prevent in the first place. I don't know if this is a normal problem but I'm really starting to suffer because of it if anyone has any reqs i would really appreciate it."

I tried every method online but i cant, i don’t know whats my problem. i tried starting goals, chunking it down to small things but nothing works. I tried sh to force myself to do anything it still doesn’t work. I’m just unable to put effort on relationships, work, or anything. i wasted the past 5 years of my life because of this issue. i want to care and put effort

295,"I’m a 20 year old girl and ever since high school my depression and anxiety have been very prevalent. People kept trying to convince me that it’s all in my head and that it’s a chemical imbalance, but I know it’s because of the environment I’m living in. Since graduation, this anxiety and depression have been so unbearable and it’s affected my health physically. I feel like it’s gotten worse. I’m not eating much anymore because I’m either working long hours, doing school, or trying to get as much sleep as I can. I’m doing everything I can to try to live normally, just as my therapists have instructed in the form of coping skills, such as going on walks, keeping up with self care, listening to music, etc, and yet it’s not helping me. I really need help. I’m losing hope for the future. I can’t afford to live on my own. I’m having terrible luck in finding true love. I have no idea what to do. My future seems so fucking bleak. I tried to kill myself when I was 16 for very similar reasons, and had a very traumatic experience at the psych ward as a result, not to mention a very bad relationship with a guy who didn’t respect me and probably spread rumors to people at school that I was crazy. I know I need help but I don’t ever want to go through that trauma and judgement from others again. I just want someone to listen and understand, maybe even have the answers I need. I’m so desperate right now. I feel like I’m dying. I have a very hard time trusting mental health professionals so I really don’t know who to go to. "
296,"I could not tell you for the life of me whatever is wrong with me.

I feel like shit, honest.

I feel like the best years of my life have been wasted.

I could have genuinely tried to make more connections but the hate towards myself was too much.

I began to self-sabotage.

I am not someone I am proud of.

I do not do drugs or alcohol but I might as well,  you know.

Anything to ease the pain at this point.

I wish I could be normal.

I wish I could be just like everyone else.

But I am not.

I wish that I could just drown in my own sorrow.

Till' my own existence just started to slowly wither away.

I'll kill it dead.

Until there is no more.

"
297,"I'm sick and tired of people telling me I ""just need to love myself"". I'm sick and tired of people telling me to ""practice self-care"".

You know what? I do fucking love myself, and I do practice self-care. I force my ass out of bed every single day, even when I don't want to. I make sure I eat something, every day. I clothe myself, every day. I brush my teeth, every day. I brush my hair, every day. I shower as often as my crazy combination skin allows me. I get up and move, every day, even if it's only a walk to the mailbox and back. I put on music, even when I don't feel like it, because music keeps me focused. I buy things for myself that I want and need. I do the dishes when the dishes pile up. I do the laundry when the laundry piles up.

Name me one person in a committed relationship who wouldn't do all that shit for a sick or injured partner, who isn't a giant jerkface. You bet your last pair of frilly old bloomers I love myself.

And you know what else? I *still* have depression. I still cry for hours. I still feel hopeless and want to die. I still have motivation so low I sometimes stand in the middle of a room, looking at everything not knowing what to do and not moving until my body needs something. I still have sad thoughts that spiral for days. I still hate myself sometimes.

When it's just you and you alone, you're own caregiver, and anyone who's ever been in caregiving will tell you... It. Is. HARD. Even when you're mentally well, it's incredibly draining. When you're the sick one, too, it's ultra-draining.

Loving myself and performing self-care doesn't magically make my mental illness go away, and I wish society would stop acting like they should. I'm so, so, so sick and tired."
298,How long was/is the pain. I'm genuinely thinking about doing it and I want to know. Will I even feel anything when I hit the ground or will it be an instant death
299,"I dont really know if I would because it’s become a part of who I am and my personality in a way. Even with all its nasty sides and the awful parts of feeling like a numb shell at times I just don’t really know if I’d still be ""me"" without it. "

304,"So a little about me, i just bought my first house that needs work almost 2 months ago, been working on it while moving stuff there as much as i can between rest, my primary job, i also mow lawns for side money since last year and have people that expect me to be there. I also have people that ask for help and sometimes i help them or i try to. I aint perfect but i always try and i feel my effort is great than others usually. Well yesterday after work i tried to rest because ive been going for months back to back everyday with everything going on, tried making some time for mothers day with my mom and that fell apart. She begged to give her the day so i did then she didnt want to anymore after i tried to make a plan with her. Then i got busy but still made time for the planned and delayed family event that fell apart and after a few hours i had to leave to get more stuff done. Well after that and i havent had time to keep up with family and friends i feel like everyones mad at me and my mom is mad at me. I cant understand why people cant leave me be when i need to do a half million jobs because it holds me up and then they get all drama and but hurt when i dont have time to waste my day or understand when i take a day off i need to rest so i can keep kicking these jobs ass. Also due to the pressure of bills i started door dashing and am doing well at it basically doubleing my regular jobs pay with both side things and people cant understand why i need the money after all this debt for the house amd bills and im recovering from a car crash in december when i was going in to plow parking lots i slide off the road into a tree there went 8k that i didnt have ☹️ just sucks man, i work so hard and get nowhere. On top of that the only person that doesnt hate me is my gf she understands and i was supposed to go see her in december but then i crashed. Love her to death shes been amazing and supporting but i feel so bad i let her down a bunch and i want to be there with her. I can never save up the money or that. I get help sometimes from people but then feel bad, i feel like i need to work for everything. What a mess ive made of life ☹️"
305,"Got transferred to the bank diamonds was getting decent hours, the manager realized i actually do know wtf I'm doing and was treating me like a human being and showing respect and offered me the ordinary hours when we go back to the arena. Pretty solid right?

Well, then my insurance company calls for a safety inspection, all 4 rotors, brakes and a tie rod end and rear tires are fucked, think of can do the brakes and rotors myself because I'm relatively handy. Long story short 2 sets had bolts i could get, they were sized to fuck (understandable as I don't have a lift so not as much leverage) but was feeling pretty good about successfully getting the 2 done. 

Well I fucked one up completely, and one of the bolts that were seized was also broken and is about 100 fucking bucks so now I'm about to add another 400 to the 850 I've already spent and I still don't have tires. I was already fucked for money even with my tax return coming at the right moment, it wasn't enough to cover the hours dropping at the arena (end of season slow down) 

No vehicle is not an option either unfortunately as I'm in the middle of nowhere (not by choice) and am over 50km from any type of actual town (where I work) and a little over 100 away from a major city

I honestly don't even know why I fucking bother anymore, I keep trying and keep failing i just can't do a single fucking thing right.... well except suck at everything

If you got this far, hopefully you can feel a little bit better about yourself because you're not me (this is just the tip of the iceberg and the last month and not counting a lot of other smaller things)"

307,"I served in the marine corps with my younger brother. A few years back my brother decided to kill himself a few days prior to Christmas. His body was found on christmas day. Even after a few years of grieving I still find myself broken and a hollow shell of what it once was. 

My laughter feels like an empty echo 
My smile is just a mask 
My happiness just a lie to myself and those around me 

I find myself trying not to think of him anymore as if it would be better to forget him all rather to relive the guilt and fear I felt for him. 

The cycle continues with me trying to cover up my depression with actions cause if can just be more productive, work out, get a second job, go to school then ill be too busy to think of his lifeless body when I went to dress him in his uniform at the funeral home. 

The rigor mortis set it, his hands cold, his face disfigured from the entry and exit wound of the bullet. 

The memorias haunt me, mock me of my failure to stop his final action. "
308,"this is it. I'm reaaaalllyyyy tired 

I just want to be unconscious. no, I don't want to die. but i don't want to face the reality. I'm thinking about taking my pills and be unconscious, maybe it'll last for a day, or more. 

i honestly don't care about anything anymore. i don't want to live, I don't want to die, I just want to be unconscious. is there any way to be unconscious forever? lol

i want to sleep all day, and i did, that's the only thing closer to be unconscious. but i keep waking up over and over again, and i hate that. 

so, what should i do to be unconscious for a long period of time?"
309,I finally took the first step to healing from a emotional/ financially abusive narcissist relationship.. I called to schedule a appointment but while on the call I end up crying hysterically to the scheduler she was very understanding..

310,"I’m a 20 year old female college student and my best friend said we can’t be friends anymore because i’m too anxious of a person for her to be around. I don’t even know what to think anymore. I said that I could act less anxious around her but she said that it doesn’t matter because she’ll always know that inside i’m anxious and that makes her a more anxious person apparently. I’m distraught because my entire friend group is blown up now and i’m basically alone again. I’ve read tons of books or short stories of people with mental health issues and they always have either a best friend(s) or significant other to support them, but my friend just left me and now the rest of the friend group doesn’t want anything to do with me. What the fuck do I even do anymore. "
311,"i'm so tired. i cry literally everyday,and school isn't even that bad. i'm a senior,i've been thinking of moving school but that would be a lot more difficult. my best friend is driving away from me and my other friends and me just aren't that close. 
I went from passing all my subjects to failing half of them. i can't go on like this,i don't know what to do.  my family makes it even more difficult(they're emocionally abusive,minus my mom) my mom and my other best friend who goes to another school are the only ones i told them how tired i am. i don't know how to stop this,i don't wanna go anywhere"
312,"i grew up being abused by my father who now refuses to admit ever doing so to my family & i, even though he is STILL abusive.

 i met my current partner last year & we have gone through SO much, so many issues & forgiven each other, just for me to find out last night that he is still cheating on me. no matter how much i changed for the better & how good i treated him, he still cheated. i am even closer with his family than my own & we live together. leaving him means leaving my home, the only home i have ever truly had, & returning to my father, which is horrifying to think about.

i struggle with many things like self harm & suicide. i probably have bpd but i cant even be bothered to see a professional about it. i cant sleep until i exhaust myself by crying. i cant bring myself to eat. everything is falling apart.

i am proven time & time again that the people i love will just betray me, no matter how much i give to them & love them. i dont know what the point is anymore. i have been going through life aimlessly just fighting to survive but im so sick of it. i am literally living just to suffer."

"
316," My neurologist prescribed me an MRI because of the bad results of the electroencephalogram. If they find something, I will be happy because I will finally understand what exactly is causing my depression.
 I have been taking antidepressants for 5 years and I do not understand why they do not help me. Zero effect. This suggests that depression is just a symptom of some other disease. I have no other guesses.
 But I already had an MRI 6 years ago, the results were normal and then I was already depressed (though, this was only the beginning). This fact undermines my faith that all this will finally end and I will be able to live a normal life.
  I am afraid that the doctor will again throw up his hands and show me perfect results. If the results are perfect, why do I constantly have a headache? Why is my life shit? 
 It is so hard for me to wait for the day when I can go and have an MRI. It is some kind of torture."
317,"I am in my mid 20s and have now been in therapy for over a year. I've already been in therapy for 2 years when I was a teenager. Always because of depression and social anxiety. The thing is, I feel very lonely and lost and confused because I rarely hear of people that I can relate to. I have had social anxiety since I can remember, even as a little kid. And I have been suffering from chronic depression at least since I was 11, but I am pretty sure even earlier than that. I don't wanna put my whole life story here but long story short, it's probably mostly genetic from one of my parents. I've never read about people who's depression is chronic (I never have a 'not depressed' phase), high-functioning (i have a full time job, partner, friends, hobbies....) AND doesn't have a real starting point like a childhood trauma etc.
I just kinda want anyone who's similar to share their experience. I don't really want advice since I am already getting help. "
318,"**21M** born in a 3rd world country with an avg. IQ and most likely on the spectrum.

I don't know where to start, I feel like my whole life I've been letting the tide take me wherever it wants.  
I love my mother, but she didn't have a clue on how to raise a kid with bs going on in his head so she just neglected me. I love my Dad too, but he didn't raise me either since they divorced when I was a toddler and never taught me anything besides a bit of business management.

Wasted my whole youth on escapism like videogames and anime, bad grades on everything, few friends and bullied during Midschool and Highschool, had a gf at 18 and it lasted 4 months till she cheated, then a situationship last year with a really close friend that ended because of dishonesty (had a hookup with my ex best friend).

Therapy feels like a scam, there doesn't seem to be a good therapist in my city because I've tried it many times but It just don't lead me anywhere.

Where I live College Education is free, but it's unbelievably bad plus there's not a lot of careers, and I didn't have the money or will to study elsewhere so I resorted to taking courses that led me nowhere for the last 3 years.

So I'm basically a NEET I have 0$ to my name and the only thing I like is going to the gym, sure I'm fairly built but I lost a lot of progress the last 3 months. 

I HATE the thought of wage-slaving my life away like my parents did I've tried it and it just makes me feel like I'll end up being a number without having achieved anything meaningful in my life.

I've had suicidal thoughts since I can remember, tried doing it twice and I might try again since I think everyone would be better off without me, I feel like I'm trapped since I'm not smart enough to be good at anything so I'll always fall short every time I try, what's real funny is my surname literally means ""Failure"" in my language lol good one.

319,"i got heat stroke at work back in March and haven't had a job since then... my savings is down to $1000.  

I live with my mom and her husband - they are gonna kick me out June 1st.  i have to somehow grow the balls to go through with it by then.  i am too depressed to get a job or to even think about finding a  new place.

I've messaged friends before when feeling distressed, but I think this time I'm just gonna let them be.  I'm sure a few of them will feel some type of relief upon leading of my death.  

I'm really scared that my mom is gonna find me... and funerals are so expensive.."
320,"i don’t want advice, just needing to vent. 

my stomach hurts from all of the stress im enduring. i can’t sleep or eat. it’s never been this bad. today there has been a really sharp pain, near my heart. am i going to die? lol. i cry everyday. why am i like this? why do i make things harder for myself? why am i addicted to self destruction? why can’t i be successful at redirecting the negative thoughts? 

yesterday was the worst thing. my sister, drunkenly, told me that instead of focusing on all of the bad things, i need to get up and do something. i wish it was that easy. it’s not. i don’t want to and i don’t know how to find the drive. 

i am suicidal and it’s getting worse. my therapist has somehow made it so my appointments are no cost. i am grateful. but barely any time to speak with therapist because new job. 

don’t know how to prioritize myself. no sense of self. no self worth. childhood trauma haunting me every single day. i am so tired. i am so tired. i do not want to be here. i want to give up. but i can’t. i’m so sad. "
321,Just saying. I am sorry in case I upseted.
322,"I've avoided posting this for so long because I feel as though what im feeling isn't as severe as what most people here go through,  but I needed to vent and don't know what else to do.

I hate everything about myself. I hate how im always being belittled because of my skin. The other day I was talking to a friend about how I would love to travel someday, and they said I should go somewhere with little sun so that maybe my skin would get lighter. The worst part is that it wasn't even a joke, he was being 100% genuine, which is objectively worse.

On top of that, I'm so fucking ugly I hate looking at myself in the mirror. I'm 18 with a receeding hairline and my confidence is at an all time low. I have never felt comfortable in my own body. I have a condition called Pigeons Chest where my ribcage is misshapen and my sternum juts out. Everywhere I go I feel like such a freak and I don't know what to do.

I don't want to kill myself but I just wish I wasn't me to begin with. And Im ashamed of it because I know for a fact that this doesn't compare to actual hardships other people go through, but I've bottled this up for so long and I didnt know where else to post it."
323,"i used to be funny, friendly and well-liked. the barriers i broke down are going back up, and i know i'm subconsciously perceiving everyone as a threat, so now my brain is blank 24/7 around others. it's made me so bland, unfunny, quiet, submissive. the depressive episodes suck, because you don't have the energy to speak to anyone. but the happy periods, where you do have the energy to speak to people but realise you have nobody left to speak to, suck even more. it hurts even more knowing that i was like this in the past and i was so proud that i overcome it. and this time i can't fix it as easily because a lot of the factors creating this depression are things out of my hands. yes, i know ""fix the things that you can control!"" it's easier said than done..."

Over the past 2 months I feel super lethargic. Even at work I just want to sleep. 
I am getting the same amount of sleep ~7 hours so nothing hAs changed. I don't want to talk to anyone . I don't call friends or family. 

When people talk to me I feel weird, actually get more tired and sleepy. 

Is this depression?"
325,"I've been trying to do things to help with my depression like going outside, walking my dog, exercising, and even trying to learn new things or pick up new hobbies. But I just get bored of everything quickly, and the sadness always comes back. I do go to therapy and use grounding techniques, but they never seem to really help. I've also tried going out and spending time with friends, but no matter what I do, that sadness is always there with me.

"
326,"This is my first time posting something on reddit so just bear with me. I’m really desperate here. So to give you guys some context, my sister (20F) is severely depressed. She suffered from anxiety and depression for almost 3-4 years. It seemed like she was getting better with therapy. She said that she doesn’t feel the anxiety symptoms anymore but that she never got better and now it’s particularly bad. She’s made two suicide attempts this year alone. I’ve tried taking her to therapy. But she only attended a few sessions and says that it will only make her worse and that it overwhelms her. She’s not willing to take therapy AT ALL. She doesn’t even believe it’s depression but from what she’s told me, I think it is. She says that she feels empty all the time and that her brain doesn’t shut off for even one second. She’s always either thinking negative thoughts or thinking about the fact that she’s thinking too much and should stop. She also says that she thinks about killing herself all the time, that it doesn’t stop for even a second. She was on meds when she was 17 but it didn’t help at all. But I think other than therapy, only medication can help her? I’m feeling so tired and hopeless. I don’t know what to do anymore or if she will ever get better. She seems to far gone… If anyone has any advice, I’d appreciate it. Thank you <3"
327,"I feel completely drained. I wish I could just smile, but I feel so down right now combined with some mix between feeling numb and dizzy. "
328,"So this is probably my most vulnerable post to date. I was diagnosed with major depression four years ago, and all I could bring myself to do during most of that time were the most basic tasks like eating, going to work, and showering. For some reason, brushing my teeth just felt like such a huge task most days, and my dental health took a hit (obviously). I also broke my retainer and didn't have the energy to get a new one, so my teeth have shifted, which brought even more shame (self-inflicted, no one has actually mentioned them). 

Recently my psychiatrist and I found a medication regimen that works, and slowly but surely I've emerged from that hole. I know I have to go to the dentist because it's been literally 4 years and my therapist says it'll be a big step. But it's been a feedback loop of I don't want to go because I'm so embarrassed, but that just pushes it off more. I can tell there's plaque, and I know the dentist I used to go to would be so mad and yell at me for not brushing/flossing. 

Does anyone who has maybe been through the same thing have tips? Do I find a new dentist and tell them up front about this struggle and ask them to not mention how bad it is and just do what they need to do? Any help appreciated :) I really want to get over this hump and move on with my life."
329,"I'm so used to being alone now that having people around tends to irritate me. And I'm okay with being alone and away from family or friends for long periods. Yes, I do get lonely and depressed when it becomes tooooo long, but I've always fought it.. alone. And I've never expected anyone to listen to my tears.

But rn I can hear my roommate complaining and literally crying over the phone to her bf and parents that this place is depressing and she wants to move out next sem. She's told me so many times before that I'm a nice roomate and everything, but recently she's just been so distant, atleast from me. Tbh it kinda hurts being alone and I've tried to get her out of the room but she has other friends she hangs out with so I intentionally don't bother her much. I don't think I'm a great person to hang out with anyways because I'm not that interesting nor that interested. I tend to be in my bubble a lot, not talking much, and maybe it shows my depressing aura.

But my roommate had the audacity to have such a conversation right next to me. Maybe she didn't mean it's because of me, but in my ears it just sounds like there's nothing worth staying my roommate just for the last semester. That hurts. And I'm quite jealous she has the courage to cry about something like this in front of of other people when she's freakin 25 years old. She even goes back home in the weekends but I haven't been home in the last three months. I seriously can't fathom what she's crying over.

I guess depressed people really don't experience the fun side of life the same way, otherwise we'd also be crying over what we missed out on."
330,Have you ever peeled left out I do I'm always left out my friends don't like me my family don't like me Idk what to do anymore rn I'm doing anything for a conversation with someone but no likes me I thought it will stop and I will make friends no I've never had actual friends 
331,"Today, my mom called. She asked me if I was okay since I dont call often, and I said I am good. She replied “u are good thanks to god, always say that”. And when she hanged up, I started crying. Idk why that did it for me. I am an atheist, and I haven’t told my family cause I know they would just shit on me forever. I am bi, and I cant tell them, because they are extremely homophobic. I have tattoos that I will have to hide once I go home, since they would disapprove. 

There are a lot of ppl that go through a lot of fighting for their family to accept them, but as someone who financially depends on them and is currently on a visa, I don’t have the luxury to rebel. I don’t have the luxury to just tell them. And the more I think about it, the more I understand that they probably wont accept it. They will try to actively change me actually. Not just my parents, ALL my family is religious. I wont be able to handle it. I k ppl say to pull through and wait until I eventually can break free from them but it id hard NOW. It hurts NOW. What do I do about that? 

I feel so drained. I have to study for finals and have no energy. I have to start grad school application and all I can do is cry. Why couldn’t I be lucky for parents who would be there for me? Why is the world so unfair? I just thought about just ending it so many times 

Whatever "
332,"I’m really depressed and it’s hard for me to move my life forward. I have the chance to go to the gym, eat healthy, and fill my mind with studies, but all I do is have bad thoughts and do the bare minimum—like cleaning the house and cooking.

333,"I failed university doing something that I thought it loved. At 19

I’m home now, parents keep saying I would’ve tried if I actually loved it

Realizing I didn’t enjoy anything at all, I waited and only looked forward to sleeping every day, not mentioning I made 0 friends or contacts in 2 years of being there

Had a girl for a bit, don’t know how but it actually lasted a bit, she dumped me. 

I’ve been home for a month and I’ve been applying for jobs, it’s extremely disheartening doing all these little tests and personality quizzes and cover letters and all this work for something that I know I will hate my life at. It feels like I’m actively trying to make myself unhappy, I’m doing this work so I can make minimum wage at McDonald’s. I’ve been working since I was 15, I have work with the provincial government, yet I’ve not had one interview. It’s so hard for something I don’t want

Everything feels so hard, leaving the house, getting up, showering, cleaning, but even talking to my friends, writing, reading, walking. 

All I want to do is be at home and sleep


I feel guilty 24/7, my life isn’t hard. I have parents and food and shelter, yet all I want to do is end my life.


I go to my friends place a couple days ago and all they talk about is going to the bar and one night stands, I feel disgusted. I don’t relate to anyone, no one understands what my life is like, no matter how long I wait for someone like me I know I’ll be alone. While people my age are seeing how many people they can be with, I’ve given up seeking for someone who is like me. I’ve tried so hard for 19 years and I’m so fucking unhappy, why keep trying? It’s so much easier to give up 


I met an older person who said to me that happiness only matters in the end, and gave me a story about her friend who was unhappy for 60 years, then she met her soulmate at 60 and died 2 years later.

I don’t want to wait 60 to be happy. That isn’t worth it in my opinion 

I grew up always being told I’d be something, I was happy to see that I’d make something of myself. I was smart, i was good at sports, only 2 years ago I was going to go to a nice uni on scholarship. Now I look at my life and laugh, I used to laugh at bums like me and now I am one 



I’m 19, I hate the man I’ve become because I don’t recognize myself in the mirror 

Sorry for this fucked up chicken scratch, I’m so depressed, I’m sick right now, I’m exhausted, and honestly I’m done with this life "
334,"Having nothing to share with anyone just sucks. I have to do everything by myself or with my dad. I’m 19M and feel like I’d be better off dead. My dad is tired of me from what he said. I work at fast food place, volunteer when I can, and have my own hobbies but nothing is fulfilling. I try talking to people but no one seems to really care. I’m nothing special. I ruined all my relationships with my exs and have absolutely no friends. Maybe by dying I can get the new start I want. I hate my sister and I just get in the way of everything. My plan is to buy a shotgun, go in the middle of the woods and pull the trigger. No note, just peace."
335,"It’s so crucial there, the teachers are nice but the students are so mean.

I have been going to this school for like 4 years and each year is hell, I’m a fat girl who isn’t the prettiest. And everyone just treats me like shit there.

Like these fuck ass girls in the group chat keep saying “I love you _” and “you are my idol!”
Like shut the fuck up?

And the worst part about it they use “pretty” to practically bully me, they say I’m “pretty” and beautiful but I can see it in their eyes that they are lying.

I have almost killed MYSELF. Because of this fuckass school

I just wanna leave this school, but I can’t. I have like a month or so left untill I graduate and go into high school."
336,"Dysthymia patient here. This technique helped me greatly to calm down and be at peace for the moment.

Maybe you want to give it a shot.

Be safe though ❤️"
337,"I developed depression a few years before I started exams or anything meaningful at school so I was already in the habit of doing absolutely nothing at school and thinking it's all worthless before exams started. When exams actually rolled around I was just completely tapped out of school. Sleeping through most of my classes not paying attention to anything all while thinking that I would just start putting in effort the next day or a month. I never actually intended on putting in effort and I never really cared but it was reassuring to know that I could technically save myself if I wanted to. I actually had zero idea if or when I was going to start studying it just never felt like it was something I could control which to be fair to myself it really isn't. Now I'm almost finished my exams and I still don't know how I've done. I think I just failed maths which hurts. Really though I don't feel stressed or like I've done anything wrong more than anything I just feel angry yknow? Like why I am I doing this why does it matter who fucking cares? Even though I know the answers to all of those questions all I can think is that it's horseshit. Similarly it makes me a little angry wondering why nobody did anything when (in my opinion) I'm very obviously outwardly depressed I mean I'm blatantly tired all the time I can't physically bring myself to do anything that requires effort and I haven't shown interest in anything school related for years but at the same I have genuinely no desire for help really I just want to not be expected to do anything. I do understand that really it's nobody's fault. I only really care because of the embarrassment of doing poorly, the pressure from my parents and how time consuming retaking a class is. I've been trying really hard to make a coherent point while writing this but I feel like I've hardly said what I feel point is school is awful and miserable and it's shit how it's my only real option in life "
338,"Hello. About three weeks ago, I was in a motorcycle accident and broke my elbow. The pain is manageable, but my arm and elbow won't straighten completely, and I'll have a 5cm (approximately 2-inch) scar on my face. Since the accident, I've been blaming myself a lot. This elbow surgery has forced me to change my future career plans and has been a significant emotional shock.

Constantly blaming myself and overthinking has led to **suicidal thoughts** and feelings of worthlessness. I'm judging myself very harshly, and since I live alone, I don't have anyone here to comfort me. After almost becoming disabled, life has started to feel meaningless, as if the future is only dark and painful.

I've never reached out to a mental health professional (like a psychiatrist or therapist) before, but I'm wondering if now is the time. If I do, what will happen? Would they commit me to a hospital? Thanks for reading"
339,I just so want to no longer exist. I really want to die . Why is death eluding me ? Why can't I just drop dead already. So damn tired of feeling this way.
340,I was doing better for a long time but I’m back here again. I just want this to end
341,Hello
342,"I just wanted to share how much insight this book is giving me. My pride has kept me from doing therapy and reaching out to loved ones for too long. 

In a particularly desperate day, I found myself not knowing who I was and having no sense of purpose. Again. This time I started to walk aimlessly and saw a book store, I remember I used to like books so I went in. 

The first few pages of this book made me burst out crying, which was a relief from the apathy that had taken over. Im starting to understand this thing as an adult (I’ve had it since I was 17). ESPECIALLY where the bitch starts and I end. 

He compares it with a parasite and a tree, I was feeling so guilty about all the things I wouldn’t, couldn’t do and knowing that (in a figurative way) it is something that takes over is allowing me to gain some control back. 

I highly encourage anyone who needs this to find an outlet to learn about depression because it makes you feel less alone and understood. Of course I recommend this book but seek out anything you can do in the present moment, maybe a podcast, audiobook, movie… 

With a lot of love and hope 🤍"
343,I feel like I’ve become so numb to stress and trauma in my life. I think a good sob session would help release that. Any tips?
344,"I have been a living problem for almost 15 years. I can't think of anything but suicide and I don't feel like doing anything, not even the things I liked to do four years ago, before I fell into depression. If it weren't for my mission to raise awareness about autism on my YouTube channel, I would have killed myself already. In any case my suffering is reaching extreme levels. I just want to go to sleep. Forever. "
345,"Hi, I'm 17 f and the past month I shut out all my friends, I talked to them very less and cancelled all the plans we made. So I was talking to one of them today, and they said that I ghosted them , and I just feel so bad. Nothing happened last month and I completely isolated myself, I don't know what I'm doing and I feel really bad for ghosting them,but  during the past month I couldn't even pick up a phone call. I don't what I'm doing, I feel so lonely, it's killing me. "
346,"Tenho avaliado diversas alternativas para tirar minha própria vida, uma vez que não quero mais estar vivo.

De todas as alternativas que avaliei, me jogar nos filhos do metrô oareceu a alternativa mais segura, rápida e fácil, mas acredito que existam poréns e que exija algum planejamento.

347,"My career looks like it’s over. I am drowning in student debt and will likely be fired in the not so distant future.

I can find hope. Only sadness."
348,"I'm 28, married and have 2 young children who I love to pieces! & I always tell my husband if I didn't have the kids I would have killed myself s long time ago.. 

I live quite a comfortable life but I feel it's fake.. I'm not happy from the inside.. My husband has this strange fetish about me sleeping with other men and all he does is fantasise me with other men and tells me how to dress (I look and feel so disgusting in the clothes he picks for me) they're very very revealing and even in the car he humiliates me when it's just the two of us by telling me to take my top off and have my breasts out (he gets excited if another man looks at them) it's been going on for around 7 years now and I'm just so sick and tired of this.. I can't divorce him.. it'll hurt my children since infront of them we're always a happy loving couple and I can't kill myself because that will also hurt my children.. I've never mentioned this to anyone.. and bottling it up is just driving me mad! He doesn't talk about anything else when it's just the two of us.. he'll just masurbate and talk about other men desiring me and wanting to do this or that to me.. it's honestly so sickening.. he's also convinced me into stopping all this in the past if I slept with somebody he found online.. and so I did.. after sleeping with the guy it's almost like half of me had died that day.. it's my children that keep me going and give me a reason to smile and live but recently I've not had a will to live.. not even for them..  How I wish I could just die! Instead of this humiliation every single day! And I know you think why do I even listen to him? But if I don't listen he doesn't talk to me and makes it very obvious to other family menders that we aren't talking.. and I don't want to upset anybody into thinking there's something going on in our marriage.. and I don't want to humiliate him by telling them what he does or has done.. "
349,"**Hi everyone**

I don’t really know how to say this but I’m in a really dark place right now. My mental health has been getting worse and every day feels like a struggle. Getting out of bed feels impossible and pretending I’m okay is exhausting. I feel so alone numb and honestly I’m just tired of faking it. It feels like I’m slipping more and more and I’m scared. I’m trying my best to hold on but it’s hard. One thing that helps me a bit is gaming. It gives me something to focus on and helps me forget for a little while. I’ve really wanted to play GTA V for some time now. I know it might sound silly but it seems like a game I could get lost in and feel a little less empty. I can’t afford it right now and I hate asking but if anyone could gift it to me it would mean more than you know. Just having a small escape would really help. If not that’s okay too. Just writing this out and knowing someone might read it already makes me feel a little less invisible. Thank you for taking the time to read this."
350,"I've been Battling with Depression since I was (13-14) currently (23) anytime something bigger that's bad happens to me I spiral and want to blow my head off.

I'm tired if rebuilding myself it's miserable going from doing somewhat good to not being able to make eye contact with anyone and feeling pressure in my chest.

This cycle constantly repeats and there's nothing i can do about it doesn't matter how much I journal or do breathing exercises I crumble .

I currently have to go pick up Laundry from the Laundry mat and have to teach a class I'm a Martial arts instructor I'd rather bash my head into the floor then do either of those things.

I was thinking I might just call it and kill myself by the end of the summer

The cycle never ends.

351,"I recently joined a Discord group where everyone inside struggles with mental health issues. One day, a member told me about a girl in the group who had a clear plan to get drunk and jump off the roof of her school. I started chatting with her online, trying to build a friendship and understand her situation. Through our conversations, I discovered that she feels lonely and overwhelmed by the pressure from her parents. She also shared that her mother said hurtful things to her during her childhood, which deeply affected her.

The reason she wants to act on her plan now is because she recently graduated from college, and her parents are pushing her to start working. But she doesn’t even want to live, let alone work. I tried to help by suggesting some easy part-time jobs, and after much hesitation, she finally agreed to apply for one. Unfortunately, she didn’t get the job, and every time we chat, she still brings up her plan.

At one point, I convinced her to share her resume with me so I could help her improve it. Now I know her name, phone number, and the school she attended. I even know the exact day she plans to execute her plan because other members told me.

I’ve decided to call her school and share everything I know, hoping they can intervene and stop her from committing suicide. This situation has been weighing on me every day. I’m also a depression patient myself—I’m not particularly fond of life and struggle with pain daily. But I’m still holding on, letting time gradually ease my suffering.

I won’t say I’m going to “save” her because we all know how tough life and depression can be. But she’s only 23, and the fact that she openly shared her plan and trusted me with her information makes me feel she’s not ready to give up."
352,"I have struggled with depression in many forms. In the past it looked like not being able to get out of bed and being unemployed and sleeping all day. Now I’m 30 and I’m doing good, I have been for quite some time. It feels good to be stable but I am so bored. The feelings I describe to people definitely sound like depression but It’s hard for me to see them that way because I can still function and I’ve never been so responsible, stable and respected in life. I guess I just have functioning depression now?

Currently how I feel: 
Inability to feel joy unless I have a drink when I’m out,
No desire to do things I used to love,
No drive,Hard to feel emotions (I used to be a very emotional person) 

Part of me wonders if this is just the SSRIs…I’ve moved cities multiple times thinking maybe I could excite myself with a new place and it is fun! But it wears off. 

Good example right now: it’s so beautiful out right now, beautiful weather. I’m sitting in my apartment, probably could go for a walk. But what’s the point? I’ll go outside for 30 mins, walk back. Then I’ll be back inside for the rest of the day. What was the point? I feel the same way about showering often.

353,"

    I don’t want to love my father. According to him, I was given everything imaginable and should succeed like no other. When (not if, but when) I don’t succeed, he makes sure I’m ashamed. I hate him. I truly hate this man: I hate how I look like him, I hate when I act like him, I hate when I enjoy what he enjoys, I hate when I hate what he hates, I hate when I’m good at what he’s good at, I hate when he thinks he understands, I hate when he does, I hate when he hits me, I hate when he brags (as if only hitting your son is something to be proud of), I hate when he thinks he loves me, I hate that he doesn’t, I hate how mom always apologizes for him, I hate how I rely on him, I hate that he speaks to me, I hate that I *must* speak to him, I hate being on the same earth as him, I hate being alive at the same time as him, I hate prolonging his faux care in me, I hate making him feel like he’s succeeding, I hate how he knows I hate him, I hate that he doesn’t care, I hate how he yells at me, I hate how I’m the resident dumbass, I hate how I’ll always be the resident dumbass, I hate how he thinks I should know better, I hate how he thinks I should have been better, I hate when he calls my actions mistakes, I hate when he thinks I was somehow a mistake, I hate that this might just be him showing his love, I hate that my mom calls us similar, I hate that I have four years before I can leave him for good, I hate how he talks to my mom and my sister, I hate his voice, I hate his being, I hate how he “supports” me, I hate how he twists his words to make me the villain, I hate how I’m always the villain, I hate when I have to clean up after his mistakes, I hate when I have to be near him, I hate when he’s disappointed in me (he is always disappointed), I hate when he says I could have done better, I hate when he says I should have done better, I hate being in the same household as him, I hate that I can’t leave, I hate how he cares for his dog more than anything, I hate how he still lost his dog yesterday, I hate how he speaks, I hate how I must speak near him, I hate myself, I hate him, I hate that I hate us both, I hate how I never want to go home, I hate how scary he makes home, I hate how dangerous home is when he is there, I hate how long this paragraph.

354,"have had some issues for the couple past of years, but now it’s getting a lot worse. I traveled to be with my family because my grandmother went very sick, eventually she died 40 days ago, I’m still with them, and I want to get to the city I usually live in. The problem is that I started to get a lot of phycological issues such as panic attacks(I think). I do work from home since the pandemic, I don’t get out too much, but since I got to be with them, it’s getting worse. When I go to the store or try to walk long distances I get anxiety, and I’m not being able to breath very well, I start sweating, I start not being able to walk, and it’s a lot to handle. When I’m home when I use to live I don’t usually have that unless there are a lot of people around me. Now I’m scared to go to the store or being in the city centre walking because I have that. I don’t know if it’s a panic attack or not but it’s making me scared to go out and live the way I used to 2 months ago. I used to go to a psychiatrist but I didn’t have those problems, just having anxiety and I only had Deanxit(not sure if it’s spelt correctly in English). That doesn’t seem to help me anymore and I’m scared I’m getting worse and I have it. How do I get better?"
355,"I constantly constantly try and try to kill myself. I was so close a couple of times shaking on a bus stop whilst cars ride throught the street or holding a knife right by my throat only to always give up in the last moment. Why can't i do this? Why can't i just end it? I believe it will happen in the future but my god the waiting game is shredding me apart. I don't even care for the fate of my family or my friends i just want to do it so so bad and yet i always just reset and something gets me going for a little while. How do i already do it?? I know this might be not the right place to ask for that but think about it. It's just that everything is prepared, i have the notes on my computer telling all the important things, i have the sheer will to do it, i stopped caring for everyone else or what they will think after i die. This is worse then pain itself, the wait for the right time to actually do it. Please tell me is there any way to just ease up this process? Keep in mind that i am a minor. Please please please someone give me a tip to do it quickly without a way to still go through."
356,"I (23F) have struggled with depression, anxiety, and OCD for most of my life and was officially diagnosed when I was 19. I was going to therapy and was on meds but of course stopped because I’m an idiot. Since then, I have moved to a new state and changed my lifestyle 100%. I used to be completely sedentary and i was raised by two parents with similar mental health issues (albeit worse) so the depressive behavior was always normalized in my household.

I exercise, go outside a lot every day, eat a healthier diet, and try to take care of myself. I ACTUALLY get out of bed now and do stuff and get out of the house and get dressed - it sounds basic but i swear this is big for me. AnywaysI knew this would happen but of course the issues and feelings I’ve struggled with for my entire life and adult life have come back in full force. Even though I take care of myself and on paper I seem very successful and to be doing well, my brain isn’t listening. Idk how to describe it but even though I am doing the things to make myself feel better, my brain is still fighting itself. It’s full of shit literally.

I also have lost interest in most of my hobbies that I used to love (wow shocker), I have intense guilt and shame, intense flashbacks to trauma I’ve been through, issues dealing with work schedules and school deadlines, etc. 

Of course I know the answer - I need to get back on medication and go to therapy. I’m working on that currently. But has anyone else had this issue? The number one thing that was always recommended to me is lifestyle change, and I do think it’s improved so much! I am happier but at the same time my brain just doesn’t listen. It sucks ass. I’m just so so so tired. My boyfriend was raised with similar issues with mine and we both feel like we are just exhausted from the first 20 years of our lives. "
357,"I don’t usually have feelings of sadness, only when I truly ruminate & realize how little foresight, ambition, or love for anything I have do I feel sad. But I just feel lost & dull. I’m very misanthropic & I feel lost, maladaptive & disinterested with everything & everyone. I feel alone. But my mood is relatively stable. I can still laugh & feel a lot of joy but then it defaults back to this derealized feeling where I don’t care about anything or anyone. I still feel fear & anger and anxieties towards my future too. For multiple reasons I cannot access a therapist at this time, so just curious on as to how to self diagnose. Thanks for any help in advance. "

Although I think the Wellbutrin worked at first, I’m using generic bupropion -I believe it’s losing its effectiveness.

If this stops being a choice. What is the next option that is typically recommended  
I totally understand that that’s where a doctor needs to apply their expertise. But I was just curious what some of the other options are and how they determine what kind of depression it is. is.

On the other its kicking my ass.  They tell you going in 'just tell us the side effects your having, we can help'.  No the fuck you cant.

Chemo is just round after round of chasing side effects. There's not a damn think Ive been able to do to actually prevent them.  And my god, you talk like this on the cancer forums and other patients tell you the fuck off.

367,"23f, I think I’ve been depressed since high school. I just didn’t see a future for myself back then. It got worse in covid and i started having anxiety attacks realizing I’ve messed up my future. I grieved a long time for I could have been successful, I could have enter a better college. I’ve been seeing a professional since then. I suffered with anxiety attacks and heavy depressive episodes where I couldn’t get up. I am seemingly better now.
Now, I care for my future and I want to get my degree in the college I’m attending but I’m struggling with studying, I’m on medication and while I think they help, I am basically forcing myself most of the time to go to college, take care of myself, to have friends. I have a passion outside of school and attended events for it, even though “passion” would be a strong word since I don’t really believe in myself for anything and can’t be really excited about anything. Sometimes I am motivated but then, a depressive episode hits and it’s usually before my period. It destroys every hope and belief in myself. It takes time to recover too so I basically have like a week where I am doing good.
I am already behind my peers. How to survive to get the degree while I am not consistent mental wise, when every glimmer of motivation or positiveness go away so easily. I am so weak physically and mentally. I could use some tips from those who also suffer similarly."

369,"I broke up with my girlfriend of two years about a month ago, and she already fucked somebody else. And she’s already telling him she loves him  she leads both of us on, but keeps the door so open for me and it keeps me going. I miss her so much. I think about her all the time, everywhere I go all the little details. Remind me of some sort of memory with her. I really don’t care anymore that it would hurt other people if I ended it. It hurts so bad every single day to miss her like this. I started talking to someone else myself, and I found solstice in the fact that she also was getting over her ex. But it was in an unhealthy way, and it caused a big rift between us, now she had talked to my ex and badmouth meets her and they both like me less because of it. After the break up, my ex has kissed me multiple times, and hugged me multiple times and told me she missed me and loved me. And that’s part of the reason why I keep trying to get back with her as well. I don’t know what to do, my family and friends are all sick of hearing about it. And I’ve been cutting the last two days. It’s been embarrassing when people ask me about my wrists and I need to find a better way to hide it. 

I’m really not ready for her to give up on me. "
370,"I don’t know how to feel anymore. I’ve been unemployed for a year now, I’ve been broke for a year now. I have no friends and I haven’t had any friends for about three years now, before that I had one friend, that friend was my abusers cousin and she was the only person I was allowed to talk to. I’m supported by my amazing partner who I feel so much love towards, but so much guilt for how much he has to do for me. I was with an extremely abusive person from the ages of 15-20 though, where I was regularly screamed at, cornered, used, and sexually assaulted. I have this person initials carved into my chest, and it was done without my consent. In 2023, I was involved in a domestic dispute with my abuser which led to a multitude of things; first and foremost me getting arrested after my own mother told him to call the police on me, him co-conspiring with my mother to turn my family against me, me being homeless and getting my property stolen from me as he had the cops kick me out of my own house, a serious head injury that has left me with severe migraines to this day, not being able to be employed until I could get a psychological evaluation because I was accused of being crazy after he beat in the head, amongst a never ending list of other things. After it was found out that I am, in fact, not crazy and I have complex post traumatic stress disorder due to a lifetime of serious traumatic events, the case was dismissed. I then started looking for work again, only to find out through a physical for employment, that I was finally so close to securing, that something is wrong with my heart. I have no money, I have no friends, I have no family, I have no health. My partner is an actual angel, he cares for me, he pays for me to go to therapy and for all of my doctors appointments, all I can do is cook, clean, and love (I feel like a low-tier shitty house wife because I can barely get that done). The copious amount of love I have for my partner will never be enough to repay him for supporting me and literally keeping me alive, and I hate myself each day because of it. I hate watching him go to worked tired and beaten down while I do nothing. I feel like a shell of a human being every day. I’m constantly alone and lonely. Every day, I’m in pain both physically and mentally and I don’t know what to do anymore. My 22nd birthday is next week, I made one final attempt to try and find some sense of community, everyone I tired to invite can’t make it. I’ve had an extremely traumatic childhood: junkie parents, neglect to the point of ending up in hospital because my starving toddler self ate rat poison, child-on-child sexual assault because as a child I was being gifted out for drugs, childhood homelessness, and abuse; but I stayed strong and fought everyday to keep going. I’m a firm believer that suicide is not the option, but things seem like they never get better and it’s the only thing that’s been on my mind for a while now, and it seems like it might be the right choice.

Please, someone tell me I’m wrong. 

"
371,i dont feel anything since 2023 and i cant even explain it.
372,everyone hate me I'm gonna kill myself life sucks I hate this world I hate every fuck everything 
373,Actually I'm suffering from a health problem for six years. Because of that I couldn't clear an entrance exam to get into medical school. I failed back to back three times. I'm both physically and mentally ill. I was diagnosed with depression and some new serious health issues a month back. I'm taking medicines. I'm completely mired up with failure and mental & physical problems. Now the problem is my parents are telling me write the exam again next year. They are ending every conversation saying we are not forcing you. But the way they are speaking is like they want me see with that white apron very badly. It's like that is only thing they want. But my current mental and physical condition has made completely hopeless. 
374,"So. I'm not in a good place.

I mean I have a 2 bdrm apt that's cheap compared to today's prices. It's why I haven't left.
Im currently on OW (Canadian welfare) and can barley afford anything. 

All my mental health resources are within walking distance  right now.

My dad is currently in the hospital.  And will not be returning home due to lack of bodily functions. Mental state and such.

My mom has offered me to move back home to save everyone money. (She's been helping me out here and there).

Problems. She live in cottage country.  You have to drive everywhere.  I lost my license years ago. I'll be kinda trapped. And no work opportunities.  Probably lose my OW.

Im not sure if this is an opportunity.  Or multiple steps backwards. 

I'm afraid that it'll be my childhood all over again.  Where I'm nothing but free labour. Cut grass, shovel snow. Clean this. Fix that. Rake leaves. Move this. Ect.

I know i need to get my shit together.  I'm thinking I'd rather clean my place up and get a roommate instead of moving back home.

I have time. But just weighing options. "
375,"i have been struggling with self harm & suicide for a long, long time. i kept trying to hold on, mostly for my moms sake. i know she might try to take her own life if i did, & if she doesnt then it would affect her for the rest of her life.

the people that i love, the people who were supposed to love me continue to hurt me over & over. they constantly prove to me that im worthless & that at the end of the day, they don’t truly care about me. i have nobody to go to about any of the things i struggle with. trauma, depression, self harm, whatever.

living is suffering. im only here because im worried about how it would affect someone. other than that, i have made peace with death & im unafraid. why am i even fighting to be alive when i know i have the power to end my pain & suffering?

perhaps my mom will just learn to live without me & i can finally be at peace. i hopefully wont be around for much longer."
376,"Hi,
I’ve been struggling with my mental health for years, but lately it’s gotten to a point where I can barely function. I feel completely numb—like I’m not living, just existing. Nothing makes me feel anything anymore. I don’t enjoy anything, I don’t care about anything, and I have no energy to try. Every day feels heavy, like I’m just dragging myself through it.

My grades have completely fallen apart. I failed my exams with some of the lowest scores possible, and now I have to repeat my final year of high school. But I’m terrified I won’t even pass this time—I feel so far behind, like I’ve already failed.

I feel like I’ve disappointed everyone—my teachers, my parents. They’ve put time, money, and effort into helping me with tutoring and support, and I still couldn’t do it. I carry so much guilt for that. I feel like I’m not trying hard enough, like I should be doing more, but I just can’t. I’m mentally and emotionally drained, and nothing seems to get through to me anymore.

I feel stuck in this hopeless cycle, and I don’t know how to fix it. I feel like I’ve let everyone down—including myself. And what’s worse is I don’t even know how to care anymore. I’m scared. I feel like I’m slipping, and no one really sees how deep it’s gotten."
377,"Хей... Я конечно знаю что никто почти это не услышит и не прочитает но... Я наверное покажу кому нибудь это... 
А так это история, наверное, того как я оказался один? Грамматики нет да и чëрт с ней я буду писать так как думаю... 
Эмм с чего начать то.... 
Я Артëм Астахов и мне 15 лет... 
Сука ненавижу и фамилию и возраст ибо одна вещь меня клейма а вторая запрещает курить.... 
Я не из тех людей которые идут и дерутся за ""свой район"" Нет... Хотя я в таком месте вырос... Очень тяжело это сейчас осознавать... 
Иногда кажется что я абсолютно тупой и не понимаю очевидных вещей ведь люди только и могут что драться, а я.... Ну я договариваюсь... Да только это не помогает... 
Мне с детства твердили что я какой то не такой.... Ведь веду себя не так думаю не так и в целом неправильный... 
Да вот только я делал всë так как меня просили... А в итоге говорили что неправильно... 
А потом я осознавал что добавил что то своë и всë испортил.... 
Ну... Вот примерно так протекает первое моë десятилетие.... 
И..... Примерно лет в 9-10 я попадаю в школу номер 40 ..... 
Оооо да это мой личный ад..... 
Избиения 10 раз за день издевательства на каждой перемене и полная беспомощность.... 
Там я получил свой первый шрам.... 
От толчка на ебаный штырь... 
Пронзил руку... Не насквозь но чудом не достал до вены... Это на внутренней стороне запястья у меня он.... 
А может не шрам.... А клеймо неудачи? 
Ведь с того момента всë и пошло к чëрту..... 
Кхм ладно не важно....
В общем я немного.... Задрался по жизни как видишь.... 
Хе... 
А сейчас я еще и в полном одиночестве... 
Но зато я хотябы здесь могу просто жить? 
Как же хочется сейчас просто впасть в кому и выйти через 10 лет.... Это будет прекрасно... Ну конец первой моей записи хе друг.... "
378,"I don't feel like I belong anywhere or know any people who can relate. I'm 17, I was born in India but moved to the UK when i was only a few months old, so don't know if i qualify as British Indian. I feel a really strong sense of identity with my british values and the culture around me, but i don't know how many people would recognise that and accept me as British, especially with the riots last summer. On top of that I can't even speak my mother-tongue language, only English, which is my own fault. The other day my mum said I'll never be fully part of either culture and that im just a partially-integrated hybrid and it really hurt me because thats been my biggest insecurity growing up until now. I feel so depressed and have lost my sense of identity, im scared I'll never find people who relate or understand. I just want to be able to embrace both parts of my identity, but i know people from both sides wouldn't see me as one of them. "
379,"If I was at that level, I wouldn't be calling your helpline.

I am so unwell at this point, I'm losing my sanity. If a cup of tea could fix me, I would not be here sobbing my heart out saying I cannot take this pain anymore. And then they end the call saying ""your life matters, take care""..... Okay, well I'm still in this pit suffering with no end in sight, and I am beyond exhausted. Living with depression is such a lonely experience, no one understands. 

These helplines exist for god knows what reason because they sure do nothing but make me feel misunderstood and like no one cares whether I live or die."
380,"Hi, I want to tell you a story about how I was bullied in the seventh, eighth and ninth grades. Now I'm 16 years old but this problem haunts me to this day. Every day I have flashbacks. I cry and so on. I'll tell you right now that I don't have money for a psychologist because I'm poor and I can't talk to my mother because she once condemned me, and I have no friends. What should I do? Please help."
381,"All I want is to die, I can't stand myself anymore since years actually but I'm too scared I might end up in hell or something."
382,"I can't do this anymore everyone hates me, they are using me and I can't live anymore, I'll probably overdose "
383,"I am so exhausted with myself. Too mentally ill to work full time, too poor to move out of my parents, too worthless for anyone to care. I have nothing to show for my 29 years of existence, no skills or qualifications or friendships, and I am too depressed to do anything other than lay in bed or force myself to do things I think I should enjoy. I have tried countless medications, I have tried therapy, I have tried sitting in silence, I have tried exercise. I am completely defective lost cause destined for nothingness and disappointment."
384,I have felt so tired since the end of last week. Granted I worked six 12 hour shifts in 7 days but during my time off I’ve been so drained and not wanting to do anything or visit anyone. Is this a sign of depression?
385,"I just can't stand the cycle. Waking up in this world is miserable. I'm so alone. I want to bash my head against a wall. I really hate this world. It's all so pointless and dull.

Nothing gets better. I stop thinking about it for 5 seconds but it always comes back and drags me back to this place.

I wish I died sooner. Sincerely. I wish I never made it to adulthood, I was so much happier before. Everything is awful now.

It just sucks. The good parts of life are so short and the miserable parts seem endless. There's no way back. Just have to keep trudging forward through the garbage. But why? It's exhausting. It's unrewarding. It's hellish."
386,I used to read and draw however due to my depression from trauma. I haven’t been doing much of anything for years. How do you get back into hobbies after years of doing nothing.
387,Im a 20 year old male with no friends. I had friends in high school but after a little bit they stopped contacting me and I got blocked by some. One of them mentioned me ghosting them but I wasn’t talking to anyone and isolating myself in my room. I wasn’t able to really pick up calls and talk to people. I’ve always had trouble reaching out to people because I don’t want to be a burden but now I just constantly feel empty. I have a big family but I don’t really feel part of the family I always feel alone. 
388,"The past few months have been extremely awful for me, I have had sleeping difficulties, haven't been able to function properly. Because this has been eating at me

A few months ago, I took some time away from my relationship to focus on something important in my life, for a month,. I didn’t stop caring. I never stopped loving her. I just needed space for a short time. I thought we’d be okay — that we were strong enough to survive it.

But when I came back, something in her had changed. She told me she didn’t feel the same level of attachment anymore. That hurt more than anything I’ve ever felt. Still, I had hope. I believed it was just temporary. That if I tried hard enough, things would go back to how they were.

So I tried. I stayed close, talked to her constantly, made every effort to rebuild the connection. And for a short while, it seemed like maybe it was working. But it never truly felt the same. Now she rarely shares things with me. She doesn’t talk to me the way she used to. I feel like I’ve become just another person in her life — not the one she once said she never got tired of talking to.

I know she still cares and loves me, as she says. But it’s not the same, and I can feel it. It’s inconsistent, distant, and it’s tearing me apart. The version of her that loved me like I was the most important person in the world is gone, and I can’t stop grieving it. She gets angry at me a lot, which she could never even think of doing to me earlier, before all this, among other things, she just seems so much more distant, like she used to be when we had first met. 

I don’t know how to move forward, I am a deeply emotional person, and I form bonds strongly, she gave me something I didn't think I could ever have, before her I thought I was completely unloveable, I wouldn't be able to get into a relationship, let alone have someone love me to the extent she did, I don’t know how to stay in a relationship with someone who doesn’t seem to feel it the same way anymore. I’ve tried talking about it, but it only upsets her.

Now I don't know what to do anymore, I don't see a future ahead, I don't know why I should do anything now, I see no point. 
"
389,"Up until about 2-3 weeks ago my experience of depression was 24/7 mental anguish
I've started feeling kind of numb and disconnected from life, like someone else is talking and doing things not me. I come across things that would've seriously distressed me before, or think about my problems, and I just don't care. On the surface I feel a bit angry or sad but really I feel nothing.
Is there a solution to this? Cause I kind of preferred the anguish lol"
390,"I feel like I’m singlehandedly keeping the world spinning, or at least my friends on their feet. I buy drinks to their bad days better and I console them without the expectation of an explanation or apologies. I’m constantly taking care of everyone else but the moment I crash out everyone is gone and somehow I’m still being told it was a problem and I’m apologizing for it. I don’t know what to do, I’m chronically depressed it’s never going to go away. I wish I didn’t have to apologize for existing to the people I would die for. I wish I didn’t feel like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders. I think it’s going to crush me. "
391,I'm needing to come off lexapro 20 mg so I can switch to vortioxetine as lexapro is not working for anxiety/depression. My psychiatrist is planning dropping 5 mg every fortnight? Does this sound like an ok withdrawal plan or will I get withdrawal symptoms?
392,"Please help me figure what's going on as I'm totally hopeless 

I am 23 years old. Here is my pain journey.

EARLY PHASE
I was usually a healthy kid. 3 years ago in 2022, during my college days, it was covid and i used to play video games with friends for 4-5 hours continuously almost daily while slouching. That's when I started feeling mild pain in both of my thumbs. Once I didn't play for few weeks, pain would go away. I didn't took it seriously as it was pretty mild but something i encountered frequently.

In 2023 i graduated as software developer. My job involved typing on keyboard for 7-8 hours a day. Initially i was fine for few months, but gradually i developed severe pain in all 4 fingers. Pain seemed to be originating from nerves, I would type for 10min and my fingers would become sore. I tried using ergonomic keyboard and mouse which did help but no major impact on pain. When i tried to force myself to type, my fingers would slightly swell up. Slowly i also developed this pain in both thumbs. My thumbs got slightly swelled. I couldn't type without stylus.

PEAK PAIN PHASE
In mid of 2024, I started experiencing muscle twitching all over my body. It started in legs then arms then eyes. Slowly i also developed pain, numbness, tingling and burning sensation all over body. Sometimes it was in left hand sometimes in right hand, sometimes in legs. I also felt it inside my spine and on tongue. I also felt severe eye pain and light and sound sensitivity. I got brain mri which was clear. CBC, vitamins were normal. Anyways I continued with pain somehow.

HELL PHASE
During end of 2024, I was walking a long distance suddenly i felt severe pain in both knees and started limping. I thought just a strain and would get better but it didn't. I waited 1 month walking with limp, full of pain, eventually ended up getting knee mri which showed minimum synovial effusion but joints ligaments etc were normal and doctor said mri is inconclusive and it's soft tissue injury.

Current situation 
I'm full of pain. My symptoms are

1. Pain in eyes when looking extreme left or right

2. Severe pain in fingers and thumbs (thener muscle), can't type without using stylus

3. Pain in knees with mild limp (due to chronic soft tissue injury)

4. Severe pain in feet, toes and ankles when i walk

5. Random pain lasting few seconds in arms and legs

6. Episodes of numbness tingling across hands legs lasting few minutes to sometimes hours

Tests I've gotten
1. MRI brain, knees (normal)
2. Haemogram, Vitamin B, D (normal)

Other health conditions I have 

1. Extreme chronic stress (I have persistent depersonalisation derealization issues for over 6 years)

2. Non alcoholic fatty liver (stage 2) slightly elevated globulin and sgpt in Lft test, for 5 years

3. Lots of gut issues, like i poop only once a day but it's very mushy / loose and it's going on for years. I also have pretty severe GERD and acidity issues, acid coming in throat, for 5 years

My lifestyle 
Honestly I've a pretty unhealthy lifestyle. Every 2-3 days I eat some kind of junk / processed food. My water intake is 600-700ml and i don't feel thirsty usually. My diet involves gluten, milk, it's high in carbs and very low in protein. I have a good sleep though (8-9hrs). My stress levels are extremely high due to health issues and personal life problems. No exercise (coz I'm scared as it hurts when i do some exercise).

Doctors I've consulted:
1. Neurologist 
2. Gastroenterologist
3. Physiotherapist 
4. Psychologist 
5. Pain specialist 

Everyone run a bunch of tests that came normal. No medicines seemed to work though I did find slight relief from some anxiety meds like clonazalem.

Someone please tell me if they have experienced something similar and what they do to get better. My pain is mostly related to nerves muscles tendons. Please reply."
393,"Life sucks. Life seriously sucks. - and I'm sorry- I'm sorry for being so negative and cynical, but i don't see things getting better for me. Its so hard. No matter how hard I try, it seems I always end up in the same place.

I'm so lonely. I'm so cold. I'm so cynical and upset. I'm so mediocre. I lack the grades to get a good job based on... grades. I lack the interpersonal skills to get a job based on connections or whatnot. 

My pain is neither unique in its circumstances or magnitude. Yet it hurts all the same. It feels there is no way out. Meanwhile, people I used to know seem to be doing fine. Even if internally they too are in pain, externally they keep up appearances, of someone with a life, something I fail to do.

Suicide - i haven't thought of that in a while. I think I'm still not as suicidal as I once was, but I don't know. Perhaps in 5 years, when there is nothing left to redeem or salvage."
394,"I don't know how else to describe what I feel. I don't have the strength to get out of bed, wash myself, my parents don't understand me. I live in a very toxic place. My hair is falling out, I'm losing weight. I constantly feel sad, angry or tired. I feel like I have no one. I have no appetite, I can't take care of myself. I also after breakup very messy with my boyfriend of 3 years who doesn't want a contact because of my lack of trust and control. Im so scared. I signed up for a psychologist, my parents are so angry for this and I don't have any money of my own. I don't even have the strength to work. The psychologist said that I have depression and anxiety disorders and need medication, but my parents don't want me to take them. Im 18. I didn't want that kind of life. I wanted to have a future with that guy, I wanted to get out of that house and everything was going to be different after my 18th birthday. And yet I lie in bed and have no strength to do anything with myself, the psychologist told me that I have to act without thinking but I really have no strength. My family is controlling and gossips about me, I have no one to talk to and I don't have the strength to live, but I'm afraid of death, I don't want to die but i don't want to be myself anymore. My parents say that im dumb and i have depression because i dont go to work, the boy I loved blames me for everything and is fed up with me because I didn't trust him. Im so lost and i hate myself. I dont see myself in future, i dont want to see myself. I feel like such a burden "
395,"My friend committed suicide, it's been 2yrs but i still couldn't forget her, sometimes i blame myself why i wasn't there for her, it hurts a lot, i miss her

No matter how worse my days are when i spend time with her i feel better...i miss that comfort a lot

Everything in my life is just worse 

Have a father who sa me when i was kid, he is also very abusive towards my mother

I rarely get love and care from anyone

I'm 18 now, and i don't have any hope with life, future scared me as i don't really have any good experience from my past




"
396,"
I was laid off today. The past month has literally just been blows upon blows upon blows.

And through it all, I tried to stay strong. I tried so fucking hard. I studied and worked 16 hour days to try and build a life for myself, all because I believed that God rewards those who do their part. And I did my part, more than did my part.

Yet, today, I’m left alone and deserted with no recourse. I don’t know what comes next. I don’t know what happens next. I’m fucking lost and I’m fucking clueless.

I’ve been so lost and so depressed lately. I don’t know what to do anymore. All I know is that I can’t live like this anymore. It hurts, it just fucking hurts and I’m in so much pain.

Does it ever get better?? Is there anyone here who’s survived the worst situations and gotten stronger for it?? I guess I’m looking for something, anything from somewhere that motivates me to keep fighting for my future."
397,"I don't know if this is the right place to post, but I met a guy named mike on here last night (same page as this) and we started dating but he just unfriended me on discord and wasn't messaging me anymore on here or on discord, i just wanted to be with someone and they promissed to love me but have already stopped talking to me, i posted this on here hoping they would message me just an explanation or something atleast"
398,"I'm going on 22 years with depression and it's definitely worse than it's ever been. I don't know if these are depression related symptoms, but I'm asssuming they are. There was one day in the shop where I suddenly just got this crushing, overwhelming feeling that I needed help, like I needed to grab someone or scream. I don't know what caused the feeling and it was gone pretty quickly, but it was really weird. Yesterday, I was walking outside and suddenly felt like my body was too heavy and I was going to collapse to the ground, like my legs were going to stop working and I couldn't hold myself up anymore. It passed quickly too.

Should I be worried? Are these normal depression symptoms? Anyone else experience this? I'm fully aware my depression is getting worse. Meds don't work. Multiple therapists have said they can't help me. So I don't really know what to do. If these are depression symptoms, should I expect them to get worse?"
399,"I am proud of being a cinephile and I love movies and tv shows and reading the screenplay, listening to the commentaries and watching special features, listening to podcasts about them, etc. But I dislike Tarantino (just overall personal preference). I recently, in a different subreddit, posted about him being overrated and was inundated with over 200 comments calling me the cruelest names and “junior” “kid” “a petulant child” and I know these are rabid vitriolic trolls who hide behind keyboards and don’t know me or my personal life but it just makes my depression so much worse. How do I not let these people’s comments affect me? I even deleted the post the comments were getting so bad. And then they’re still able to comment. So I messaged the moderators asking them to please remove the thread. But it’s like can no one have an opinion anymore without being met with hatred? "
400,"If talking help i don’t wanna get anyone scared of my thoughts,and thank you"
401,"Well, these days I've been feeling free. I don't know why but I just don't think of my problems anymore (I suffered for 7 years) but seriously it's been a day that my mind just don't worry anymore. I feel like all of my worries are gone even though yes it's still existing but I'm not even thinking of killing myself anymore or I'm not sad anymore, just completely nothing. Can someone tell me or explain? I don't think about killing myself suddenly, someone have the same experience? Is this normal or there is something into it, well I'm prepared to die but I'm curious about this."
402,"My Dad has stage 4 cancer so I’ve been working seven days a week so he doesn’t have to. However, he can be really mean sometimes and say stuff that hurts my feelings. I vented about it on Facebook. One of my cousins saw it and got all mad at me because my Dad is sick. All I said was that he says hurtful things and that I don’t get recognition for the things I do for him. When my Dad gets mad at me, it really does hurt. I don’t want to work 7 days a week or never go anywhere or eat hot dogs and beans all the time. I’m so tired from always working. I can’t eat right or take care of myself. 

This cousin is one of the golden boys of my Dad’s side of the family. Everyone gushes over him all the time and I get jealous. He gets to do impulsive stuff and doesn’t get criticized. Even his parents can do stupid things and get away with it. Their impulsiveness has cost time and money for everyone else. It ticks me off.

Not only that, he tried to talk about my Dad’s condition like he knows all about it. He hasn’t so much as called my Dad to check on him. How can you know how he’s doing if you don’t talk to him? My Dad has had the same phone number for 22 years. He’s home every day now since he doesn’t work. He’s lived in the same place since 1984. He’s on Facebook just like they are.

Yet they don’t call, don’t offer to take him anywhere. My Dad never defends me to his family. I get the feeling he probably just complains about me to them. I always end up feeling like the world’s worst daughter. I have BPD and none of my family has ever tried to understand. I’ve spent so much of my life feeling like a monster because of it. I don’t even trust my own emotions. 

I had to watch my Mom die of cancer when I was 14, so I’ve been through this before. Things have come along way since then so my Dad has been able to live longer and still do most activities. He goes to the VA, so it’s tough for me to get information about his condition. He doesn’t seem to pay attention when they talk to him, either. So I end up getting bits and pieces of what’s going on. I need to reach out to them, but I need his permission first. I haven’t had luck getting that, or even getting him to write a will. "
403,"I am 45, no job, no career, no pension, barely any savings left (enough for a small trip, and yes).


I am constant carer for both parents, mum is very ill, dad is ill/unwilling (sofa sitting 24/7).


I am a virgin, no friends, no social life (no car either), spend most of my time in bedroom. I am volunteering for a charity (online work). i also walk


Work wise, I was self-employed for 18 years in labouring and grounds maintenance. Got 2 degrees in the evenings while working (BSc and MSc, firsts both). Cant return to that, van scrapped no way im reinvesting in that business and i cant (not enough money, no i wont take another loan)


Job applications. Almost never get a reply, one interview (failed). I was explicitly told i am too old (three times) other times no one provides me with any feedback. I know age-discrimination is illegal - but you try taking companies to court , its just not happening.


I have nothing and I am nothing. I detest myself and my life. I hate the site of my face every morning. It is revolting


Mental health charities provide generic advice, leaflet-like platitudes. ... oh 'if i had a magic wand' all that type stuff. Doctors, almost impossible to get an appointment, they just offer lucky roulette on tablets (maybe they help/maybe they wont, who knows? keep trying them they say).


Life shuts me out, its like watching through a window where other people have lives (metaphor). It was like that when i was younger as well. I was completely crap at asking women out on dates and i had no clue how to be engaging and all that.


its never getting any better, i am punished for having any hope"
404,"I wish i could return to my 15 years old because i felt So much better never had the problems I had right now. Im 22, I dont recognize myself anymore have no Friends, and my future feels dull, sad. I hate the fact that im feeling depressed, I hate how things are going. I have no Hope anymore."
405,"I've always been depressed, but I met a girl in a high-school and I've loved her more than anything ever since, and I dont know why because she never treated me that great. no respect whatsoever. but I didn't care, we still managed to create a decent life. up until she decided to leave me. I almost deleted myself and went to the hospital for a week. meanwhile she is bringing another dude around my kids immediately and tells me while I'm still in the hospital. I really wish I put more effort into my attempt. I try to be okay for the kids but I'm a family man without a real family. I'm done with this life. I'm 34 years old and don't see any way to be happy like I was when we were a family. I love my job but keep fucking up sleeping through my alarm and I don't know how why. I just want to die but I have to stay. I can start to feel a little better and then I have to talk to my ex wife and I relive everything. she's pure evil and I can only hope my kids don't turn out like her. I should be happy I don't have to be disrespected anymore but I'm just not. I don't wanna be here, I have no joy whatsoever. idk what to do."
406,"Without going into detail the world is a scary place right now. I don't remember it ever being this bad. Even if I did fix EVERYTHING in my control, life would still be horribly depressing. How do I cope?"
407," I never make a post about anything on reddit in general, but the one time I do it's about this. It seems silly but this seems the only way for me to get something out. The title says it all, I want everything to stop. I want all these feelings I have to stop, I want the tormenting thoughts and self criticism to stop. I want people to stop asking me what's wrong all the time. I hate feeling guilty for secluding and closing myself off to everyone. Everything in life feels way more difficult to keep up and I'm always feel like I'm slipping and barely catching myself. I can't be happy with family and friends. No relationship, and I hate getting myself stuck on people that don't want me. Life and the people that live it are constantly moving and progressing, while I'm always falling behind, and getting stuck on pointless things holding me back. The only movement are the clashing feelings in me that are driving me crazy at times. Even as I'm typing this I'm getting so emotional and my mind is racing. I wish everything just stops. The worst part is I have to try my best to be there, show face, look happy and keep the energy up. I smile and laugh to show that everything is OK. Cause if I'm not that, then everyone will start to wonder what's wrong and I bring the mood down and I don't want people to feel some sort of way towards me. I have to push myself to keep going everyday. Some days are easy and other days are torture. I just want as many easy days as I can get in this life. 
Sorry if this is long or seems like ramblings of a mad man type, I just have these overflowing feelings that I don't know what to do with"
408,"In bed.. I just lay there, trying not to sleep, because I know if I do, i would have to wake up tomorrow and live my life again - that same boring and overwhelming life. Night is the time I love, when I can fantasize of my crush accepting me lol. Well you know she asked me if I had lunch today and thats an accomplishment. I wish she likes me back, though she never messages me first. I hope, because I like really much. Well goodbye everyone! Hope you dont go through the bads of the world."
409,In the past 9 months I’ve been on 2 antidepressants for my MDD. I tried Zoloft up to 100mgs and I still wanted to die ( I honestly think it made it worse) for about 7 months. Then in the last month I’ve been taking vraylar (1.5g) and surprise surprise I still want to die. It’s like the voice are slightly muffled but the urge is still there and gradually growing. Is there anything I should recommend to my psychiatrists? Or has anyone been through something similar? 
410,"bro idk anymore. like isolating myself has always been my comfort. it’s the only thing that makes me feel safe cause i don’t have to talk to people, i don’t have to pretend i’m okay, i don’t have to act like i’m not internally panicking 24/7. but at the same time it’s fckn lonely. like i hate it. i hate that i’m so used to being alone that now it feels impossible to be around people without wanting to disappear.

and it’s not like i don’t wanna change. i do. like every day i tell myself “okay maybe tomorrow i’ll try to step out, maybe i’ll talk to someone or go somewhere new” but bro it’s so hard. i literally don’t have friends who genuinely get me and the thought of going out alone??? no. my anxiety would eat me alive. i start overthinking everything like “what if i look weird? what if people judge me? what if i fck up and everyone stares?” it’s embarrassing how much power my own brain has over me.

and i’m not used to socializing. like i don’t even know how to be normal around people anymore. small talk makes me wanna kms, group settings drain me, and i always feel like i’m just forcing myself to exist in spaces i don’t belong in. but the crazy part is… i still wanna get out of this. i wanna be free. i wanna feel alive. i wanna stop feeling like a side character in my own life.

but idk how. like where do i even start when everything feels so overwhelming? and people keep telling me “just go out” or “just make friends” like bro if it was that easy i would’ve done it already. i just wish someone would understand how exhausting it is to fight your own head every damn day."
411,I feel so alone
412,"I am turning 18 in a couple of months and now it’s exam season. Needless to say it’s pretty stressful and at times I don’t have the energy to hide my true emotions. I have been depressed since I can remember myself, I was never happy even as a kid. The last few years things got really bad. I have panic attacks daily, seriously contemplate committing every single day, I self harm and cry myself to sleep almost every night (when I can). However it’s almost impossible for someone to notice because to the average person I have everything anyone would want. I am one of the best students of my year (because I basically study to not think), I am physically healthy, have a roof over my head, food on the table every morning…but my life is miserable. I have no friends at all, my parents are basically divorced but still living together with my mum being toxic and my dad absent at best, and the expectations are out of this world. My life is miserable and I hate it. I don’t even know what to do with my life, I don’t enjoy anything anymore, even things I used to love. The worst part is when I try to hint that something isn’t the way it seems, no one believes me. Now, to the point. Today I was at an after school lesson. At some point my teacher said «life is beautiful isn’t it?», and I answered very spontaneously and without thinking «No». She said «you should ask my student Jess (not her real name) who is at a hospital in France that», I think she has leukaemia. I just replied with «not everything is visible» and she asked me what I mean. I told her I didn’t want to continue that conversation and went back to my work. People in my country don’t really think of mental health as something serious, so that is not an unusual encounter for me. Am I ungrateful?"
413,"TLDR: I’m a student who has gotten good grades throughout uni but at the last moment i’m struggling a lot mentally and in general. Any advice with what i should do?

Apologies for the long and messy paragraph, i needed to get it all out

I’ve had a hard time throughout university but everything has turned out okay in the end. I’ve managed to get really good grades and even scored a placement year. Coming back to university for my final year, i found it very hard to get back into the swing of things, and was in a bad spot towards the end of the first semester and its exam season. Somehow, i still managed to get 60-80% across my exams and coursework and have technically passed the year in terms of getting 40% overall. But i think i got burnt out from that, and have been incredibly unproductive during semester 2. This still carried over to easter, and every time i realised how behind i was, i tried to catchup but i couldn’t. A mix of my mental state and immediately getting burnt out again after a few days of dedicated work meant that everything has just been getting pushed back. I don’t want this to sound like i’m making excuses, because i know that it’s completely my fault. I’m just angry at myself that at the last moment i’m failing in every possible way. I worked so hard throughout university to put myself in a position where getting a first class degree was possible and now i know i can’t do that. I feel like i’ve wasted 3 years of my life to reach a goal i can’t meet and it’s really making me upset. I’m probably depressed and probably have been for months now. I’m either trying to study, or trying to look after myself. I don’t sleep well, i don’t eat regularly or cook for myself, i don’t clean myself often enough. I don’t have a routine but have been trying to force myself into one this entire semester. I’ve made so many plans for myself this year and they’ve all fallen to pieces, whether it’s me oversleeping and missing time, sitting down to study and just not being able to concentrate, going to the library to study and either getting so overwhelmingly anxious or just straight up tired that i can’t even work there. I don’t know what to do, If anyone has any advice or suggestions, or if anyone wants to just tell me i’m an idiot please do."
414,"I don’t know if I’m in the right place or not, so I do apologize in advance if this is the wrong subreddit. 

Recently I can’t be able to go to my job anymore. I wasn’t fired or laid off, but it’s such a mental struggle to log in. I work from home majority of the time and 1 week in office. I’ve been with the company for a year. At first it was great and the pay is adequate, far better than what the job market currently offering. You think it’s simple in just taking a call and going onto the next but recently management has been getting more and more excessive on micromanaging. I try to adhere to the recent changes but suddenly I just stopped. 

Recently I got married to my wife, the love of my life, and then we took some time off. After a couple of days off, I didn’t want to go back to work. At first I thought it was because I was being lazy but now I realized it’s such a mental drag to get on take call after call while trying to adhere to the strict requirements that management wants everybody to follow. We can’t even go to the bathroom anymore without using our break or lunch time. I already have FMLA and that’s what’s been covering my absences, but it can only cover so much. I’m trying to find another job but it’s been such a struggle.

I now feel guilty and lazy for calling off so much. I feel like a failure and weak because I know we need the money but I can’t get myself to be motivated enough to just clock in. My wife has been comforting me for my recent behavior, but it’s so hard to look at her because I’m not being able to provide for her right now. I’m just so lost and tired of feeling empty and confused.

Thank you for reading my frustrations. I hope this finds somebody that’s feeling the same way to let you know that you’re not alone."
415,"Hey guys so, I think im done.. I've felt like this for a long time but little things like friends, family, or ""people who care"" have kept me here. People always say it's selfish to leave but how selfish is it to make someone stay so miserably? 

I've been depressed/suicidal for as long as I can remember. My first attempt i remember, I was 7. So this is something I've thought pretty in depth about. Idk if it's past trauma or current day me but I'm tired of feeling like this. I'm tired of feeling like a disappointment who can't do anything right. I'm tired of being unloved, never thought about and alone. I have next to no family fr, and the ones I do have don't really know me or care to. 

I have 2 daughters but idk if I'm even a good enough candidate to raise them considering my shitty upbringing and a lack of an idea of a good parent. I honestly feel they deserve better and I feel like a plague when I really think about it. I truly wonder how much better off they'd be without me around..

All in all I just wanted somewhere to put some of my thoughts before I leave here. I'm sorry to anyone who may actually knows me.."
416,"I’ve had depression and anxiety my entire life, with a special side of guilt for literally every move I make. I’m never not sorry or feeling guilty, and have rejection sensitivity. Basically I have a lot of symptoms across multiple Cluster B disorders. 

I’ve been on a solid medication combo for like 3 years, and so I would say it’s overall been well controlled. I feel like normal people say they do, I guess?

Lately things have gotten dark. I am in a bad job situation, my family is facing severe health/aging challenges, and I’m in a tight spot financially. For over a month I’ve been crying at the drop of a hat. It’s completely screwed with me physically. I go to bed every night and wake up every morning with the same sense of dread and fear. I had to start benzos to make it through the days. 

Every spring for four years, all I can fantasize about is moving back to my hometown - which I hated growing up - living with my parents, going to a boring easy workaday job, and sitting in the overwhelming silence of country living. Actually I don’t want to work at all - I want to completely regress for the summer, blowing bubbles and running through sprinklers and playing with the dog. Like I’m seven again. 

I’ve just always been too fragile to meet the normal expectations of adults. I’m a good employee, I’m the “strong” one of my friends… but im just so tired. "
417,I've lost 20lbs in 2 months because I don't have the energy or motivation to bother feeding myself. Truthfully thought this is the best I've felt about my body in 10 years
418,Couldn’t get hire for another job. I had to walked to the Cafe to cry about cause I’m a failure at life. 
419,"I went to therapy last week and yesterday. Oh boy. Finally, I'm being honest with a therapist, but also felt safe doing it. It's scary but possible and I realize I might have finally found a very good therapist - I'm lucky.

However, the minute I walk out of there, I want to go back in. Even if I felt like I healed and I started seeing slimmers of hope, I started crashing down and today in the morning I can't even go to work.

I want whatever is happening in there: Honesty, vulnerability and exploration. But it's not possible outside of therapy. Getting a friend to talk to in that way, would mean dumping it on them. I have so little trust I will ever find someone like it. But.. at the same time I wouldn't mind doing it for a friend I trust.

Whenever I open up, I get extremely vulnerable and feel small. I haven't ever done it with a friend come to think of it. Except maybe my latest love interest. I really should find people I can trust with this. But it's not like I can just grab someone that look like they understand and start ugly crying to them.

Ngl I need friends to share trauma with. Fuck normal people I've never felt connection to functioning people. I should find others who need this just as much as I.

"
420,"I hate when people act like exercise is a cure-all for depression.

Last year I started swimming 5 days a week for my mental health. On the days I exercised, there was a noticeable difference. For the first half of the day I felt happier and more energized; however, since I have to get up at 5:00 am to work out, I often felt like I was exhausted by the afternoon/evening. 

The worst part though is that if I take a single rest day I feel awful. I feel anxious, depressed, stressed, and often verge on tears. I just want to be able to sleep in and relax on the weekends, or have a day where I don't have to get up as early before work. It's so unbelievably frustrating. I shouldn't have to work out vigorously for an hour every day just to feel okay. It's not healthy or sustainable. Rest days are imperative but they also lead to emotional distress.

 I took a break for a bit and got back into my routine of swimming 5 days a week in the past two months. As much as I enjoy it, the off days are borderline unbearable at times. I've spoken to my therapist about it and her only solution was to take walks on those days which has not been helpful. I'm on medication, see a therapist weekly, work out, eat healthy, and I'm still struggling. It's not fair when you do everything right and still feel terrible. "
421,"1. I'm still grieving over my cat who went missing 2. I applied for almost 1000 jobs just to get ghosted after spending lots of time preparing because job market is shit. 3. my boyfriend instead of being supportive is acting dismissive and calls me negative 4. my friend flexes how good her life instead of being supportive and shit on the companies I interviewed and said""when are you gonna actually land something 4. stock investment not going well 5. I'm a contractor so I feel isolated at work, people in my office are kinda racist and micro-aggression"
422,so i always been mostly a social drinker. as i get older ig my depression is getting worse but i just keep it inside and ignore it or just deal with it in the gym or in video games. i’m 38 in america and poor with nothing going for myself. every time i get drunk i get super emotional and even suicidal. my inner thoughts come to light and i just let it out. i want to quit getting drunk hut problem is my only friend likes to get drunk and ik if i stop it’ll probably end our friendship. it happened before when i quit drinking. what should i do?

424,"
Am currently unemployed and just waiting till my apprenticeship starts. We have nice sunny days but I waste them.


I sleep at 6 am wake up at 4-5 pm and start to feel bad because my back hurts and I fell exhausted. Get up and my family is angry at me for sleeping so long or even worse they are disappointed. Do nothing the rest of the day except maybe help dad and go to the gym here and there. 

Come home from gym and around 10 pm start sitting at pc and watching YouTube or playing Minecraft with a friend till 5 am. Stay awake till 6-7 and sleep.

Ringe and repeat

I feel so terrible this is all going sideways. 

How can I fix this ? Anyone got similar experience?

I should also mention that next to my depression I also got ADHD if that matters "
425,"when I'm doing something (working, errands, socialising) I feel like I want to kill myself but in a panicked way. It's just like an impulse. When I get to wind down I have the same thoughts but not being busy, I start to plan it to the detail. I don't know what to do to end this (besides the obvious)

I've tried medication. I've tried working out. I've tried therapy. I'm so fucking done. "
426,"Hi. I'm just 20, but I've been depressed and kinda suicidal for a long time. Years. I can't remember the times when I didn't think of death on the daily basis, even when I'm on medication. Life just sucks and I don't see myself growing older because there's no point to it. I know that maybe if I took my meds I could quiet down these thoughts, but they're still there. All the time, every day. For a while I might be relatively stable, but one minor setback and I'm back at the same spot again. I don't see the point in taking meds or going to therapy because I tried both and neither worked. Either at all or maybe in such a small way that I'm basically back to square one.

Today my mum asked me if I was taking my meds because she's noticed I've been feeling bad. I told her I don't feel like they are working and I don't see the point in taking meds at all because just existing isn't living and I'm tired of it. I'm tired of chasing happiness or even stability. I'm just so fucking tired.. she tried to give me half my dose because I've not been taking my meds for a few days now, but I refuse. And she got mad at me and even raised her voice at me? She said that I apparently don't give a fuck about her.. like, no shit, sherlock, I'm depressed and I've ADHD and ASD and I have huge trouble keeping anything up in my life. Especially relationships, which is making me depressed and it's an endless cycle.

I'm not doing much in life, I've been trying to be an artist, but it's not really working and she's doing the management part of this business anyway, so I just in my room trying to create. Once in a blue moon I make something people like, but it's not enough. I can't live like this. But because of my ASD and ADHD, and generally my mental health I can't do anything but that. So, I can't keep going the way I am, but I don't have any capacity in me to change anything. I'm tired. I'm exhausted of doing the same things over and over again and by now I know I won't see improvement. And I kind of don't want to. The world is shitty, my life is shitty and my brain, even on good days, won't shut up about it. But somehow my mum thought for a moment that this is just ""a teenage mood"" and I'm not taking meds to.. idk, get back at her? Like, she said that I don't care about her and that's why I'm not taking my meds, but that's not my reason.. I'm struggling, partially also because I don't feel much for others or at least I don't recognise my feelings, and she's throwing it back at me.

Is this normal for a mother to act like this? I know she must be frustrated and I shouldn't be going off my meds on my own, but I feel like making my struggle about her is kind of.. a dick move? Like, I already feel worse than shit and I've even stopped taking my meds and she decides to make it worse by making me feel even more guilty? What..?"

428,"I am currently living with my boyfriend and his sister. I just finished my first semester of college and have been getting increasingly more depressed with every day that has gone by since January of this year. Nobody in my house seems to understand. I have been called lazy multiple times within the last few months and I just can’t find the words to explain that I am doing the most that I can, but that is just so little. I can’t leave the house, I cry all day, I can barely eat. My roommates have been saying they are trying to understand my situation but that it gets to a point where I just need to get over it. I still do my weekly cleaning and everything I’m just so exhausted after I can’t do much else but what I need to. I’ve been considering transferring colleges, as I keep being told by my boyfriend’s sister that I ruined their relationship and have messed up the dynamic of the house. I feel like everyone would be better off, myself included, if I just left and let them forget I was ever there. I don’t want to leave my boyfriend, but I can’t live with both of them together anymore. Any advice? Sorry for the long post. "

430,"Victory over depression isn’t loud,it’s in the quiet moments you choose to keep going. Every breath, every step forward is a triumph. Strength is found in persistence, not perfection. You’re not just surviving—you’re conquering. Keep rising, even when it’s hard. You’re winning more than you know"
431,"i’ve never posted on here before and probably won’t post again. just wanted to know if i was alone in this or if it’s something that happens to a lot of people.

when i was freshly 12, i was at school and depressed. i didn’t really grasp the whole idea of saying something worrying to a teacher and then getting sent home due to safe guarding. but i said something along the lines of ‘maybe id be better off dead’ to which i then got sent home, and my mom had to take me to the doctor.

the doctor took one look at me and said ‘you don’t look like someone that would struggle with depression.’ since then i never spoke up about how i felt ever again. my mom agreed with the doctor, she doesn’t understand mental health.

when i turnt 19, i went back to the doctor, for depression as i was still feeling the same, if not worse. and it was a different doctor this time, my other one retired or whatever. she looked at me and said ‘are you sure you’re not faking this? and you’re aware it’s all in your head?’ i just don’t understand??

is this a universal experience or do doctors just hate me?? the system is extremely messed up. "
432,"I have been diagnosed with clinical depression for almost 20 years.  I have had two points in my life where I have been suicidal.  I have spent more time in a therapist office than I ever thought I would.  Depression is something that has deeply impacted my life.  There are days when I feel like I could sit or lay still for the rest of my life and just let the world pass me by and I would be fine with that.  I have no close friends other than my wife.  I am on several different medications and I know I will be taking them for the rest of my life.

  
I accept that I will be dealing with depression for the rest of my life.  That being said, everyday when I wake up I have to get myself psyched up to go out and live.  It is possible to live a productive life even with depression.  I have a good career.  I have a wife and a son.  Do I have to work everday to keep my depression at bay, yes, but it is worth the struggle.  Yes, there are many empty platitudes you will hear from therapists and other people all your life.  The only adivce I can give is you will only make progress fighting your depression when you decide you are done wallowing in self pity and decide you want to change.  You can't do this for anyone but yourself."
433,"anybody else just feel like shit all the time ? I feel bored and sad all the time. I waste my life away all day play games and smoke pot like a loser but even when I do get out of the house and get active I just feel tired of doing anything at all.  even smoking weed is boring anymore, I feel like I've exhausted every bit of my life even though I'm still young. I hate wasting my life away yet I still continue to do it every day"

435,"Some background info: I (19F) have had depression and anxiety for over 6 years now, it’s fluctuated over that time and sometimes I genuinely forget that I ever was depressed. I used to self harm and had really bad suicidal ideation (multiple attempts were made), but through therapy and many different medications I finally got to a point where I was actually feeling good and felt like my emotions were somewhat normal. This began to change up again due to family illnesses, university stress, not knowing what I want to do with my life etc. 
As my depressive episodes were back again my doctor decided to raise the dosage of my antidepressants. That was a few months ago (I’d say around January) and it has had the opposite effect on me. My depressive episodes are so much worse and the emotions I’m feeling are so intense that I genuinely don’t know how to help myself. I went back to the doctor recently and told her this and her response was to increase the dosage once again, which hasn’t worked. Shocking. It’s gotten to the point where I’m self harming again (which I hadn’t done for about 3-4 years) and I’ve also got this constant headache that hurts my eyes frfr. 

Anyways, to my main question/concern. My girlfriend (19F) is becoming increasingly more worried about me to the point where she is literally having nightmares about me killing myself or hurting myself. I hate that I’m causing her so much stress that’s it’s affecting her dreams. How do I help ease her worry? She’s expressed that she doesn’t want me to stop sharing my thoughts and feelings with her, but when I do that it causes her to worry. I’ve told her that I’m not going to actually kill myself, it’s not like that this time. Im not yearning for death, I’m yearning to feel normal again and for my pain to go away. 

Any thoughts or ideas would be helpful, I’m out of my own. "

I hurt people and most of the time they forgive me but I don’t feel forgiven all the is stay up late nights wondering why I would even do what I did to hurt them and it fucking haunts me

When people hurt me they never care about how I feel but when I hurt them I care all the time 

I have friends but they don’t feel like friends when I’m sad or going through some some of them just sigh like they don’t wanna hear my feelings or they’ll tell me things like “your sad all the time” and ik I don’t want to be sad all the time I want to be happy I don’t how all I wanna do is cry and sometimes I don’t wanna be here

438,"With in 3-4 more years if my life dose not get better, I will be buying my first fire arm and doing the deals. Sorry to say I genuinely feel like everyone should off them self cause I don’t understand why this life makes zero sense and we just waste away. My mother made it clear life is garbage there is no purpose. No one understands you or feel you and if u cry out it is considered weak and will be used against you. My father is a detective he told me as a kid I stole his fire arm off the kitchen counter and attempted to blow my brains out. But he managed to get there and stop me. I see heavily why people commits sucide now, I feel like it’s a good thing. I feel nauseating pain everyday while still holding a smile and being nice to people. Most of the times I just want to put a bullet in them because they end up being a piece of crap or saying stuff that’s bullying my character. I don’t need to live like this and other people should not live like this. 


And why would u want to live think about it

People fight over skin colour seriously? 

People fight over stuff that happend ages ago we live in modern day slavery no one helps u only want to hurt u and beat u down and digg ya grave and it will appear in an unexpected way. You get nightmares like living isn’t a big darn nightmare enough. 

You fight for your entire life to die and the fight is useless fight to uplift your race that dose not matter when u die ur not going to a white black heaven. People say “ we have lost them” when someone passes away that means u will never see them again they are “lost” passed away it’s just something to make u think trick ur brain 🧠 it’s all a delusion there is only monsters here on planet earth the more I plead and beg that no it can’t be it. It is clearly it. Everyone is a lying bag of fake rotten crap and should be tortured. I have spent my days on earth begging everyone to stay in my life helping etc and all I see if dirty evil people getting all the money and trafficking kids and ruining peoples life’s. but the person that loves everyone and want something good dies every day emotionally and mentally.  

If u have reached this far in the next 3 years I will post my firearm in this depression community or  just on my profile  on Reddit. Save this post if u want to be updated.

439,"I have MDD and was prescribed 20mg prozac around a month ago. Noticed some big improvements in the 3rd week, also noticed that alcohol seems to decrease the effectiveness of my meds for a few days after I drink. I've been wanting to smoke recently for the first time in a while, but I'm afraid that marijuana will end up affecting me similarly and ruin my progress. So, has anyone noticed that Prozac becomes less effective in treating depression after smoking weed, or is there nothing to worry about?"
440,"I feel like I have no purpose on this earth. Im so awkward, I have no friends, I’ve never been loved by anyone. I’ve been depressed for a couple of years due to bullying and trauma but as I’ve gotten older it’s gotten worse. I’m 20 f and in college and I feel like this is the time I’m supposed to be living and enjoying life but there’s nothing to enjoy. I have many hobbies like drawing, painting, dancing, singing, but i haven’t felt motivated to do any of that. 

Everyday I feel like crying because I’m so alone. It doesn’t help that I have severe body dysmorphia and I hate myself so fucking much, it’s to the point where I can’t even look in the mirror without being discussed and embarrassed to even talk to people. I just wish I was normal, a normal girl with friends, that’s attractive, that has a life to live. I get so jealous of people my age that have everything I could only wish and imagine for. 

Every time I try for friendship or for a boyfriend no one is interested. I’ve had a couple of friends but because of my social anxiety and depression I’ve become distant. Every time I’ve tried for a relationship they always like my friend, plus the fact that men give me no attention. If I was attractive it would be different. And it’s not just that, I know a relationship isn’t everything and I should learn how to love myself first but, it’s hard when you’ve been broken down so many times. 

I’ve thought about taking my own life for the past couple of days, the only thing holding me back is fear. Sometimes I think if I wasn’t here it would be better. 

I don’t even know if this is a call for help, or just a rant.. "
441,"TLDR: I know what I need to do in order to improve lots of areas of my life but it's like my brain imagines and plans a lot without ever flipping the goddamn switch of action. 

I want to lose weight, I keep eating fast food. 
I want to save money and achieve financial goals, but I keep ordering uber/doordash and impulsively buying stuff I could easily go without.
I want to get in better shape, but I keep not using the walking pad I bought, to not be able to tell myself the reason I'm not going out is the cold, the snow, people or anything else.
I want to be more flexible, but I cannot remember to take as little as 5 minutes daily to stretch.
I want to improve my memory, but I keep smoking weed a few times a week, when I'm alone.
I used to say loud and proud that I'm absolutely not able to drive under the influence, and that I would never do that; but I started doing it a few weeks ago (rare instances, but still doesn't excuse the act)
I want to stop overthinking and freaking out about things that don't warrant that quantity of energy, but I keep using cannabis even though it clearly exacerbates a lot of anxiety symptoms for me.
I'm having trouble breathing sometimes and feel like it is due to my inhalation of the drug, but I. keep using it. 
I want to get back into reading every day and keep a book on my nightstand, one on my coffee table and various others throughout the house, but can't pick any up to read even though I enjoy their content.
Id love to draw on a regular basis (first milestone could be once every week...) and bought an ipad a few years ago for the convenience of it, but I haven't drawn at all since the beginning of the year.
Id love to practice yoga often (to help with back pain, amongst other numerous benefits) and have a ton of resources to help me with that, but rarely ever complete a 10 or 15 minutes.
Id love to feel energetic in the morning, but am not following any sleep schedule at all when im off work.
Id love to feel energetic during the day, but cannot remember to drink my 710 ml bottle over my 10-12hr shifts.

Why am I like this ? I read somewhere that when a change needs to be done, but you keep avoiding and going in another direction, it is because you are not ready deep down. When will I be ready? I already feel like the remaining time to attempt changing those things, especially ny physical health, is almost over because of how I feel in my own body. (But I'm just an obese 27yoF that's always been sedentary even though she's always dreamed of being in shape)

I don't necessarily want to die (I'm afraid of death) but I'm tired of actively criticizing myself on my inaction while I'm laying on the sofa eating my lukewarm 50$, uber-delivered mcDonald's. It's like I'm watching myself ruin my life in slow motion.

I used to have shitty self-esteem and think I could never achieve anything I really wanted. Then, my vision of it changed and I realized I wasn't worthless nor incapable. And I know I have value. But every day these kinda thoughts wander in my head and I just wonder... why? "
442,"My gf (both early 20Fs) has recently switched meds and they are not working. She tried to tough through it and say nothing but she’s realized she can’t do it anymore. She is deciding to go back to her old ones (even if they’re harder for her to take. They work) but until she can get seen for that we’re struggling. I’m at a loss of words for what to say when I can tell she’s bugging out. I can only offer space to talk so much and if she doesn’t take it I don’t know what to do next. 

I sometimes struggle to not take it personally when her brain gets off and feel like I did something wrong. Any advice to help her and I is greatly appreciated. "
443,"I always hated my overthinking shit brain almost every night I cry inside or irl on a pillow I’m soon 23 next year and I despise myself so fucking much I can’t take it anymore, I’m easily anxious so easily scared it’s not even funny anymore been like that since day….

I now have problems with my stomach I’m so tired scared and hurt and in pain I can’t even describe it 


I will one day just wake up gone cause my fat ass was wasted on cause I couldn’t fix myself fix my life fix my family or loved ones or anything I’m a failure through and through and I can’t take it much longer I’m so tired 

I’m in pain I wanna cry all night and day I want someone to hold me or a long hug while I sob… I hated the future ever since I gained thoughts cause of my ADD and overthinking bs… money always been an issue, my weight, how I look and every tin above 

I don’t know what to do anymore… I’m so done "
444,"I (38 m) have been clinically depressed for about five years now. Ever since my parents passed away I have been non-stop depressed and have gained A LOT of weight. So I have recently been signed to a record label, and having all my dreams handed to me on a golden platter; but I’m still so depressed. I feel more motived to write music and change my life (such as losing weight), but this depression is keeping for enjoying this HUGE event in my life. Can someone offer some advice to help me enjoy the joyous occasion?"
445,"So hears the rundown, failing classes in engineering, amazing realized I hate it wanna switch now, apply for a computer science course, now a guy in my class also applied he got an interview email me, none so far, nothings going write. So at this point I think 30th may might just be my best day ever, felt like and appropriate end to a month"
446,"I’m not even sure exactly how I even got into this episode, life was going great or so I thought. I was actually a functional member of society, I went to my GED program, I went outside and cleaned my house, I would do normal things. Recently though for the past month or two, I have been feeling absolutely horrible and exhausted. I haven’t left my house in 3 days but if I could, I wouldn’t even dare leave it at all. My sleep schedule is fucked, I’m sabotaging my GED classes and I was supposed to take my test this month but my coordinator is going to cancel it.. probably because I haven’t been showing up. I thought maybe it could be the Zoloft since I’ve been very on & off with it but just started taking it consistently again recently & I’m at a high dosage. I feel like such a failure, I have friends who were at en even worse headspace than me and THEY STILL graduated from my old school, I really am starting to think that the system is fucking me over on purpose. 

I spend my days doing absolutely nothing, I shower, go on youtube for most of the day, talk to people online & stay in bed all day or clean the house if I feel like it. My mother is starting to get angry at me because I’m not attending school. Right now I should be heading to the program but I feel like I’m being weighed down & it’s so hard to get ready and actually leave the house. I don’t know how to get out of this, I am so stuck and I’m truly spiraling and all I want to do is fuck my life up since I’m already such a fucking failure. "
447,"

Every morning starts the same.

I wake before the sun has the nerve to show its face. The world is still. Cold. Too quiet. The kind of quiet that hums in your ears and makes your thoughts louder than they should ever be. I lie there sometimes, watching the ceiling vanish into darkness, wondering if today will feel any different. It never does.

The loneliness always hits first. Not like a wave, waves are gentle, even in their chaos. This is more like a weight pressing on my chest, reminding me I’m still here, still breathing, still waiting for something that isn’t coming.

I make coffee I don’t even want, just to fill the silence with something. Anything. The sound of the machine, the smell it’s the closest thing to company I have. I sit by the window, cup in hand, staring at nothing. Sometimes I pretend I’m waiting for someone. But no one ever comes.

There’s this ache inside me. Not the sharp kind, but the slow-burning one that makes everything feel heavier. Like I missed something important a long time ago. Like I was supposed to love someone, or be loved, but somehow I never quite found the right time, the right words, the right version of myself. And now it’s too late.

People say time heals everything. But they don’t tell you that time also buries things, dreams, hopes, the parts of yourself that used to believe in things. I think anger lives in that burial ground too. Not rage, not fire, just the quiet resentment of someone who tried, really tried, and still came up empty.

I see others out there, living lives that look full. They laugh in grocery store aisles, complain about traffic, text someone who’ll text back. And I wonder what it feels like to be missed when you’re not around. I wonder what it’s like to be someone’s reason to stay.

But wonder only gets you so far. The sun eventually rises, painting the sky like it always does, indifferent to who’s watching.

And I tell myself, like I always do: Just make it through today.

Even though a part of me knows
I’m not waiting for the sun.
I’m waiting for something that will never be.
"
448,"I’ve never had a bad life. My parents always showed me love and support, they rarely ever argued, I was never punished, not even grounded. I was given everything I asked for and money was never an issue. I never had problems making friends at school and always excelled at my school work. I had hobbies that I enjoyed doing as well. But even through that, I’ve been thinking of suicide since the ages of 5-6 till now. My mental state has only gotten worse while my life has gotten progressively better, closer friends, new experiences, but it’s like a pit inside me that I just can’t seem to fill no matter what I do. That’s why suicide has always been prevalent in my mind. Does anybody have any clue why? Maybe just like really bad mental health genetics or something?"
449,"
 I have been suffering from depression since I was 11 years old, and I will be 17 this year. I don’t know how I am going to live past 18 at this point. I have nothing I am passionate about–at least not to the extent of having a full time job surrounding it–I have difficulty concentrating on my schoolwork–which I do online–and I spend just about every moment wishing I was dead. Even when I am feeling “good”, I still don’t want to be alive since I reason to myself: ”I feel just fine now, so I should close the book now before it gets worse so I can end this miserable symphony on a high note.” No, perhaps this reasoning serves merely as a justification for emotions I would have had regardless of my conscious thoughts. The worst part about all of this is that I have no idea why I feel this way. 

I heard from a psychologist on YouTube that it’s a good exercise to imagine what circumstances around you would need to change in order to be happy. Apparently, doing this can be a useful tool to help a despondent person to ascertain whether their feelings are caused by the outside world, or whether they are simply brought about by an ailment of the mind. Interestingly, the only world I imagine myself happy is one devoid of people and responsibilities, made complete with a basalt-gray aesthetic throughout the land, grey cloudy skies, and tower for me to inhabit with a vast library spanning the fields that interest me. Not only is this wildly unrealistic, but I may end up not even being satisfied if this fantasy ever did become a reality.


Further context: I started feeling persistent hopelessness when I was 11, and the chronic suicidal ideation since I was 13. I have been in therapy and taking SSRIs ever since I was 14."
450,"At this point I've run of reasons to keep living. It's less about me wanting to harm myself and more about me being okay if I never woke up. I'm tired. I had wanted to make music for a living but instead I ended up with declining mental health. I don't have a support system, my family is part of the problem, and I feel like I mentally can't do anything... I'm 25 and I haven't had a job at all. I don't feel like I can even hold one, I cry too easily. I get stressed out. I wanted to make a bit of money to get my family out of poverty but I can't even get myself out of the bed some days. My partner pretty much killed my last dream which was my only motivation, even if only a little. I feel unloved by my partner because I wanted to get married but, despite knowing how bad off I was when he meant me, he makes me feel like he doesn't love me enough for that to happen because I'm not 'functional' enough. I've been going to a psych, taking my meds, and trying my best. I've been severely unfulfilled in this life. Some of it being that all my hobbies turned into coping mechanisms and I struggle to find enjoyment in life. I don't know how to be productive. My friends are all struggling or are extremely pessimistic. I can't make new friends. I feel easily discouraged in places and low energy in things that don't interest me. I've been in and out of therapy. And until last year I had been using an AI to cope with my loneliness only to cry myself to sleep about it at night. "
451,"It gets harder every day. Sometimes I am still breathing for the sake of my daughter, but even that's getting harder. Things I missed and missed out on, the regrets. The self hate. I'm so useless. I don't so much but it's not enough. Then there is the physical pain and constant exhaustion. I am just so tired anymore. "
452,"Does anyone else suffer from an inner voice encouraging you to do things you know are bad for your mental health? Example, I know food is good for me and I crave it but my inner voice urges me not to eat, I know I should go to sleep but my inner voice tells me to stay up and watch YouTube, it’s almost like depression has a conscience of its own, does anyone else experience this?"
453,"I suffer from severe treatment resistant depression, and I've never been able to achieve sufficient symptom control throughout my life. This is something I've struggled with since I was 12. I also struggled with self-harm and an eating disorder and borderline personality disorder and in the last few years a substance use disorder AKA addiction. 

I am currently 3 hours away from my daughter who lives with my mother because my mother has custody of her and I got a phone call tonight from my 13-year-old explaining that she had made a comment to some friends about jumping off a bridge (and I know the bridge she's talking about it wouldn't have killed her she might have gotten stuck in the mud or had to swim out of the canal) but one of her friends reported it to the guidance counselor, and so my mama took her to the ER to be evaluated and they ended up admitting her to a psych Hospital. 

I've been hospitalized over 30 times and in rehab three or four times in my short life. And I'm so worried that she's going to suffer the way I've suffered. And I did the best I could to comfort her and reassure her that sometimes the hospital is the best place to be even though it sucks. And selfishly I'm worried that I'm going to get the blame for the condition she's in because my struggles have such an effect on her. 

She was in tears saying I just want to go home and I asked her if she meant home like when we were together, and she said yes, which broke my heart just a little bit more because I'm in no position to make that happen and also my mother would fight me if I tried to take her back. 

So right now I'm kind of in a state of surprise or shock or some combination of the two because I know what she's going through and I know how tough it can be to be locked in a hospital with strangers. And I haven't been able to even cry about it despite the fact that my heart is breaking for her. Maybe it's my body's way of protecting me because I think if I start crying tonight I won't be able to stop. She doesn't want me to tell anyone, not even her Grandpa and grandpa that I'm currently staying with after my most recent relapse in hospitalization. And I took my Xanax like 5 hours ago and every dosed in pieces because I just want my day to be over because I feel like shit for not being more upset or for not being able to cry I feel like shit because I can't be there with her while she goes through this because my daddy lives 3 hours away from New Orleans where my daughter lives with my mama and my car is not Street ready yet so I won't even be able to go visit her and hold her and tell her that things do get better. 

I tried reaching out to my therapist and to several friends that don't specifically know my daughter but they know of her because I talk about it all the time and they've seen pictures of her. So while she doesn't want anyone that we know or she knows to know what's happened, I need it to talk to someone and when I couldn't that's when I took my meds and laid down and put on the show to zone out too so I could stop beating myself up over everything I've done or haven't done that's led her to this place. And the fucking meds aren't working tonight I guess because I was so wound up after speaking with my daughter before the ambulance came to transfer her to the psych Hospital. 

She's just so very sad. And I'm very sad. And I can feel my own depression creeping towards me, and for me to fall into a depressive episode right now is the absolute last thing I need. 

I'm not even really sure if this post belongs here but the subreddits for ""worry"" don't seem to be active because they haven't had any new posts in 4 or 5 years. So my apologies in advance if this is not an appropriate post for here, I just didn't know where else to turn."
454,i dont actually know what to do or who to talk to because my family have no emotional awareness and my friends including me are the type to joke around constantly so we never really have serious conversations about anything and i dont want to push them in a situation like this. its been a few weeks since i talked to them and i dont know what to do. i dont want to call the hotline because talking to someone i never spoke to about my problems doesnt seem right to me either.
455,"Hello everyone,

I am 26 years old and have gone through a burnout last year. 

Ever since I cannot think properly and have gotten depressed.

I can't remember basic things and easy things like reading is almost impossible, which makes all aspects of life very hard.

I have no problem dealing with my life as long as I know that there is an end to this and I will one day be able to think again.

Is there anyone who has had the same issues as me and has gotten better?"
456,"right off the bat, I know I’m young (hs), but lately I really am just so tired and am struggling to see how it gets any better. 

Idk when the switch happened, but I used to care about myself? like my grades were such a huge part of my identity and I didn’t wanna disappoint my parents, and so I really tried and cried over two missed points and aimed for as many awards and positions as possible. I had friends and cared about how people saw me, how my teachers and peers saw me, and I did work hard. I did my work, and I kept myself in line with expectations. now, if I’m being super honest, couldn’t care less.

and that’s really the basis of it. I don’t care anymore, I don’t feel really anything anymore but I just understand that I wish I could just never wake up one day.

and the worst part is I understand the cycles, it feels shitty one day and then suddenly I am actually happy and then I’m not and I feel fucking insane. it’s this constant dread of wanting to actually disappear and then finding reasons to be happy, forcing myself to be happy, only to just fall back into bad habits. my phone is ruining my life and causing me to procrastinate, I lack new goals so I have no drive and motivation, and i super sensitive to lazy habits. I know all of this, yet I make no effort to change, almost as if there’s no point in trying. I hate who I am

I’m not sure what I’m looking for, maybe it’s just venting. but it just is so tiring to be me."
457,"i get high all day and always js end up crying off of just my thoughts basically these last few months
am i throwing my life away?"
458,"It all started 5 years ago—late 2019. That’s when COVID started hitting, and my dad got diagnosed with cancer.

My dad has been in a wheelchair ever since I was little. He’s always had a strong personality and expects people to follow his beliefs and values. At first, I thought I was dealing with things okay, but everything happening at once slowly started to eat away at me. During the COVID lockdown, I lost touch with my social life completely.

We had just moved from the U.S. to Greece (my parents are Greek), and the culture shock hit hard. I moved schools 5 times. In my second school, I got judged constantly—made fun of all the time. It wasn’t usually physical, but it hurt. Sometimes it did get physical. I used to be a very social and outgoing kid who loved making people happy. That judgment destroyed my confidence. My best friends became my teachers. I wore hoodies so people wouldn’t see I got a haircut. I completely disconnected.

And then came COVID—and my dad’s diagnosis—at the exact same time.

Because of that isolation, I spent most of my time online. Most of my life is online now. I taught myself how to develop games. At first, my parents just thought I was addicted to it. Meanwhile, I was 13–14 years old and mentally falling apart. On top of my dad’s cancer, both his brother and his mother were also diagnosed with cancer the same month. The mental strain on my dad was insane, and I was trying to hold it together while not adding stress to him. But it wasn’t working.

After his surgery, the recovery was tough. Then he was hit with an autoimmune disease that affected his muscles. He got put on heavy cortisol, which destroyed his immune system and led to sepsis. I saw him shaking from the infection, pretending everything was okay. I didn’t realize how serious it was until much later. Luckily, he made it and came back home after a week in the hospital.

But the cortisol changed him. His personality and attitude shifted. Ever since then, it’s been constant arguments between us. School felt impossible. I changed schools again at the end of middle school. This time, I made some better friends and started recovering socially a bit—but I still haven’t found a real, deep connection.

And I’ve never been in a relationship. Just a few online things that never lasted.

Eventually, things picked up for a bit—my passion for game development turned into a real success. But even that came with problems. I still can’t figure out the financial side of it. I constantly got into fights with my dad about what I should do with my money. I had to manage so many users and all the stress that came with it. On my birthday, I lost my pet, and that crushed me.

I started giving away enormous amounts of Robux—millions every month. It became an addiction. It’s the only thing that makes me feel powerful, loved, or like I matter. But deep down, I feel completely unfulfilled. In real life, I feel pathetic and uninteresting. Still no relationship, still stuck in my own head. Constantly getting hit with more and more.

I overthink everything. I can’t sleep some nights.

Then recently, my mom fractured her leg. Things between me and my parents have just kept getting worse. More arguments. Different beliefs. My school performance has hit rock bottom, and I refuse to do anything about it. I’m on a path no one else around me understands. It’s weird—being successful financially but still feeling completely alone.

Then I lost two more pets.

The first was a dog who had helped me through a lot. She had a genetic kidney issue we only found out about a week before she died. And then my cat—just a year old. She hid under my car, even though we always checked. She must’ve crawled in deep. When I drove off, she tried to escape and was crushed. I saw her die. Right in front of me. I can’t explain what I saw. It messed me up. That trauma hasn’t left.

Now I’m at the end of the school year. I was recently hospitalized for two weeks from something that was supposed to be a normal illness. I started vomiting blood and got severely dehydrated. I’ve done nothing for school. I’m failing. I can’t get myself to care or even try anymore.

A girl who I knew for a year and meant a lot to me just cut ties with me. And now I feel lower than I thought I could ever be.

There’s so much more I could say. So many more things I’ve left out. Bad event after bad event. It just doesn’t stop. I don’t know what to do anymore.

If anyone’s still reading—thank you"
459,"I haven’t alive in over 15 years. Literally since I could remember. Everything feels like a grind and every single day I’m fighting for survival. I don’t know what living life even is anymore, I’m just surviving day by day. Wish god or something would end my life. I continuously struggle, I constantly make sacrifices and put myself at a disadvantage for others. I think I’m selfless to a certain extent. But I don’t have anyone that genuinely loves me. I bend over backwards for everyone in my life and I get treated like the scum of the earth, I can’t find a significant other who truly loves me, people I call friends and family take advantage of me and talk shit and treat me horribly. I feel like an injury animal that was completely neglected and I get kick constantly when I’m down. I pray for death, I don’t understand how other people lives can better extremely better than mine and they’re literal monsters as human beings. Plus everything happening in the world doesn’t make anything better. I’m fucking exhausted and I want a redo on life. This experience is horrible and hard to continue on "
460,I always struggled with this before in the opposite way but suddenly it's like a flip switched in my head when I've been doing very unwell recently and it doesn't even hurt or anything 
461,"Why am I in 2025 ? And I failed myself from 2017 to 2025 sometimes I failed without trying. At this point I don't believe that I can change but I wish to sleepwalk to edge and jump so.
I am so scared of how defeated, and how infinitely wrong I am today. I don't want to go to next year or be in the next decade. If I get emotional enough can't I cause a physical condition that kills me sometimes my chest hurt but I need a real heart attack. 
I take concentrated herbs or tree leaves in hope they'll damage my liver. My aim is that finally my liver gets damaged and I kms."
462,tired of trying. tired of hoping. tired of living. tired of pretending. tired of praying. tired of working. tired.
463,"it feels like life wants me to fail again.
everything i touch falls apart. no matter how hard i try, nothing seems to work out.
people say: just give it time. things will get better.
i did give it time. five years of waiting, hoping and i still feel like this.

i watch others do the same things i do, and somehow it all works out for them. i'm happy for them but when it's gonna be my turn?
i'm getting dragged through the dirt, day after day. sometimes i feel like the man upstairs is laughing at me while i suffer.

i feel like i’m living in the truman show, slowly losing my mind, clawing for a way out, trying to make sense of everything that keeps happening to me.

but here i am.
alone in my room.
stuck with my thoughts.
stuck with these feelings.
stuck with depression.
stuck with the memories i can't escape.
nowhere to go. nowhere i belong.

sometimes i wonder, do i even exist?
maybe i'm writing this just to prove that i do.
i exist. i exist.
despite feeling invisible everywhere i go.

thank you for reading.
goodnight."
464,"I wish I could get back at my enemies by putting their shrunken heads in jars that I'd put on a shelf. Anytime I feel blue, I can just go look at that unlucky SOB's leathery, baseball face and and have something that reminds me life is worth living and is hilarious at the same time 😂"
465,"Its been stressful lately and I really don't have any time to procrastinate, yet my depression is hitting really hard right now. I just feel awful. Anyone else in the same boat? "
466,"I’ve battled depression off and on for over 30 years and what I’ve noticed most in the past 5 years is the way I neglect myself.
Why do we find it so hard to complete the most basic daily hygiene requirements?  Is it everything else that goes with showering? The selecting clothes, getting undressed, drying, re-dressing, having to deal with wet hair (which I hate) 
Don’t get me wrong, when I do eventually get in the shower I enjoy the hot water washing over me but washing hair is exhausting, my arms literally ache.  The whole routine is just so overwhelming hence the ability to even do it in the first place.  
I’m sick of bedrotting in the same disgusting clothes with matted hair and stinky breath!  I long to function like a normal person….. Thankgod for baby wipes in the meantime.  
Starting phone counseling next week, wish me luck 🍀 "
467,This is my first time posting on the net. The thunderbolt flim was so hard to watch as the void personified my demon. The whole movie was about depression from the first scene to the last. I took my kids and I tired to hide the tears but it was to much for me. I am broken and it bleeds through everything.
468,"ugh. i’ve been dealing with depression since i was like 7 years old. maybe 8. i’ll be 32 this year. i’ve tried therapy, i’ve tried medication, i’ve tried behavioral therapy. nothing works. 

why am i still here? i don’t want to be. everyday i beg god or whoever, to just kill me already. it’s not fair that people who actually enjoy being alive, get sick and die. when i’m here miserable as fuck. i think i’m being kept alive out of spite. i’ve put myself in horrible situations and i still lived to see another day. 

i would end it myself, but i don’t want my children to carry that burden. sometimes i have good days but the depression always comes back. the things i need to do, to have a better life are completely out of my control. so i’m stuck. i don’t want to be stuck anymore. "
469,"They're in my head all the time, they never stop. It's becoming almost debilitating because I never have a moment of peace and quiet. My brain is really fucked up I think and there's just these constant voices in my head that male me question myself, they tell me things that I know aren't true but they never stop. My anxieties and insecurities are just shouted through a megaphone in my head. It feels like they've gotten progressively louder throughout the years.

I've stared self harming again and it helps quiet them down a little, I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't think i want to kill myself, not yet. But I hate living like this, i would give alot to.have them stop. I would honestly rather just die than live the rest of my life out like"
470,"First time posting here. Not gonna go into details but I’ve had the worst 6 months of my life. Just been loss after loss , some close family members etc. 

Just a question. I’ve been feeling really off I’d say the past 3 months. My vision is what I would say is most affected. I’m pretty light sensitive and I almost have the sensation that nothing is real when I look around. I worked this morning and the first 4 hours of my day I’m kind of on autopilot. I donteven think about what I’m doing it just happens. Are these classic signs of depression? It feels physical but it’s more of the way I’m taking in the world around me if that makes sense? 

Any answers would be appreciated because it’s worrying me which then becomes a vicious cycle "
471,"Stuff like ""go outside"", ""talk to friends/family"" or ""clean"" doesn't do anything for me. Cleaning bores me and I don't get any sense of achievement from it, talking to family and friends about my feelings is uncomfortable and I don't like getting ready to go outside. I like going to parks with my parents or friends, or playing games with my friends, but I don't want to talk about serious things with people. Having fun might distract me for a few minutes, but the second I'm not happy anymore I'm instantly back to being depressed. I hate exercising and taking walks, because it tires me out and I don't see any reason to do it because I'm not overweight. Nothing helps in the long term. And i can't rlly get therapy or medication because I'm 14. The best I can get is a school counsellor who's meant to deal with kids who don't like going to class, not mentally ill kids"
472,"I have now failed 6 classes at my jc and passed 0 of them due to being a lazy fuck, I am genuinely not sure where I want my life to go. I have no goals, nothing that makes me want to pursue a career and all I do everyday is play videogames and sleep in my car skipping classes. I feel suicidal but I'm too lazy too do anything, and the worst part is my family thinks I'm doing the best out of all my siblings and they keep spending money on me like I deserve anything. Making music seems like it would be fun, but idk where to get started and that makes no money... idfk man i just want to play videogames. I want to drop out but I don't know anything. Not looking for pity just idk maybe advice and seeing other people's stories."
473,"Its like I'm invisible to everyone on this planet. All these people around me and its like I don't exist. Sometimes I play games just to see if anyone will catch a hint of what I'm dealing with. They all know how hard it is for me to express myself. Maybe if I disappeared for 2 weeks without warning they would ask me honest questions about myself and expect honest answers? No. At this point I feel as if they know, but don't want to let me know that they know lmao. If I were dealing with them I would've seen something was up. I feel like all of my relationships are so fake. How is it that my dad talks so much about being depressed when he was growing up, but when I mention it, its like his brain cant compute, and the solution to my problem in his mind, isn't compassion, its yelling, and putting me down, as if he's better than me. Its like we're all living the same life, but no one can talk about it. I feel like a fraud. Constantly lying to my friends and family because they don't want to hear what's really going on with me. I want to tell them so bad that I've been dealing with depression for YEARS, but I can't because they wouldn't understand. Or maybe they do, they just don't want me to know. So confusing. Too much thinking. Hiding would fix all of this, which is what I've been doing for the past month, and no one even notices. So I stay away for longer, hoping someone will give me a reason to stay around, and not isolate and leave everyone behind, but no one does. In the end I'm the one who left them, and I'm the bad friend. Which in a way, I am. Because I find it hard to motivate myself to even say hello without feeling drained. Its like I'm forced to put on a act and its so painful. Everyone says they care, but they don't want to see the real me. I've been dealing with this for years alone. This secret is eating me alive. Its completely destroying the person Everyone knows and loves and its so sad. I think back when I was a kid and there was a time to where I was never like this. I used to be so happy, and positive. Everyday was a new day, I had so much fight in me. Now I don't even recognize this person. Somedays I feel like I've lived the entirety of my life then I realize I'm still young. Like I have so many years to go and I'm already so tired. I'm so beat down. My life hasn't even started and I feel like its already over. Everyday is a continuation of the last, slow miserable, draining day. All these eyes on me, make me want to hide from everyone. Even my family. They mean the world to me, but they cant help me. I can't even help me. "
474,"16M. It happened 5 months ago and it keeps popping up in my head a lot. I got drunk even tho i shouldn't because I'm on medication. They had to pick me up from a friend at 1 AM because crushed out. It was so awful and i felt really suicidal probably for the first time in my life. So when we arrived she started yelling at me and telling me to shut up and god i felt so fucking miserable. So started to ask her to kill me over and over. And she kept yelling at me that I'm a fucking idiot. I thought I'd kill myself later that night but I didn't not sure for better or not. We never talked about it and everyone keeps acting like there's nothing wrong and it makes me feel like I'm nothing. Why would anybody care? Do i even deserve help? Honestly I'm not sure about anything anymore even though I'm always trying not to spiral down this road. I'm not even sure why I'm posting this
"
475,Sometimes I wish I could just get a big hug. It’s been a rough eeek. 
476,Life is not going my way. Don't know what I will do
477,"Fundamentally I want to get better at art and I know I can do better but like something is holding me back, maybe it’s cause I realized that one day I want to die and no longer want to be here, but I just have no motivation to do it or any reason even because we are on our way I’m gonna die and we’ll still wanna do something if it will be soon forgotten."
478,"My parents have ten animals. Two dogs, two cats, three goats and three cows. They told me I can come over whenever I want to pet/cuddle them. So I do. I cuddle with the dogs and play with them. I pet the one cat that's okay with pets. I pet the goats and feed them wild chamomile flowers. I give the cows treats.

It feels good for all of about ten minutes, and then I just go back to feeling like this. I still feel stressed. I still crave human touch. I still feel hopeless and wish I was dead."
479,Idk what did I do to deserve such hopeless in life .
480,"I’ve had depression for as long as I can remember (at least definitely since I started being a teenager) and was diagnosed at around 20. Father is bipolar. I was doing well seeing my psychiatrist and taking my medication and got into remission. Then due to political situations in my country I had to leave but the good thing is that I was able to move to a new country with my partner (my country is homophobic so this new country was a better environment for me) but still I struggle with finance and just guilt about leaving everything behind. 

Point is this means I can’t see my psychiatrist anymore and I still take pills from him according to his prescription from overseas. These days I’m having a relapse. Feeling like shit for no reason crying every day and resorting to self harm. On the days I drink I kind of go insane but it’s not bad when my partner is here. Last time my partner wasn’t there I kind of just decided to leave the house at 2 am for no reason with nothing but my phone. 

I feel like I’m going insane. I wouldn’t go as far as suicide but recent work problems make me want to just curl up into a ball and rock back and forth. However it’s office hours and I just try to drown myself in work, knowing I’m getting into trouble with management. I feel like I want to quit my job but also feel guilty that if I do, it’ll just be another job that I quit because I couldn’t handle doing it while I’m having a depressive episode and because of this my resume looks like I’m hopping around from job to job. 

I don’t know why I’m writing here except maybe I want to rant and also the off chance if anyone has any tips on dealing with a job as well as mental health ? "
481,"Just venting. I'm currently having another depressive episode. Nothing is interesting and fun. 

I don't care about anything, nothing seems important. At home i can't even stay put, just walking around in circles until i get tired enough for bedtime. I don't want to watch, listen, play or read anything."
482,"Yall ever just feel completely isolated? Not sad, not mad, not even fucking empty, just not there? All I do all day is play video games because im homeschooled and my whole fucking school is up to me to do (im only 25% done with the school year) and I have ADHD and suspect autism and OCD (I have multiple nurses and doctors in my life whom say I may I have it, although I cannot be sure) so yall can insult me and call me lazy or whatever go fucking wild, I also struggle with hygiene and basic tasks, I just feel so drained and tired that I never get around to it, which I dont know if thats normal or not, Im a lazy fucking piece of shit. All I want is for it to end. Ever since October my life has been absolutely FUCKED, my brother (who is my only friend) moved out, my dad’s wife of 12 years cheated on him with a 20 year old, all my friends ditched me because I couldnt hang out as much and I “wasn’t as funny” (im the group punching bag and I stopped reacting to it and caring), my emotional support cat RAN AWAY i miss that fuzzball so much. I cried tonight for the first time in 7 years, 7 fucking years. Ive been a mess tonight, my brother hasnt been responding, I have no friends, my dad is to busy to care, and his fuckass ex wife is harassing me. I looked in the mirror and analyzed every last cell in my pathetic fucking face, I loathe myself entirely, hate does not describe how I feel about myself, a brew of loathing and pity more like it, I feel sub-human, nothing more than a clump of barely sentient cells, it doesnt get better, if I hear one more person say that Im gonna genuinely hurt myself, it gets worse and worse I DONT GIVE WHAT YOU SAY! This world is nothing but hatred, nobody likes each other. I can feel myself going insane, losing my very brain cells my very humanity, becoming a shell of what I was, a fucking idiotic slug at most. I will never amount to anything"
483,"I’ve been carrying trauma in silence for years. I experience child on child, sexual abuse, and buried it so deep, I tried to convince myself it didn’t happen or that it was somehow my fault. But no matter how far I shoved it down, it still leaked into everything, my relationships, self-worth, my mind.

Now I live with depression that feels like it’s swallowing me up. I smile. I joke. I pretend. But the truth is, I feel like I’m screaming behind my face all the time. No one sees it. Sometimes I wonder if I’m even real.

I don’t know how to stop feeling like I’m broken beyond repair. 

I’m not really looking for solutions. Just connection. Advice if you’ve got it. Or just let me know I’m not alone in this fog."
484,"i hope i can say something here bc im too tired. less than a month ago, i was diagnosed with madd, and now i feel like im falling apart. ive been living in hell everyday for so long, but nobody's going to know what im going through cause they dont even want to understand. i was thinking about s3lf-harm and su1cide so much times that it's not scary anymore. i always tell myself, ""oh, im just overthinking and overreacting"", but it only stresses me out more, so im losing myself. i cant remember the last time i felt alive – dpdr is a main part of my life now. i just want to live again. i want to answer ""alive"" if someone asks me, ""are you alive or just existing?"" i thought i was getting better after i went to psychiatrist, but no – im not. 8 days ago, i found out that my mother didn't even give me the pills I needed. it feels like i cant take it anymore, but even if its the worst time of my life, i cant die – because im too weak to do it.

sorry if there's any mistakes or something is not clear, i just need to tell it to someone. "
485,"
I'm so tired of getting scammed by therapists while seeing absolutely zero results. For one year I've been getting robbed while getting advice that is no better than Chinese fortune cookies. ONE YEAR. I'm tired of being leeched for every cent that I have while knowing damn well nothing will ever change. She's been making 6 figures while I rot in this fucking horrible existence. It disgusts me to think that my pathetic desperation paid of their next trip to Cancun. Fuck this shit. There is no cure. My dumbass thought therapy would provide some deeper insight into my life and help me fix my personal issues. I doesn't. It can't. Unless your IQ is below 70, it is IMPOSSIBLE, and I mean IMPOSSIBLE that you haven't personally thought of any of the advice your therapist could give you. 

It is hopeless. On top of this useless industry, there is also the fact that medicine doesn't help. Anti depressants do NOTHING. NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING. I wish that they could watch me die so that they understood how much it hurts to get robbed and scammed while at your lowest 

But the people that I truly hate the most are the one that have the audacity to recommend therapists to others. How can you look at someone who is suffering and LITERALLY wants to put a bullet through their head and tell them to just pay hundreds of dollar per week for something that objectively doesn't work. If you EVER in your life told a suicidal person to spend thousands of dollars per year for this shit, then you need to rethink your advices"
486,"I’m 22F and honestly, I don’t know how to feel about myself anymore. Life’s been really heavy lately and I’ve started wondering if I’m just too broken for anyone to truly love or care about.

Last year, I lost my best friend to suicide and my mom to cancer — both within months of each other. Since then, my dad has become emotionally distant. A few weeks ago, he left for the US for work and only informed me over text. It’s been 2 weeks, and he’s called me just twice. I feel abandoned by the one parent I have left.

Most of my childhood friends live abroad now. They rarely check in anymore. It’s like I’ve just quietly faded from their lives. I also struggle with some medical conditions, and every doctor visit is something I handle alone now. No one ever asks how I’m doing.

I was in a 2-year on-and-off relationship with someone I loved deeply. He cheated on me three times. I know that sounds dumb, but I kept going back because he was the only one who was there for me during the worst time in my life — when I lost my mom and best friend. I was grateful. I didn’t know how to let go of that support, even if it was hurting me.

Because of my health, I pulled back from socializing. I lost most of my university friends. I just couldn’t be the fun version of myself anymore, and eventually, they stopped showing up too.

I have one online friend I talk to daily. He’s kind and tries to listen, but I can’t shake the feeling that I’m just his backup. Like he only talks to me when others are busy. It stings more than I care to admit.

All of this has made me feel like I’m always the last option — never the first. Never chosen. It’s starting to feel like I’m damaged goods. Like I come with too much baggage for anyone to truly want to be close to me.

I’ve been stuck at home all day. I barely eat, I can’t sleep, and I feel drained all the time — emotionally, physically, mentally. I keep wishing someone would just take care of me for once. Not in a dramatic way, but in those quiet, everyday things — like making sure I’ve eaten, or just sitting with me without expecting anything. But I know that won’t happen, because I never ask for help. I’ve become so hyper-independent that even the thought of leaning on someone makes me feel weak or like a burden. It’s exhausting carrying everything on my own, but I don’t know any other way to be.

I don’t know why I’m writing this. Maybe just to get it off my chest. Maybe to hear from someone — anyone — if I’m too far gone. Or if people like me can still find something good in life.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far."
487,"I have been experiencing some difficulties for some time regarding attention, memory (I often don't remember what I had to do or what point I was at in the book), reading (I read without things entering my head) and concentration and logic, in addition to symptoms of anxiety/social type and low/flat mood (I never feel like doing anything, not even simply tidying up my room..); then I have periods in which I am interested in something but after a while in which I dedicate time to it, I lose the desire and I let it go.. DSA evaluation done a few years ago was negative

I would like to undergo a psychological and/or neuropsychological evaluation to better understand the origin of these difficulties (e.g. depression, autism or other). I don't know if it is the differential diagnosis

I also have a smartphone addiction with high levels of fomo; I have a thousand stimuli in my brain constantly thinking about what I can search on the internet or ask on chatgpt

What do you think I should do?"
488,"My depression is kicking my fucking ass. Sorry for the language. It’s been months. I told myself all winter that once the spring rolls around, I will feel better! 

I am reaching new lows every week. I am having more suicidal thoughts. Has anyone been admitted to a mental hospital? How long, how was your experience, did you feel better when you were done? "
489,"Ive been struggling with depression for 10 years now, never feeling truly okay. Ive been to therapy for 2 years without really feeling improvement, my last appointment I was advised to seek a psychiatrist and start medication. But I never got around to it, maybe thinking I could push through it, mostly not wanting to deal with the process. For the most part I can keep myself busy and I try to surround myself with people, but after every moment of joy I slowly fall deeper back to where I was. I don’t have motivations, I do the things that are expected from me and that’s about it. I get these urges to escape and do whatever, but I know it’s not my environment and I can’t escape this feeling. Everything feels empty and pointless. The only reason why Im still here is because Im too much of a coward and Im worried I did have a chance and I just had to wait a little longer. "
490,"I never knew what I wanted to do with my life. As a child, I never even saw myself making it past each year. Now I'm 21 and I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I have no friends, still no job, no career, no passions or anything, and I also just left a mentally abusive relationship. I already know therapy is needed, but I can't even afford it and I can't talk about my feelings without breaking down and holding back. I don't know what to do at this point, I'm feeling lost in life. The only thing I look forward to is sleeping, because the second I wake up, my heart aches and I'm filled with deep sadness, and my distractions are barely working anymore. I'm so exhausted, it is so difficult for me to take care of myself. "
491,Why is it when my depression gets bad and I feel lonely and just want someone to talk no one's there.Im about to go walk the train tracks and listen to music and shit cause I dont know why but that sooths me when no is there to talk to.
492,"hi, this is my first time posting here. 
i am a girl, i turned 26 recently.
 im lost bc i don’t know what to do with my life. i never had a job, i graduated in 2022, i’ve been living with my mom, but i was also helping her with my grandma who recently passed away. i really have no idea what i should do next. i’m not even excited to start a internship in my area, im not sure if i want to have it as my career. i feel like a failure. i see my friends getting jobs or studying and im just here… also seeing them in relationships and being happy, makes me sad bc ive never had that life but im glad they’re happy ofc.
im just here existing, waiting to find something to make me feel less empty. i’m gonna move to another city tho but im not that excited and i dont even know what im gonna do. i wanna get a job for the first time but ive social anxiety and im terrified.. i also have depression and take meds to stay stable and alive, and dont get me wrong, i wanna be alive and find something that will make me happy even tho i feel depressed and lost. but i dont know where to start. people always ask me what im doing rn and i always say the same thing which is that im looking for a internship or a job.
im not only here to ask for advices but to see if there is anyone who relates to me!
english isn’t my first language so im sorry if you dont understand shit lol"
493,"Without writing pages of context; my husband is always snapping at me and doesn't think I hear him under his breath when he mumbles calling me an idiot or a cry baby. Lazy and slacker he at least has the balls to say so I can hear. 

I'm an overthinker and always in my mind can justify why he snapped as being my fault. I do talk a lot. I say dumb things. I dont always get the laundry done or what always to make for dinner. 

Before y'all go ""you dont deserve that""...""you should tell him how you feel"" I know all this. I just needed to get this out and it's easier to share with strangers than people I know.

✌️ "
494,"I did what I was supposed to do. I graduated high school with honors. I messed up a lot in college but eventually graduated even though I dipped below 3.0. Haven’t been able to hold a job, hate other jobs I had. I’m a failure in my family’s eyes. They always compare me to my younger sister who has a job lined up after college graduation. I just feel like if I disappeared or died they wouldn’t care. They keep telling me to apply for jobs and I am, applying for anything nowadays, and no one responds but scammers and MLMs. I don’t even exchange words with my mom anymore unless it’s to do something or we fight. I resent and hate my siblings now. I honestly wish I could just stop. And just disappear. It would give me something similar to peace."
495,"  
It’s like… on the days when my brain isn’t screaming at me and I feel kind of normal, I suddenly realize how bad the bad days really are. And it hits me hard.  
Like, ""Wait—*this* is how most people feel all the time?""  
Then I start dreading the next crash, even while I’m feeling okay. It’s a cycle that keeps pulling me back in.

I don’t really know what I’m looking for here—maybe just to not feel alone in this. Does anyone else get what I mean?"
496,"Recently, i've been very, very depressed and my moms always like ""You need to go outside more!"" or ""If you do a sport, it will make you stop being depressed!"" (she yells at me about it)

I tell my dad that my mom is rude (my parents have been divorced since i was 6) and he just says ""Thats just the way your mother is i guess"" or something like that.

My mother also says i should go to therapy, but i don want to because i fear that the shrink will tell on me and then i would be bound to anti-depressant pills and my mother would be mean to me about it. Thats why i use AI therapy instead of real therapy.

She also teases me about stuff that she shouldn't be toying with, such as the fact that i beleive in Jesus and God and she says things like ""God and Jesus were never real! Its just a big fat lie!"" and doesn't like it whenever someone says 'Jesus' or 'God' around her, wether it be in vain or not."

498,"I think it's time for me to finally finish this life. In the last 6 months I've lost everything. I lost my wife, my house, my pets, and as of today my job. A few months ago I attempted to take my life but I couldn't go through with it. I think im finally ready to fix that mistake. I'm a failure and a loser. I dont deserve this life as I continually make the wrong moves. Then im too lazy to fix anything im a waste of life. No one will even know im gone "
499,"Lately I’ve been feeling... nothing. Not sad, not angry, just *numb*. I go through the motions — get up, work, eat, scroll, sleep — but it’s like I’m not *really* here. I laugh at memes, I respond to texts, but inside, it’s just this weird, quiet emptiness.

What’s frustrating is that nothing is “wrong.” I have a roof over my head, a job, people who care. And yet, I feel completely disconnected from everything. The things I used to love don’t bring joy anymore. Even small tasks feel heavy. I can’t explain it to people without feeling dramatic or guilty. Like I’m not allowed to feel this way because my life looks “fine.”"
500,"14f. these past 3 years Ive never felt like I have worth. No matter how happy I feel on some days, Ive always had it at the back of my mind that im worthless, and that I'll never get anywhere.

I don't even know where to start.

Academic wise I'm completely down the drain, math is my worst subject and ive never past any written tests for it, sometimes my test results for it are so bad my teacher wont even grade it. Science im decent in, but for the love of god I can't recall anything ive learnt in it. English was supposed to be my subject im good in, but after my state testing I completely doubt it. I think I did terrible on it (my classmates finished at 11am-12:30pm and I finished at 2pm, when I asked them they said they wrote only 500-600 words meanwhile I wrote 800-900 and I feel like it was all complete shit).

Social wise I have friends. kind of. idk. theres 3 girls in my class(I go to a small private religious school so I can only really be friends with girls-) and theyre all closer to each other than they are with me. I really dont know how to talk to people- I push everyone away. the closest Ive ever gotten to a best friend is the 20 year old man who groomed me for two years. Sometimes I wish I didnt cut contact with him and think about begging him to keep talking to me because I miss having someone who knew me properly.

Appearance wise Im ugly. thats it im literally just ugly. yeah some days I feel good about how I look but thats just because I set such a low standard of how ""good"" should look like when it comes to me.

Mentally I feel like im not making it past 16. Im already a failure to my entire family so whats the point. id get kicked out of my family and literal community if they found out im a lesbian and not religious in the slightest, Id lose my mom, the only parent I care about. I fucking hate my dad because of how shitty he treats her so I dont care about him. I have 3 older brothers, the eldest being disabled, the middle one my parents literally hate and constantly talking about him ""abandoning us"" when he lives under the same roof, and the ""youngest"" one whos constantly coddled by my mom. and then theres me. the actual definition of useless. I'll never be as smart as any of my cousins. I fake hobbies when people ask me just so I can appear somewhat interesting- even if I have an ""interest"" in them it doesnt count if I havent done it in years.

and the worst part of this all is that im trying. ive been trying. this year compared to the last 2 years was a complete shift in the amount of effort im now putting in. even my teacher has told me but it isnt working. nothings working. Im not smart im not pretty I dont have a good mindset no matter how much I try to- Im supposed to be fucking studying right now yet im sitting here writing this, completely lost. I dont know how much more I can handle. I feel so lonely, so anxious. I tell people that I want to become a pediatrician when im older knowing damn well I genuinely want to be dead, even though I wish that wasnt what I wanted if that makes sense.

I shouldnt to feel this way. I have no right. there are people who struggle way worse than I do and I know that. but I cant help it. I wish I could go to sleep without thinking about how much worse I am compared to my friends, my family, literally anyone. im so sick and tired. I dont know why im not good enough."
501,"Well, I've been in a mood lately that makes me feel like an 8-year-old. I've been watching way too much Thomas & Friends and playing Transformers since I broke up with my best friend. I'd like to know if anyone feels as weird as I do, or if I'm the only weirdo who feels like a little kid because of depression. Is that a yes? Okay bro"
502,"Hi everyone I’m f 21 and my girlfriend is also f 21 , for the past maybe 4 months she seems to just be trapped in this horrible loop of being so down and tired all the time and I just don’t know how to help. We’ve tried doctors , health services , medication but nothing seems to be working. I want her to feel good more than anything but every time I try and help I seem to do something wrong :/ can someone please give me some advice or something"
503,"I'm fairly young, but as I kid, I did not have many friends. I wasn't liked by many people; they picked on me for weird reasons. Any real friends just left me after I moved. When I was around 5-7, one of my favorite toys was taken away. It was a horse and would always be a substitute when I lost my main one. My parents were hard on me for years, and now I reflect on that with today's life, and all the past scars. I've lost so much: pets, friends, etc. I tried to pray to God, but I guess he can't hear me. My parents are Christian, so they want me to be saved, but they don't see what's going on behind the scenes. I don't want to be here, in a cruel, hateful world. I try to find hobbies, but they don't fill me. Maybe life would be better if there were one less person in the world. I want to die, but I won't die because I heard it's selfish. I might starve myself. Sounds great!"
504,"i don't exactly know how to name what i'm experiencing; they are not panic attacks, at least they don't match the description i'm familiar with. i am not scared, i don't feel extreme anxiety. it feels more like a sudden wave of desperation, like there is a button in my brain that says ""press here to instantly feel extreme psychological pain"" and someone decides to press it. it happens when i'm alone (but then, i'm almost always alone) and usually in the evening or at night. it's not completely unexpected, i usually start feeling shittier beforehand - or feel shittier than usual that day - and can sort of predict it's going to happen. and then it does, and i bail my eyes out - from 10 minutes to a couple of hours, and then i fall asleep, and the next day i'm, well, okay. i can function at least. it almost feels silly, like i am a child throwing a tantrum, but, like, i genuinely cannot put into words how much pain i feel. please share yours stories if you experience something similar and know a name for it "
505,"I couldnt go to work

I actually don't know what to say for myself at this stage. Basically, I struggle massively with depression, anxiety, panic attacks and I am autistic, and my ability to cope with things on a general basis is low. I started a new job in April, I'm working 12 hour shifts 7-7 plus 2 hrs travel time 4 days a week, they are on a 2 week rota and the way my shifts work I actually end up working 7 in a row and I just can't do it feeling as depressed and anxious as I do. I have panic attacks all day, I struggle to get out of bed in the morning becayse I'm feeling so depressed. I've adopted bad habits like smoking and self harm to cope. I've increased my antidepressants by 40mg and I'm on propranolol for anxiety, but I'm just unable to cope. I think it shows in my work but I just can't help it, I'm exhausted. I am obviously on probation for 6 months, and I need to be being careful, but I just woke up this morning and I just COULD NOT do it, I phoned in sick. I am so burnt out, this is my 6th shift in a row, my head feels depressed and muddled and I can't think straight. I just need to sleep. I passed out yesterday night from sheer exhaustion mentally and physically. I just couldn't do it, and I am so disappointed in myself and worried about what repercussions I might have for it, I tried to explain but my manager just said mmm okay and cut me off mid explanation. I'm so disappointed in myself and I can't tell anyone I called off sick, but I just couldn't do it. I feel so ill"

The psychic pain is driving me crazy and I don't know how to endure it. I don't even know why exactly I'm in pain. I just want to stopp my fucking existence; i'm lying in bed currently, thats the best i can get. Theres no will to anything besides coping with this sHit. I want to bury myself and never show up again. Thats my only will currently.  And i feel like coping requires this 24/7 help even tough i'm actually tired of people. Gosh, its hopeless............................... no will to navigate through life literally. I don't want to make any decision anymore that don't lead to non-existence, the dissolution of my individuality, my ego, my existence. God. I know my this stupid wishes will never come true. "

511,"All my life, after being abandoned over and over again, I thought all I needed was someone to live me. But now the texts, the emails, the messages, all just make it worse. I don't want my roommate who loves me and lets down his guard when I'm sad. I don't want a family that only acknowledges me when I hurt myself. I don't want teachers who only care about failing me when I become hospitalized again. I don't want doctors who only care when I'm actively having an episode. My feelings don't go away when you can't see them and I just want complete silence. To go off grid. To only see people through media. To have dim lights and nearly nothing in my home. No people, no mess, no existence. I'm tired of other teenagers and being mad when their music is too loud but truly every noise is too loud and I just suffer. I'm tired of having to see, I just want it to go dark again. Im tired of having to move, especially now that it's hard and hurts because of my autoimmune disorder and cane. I'm tired of the mess never being gone no matter how hard I work because my roommate will just fuck it up again and not care. I'm tired of my only safe space being the hospital, which isn't even safe anymore because I have to be around people."

I don't know if I'm looking for advice or if I just needed to rant. I'm just so deeply sad, and I haven't gone a day in years without thinking about it and imagining myself doing it. I'm not sure what to do anymore, it's just so hard. I want to live life, I just can't keep going as me.

Quisiera que esto fuera mentira, fuera una broma pero no, siento que no encajo en esta vida y las cosas se me están saliendo de control de forma brutal, estoy afectando gente, estoy creando caos, estoy dañando a los que amo y eso no me lo perdono. Necesito liberarme y sentir que al menos hice UNA cosa bien en toda mi vida. "
516,"I keep watching the love of my life slip away with each passing day. I hate myself for still holding onto him when he’s made it clear he hates me and doesn’t want anything to do with me. His fiancee keeps posting photos of the two of them planning their wedding and their lives together, and it kills me inside.

I hate myself for hurting him. I hate myself for lying to him. I hate myself for believing that just because I forgave him for his lies and forgave him for hurting me, he would give me the same grace even though what I did was so much worse. 

God, I miss him so much. Talking to him felt like coming home and being wrapped up in a warm hug. No one else has ever made me feel that way. He made life bearable.

Andrew, please, if you’re out there, if you somehow can feel or hear me or somehow come across this, please come back. It’s selfish of me to want this. It’s horrible and evil of me to want you because of what I did and how it would tear you away from someone else, but I don’t know if I can live like this anymore. I don’t know how long I’ll be alive. I’m barely hanging on as it is. I just. Want to apologize. I want things to be okay again. I want to wake up and not feel so alone anymore.

I love you so much. I don’t have the right to say that, I know, but I can’t stop it. You said we were soulmates, and I know there were so much lies and deception, but God, it felt true when you said it. I’m so fucking crazy and delusional. I need to be put down like a dog. 

Please, God, if you’re real, please just give me this one prayer. This one miracle. Or at least just do something to me that puts me in a coma where I can live out my dreams and not face reality anymore. I hate my life. I hate everything I am. I just want it to stop."
517,"
Hey,
I don’t really know how to say this properly, but I’m just incredibly lonely. Not the kind of “I have no plans today” lonely, but the kind where you sit in silence and feel like the world wouldn’t notice if you disappeared.

I’m not trying to be dramatic, I just want someone to see me. I’m not great at opening up, and honestly, I almost didn’t post this. But I figured… maybe someone out there feels the same. Maybe you get it. Maybe we could talk?

No pressure. Even just a comment helps. I just need to feel like I’m not the only one floating in this void. Thanks for reading. Really."
518,"So I've had depression for well over 20 years. The ADHD helped hide it and my receding into myself and repressing emotions. Pretty much cause me to not realize and then not respond to it. 

I've done therapy for awhile now. It's helped tremendously with that and other issues. Regular medication keeps me tethered to the mortal realm and focused. I still have hard days but they aren't as debilitating or dark, just hurts emotionally. 

I'd also like to know what every one does to help motivate or stay motivated. Would also like to if anyone else have a few tips on grounding yourself when intrusive thoughts start to take hold. I'm looking to expand on what I've learned. "
519,"As the title states, how can you genuinely just stop being depressed for good and develop the mental resilience to not fall depressed again?

  
Fyi i'm talking about MDD"
520,"I'm 22 years old man and I have fleeting suicidal thoughts couple times a week. 
Recently been diagnosed with ADHD and just realising how it has affected my life.  Been told I have depression since I was 17. Inconsistency has been a regular pattern in my school reports and I can see that mirrored in my very short term relationships with girls, making new friends but can't follow through, and finding new jobs every month and can't commit. 

A traumatic incident in high school - being accused of sexual assault and having the majority of my peers hate me because of it, didn't help. 

I can't help but be incredibly judgey and hate people and to be negative. I hate that about myself.  I have absolutely abhorrent, violent thoughts about the people on the street when they do things that piss me off that doesn't even affect me. Or when they make a comment or have a slightly judgey face. It's made me incredibly cynical I don't trust nobody. It inhibits my ability to make new friends. 
I notice a big polarity in mood from 10/10 feeling amazing, confident, social (this lasts a day or two) to 0/10 angry, dark, withdrawn. 
The 10/10 mood comes from a series of achieving things. From successful social interactions, winning people over, getting validation from people or having a good funny conversation with friends or whomever. 
Things start spiralling when I'm caught up in my head. Thoughts like; ""I'm gonna be alone for the rest of my life"" ""got no skills"" ""how do I be like this person"" or ""I got nothing, no one"". 
I've been doing therapy, mainly cognitive behavioural therapy. I can't make use of this therapy precticslly day-to-day. Why do I hate life so much?
Most of the time I wanna keep quiet and present as little attention as possible. I'm insecure, angry and withdrawn and I don't know why. 

I'm struggling to find a job. I have friends, the closest of ones I have resentful feelings towards frequently. 
But I hide it.  The people that are actually quite good I push them away because I fear I'm not good or happy enough to be around them. 
I understand I'm pretty good looking, I work out, eat healthy and keep myself clean (I don't necessarily believe this most of the time). 
Something is missing. I lack social cues, struggle in conversation a lot, feeling spacey and anxious, want to be left alone. But being left alone makes things absolutely worse. 

Can anyone find a pattern here and how to get out of this rut? "
521,"I'm 15 and I have the worst genetics . I got to the gym 4 times a week , I spam push ups every day , I lost so much weight . Unfortunately I have big hips , because of this it seems like I'm fat but I'm 70 kg . I dropped from 83 kg to 70 kg , but only my face has changed . Most of my friend's make fun of me and they always hit me because I can't fight . Also I have gyno and phimosis . Thankfully I'm not that ugly , at least I think . When I go to the gym with my cousin he always says to the girls that I'm ugly and fat and that I'm stupid and he always punches me , and I feel really embarrassed .

523,"I never knew that working with depression is that much hard. In my case, severe episodes were srarted when i was uneployed. I hoped getting job would help my depression. And it is not. I don't know what to do with it. It is disaster"
524,"Hi, I'm 24. I've been struggling with severe depression for years. I did my bachelor's from 2019 to 2022 while staying at home, and it made things worse — constant arguments with my parents, who believed I’d never succeed. At one point, I felt so low that I thought maybe not being here would ease things. I didn’t act on it, but those thoughts were heavy.

I’ve always wanted to study law. I didn’t get into BA+LLB after 12th, so I completed a regular bachelor’s and then got into a central law university. I hoped that leaving home would help, and initially, it did. But I began failing my papers. In my first year, I passed only 4 out of 10 subjects and got detained.

I didn’t quit. I stayed and tried again. Now in the second year, I’ve passed most first-year papers but depression returned hard. I was barely attending classes, couldn’t eat or take care of myself, and time just slipped by. I recently gave my third semester exams, needing to pass at least 2 subjects, but only cleared one. So, now I'm back to zero again.

Now I feel like I’ve let everyone down. Especially my father, he’s supported me financially despite us coming from a very low-income background. I’m terrified to tell him I failed again. He doesn’t handle failure well, and I fear disappointing him more than anything.

If anyone’s been through something similar — how did you tell your parents? How do I talk to him without breaking down or making it worse?
"
525,"to start this off, I guess I’m just searching for answers, not attention, Im just constantly confused and sad about everything. 

I’m 22, have 2 duis, lost my job today. have planned about offing myself almost everyday for about 2 years. I’m still dealing with the second dui. I have dreams I want to be great or even just good so bad. I want to be an electrician or work in the healthcare field. Everything just seems so unobtainable at this moment in time with what I have done in my past, and I’m only 22. It feels like I fucked myself for the rest of my life with my mistakes.

I don’t know if I can make rent this month. Yea my dad will let me back in his place but the peace is so nice. I just, I WANT to do better but I’m just stuck in stupid line cook position after one another and I will never attain my dreams.

Thanks.
"
526,"I went into it thinking that my problems were not that bad and that I often felt like I was faking depression or exaggerating the way I felt and that's what I expected to hear honestly. Before this I had not received a formal diagnosis but have been dealing with typical depression symptoms and had SI for many years. I started seriously making plans to end my life which scared me and convinced me to find a therapist and stick with it and follow their advice. I received a diagnosis of major depression and CPTSD but I wasn't sure if those were correct and kind of resisted it and still told myself I'm just making things sound worse than they really are. 

It took more than 6 months before I really accepted that I may actually be depressed and may actually be dealing with trauma issues. That's when I decided to take a leap of faith and give medication a try, I'm still quite early on in that side of things so I don't have many thoughts on it yet.

Ever since I started to accept that there might actually be something wrong with me it's been harder for me to see a future where I really get better. I went into this thinking my problems were mostly made up by myself and that once I heard that I'd stop being this way, which I know makes no sense but that's what I told myself. Problems that I used to think were small and overblown now feel insurmountable and I'm wondering if I'm capable of actually getting over them. I like my therapist and feel comfortable talking to him and I agree with a lot of what he says. I think I'm better at understanding myself and where my thoughts and attitudes come from but I think that may be as far as I go. I'll keep working at it just in case I'm wrong but I don't know if I have it in me to ever be free of this instead of just trying to manage it. I'm not sure if any of that makes sense but I just wanted to put my thoughts into words."
527,"I made a reddit post few hour ago about how I will kill myself today.. I haven't yet but I do want to end my life still. I don't understand... I do wish to kill myself but at the same time I don't want to kill myself after I have finally decided to.. I don't think my father will care about me but my grandparents and my mother might, as well as I don't want them to be ridicule by other.. for there daughter committing suicide 

I also have a interview tmrw and they will 100% ask for my marks and thinking about it make me want to kill myself even more... I don't see the point in life anymore "
528,"I literally have no redeeming qualities, I'm ugly, and I'm pretty sure no one actually likes me. I'm disgusted with myself and I don't feel like I deserve to live anymore. Please don't just tell me that ""You're not alone don't do it"" sorta crap because nobody is going to change my mind. I want to end it all, but I can't do it, I don't know why..."
529,"I can be so good, I can make so much growth. Then its like I didnt grow at all when the depression comes back. Im 26, 3 kids, amazing husband. Healthy relationship. Decent confidence. So what the hell is wrong with me? And why do I feel so alone when life is always so busy? "
530,"I’m 14, and I’m in counselling because my parents found out I’ve been self harming. I told them that I’ve been doing it because of stress with school and exams and stuff but it’s not. I can’t really explain what it is that makes me feel like this, but I have a strong feeling that I have depression. I get suicidal thoughts all the time even though I’m not really sure if I want to die yet.

I’ve been missing a lot of school because I permanently feel crap and my parents keep lecturing me about how I need to go, and that just makes me feel worse. Sometimes I want to go back to when I was little, dealing with scarred knees instead of scarred arms and wrists. Back when I felt freedom and happiness naturally and I didn’t have to force myself to put on a show of emotions to appease everyone around me. I honestly feel like just giving up."

My bills are severely behind.
I can’t afford toilet paper even at a dollarstore.
I am at a loss, and it’s really scary that I let myself go like this.
I pushed every single person away even family I was close with.

I numb my emotions with substances / alcohol 

It hasn’t been this bad since I was 15. 

Just venting, don’t want to be called names or messaged. Have a lot on my mind.
"
532,"I honestly don't know what all to do, I'm 22, unemployed, have little to no motivation to work, aside from the occasional urge to work like a mule, and just generally feel hopeless, miserable, and increasingly more and more angry.

It wasn't always this way, when I was 20 I was actually doing very well for myself, I was in college on a scholarship studying Computer Science, I had a job as a Software Dev Intern, and had even managed to save over $10k, and was generally on a good path. However, this all came crashing down due to a combination of factors out of my control, like my dev team deciding to screw me over by giving me a card way above my skill level at the time and not giving me the documentation they promised, and my own fucking moronic decision to ghost them, which led to me getting kicked from my dev team, and ultimately being forced to resign due to no other team having any open positions.

To say this devastated me is an understatement, it pretty much killed any motivation I had to continue going to class, as I had learned most of what I was learning in class already in High School, and the whole point of me going to college was to get a job since I actually didn't like school very much, and would have otherwise taken a gap year had I not gotten the scholarship/internship program I got, I was decent at programming in High School, even working as a code tutor for 9 months during my first year at college, and Software Dev pays really well so it was the logical career path for me to follow, so to lose this all of a sudden basically killed my spirit, and I flunked out of college due to not even being motivated enough to take my finals.

I tried to go back to college when I was 21, however I started getting really bad anxiety about 3 weeks in, and had some family drama with my parents, so I ultimately didn't make it through the semester, leading up to where I am now. At the start of this year I had a glimmer of hope however, as I finally got my first job in over 2 years, working full time as a Computer Repair Tech, the job itself was pretty easy, however it was stressful due to the poor management, but nothing that was unbearable right? Well apparently not, as not even 6 days in I snapped, and quit in a fit of rage over a small error I made, what the fuck was I thinking? I've had anger issues my whole life, but I cannot believe I actually quit my job over something that fucking stupid, I got my first chance to redeem myself in a long time and fucking blew it, what the fuck am I gonna do if working 6 days is apparently too much for me, I'm just fucked I guess!"
533,"Hi, I’m reaching out because I’m feeling extremely overwhelmed right now, and I don’t know what to do. School is ending in 2 weeks, and my grades are dropping rapidly. Here in Italy, you need at least a 6 out of 10 in every subject to pass. If you don’t get that in one of the subjects, you have to retake the exam at the end of summer. If you don’t pass, you lose a year.

Right now, I have math under a 5, and I’m pretty sure I’ll need to retake the test. Honestly, it’s not a huge surprise since I had to retake math last year too, but this time it’s different. I’m feeling so overwhelmed and anxious about everything, and no matter how hard I try, I just can’t focus or get through it.

I can’t talk to anyone about how I’m feeling because I know they won’t understand, and they have high expectations of me. This is making me feel like a failure, and I’m really struggling to handle it. I feel like I’m disappointing my family, and I can’t shake the feeling that I’m just not good enough. Despite putting in all my effort, my family only sees the results and not the work behind it, which is eating me up inside.

I know it sounds like a lot, but I’m reaching out because I’m stuck. I even thought about suicide recently, but I don’t want to cause my family any more pain.

I really just need some advice on how to cope with all of this. Is anyone here going through something similar or have any tips on how to handle this overwhelming feeling of failure?"
534,"My mental health is getting worse and all that. but today I was riding my motorcycle, I crashed and I'm not sure if it was an accident or if I did it on purpose. I was going about 80km/h on an empty straight road and I feel like I purposely lost control of my bike. I'm not completely sure though and that's bothering me."
535,"I'm standing here—damn it, don’t you hear me?
I'm screaming until my throat is raw, begging with everything I have left,
but the silence stays, cold and merciless,
pressing in like a wall I can’t break through.

I reach out into the void,
not for hope—not anymore—
just for something, anything, to prove I’m still real.

But there’s nothing.
Only the vast, yawning emptiness that surrounds me,
pulling at the edges of my mind like a tide that never stops rising.
It’s a silence that isn't quiet—
it devours.
Thoughts, dreams, even the memory of who I used to be.

The darkness isn't loud. It doesn’t scream.
It just waits—patient, eternal—
to swallow me whole and leave nothing behind.

Once, there were promises.
Once, there were dreams—fragile things,
cradled in trembling hands.
Now they drift like ashes in the air,
weightless, forgotten.

I stand here, heart stripped bare,
in the ruins of what might have been.
And I finally understand:
loneliness isn’t being alone.
It’s being unseen.
It’s the echo of your own voice
in a world that no longer answers.



And I wonder,
how much longer until I disappear too?

"
536,"I have the worst parents and family ever, I hate Islam also, they don't know the word privacy and in my room ALONE there are 3 cameras watching me at all times, I have to hide in the closet when I change, and when I do, my parents open the closet and hit me while fucking naked thinking I'm doing something else. They're really abusive and I've gotten so many marks all over my body from their beatings, and my sister is and absolute fat fucking asshole (she's like 80 pounds at 9 years old), she acts as the favorite in the family and messes up the house and blames it on me and even gets to punish me IN FRONT OF MY PARENTS and they don't do shit. It's been getting so hard for me lately, I've had depression since 10, and I've been thinking about suicide. But I don't to do it because I'm worried how it'll affect all the other people around me, it probably won't, but I have friends online, so It's been really hard, and because of that I've made a decision, even though I'm only 13. I'm going to run away this summer, I can't wait for this and I feel I'd be better off doing this because I'm tired of living with these shitheads. I hope I'm online by next year to update you guys on this, I love you and the Reddit community too, and I hope everyone gets far in life."
537,"
It’s been months since I ended a year-and-a-half-long toxic relationship with a narcissist. It felt like an eternity. I finally walked away. I set boundaries. I faced him one last time and spoke my truth. But even though it’s over, I feel like I’m still trapped.

I carry so much rage inside me. It’s overwhelming. I don’t like admitting this, but part of me wants him to suffer. I want him to feel even a fraction of the pain he put me through. He broke me. He slowly dimmed my light until I barely recognized myself. I used to be full of joy, curiosity, and warmth. Now I feel like a shadow. Emotionally naked. Like he took everything good in me when I let him go.

I don’t want to live with this anger, but it consumes me. I hate the version of myself that this relationship left behind. And I hate that he gets to walk around as if nothing happened, while I relive everything on a loop. Every manipulation, every gaslight, every silent treatment followed by fake affection. He messed with my head so badly that even now, free from him, I question my reality.

I miss who I used to be. And it scares me to think I’ll never get her back.

Has anyone else been through something like this? How do you stop wishing someone pain when they caused you so much of it?"

I deeply feel that I can't overcome depression and just not help somebody else. It feels wrong.

541,Today I met this girl and I thought she was really pretty so I told her and she laughed and said I was a fat pig and that I was ugly and had no chance with her and that completely shredded my feelings and I feel done and empty again 
542,"Even if you have told that person explicitly that you feel sad and they continue to tell you that as if it were something easy to do, or compare you to other people, it is a horrible feeling, it is as if no one listens to you or understands you. "
543,"It's kind of unfair, everyone who's close to me and even my boyfriend who've spent 4 years together doesn't know anything about me at all, Everyone else forgets about my existence, my hobbies, my preferences, and even my birthday.  
It's fucking ridiculous, everyone else forgets shit bout me and I'm the only one who remembers everything about them  
Sometimes, I wish that I didn't even bother to remember anything about them, but I still do  
because I'm too pathetic to think that if I manage to remember anything about them, they'll remember mine.

Everyone else said that their memory is dogshit, but did they even bother to at least try to remember anything? 
If someone really wanted to remember anything about me, they would've tried so
Everytime I say something to the people I know, they won't even bother to listen
I guess that's the reason why anyone doesn't remember anything about me."
544,"I don't know what to do, I'm trying so hard to be my best for everyone around me but in struggling because I know it's not enough, I know I'm not good enough and i don't know what to do to feel better, I'm 23 years old and I've just spent the last hour crying alone sat at the top of a hill
I don't know if I need advice or something but I just don't know what to do about this, I'm struggling "
545,"Hace unos días terminé con quien fue mi pareja por dos años. La verdad, la relación fue bonita, estuvo llena de momentos lindos, y siento que, en parte, eso es lo que más me duele: saber que fue bonita, no una relación tóxica o algo por el estilo. Creo que simplemente ella se aburrió de la rutina, de esa rutina de la cual yo me enamoré, porque podía hablar o hacer de todo sin importar nada, porque para mí tenía a la persona con la cual ya quería compartir todo, a quien le contaba mi día, lo que quería y cómo me sentía.

Ahora no sé qué hacer. Solo me hundo más en el dolor, y los pocos momentos de felicidad espontánea que llegan son tan vacíos que, al final, siento que no es una felicidad real. Me gustaría no sentir nada, me gustaría simplemente ser alguien vacío, pero no puedo. Y es tan difícil olvidar todo cuando, hasta en mis sueños, aparece la imagen de ella. Mi cerebro, lo que consideraba mi virtud más grande, ahora siento que es mi enemigo, porque es imposible luchar contra él.

No quiero probar drogas ni nada así, porque siento que me destruiría aún más a mí mismo. Ahora mismo estoy lejos de todo, en una ciudad al otro lado de mi país. Mis padres y amigos más cercanos no están, y en estos momentos llega a mi cabeza el recuerdo de la muerte de mi padre. Siento que todo es una exageración mía y que no debería sentirme así, pero me es imposible no sentirme mal. Ya no logro pensar con claridad y no como casi nada. Cada día se siente peor que el anterior… Aún más vacío, aún más tristeza. Siento que en algún momento ya no podré seguir más, y tengo miedo de que llegue ese día.

Solo quería decírselo a alguien. No sé si alguien lo lea, lo importante es que ya está escrito. Lastimosamente, no puedo controlar lo que siento, y siento que esa será mi ruina."
546,"From the time I could remember I didn’t want to exist anymore. I feel too much to the point I get physical pains, I cry easily, and I just feel I’m too sensitive for this world and I hate it. I’d rather off myself before I hurt another person. I’d give up whatever if it meant those who have a promising future can be happy. But just a single thought that rolls in my head makes me sad. I wasn’t supposed to make it to 25. Yet here I am. I wanna die but I try to stay hopeful even a little but the things I hope in could end any second and my will to live would go with it. If the people I love dearly no longer need me or want me then that’s it for me. I have no other purpose. Yet in all circumstances what if things don’t end? What am I supposed to do? I don’t know how to live. "
547,"Hi, so… I don’t really know how to start, but I think I need help.
I’m 15 and I’ve reached a point where everything kind of feels like it stopped. I can’t really feel motivation, willpower, or excitement anymore, even when I try doing the things I used to love. I’m still trying to keep up with my anime project, training, drawing, making art, moving… but none of it has that spark anymore.

I feel really alone. Like, completely. I have no friends, and I lost the only real connection I ever had — Rapha. She was my best friend. We really understood each other and went through similar things. I gave her a lot of support, and at some point during those 4 months, I fell in love with her. With every conversation, I loved her more. She was the only person I could be 100% myself with. But she didn’t love me back the same way — she’s aroace — and even though I told her it was okay and she didn’t need to feel the same, she still felt pressured anyway. She felt like she had to return my feelings and was also scared of hurting me or getting hurt. So she cut contact and told me to move on and forget about her (which I just can’t do).
And now I’m stuck in a family where I can’t be myself either.

I like spinning pens, spinning cables like a spear, I like art, training, imagining and creating stuff… but all of that is seen as childish or pointless, like I’m just a kid who won’t get anywhere. My mom doesn’t support the things I want to do — like working with art or becoming a bartender. She says AI is gonna replace everything and that I should do something “useful.”
My dad is a bit more supportive, but he still pressures me and complains about things like spinning a broom (which I mentioned earlier) — he says it’s childish.

It’s hard at home. My sisters don’t understand me. One threatens me emotionally, and the other drains me with tantrums and stress. And I don’t have anyone who really listens.

I do homeschooling, but I have no connection to the community (the people who follow the same program). No one in the condo understands me either. Not even at church, and I don’t see anyone there anymore anyway because the church closed after my parents’ divorce (they were the pastors).

I’m always alone. Even surrounded by people, it feels like no one truly sees me.

And even though I keep trying, I’m not getting the results I want. My body is kind of close to what I dreamed of, but I don’t have the motivation to keep going and I feel bad about it. I’m not drawing like I used to, and my anime — which was my biggest dream — feels like something I might never make.

I don’t want to die, but sometimes I wonder if it would make a difference. I don’t feel like living the way things are. I feel empty, and the things that used to have meaning don’t really carry any weight anymore.

I just want a space to talk to someone without being judged, without having to explain everything like it’s my fault. I just want someone who understands that this isn’t drama. I’m really hurt. I’m tired.
And I’m only holding on because I still have hope that maybe someday things will get better. In about 4 years, I’ll probably move to Italy with my mom and sisters, and maybe there I’ll be able to live from art, make real connections, leave this environment, live alone, and be myself.
But that day feels so far away.

And I’m scared I won’t make it until then.

That’s it. Sorry for the long vent.

548,"hi, i’m f/17 and i am so alone. i’m not actually alone but i feel like there is a huge void in me a void that no matter what cannot be filled. i feel lost, desperate to just breath and be okay. i am in pain, in agony all the time. i’m supposed to be “okay” and be “fine” but i simply cannot function without breaking down every single day. it hurts everywhere. my throat feels like it’s bound w chains all the time, my eyes they burn with tears every second of the day. and the reason i am this way is now “too old” for it to be valid. everyone i talk to looks at me weird, wondering how i’m not over things that happened 3 years ago & sometimes i myself question, what is wrong with me, my brain, my heart that i’m unable to be okay, to function, to stay happy? why am i so sad all the time. do i deserve this darkness? will i only be happy once i end it all? get away from this world? the sadness consumes me. i so badly want to say goodbye. to leave, to let myself finally breath, to not feel so goddamn lost. i js want to be happy, to not be a burden to everyone around me. everything inside me just feels too big… too painful to carry alone anymore so im going to try even if it comes out messy, right now im not okay and not in a passing way this feels deep like an undying kind of pain that sits in my chest and spreads everywhere i feel like im trapped inside myself and the walls keep getting higher its not just sadness its something darker and heavier… like im living in a constant state of quiet agony. theres this voice in my head that doesnt shut up it picks at everything i do everything i am it tells me im not good enough not lovable not worthy and some days i believe it some days i look in the mirror or just exist in a room and feel like im the problem like everything wrong with the world somehow lives inside me. i carry so much self hate that its hard to breathe i know it doesnt make sense from the outside but sometimes i cant even feel like i deserve it its like im at war with myself every single day and no matter how hard i try i cant make it stop. some nights i just lie there completely still hoping the pain will soften hoping ill feel like a real person again but it doesnt go away i get so tired even brushing my teeth taking care of myself it feels like too much i feel broken and i dont want to be but i dont know how to fix it either. this is eating me alive. i’m breaking pieces by pieces & i simply can’t do it anymore. "
549,"I got my result and also me being a idiot but I pass with really terrible grade as well as have a school interview again... I am scared but I think I will finally do it...

I don't want to do it. I am crying right now! I am so scared for my future... I know I should I have hard but I didn't and obviously fail in life 

Please am so scared.. I don't know how my family and friends will feel after I am gone and I am do scared.. I am in my room and so scared.. 

My family isn't strict or anything but is really loving and support and I am so ashamed of myself.. they don't know this yet about the result and I am so scared if they find of about this. There's no point in regretting this now.. should have studied for it but I can't go back in time (sorry for my Grammar)"
550,"(Throwaway account, also cross posted to r/depression_help) 

Being a mother/motherly friend has kept me going. Always checking on others, making meals for people who are struggling, always being a shoulder to lean on, etc. I have experienced the absolute lowest point of my life lately. I have nowhere to turn. I’ve been trying to reach out and ask for help, only to get shot down. I have a progressive disability that will never get better/I’ll be cured of. My relationship is on its last leg. Everyone around me just seems to pity me. Not even the Church feels welcoming anymore. I’m so angry with God. I’ve had multiple attempts and I can’t seem to succeed. I wish my first one would have worked so I could be spared of this. This isn’t what life is supposed to be like. Everyone around me gets my all, and I get nothing in return. I’m empty. Everyone is ignoring me at this point. I’m so fucking done. "
551,"is there really a way to cope with the ways i feel, everyday lately i don’t feel anything anymore. and when i do im either sad or angry or simply both, i cannot cope with the way my life is going right now and im so uncomfortable in many situations. the loml doesn’t seem like she wants to be around me anymore. i think my friends all hate me, every joke made towards me is taken personally. i’m seriously running out of solutions, i haven’t thought about taking my life for 4 years now and the last month it has been the only thought, im not planning anything but im starting to not see a way to dig myself out. i truly feel miserable, i almost want to bawl my eyes out whenever im working and i feel like an empty husk on my off days.

im very worried for myself and my future, all of these thoughts and feelings terrify me and idk how to cope with any of it and truly be happy, i do know full happiness is near impossible to achieve but i was at least hoping for a little happiness in my life instead of all the dread and overthinking. anybody have any advice or similar situations?"
552,"i’ve done everything i’ve done therapy i’ve taken medication i’ve seen doctors i’ve worked out i’ve changed my diet i’ve moved i’ve tried diff jobs ive made new friends ive gone on dates but i literally don’t enjoy anything. the past two and a half years i have been so bored. my ex and i broke up two and a half years ago and idk why i am even still sad about it we dated for only a few months and it was long distance but i have not met anyone that i like even slightly as much as him. and i have done everything i can possibly think of and i donfeeel a bit better some times, but i am so bored. and nothing fulfills me at all. "
553,being in a design class in university has single handedly destroyed my life. As someone that was a quiet kid growing up i decided to step outside of my comfort zone and tried to talk to more people. but instead of people actually fucking being nice all I have are elitist pieces of shit clowning on me for my supposedly 'poor' socioeconomic class and calling me a pick me when all i wanted was to try and make some genuine friendships. No one cares if you're an international student with money. It doesn't make you better than anyone else who earned a spot in the program. I was told multiple times indirectly go k*ll myself and overall has been a living hell for me. There is this one girl who is a terrible person who started out as a friend (i'm pretty sure she used me for status because she thought I was 'popular' ) and she has been spreading untrue things around my class to make people see things differently. The me being 'poor' thing started this one time me and a group were at the mall and I didnt want to buy a shirt because it was practically identical to one I already had. And she decided the 'real' reason I didnt want is becauze I supposedly have no money which isn't even true. she eats food and trashes my desk with half eaten Tim Hortons and also gets pissy whenever I wear the color pink because she thinks she owns it. Yet she just has this stupid snob pretentious act where she thinks she's better than me. If you've ever read the Picture of Dorian Gray you would see if she had a portrait it would be disgusting. Everyone thinks she is nice but it has gotten to the point where people are avoiding events that I'm in just because of false things shes said. Her friend group is equally as rotten. One of the girls has openly been rude to me about my educational background because the highschool I went to is not the most well funded. She also told me i'm not getting anywhere in life because i'm not in clubs or whatever. And in the same class my best friend had some issues with some stuff they didnt like me doing but instead of telling me directly they went and told around fifteen others and the story became twisted and now there are people actually saying they hate me without even knowing the real story.  I do think I have some potential as an architect but with the amount of hate against me being spread around I don't even know if i'm going to be able to live through this program anymore. 
554,"*Disclaimer I’m not actually going to do anything*

The only thing I take solace in is the fact that I can commit suicide. The only thing that stops the pain I feel inside (which I’m not sure actually causes it) is the fact the all my worries be gone if I die. I’m live what feels like a meaningless existence, doesn’t feel like anyone actually gives a fuck about me. I tried making new friends recently thinking that would help, no one wants to know me or cares about me. "
555,"I feel so worthless and I feel like I should have never been born. I feel stupid and slow and can't do anything right. I'm 35, don't have friends ,never had a gf. All I do all day is lay in my dark room and be on my tablet. Social anxiety has fucked up my life so much. It kinda brings me a little peace knowing I could jus end it all anytime I want. I often think about shooting myself in the head with my 9mm. It's this park that's close to my house where I would do it. I wouldn't do it in my yard cause I wouldn't want my family to find my body cause it might be traumatizing to them."
556,Yeah this will probably get downvoted whatever. I been struggling with my mental health and drank beer at work today. I’m a hard worker and no one even notices but inside I’m suffering. This is my life I guess. Off in 65 minutes. Can’t wait. I’ll probably never be happy….
557,"When I was 11, I tried to kill myself with vitamin gummies, always living in paranoia and depression. When I was 13, I began taking pills (Oxy, xans Benadryl), sneaking out, almost got admitted into the mental hospital, constantly seeing new therapist, battling self harm, etc. when I was 14, I was very hyper sexual. I would have extreme mood swings of feeling as if I was on top of the world and doing reckless things to not being able to get out of bed. I am currently taking lexapro (10mg) but I still feel anxious and have passive suicidal thoughts. I am currently 15 about to turn 16, and I feel as i
f each day is a struggle. I have no friends, I feel so alone and tired. I think tired is the best word for how I am feeling. I view death as something peaceful. I remember when I was 13, I would cut myself a lot, I don’t anymore but I miss the relief it gave me. I disappointed a lot of people but I am currently clean from self harm and pills, I just smoke weed now. As much as I’d like to forget my trauma, there’s no way to fully suppress it as it will always come back. All I can do is deal with it. I hope someone else relates to me lol.
"
558,"I think my depression has gotten a turn for the worse.

Ive been on a waiting list for a therapist for the past couple of months. Ive been taking medications daily, but i dont think its enough. I can barely sleep, and maybe get... 3-4 hours a night, often ending in night terrors. A lot of these dreams often are about me getting mugged, getting hit in a car accident, or being blamed for others misfortunes. Like I had a terrible dream of an suv rear ending my car, then the driver getting out of the seat, dragging me out of my car and kicking my ass for ""being responsible for the death of his children"".

Eating has become rough. Ive been unable to eat these past couple of days... no, maybe many days these past weeks. I think its because one of the side effects of Welbutrin has been appetite loss.

I cant talk about my mental issues with my mother. When I told her about my suicidal idealations, she told me that I should kill myself if I hated living so much. Shes completely done with my crap. To me, I feel like im the cause of all of my problems. To me, I think if I stopped existing, then all the issues I plagued people's lives with will go away. These days, its gotten a bit worse, as my mother now refers to me as ""less than half of her genes"" since i disappoint her so much. I cant blame her because I was on a downward spiral with drugs (starting with Psilocybin then taking Ritalin recreationally). Ive been clean off Ritalin for a month. My mother still slaps me because ""i used drugs even though my problems are non existent"" even though ""she suffers more"".

When I talk about these mental issues, its like she's so done with me. No one in my family speaks to me. I never get calls from anyone besides my boyfriend that are nice in any sort of way (i cant see him physically as now, hes off in Kuwait for work for an entire year). My friends say that I care a lot, but I constantly have this ache in my heart that screams ""imposter syndrome"". It feels so jarring to hear people outside my family not call me a heartless soulless waste of genes creature. 

Is there even a way for me to get my family to realise I need help? These days, I keep having thoughts of physically harming myself so I could get their attention, but im already like the black sheep of my family...

God i hate living"
559,"I hate my life everything hurts and I see some weird scribbled in person watching me and it ""likes to torture me"" I want to kill myself so fucking bad"
560,"  I don't know how much of this life there is to find joy from. I have type 1 diabetes and I'm just so tired of it. Diabetes is there when sleep, watch TV, work, rake a shower.... it's just unrelenting.
  I was recently diagnosed with Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis. I can't even wear my wedding ring half the the time because my knuckles, wrists and fingers swell up and occasionally lock up.
  I have MDD, Generalized Anxiety and ADHD. I'm a basket case, apparently.
  And to top it all off, my ED has gotten so severe, that I'm practically dead down there. I'm only 35. Like, I don't think that there's anything left I can give. I feel like my future has been robbed. If I'm only this old, how much worse is my life going to get? Like, what other disease will I get diagnosed with that will take whatever joy  I might find later on in life. Fuck this shit. 
  At this point, I don't want to be alive."
561,My anxiety is getting worse and my depression is getting bad again. Life isn't working out even though I thought it was starting to get better. Feeling suicidal lately :(
562,"Hey everyone, this is hard to post but I'm 34 and feeling depressed about issues in my relationship. My fiancé is loving, kind, funny supportive and has stuck with me through medical issues I know most men wouldn't have. I moved away from my home in California and have always wanted to move back to raise my future kids there, and my mom is getting older so it hurts a lot to not be near her:( My dad died and I just want to be able to live close where I could remember him better I guess. But my fiancé has never liked California and is against living there (it's too expensive (which I understand), it's against his politics, etc.) and I've tried and tried to see if there's a compromise we could make, move to a cheaper place there, me getting a higher paying job, etc. But he just says no. He says he understands how I feel but says we can't move there. 

I don't think he really gets my pain though because everytime I try to explain it he says things like ""how am I supposed to bring my guns there?"" 

I don't think there's a way we can agree on this but I can't just leave him:( I've been with him since I was 19 and it's scary to start over with someone else, especially since I'm older now. He's also always been there for me through the worst of my anxiety, depression and health issues and I'm scared to lose that. Ive always had low self-esteem that I could find someone else. So I just feel sort of stuck:( 
I have no excitement for the future and it hurts me a lot to say that 😢

Is this just my anxiety?  Should I just be happy with what I have? Ty ❤️"
563,"My mental health has completely plummeted in the last year and had sank me into a depression that I don't think I can recover from. I've been isolating and avoiding my girlfriend and loved ones for most of this time and it has gotten to the point where it seems impossible to reconnect and repair the lost time.
I'm not sure I can go on living this way if I lose evervone I care about.
If anyone has advice for me I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you."
564,"Seriously, I don't understand what's happening in me, I try to come up of what emotions I'm feeling, but i come up short. right now, i feel numb, empty, and hollow, just there existing with no purpose. and other i feel like I'm being dragged down in to nothing but shame and sorrow for myself when i have everything in front of me. i have a family who all care for me, a few friends to distract myself from reality, a path i can take to achieve my dream to become a teacher, but im not taking it. instead, i stayed in my bed, stuck, doing nothing but read on my tablet or watch TikTok and skipped 40% of the school staying home. and when I think im feeling joy or happiness, im unsure whether its truly happiness or hopefulness, thinking if these feelings are nothing but fraudulent. like an imposter. there are sometimes days where think about ending it by killing myself because i'm just a useless story that is taking place in the universe, but there is so much i want to see before i leave this world. and i want to die with no regrets. but how can take view of a world where sometimes i feel no emotions, either way seeing it or not, one day i will kill myself. deep down i think i will kill myself, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year, but one thing i know is that one day this little story will in end with my own hands."
565,"Last year I started feeling so anxious about going to school that I would feel like I was about to be violently sick constantly and I started to go less and less but I still wanted to finish high school and get my QCE but now I’m in year 11 and it’s all gone to shit. 

I haven’t gone to school in weeks and I’ve now started to fail all my classes because I just can’t get up and I feel like the laziest person in the world for not getting up. At first my dad was angry at why I wasn’t going but then he seemed to understand and try to help but now he’s gone back to being angry and it honestly making me feel worse.

Everything just seems so meaningless to me now, I don’t even enjoy collecting stupid stuff like I used to and I feel like I have no future, like I’ve ruined it for myself, I originally wanted to do something related to art like tattooing but now I feel like I’m not even going to get the chance, there are so many better people then me and there’s even ai now I don’t know what to do.

It feels like it’s not worth it but at the same time I so desperately want to get up and chase after it. I feel so stuck and useless and sometimes I even wish that I would just suddenly die from some strange illness or something so I don’t have to continue on in this stagnant life. I’ve tried to reach out to so many people and organisations but they always end up telling me to just go on a walk or talk it out but it’s not helping me.

I have barely any friends that I can talk to cause I only just recently moved to this area and even if I did I’d feel bad for dumping this all on them like they have their own problems to solve as well I don’t want to add to it. I just don’t know what to do, currently I’m just sitting in my room crying every now and then when I’m not distracting myself by drawing or watching something to keep my mind off how stupid I feel."
566,"The VA has had me on Zoloft and Wellbutrin for at least 5 years. The meds worked for about a year, then tolerance took over a couple of years ago. I continue to take it because when I stop I have a very noticeable up tick in suicidal thoughts. I’ve tried tapering but no success. The Doc tried new meds on top of what I was taking but still no luck, actually made things worse. I know the VA seems to use a “one shoe fits all” type of solution.  Anyone else ran into a problem like this? Thanks. "
567,"I was fine earlier. I woke up, took a shower, fixing myself up, ironing my uniform then it hits me. It hits me really bad to the point that I put my uniform back to my wardrobe and cry again here at the corner of my bed. I prayed to Him to heal me because I'm tired. I feel like I'm drowning again. I feel like my face is already at the surface of the water but there's something under the sea holding my ankles and it keeps me drowning. "
568,"I don't understand anything about the world it's all soulless it means nothing. I've thought about suicide for the last 4 years it's been in the back of my head for awhile I've almost done it 2 times with a rifle it's clean I think. Most of friends are fake my whole family probably hates me I'm not really good to them and I hate that I'm doing that to them especially my dad who I think is the only person in my life who actually cares for me except for like 2 of my really close friends. I don't fucking know what to do. I don't wanna hurt anyone I love anymore then I already do but reality fucking sucks and is pointless I don't see a future for myself I'm not very smart at any subject except history but that's never getting me anywhere, I'm at a roadblock reality is pointless and painfull and I'm scared to take the easy way out. "
569,"I'm a man who just recently became 27 this year, I have no skill's of any kind and have not contributed anything to society whatsoever.

I am in a good University taking a Computer Science degree that I started at the age of 21 in my current University and now 6 years later I only finished 11 subjects out of 31 and in the last two years only finished 1 subject having spent one of those years without completing a single one, my mother naturally does not know any of this.

I like to tell myself that it's not all laziness since I secretly suffer with a variety of mental health issues such as: OCD; social anxiety, intrusive thoughts and depression. Every year I start with the best of intentions truly wanting to get good grades and get this degree done and over with but I slowly start getting lazier and lazier and start getting behind on my studies until it just becomes too late to complete most of the subjects, if not all of them, making my mental health issues even worst making it even harder to study.

To make things worst, my mother who still pays for my studies to this day, just had to quit her job at the family business because she could not take it anymore due to toxic working environment since the rest of my immediate family is also horrible, so now to be able to keep affording for my apartment we have had to borrow money from someone else since the bank loan I requested was denied twice.

This just makes me feel even more guilty since I am just wasting my mother's money and every effort I have made to get a job during the summer also failed. I am now at the end of the 2nd semester of my 6th year of university, 8th if I count two years at a different one before I started over in this new one, and I am now spending every day planning to wake up early the next day to study and exercise only to just waste the whole day away in the darkness of my own bedroom on my laptop.

The only one who used to make me happy was my cat that I always looked forward to seeing when coming back home was my cat until one day my mother called me saying the cat had been accidentally locked in the garage and she found it dead with it's head stuck in the window of my car, the same window I used to purposefully leave only slightly open to get air inside without many bugs getting in, I cried multiple times that day, that was the third cat I had lost as the other two just disappeared, this one was very homely and this happened, I still can't believe it, I truly saw that cat as a friend, not as a pet, but an actual friend.

As I spend most days alone with my own thoughts my mental health keeps going up and down, with some days managing to get by, with the worst day ending with me crying in the dark in the corner of my room listening to ""Phil Collins - Son of Man"".

It's really said to see videos and pictures of me from when I was a child just to get hit with that feeling of disbelief that that innocent little boy with all his future ahead of him ended up growing to be the person I am today.

I really feel like I am wasting all my potential, I know I have the ability to finish this degree and, without coming across as too full of myself, I am a pretty tall good looking guy if not a bit out of shape. I, despite the issues I have, have been given the opportunity to study and get an amazing degree that is very sought-after and pays well while being pretty lucky when it comes to the genetic lottery, and yet I am wasting away in a dark bedroom squandering it all.

If one day it becomes impossible for me to continue my studies for a reason or another and I have to quit university and the degree that I always dreamed off as a kid, I don't think I am going to be able to live with the guilt of my own failures, with the shame of having to face the people that know that I have failed and now see me working a menial job while all others who grew up with me made something of themselves. If this day ever comes I will probably just end myself."
570,"Hi everyone😀
Im 15 years old and I'm just feeling so lost in life . I don't know whether I want to be here .
I have so many problems that just keep coming my way. My school life is depressing, I hardly have any friends because they just stopped talking too me , whenever I try to sit with people they just ignore me and make me feel unseen. I always compare myself with other people at school and it always makes me so depressed and sad . Then I always have somebody quetioning my looks or the way I behave , Im really starting to feel like I am the problem in my life. 
I come home from school to just to scroll on my phone , I have so much homework and projects to do that Im just leaving.
I'm always tired and my energy is just drained , I am living in a never ending cycle .
I just wish I had someone to talk to about all this ."
571,I'm just so fucking tired. The depression has a chokehold of me and I cannot fight it. I feel worse and worse everyday and although on the surface the fact Ive stopped harming myself seems good but that was the only way I could regulate the hatred of myself and the pain and now that I don't do it anymore the emotions are just becoming way too much and I don't know how much more I can handle. (Sorry for the language)
572,Was I just brought here to suffer my whole life?
573,"Can people tell me their experiences with ANY SSRI's and correlation to hairloss, decreased libido, weight gain and possibly tinnitus? I started lexapro and struggled with some of these things but I wanted to know if there was a postive SSRI that did not have such horrible side effects all at once. Not on lexapro anymore but wanted to try another in the future."
574,"Just need to rant I’ve been so frustrated with things that are so far out of my control. To go from someone full of life to where I am at now is just debilitating. 

It all started when I was 18 in highschool, I was huge into fitness and had a great physique and I was very proud of it - but over the course of several months my health deteriorated and I lost over 60 pounds while doctors tried to figure out was wrong. After finally figuring out I had Crohn’s disease I started on immunosuppressant drugs to treat it and although I got a bit better I could never really gain weight after that and I hated the way I looked. It sucked going from strong to skinny and being ridiculed for it by family and friends or just random people because I guess body shaming is fine when you’re skinny right? Whatever, wasn’t a big deal it just really pissed me off. Well shit, a couple months later and my gf at the time notices a small bald patch on my head. It grew a bit over the next few months so I went to see a doctor and it turns out I have Alopecia Areata - an autoimmune disease where your body basically attacks your hair follicles and they fall out. Great. 


I still managed to keep high spirits and just kinda lived with it until I had a really bad flare up of Crohn’s again when I was 20. So yet again I lost all the weight I tried so hard to gain over the last two years and as a cherry ontop I started to lose all the hair on my body over the course of a few months. Like all of it. Eyelashes, eyebrows, nose hair, you name it. I felt like a goddamn freak. When you have no eyebrows you honestly look fucking weird and it’s something I could never accept. But you know what? I kept my head strong and I didn’t let that shit get to me. I was successful with my sales job, I went out with my friends, I still reached my goals, bought one of my dream motorbikes and things were still okay. 

I decided to make a career change which really helped my mental health, and my dermatologist got me on a trial for a new drug to treat my alopecia. After 5 months I had hair growing back and a year later I had all my hair back. I was so happy. I get it’s just hair but when you lose your hair like that especially in your 20s you lose a sense of yourself and it hurts a lot. So having my hair back really changed my life for the better. I got my pretty privilege back and I felt like a handsome young man again. Life was fucking amazing. 

Fast forward to now, I’m fucked. My health started to deteriorate again with my Crohn’s disease to the point where I lost even more weight, I was in so much pain, couldn’t hold down food, could barely even move without feeling like absolute death so I had to stop working, and get in for emergency surgery. They had to cut out most of my large intestine - leaving me with an Ostomy bag. If you don’t know what that is, it’s a bag of shit hanging from my stomach because they basically rerouted my asshole through my stomach lining. Although I’m grateful to be alive and be able to eat food again, I feel like an absolute freak with this this bag of shit literally hanging off me at all times of the day. It’s embarrassing, I’m worried about it leaking when I’m out in public because how gross is that, idk, I just feel like a freak and rightfully so. The worst part about this whole thing is that I am losing all of my hair again. The hair in my scalp is thinning out with lots of patches, my eyebrows are gone again, and all while I’m dealing with this Ostomy bag bullshit. Like I can handle one thing at a time but for this to happen simultaneously is so painful on my soul. All my friends are getting ahead, enjoying their lives, getting married, or going out and having fun. But I can’t do any of that. If I go out I’m constantly thinking about this stupid bag, if it smells or if I might pop a leak or if someone will notice it. And then I’m also just so self conscious now because I’m out here with half a head of hair and no eyebrows so people stare while they try to figure out why I look so weird. I can’t help but envy everyone around me because they have no idea how hard it is to even wanna get out of bed and face the world every morning with these problems. The good news is they will reattach my small intestine to the remains of my colon in the next year or so - so I hopefully won’t have this bag forever. But I seriously don’t know if I can survive a year of this shit while I have to deal with losing all of my hair again. I’m just so fucking Sad. Even the things that usually distract me like riding motorbikes or hanging with my friends I can’t even do that anymore because of this bag. It’s all I think about. To go from a relatively attractive person to this bald, disgusting shit bag freak is like hell on earth and I don’t know what I did to deserve this. It’s so frustrating. Therapy doesn’t work I’ve tried, I don’t wanna go on antidepressants because I am sick of big pharma I’m taking enough of their shit. So I prefer to rawdog my depression, but shit guys I’m just so tired of it. Thanks for reading I guess lolol"
575,"Just venting I guess

My now ex (still living together for a little while longer) is horrible to me. She only points out my faults no matter how small. I can do everything right and she will still find a way to find one small thing I didn’t do to her specifications and that’s all she can focus on.

She gets physical with me. She got me locked up in a mental institution and uses it against me any chance she can that I have a mental disorder. 

No doctor or nurse in the hospital believed what I said about the abuse. I can’t go there for help

I can’t see myself as having any value anymore. I was prescribed a very highly efficient “feelings strait jacket” of antidepressants ssri adhd and anything in between. I’m now floating with no purpose. 

I don’t have hope. That’s the hardest part. 

I used to shine bright like gold
Now I’m all indigo"
576,"Im not sure why, but i always get these intense urges to just do the worst things possible. I cut myself, i hit myself, i try to destroy myself as much as possible because im too much of a pussy to fucking kill myself. Im only 14, yet ive been craving alcohol, and to smoke something. Ive never tried smoking, but ive had alcohol before. Idk what the purpose of anything is anymore im failing school, i treat my friends and family like shit, and nothing else other than shows movies and tiktok interest me. Im addicted to my phone because it gives me a significant amount of dopamine release, and same thing with food, i binge eat cause it gives me that satisfaction. Im diagnosed ADHD, and its ruined my fucking life. I cant be normal, cant having anything fucking good in this god forsaken life. Mind you struggling with OCD and having trauma reminds everywhere doesnt fucking help with shit. Idk what to do anymore. "
577,"I'm married, I make a lot of money (top billing sales rep), i have plenty of friends, but I'm suffering pretty bad from anhedonia.

It all started when covid lockdowns happened. Prior to that any depression I had experienced was purely circumstantial and would go away when issues would resolve.

Right now I'm just so bogged down with the monotony of working in an office every day and I just feel like a purposeless blob. My work is really frustrating and sedentary, I'm super stuck in this job because I'm really good at it but I hate it. I make like 200-300K and can't bring myself to consider leaving because nothing I'm qualified for pays even 100K.

I'm stuck because I know I need to do something, I've seen therapists before and they've all been completely useless. I used to be very anti-medication but at this point I'm opening up to the idea.

My health insurance sucks and if I see a therapist it's gonna cost me >$100 per session which I can afford but I'm trying to save for early retirement and really not trying to piss money away. I've seen 3 useless therapists in my life and can't decide if it's just always gonna be useless or if maybe there's someone who can help me."

579,"Hello, my name is Brian. I am 38 m from the United States. I am autistic.

I have been reall struggling with autistic burnout. My tolerance for other people is certainly at a low point.

The only two people in my life that I am close to right now are my parents. Thankfully I have a great relationship with both if them. For that I am extremely grateful.

I have gone back and forth in whether I wanted to try and pursue a romantic relationship or not. I think there are pros and con to both choices.

But I have decided to go after a romantic relationship. I have decided there really is room for a third person in my life :)

I have no clue how I will ever meet her :)
But I so cannot wait."
580,"I experience a condition that I have never heard discussed, and have not once heard being mentioned. 

Every single second of every single day I experience suicidal ideation. I am by no means exaggerating. Even when I’m not actively thinking about it(which is rare), I still FEEL suicidal. Not even my dreams are safe from this feeling. I have felt this way ever since I was 13 years old, and I will be graduating high school this year. 
  
I have read a book on a condition similar to what I described, the condition being “chronic suicidality.” However, the book in question mainly focuses on BPD patients who often have impulsivity as core personality traits–yet I myself am anything but impulsive, and I did not even go through a phase of emotional dysregulation in adolescence. In addition, it seems like those described in the book experienced these thoughts and feelings from a couple times a week, to every day–not necessarily ALL day. As such I feel my condition is qualitatively different from that which was described in the book. I would like to hear thoughts from those who relate to my struggles."

Yk like trying your best and it's not enough , a part of why I didn't get to the knowledge is my crazy belief in god and being told always that it's just genetics, so what I need opinions about should I check for a bone age wrist scan (shows how much growth left) but if it's closed idk what I'd do tbh it could go for me to be more suicidal tbh I wouldn't love to live a life with a fcked up part messing with my mind or don't but it's still gonna be fucking up with my mind pretty good

thanks tho"
582,"Obviously we all know the ""I want to stay in bed all day and not do anything"" side of depression. However, recently, I have been feeling like total shit, but not because I want to stay inside and do nothing. Literally the exact opposite. I want to go out, I want to do stuff, but I have nothing to do. None of my friends want to hang out, I don't have the money nor the intel to go to events, not that it would be enough to prevent me from feeling this way anyway

  
It's like spending any amount of time at my home makes me feel absolutely terrible. I've been trying to stay busy but it seems like no matter how busy I stay, the moment I walk back through my front door I feel like shit again. Am I depressed? Or is this something else? Does anyone have any tips for how to combat this? My life has been in a bit of a downward spiral recently (okay, a little more than a bit), and I wouldn't be surprised if it was depression, but obviously I don't have the stereotypical symptoms."
583,"I've been depressed all my life but this year has been by far the worst. Things are supposed to get better for me but I hate having to wait for it. It hurts so much. I feel like such a loser and every single day I cry and I just wish I could stop but I can't. 

I'm a freshman in college and around the beginning of March I suddenly started having issues. I would drive an hour to and from school every single day because I felt so depressed and the thought of sleeping in my dorm away from home made me feel so anxious to just think about. Initially I thought it was just a birth control I had recently been prescribed affecting my hormones and making me feel depressed, and while I had started to feel a little better after being taken off of it and prescribed Sertraline instead, I still feel so broken and sad. 

I'm transferring to a school that I can commute to because the thought of being away from my parents and my dogs and my family just makes me feel so sad like a little kid. I feel like such a loser. I don't know what to do. My mom always says that I'm being too hard on myself because I'm a straight A student and I made the Dean's list at college both semesters thus far but it's like I just can't stop it. I feel like there is an ""evil me"" inside my head that's making me think these awful things. I hate it so much. I can't stop thinking about how much of a loser i am, how stupid I am, how I should just die. I feel like there's no hope. 

I don't have a job right now and I've been diligently applying but out of the handful of places I applied to about two weeks ago, I've gotten two rejection emails and complete radio silence from the rest and every day I'm not DOING SOMETHING ACTIVELY I feel like a failure. I just want to work or do something productive or else I feel like I'm wasting my life. I don't know what's wrong with me. All I want to do is write stories like I used to but every time I try I can't seem to get anything down on the page and I feel like I'm no longer as intelligent as I once was even though I'm only 18. I've been reading a lot of books lately now that the semester is over though... and it makes me feel a little better. 

I don't know. I feel like such a loser."
584,Ever since last year I made some mistakes with my friends and since then I have tried so so hard to make up for it they even lied to everyone else in my school about me now everyone hates me I’m so left out I just want this to end I have to lie to my teachers and my parents that I have friends I wish I never did my mistakes I’ve been cutting my arm for the past few days hoping this all would just end
585,"I (M14) deal with genetic depression, but it's gotten so bad that i've cut out all of my friends and think about killing myself everyday, a few months ago i was in a abusive relationship and at my old school everyone hates me and spreads bad things about me, I feel empty, and cold without any emotion anymore"
586,"I'm struggling with my mental health really badly at the moment. I'm depressed, hate my dead end job, I'm on a high dose of anti depressants and I'm constantly numb or so stressed that my head feels like its going to explode. I also tend to binge drink on weekends to cope.
I want to leave my job because I'm not coping, however mu mother is saying if I do I'd be screwing myself over and 'lots of people hate their jobs'. I work 9-5 busting my ass for minimum wage in an office that treats me shit. I do so much work for them and I go above and beyond yet I get no recognition. I feel ignored and neglected, and whenever I bring it up to my mother she dismisses this by going 'you have to work, everyone hates their job'. 
They've both seen how bad I've been. I was off for 2 months recently because I was in such a bad state due to recent trauma. They're clearly concerned for me but all they think about is i need to 'get past it' and push forward.
I don't know why they cant understand I'm suffering in my own head. I'm in mental anguish.
It doesn't help my resolve to quit and focus on rest and healing for a month or two to be told all of this. I don't know what to do or who to talk to and i feel so lost and confused."
587,Everyday every single hour and second i have death on my mind i don’t know why i just feel my doom coming soon it’s gotten a lot worse this year and problems in my life as in the moment have not been helping me mentally.

589,"Hi, 

I have been to subreddit many times in the past, reading posts, just to see if there are people out there like me. I even made efforts to write something but bailed last minute. Finally giving it a try, idk how it will turn out. 

I am 23M and I have never told my story to anyone before (no one asks for it). I am a person who has been and still is, just scared of being me. I am not sure what ""me"" is, never tried to find out.

Little backstory...
I come from a family of high achievers. My dad has been good at many things academically and other things. He's got his shit figured out. My mother also is very bright, she's a mathematics professor. My father envisioned a perfect son and I failed at every aspect of it, for which he beat me with any object he could find (bare hands if he's feeling spontaneous). He never talked to me about anything outside of academics, which is why once my schooling got over we stopped talking. He also had a job that required him to move around so I never had a place I could call mine. In a hilarious fashion, my father didn't get transferred for the first 14 years of my life, so I have a place to call home early on, but then he transferred to a place where I didn't speak the language as soon as the teenage years began. The teachers and the students picked on me because of that (special shoutout to the chemistry teacher who used to throw my book right at my face). My grades slowly declined and my father made me join 4 different coaching classes, taking up my weekends as well. I thought university would bring some happiness. I managed to make some friends in the dorms, and I lived happily ever after. Jk Covid-19 happened and my uni life was ruined.

Now I'm here, landed an internship a couple months ago. My first ever time working. Quickly was made clear that I didn't learn anything from Uni. And also, I am extremely incompetent due to me just being scared and unsure of everything and lack of communication. One fine day, I dropped to the floor sweating, couldn't breath for around 10 seconds and then it stopped. I thought I was gonna die. That is when I realised I'm tired. I'm tired of pretending. I have no friends, family members don't understand. I haven't felt loved ever. I have no dreams because I never dared to dream. I'm fat because when everyone constantly screams at you, junk food tastes even better. I cry myself to sleep because another day has ended and I'm still here. I act immature and do not know many things. I'm not quick on my feet. People take advantage of me. I am like a servant to people, I've been told I'm funny so I be ""funny guy"" to people I hate because I'm a clown for hire I guess. 

I'm scared. I want to improve and have tried my best. I failed repeatedly. Now I'm hesitant to look up advice because I know I won't follow up. It feels like a setup for failure. My wish, the only one I've ever had, is for someone to help me be better. I've never dreamt beyond that. I just want someone to choose me, to just be with me. I know I'm the only one who can change myself, but is it too much to ask someone to help? 

People left when I opened up to them. So I bottled it all up like a good boy. But I can't do it anymore I fear. I'm writing this for anyone who'll hear me. It's a long ass post, I'm sorry. There's a lot more left. For this post, it's all I have. 

Cheers."
590,(30M) Im so physically and mentally...done. I really dont want to die because im scared to die...but i really really really dont want to be around anymore.

Not sure what to do about it...or if I even want to do anything about it.

i’m also worried about my mental health…i haven’t been off medications for at least a decade so idk how i’m mentally going to react.

my first decrease is this friday down to half and then another week down to a fourth and then another week i’m off. so a fast couple weeks to come down. 

luckily i can get back on right away but i’m so scared. 

have any of y’all had to do this with vilazodone or any other similar antidepressants? 

any tips on how to get through this short period? "

594,"My brain is racing and slow at the same time. I’m feel so cold but I don’t want to get back in bed because I have to get ready for work. I want to work out but I feel like it’s so pointless. I have do my hair and make up but I feel hideous either way so what’s the point? Everything seems so pointless but it hurts because I reallyyy want to be a successful and productive person. But I can’t stop thinking of how many friends I no longer have. How it’s all my fault for not reaching out more, but how it sucks feeling distant and left out when we do hang out. I hate this stage of life it’s so lonely and debilitating and I just feel scared and frozen in time. 

Feeling like you’ll never amount to anything is the most paralyzing thought. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. My chest hurts and I can barely move. Breathing is difficult. They’re right when they say comparison is the thief of joy because I am just so unhappy. I can’t be happy for myself for others. Seeing my almost ex-friends so happy makes me feel so worthless and upset.  I just wish someone wanted me around. I wish I wanted me around. 

Screw body dysmorphia, screw purging disorder, screw my self esteem issues, and anxiety, depression, complex ptsd, and what ever shitty thing I happen to have undiagnosed because I’m terrified of going to see a doctor. Just screw it all. I’m so tired."

Has anyone been through something similar?"
596,"I feel like I'm disappointing everyone in my life. I'm severely depressed and in my last year of hs which im supposed to take seriously but cant seem to grasp anything. I've been failing my classes, mostly dissociating because theres just so much noise in my head making it hard to study too.
My parents are getting a divorce (I'm happy about it), moved out with my mom (my dad is an alcoholic for all of my life and has verbally abused us alot while drunk, then gaslights us when we confront him about it) and he made it hard for us (so bad the police got involved)
i can't even cry about how i feel idky. i go to therapy but i feel like im being dramatic and seeking attention  when i speak about  how i feel so i guess that hasnt been going well. I'm suicidal and think about kms alot but cant bring myself to do anything.
i cant really talk to anyone about how i feel cause again i feel like its no biggy and i dont want to feel like im burdening people with my emotions.

I could never understand how can people manage to attend school and work everyday, then go home, cook a meal, and take a shower, sleep, and then go to work the next day? 

Really? Are you not exhausted? Is there anyone that doesn't feel this way? Or is everybody secretly exhausted but pulling yourself together to go through life? "
599,All that made me enjoy anything is gone. I have nothing to look forward. Nothing that makes me happy. I can't do this anymore 
600,"My grandma passed away when I was 12. I remember when I heard the news my mind went completely numb. I was living abroad at the time and my family and I had to go back to my hometown to attend her funeral, and I just remember thinking “why am I not crying? Why am I not feeling anything at all?” I spent years completely apathetic to the world. I don’t remember feeling joy or sadness. Every emotion that I presented to the world was fabricated. Every moment of it felt like i was faking being human. My mom would call me out often about how I was so cold, how I’d never cry over anything. How I wouldn’t show emotions behind closed doors. To the point where I started questioning if I was a sociopath. I genuinely could not understand how people had emotions. The only thing I could ever feel during that time was anger from time to time. Everything else was foreign. And after years of feeling that way, I no longer understood what it was like to have emotions. Didn’t know what happiness felt like, or sadness or anything but anger. 

It wasn’t until 5-6 years later that I started feeling things again. I remember the relief I felt when I cried for the first time without feeling like it was forced. The relief I felt to feel sadness again, to know I was normal in a way. Every emotion I experienced felt like I could breathe again, even if they weren’t positive emotions. 

But I have found myself missing the numbness recently. I don’t think I have even experienced this level of depression in my life. It’s a different kind than being completely neutral towards life. I have cried everyday for the past two months. Some days are worse than others, when I’m so overly consumed by sadness that I cry the entire day. On the worst days I feel my chest tightening, like I can’t even breathe (I also have anxiety so that makes sense in a way). But I have never felt so intensely sad. It’s not a feeling I’m grateful for anymore. It has been making me feel incredibly desperate. Like I want to crawl out of my own skin, escape my mind. I just want to completely disappear (not that I will, but it’s a feeling I battle everyday). I’m tired of just feeling sad, I could deal with it when I had moments of happiness. But those are so few and far between now that I don’t think it’s worth the trade off of feeling things. I just want to go back to being numb. 

Don’t get me wrong, I remember how suffocating it was to not feel things. But it also protected me from these feelings. And right now I could use protection from my feelings. I feel myself caring less and less about my life every day that goes by. I don’t find joy in anything anymore, even though I’m forcing myself to do things I know I love. I don’t intend of doing anything against myself, but it’s been scary to not care at all if something does happen to me. At least when I was numb it didn’t take as much energy to live my day to day life. But now I just feel drained from everything. It’s honestly just very tiring to feel this much. "
601,"Have been out of 1 of my antidepressants for a couple of days now , mentally I'm just beginning to pay for it.

Well ..started packing a closet that this bottle was in....knew it's been there for months.

I've been sober for quite a few years. Well ..the bottle has been sitting on the counter all day , and my depression has been climbing.

I swear I can hear the bottle actually CALLING ME to come drink it. I'm trying like hell to resist. I really don't want to go down that road again , though I also know it'd give me some temporary relief from this damn depression. 

An escape it you will. I have the reason...just trying like hell to resist actually going through with drinking.

Not looking to discuss this any further....am just venting to the void ."
602,Why do i sleep more when I'm anxious?
603,"What kind of experiences have you guy had with depression/anxiety apps? Also as a non journal'er how useful is it really, and what sort of things would help to write down? Any suggestions would be super useful! "
604,I’ve been crying out for help for so long I just want someone to care. I have a husband a daughter and she’s the only reason I’m still here. Why doesn’t he care why won’t he help 
605,"Am i the issue for being so trustful to people that have repeatedly shown me they dont care and want me gone? Im just such a dumbass. I dont know why i was cursed with this type of brain if everybody just wants to hurt me for having it. I just cant do this anymore, it hurts so much bro. So fucking much. It hurts. I dont know if ill ever be able to have another chance at this life and honestly, i really dont care. This world has been antagonistic as fuck towards me for no reason. They hate me for basically nothing. 

Anybody that says i abused them is lying, and always has been. I havent commited any type of domestic violence in my life. I havent abused any siblings in my life. I dont think people really understand the level of sadism and torture people love to inflict on innocent souls. I will never forgive myself for not going the route the rest of my generation in this city took. I dont know why i feel such a void inside thinking about this. This is the cruelest world that loves what they do to people. 

They love it and relish it, they dont care about anybody else at all. It's just torture for people like me. Just taken advantage of year after year. Nothing but pure pain and torture is all i have ever gotten from this world, my body is the only thing that has ever given me any sort of good feeling. I have nothing and am nothing, just like everybody wanted. I really hope y'all are happy. "
606,"Escitalopram, sertraline, wellbutrin, strattera, now adderall (depression, anxiety, ADHD). Ineffective at best, detrimental at worst. ADHD meds are all physical, and I am still overbearingly absent minded. I've been doing better lately, I think simply because of lessening pressures (in fact yesterday I was relishing in my improvements with immense gratitude), but today I feel borderline suicidal again. The first time in months/ weeks, and for no discernable reason.

I understand medication is not a comprehensive solution, and that a large portion of this is habit-induced/ malleable through self-will. But unfortunately, it appears that in some ways, it isn't. I suspect bipolar disorder.

I'll keep trying to regulate myself and cycling through meds (if my doctor finds that appropriate). And hammering my brain with the rationalizations that arbitrarily/ scarcely take effect on my emotions, because there's no better option. 

Sorry, just a rant, if anybody may relate. But yep. "
607,I am not a survivor. 
608,"My entire life has been hell, parents divorced and both of them lying about eachother to seem like the better one. When my stepmom died I spiralled and nobody helped and just assumed I was okay, hell even teased me about it so I gave up trying for years, dropped out and cut constantly until I finally found someone that actually loved me and for once in my life treated me like a human, problem is she lives in the Netherlands and I live in the US, I have spent months trying to find some form or way to get to her, I've asked relatives, posted in imagration just asking for help and instead of getting it I get bullied. So I give up, I can't do this and I'm feeling even worse every day, for once i felt happy again but of course it never lasts so in a few weeks I'm taking my own life, I can't deal with this world anymore, it gives them takes never letting me be happy. Nothing ever mattered in my life until it did..."
609,"I have an extensive background with depression and have been on basically every med, even the obscure ones and I’m finding nothing but failure. I realize my physical health ties into my mental health so I do want to try to improve it but the only medication that allows me to function and maintain my career is 70mg Vyvanse. It doesn’t make me feel good, I dislike it. But I need it for now. It destroys my appetite though. Even trying to eat early in the morning before I take it, my appetite is zero. 

I’m 33f, 5’7”/170cm and 115lbs/52kgs. I don’t look “too think” but I’m hovering. Whenever a coworker mentions they’re on a diet, even if they are thin, and I say “oh I wish I could make myself do that” they usually laugh at me like “stfu you’re already thin! You’ll float away!” or something. But I’m serious. I’m not healthy, I’m just skinny. It’s not always the same. 

Anyway so it’s hard to get advice. What easy diets are good to start with for depression. "
610,"Throwaway account since I don’t want people I know to see this. 

I started taking Prozac about 5 months ago for depression and thankfully, it has worked wonderfully. But I’m noticing lately the things I used to enjoy doing (before being depressed), I no longer find interesting. I’m not really excited to do anything anymore and everything feels…meh. 

Am I going crazy? Or did I just forget what it feels like to not be depressed?"
611,I look for a hero to save me. In particular: a hero to kill me
612,"So once one admits one has depression, it can take years to recover from it, if not never fully.

Which begs the question, should one even try to be in a romantic relationship with depression ? Or push through the depression ?

Even tho one can find a partner that's willing to stick around, to me it kind of feels like it's at the expanse of someone else, if one doesn't recover from depression.
Like one is inflicting that situation onto someone else."
613,not as attention seeking behaviour but over the last few months I have really stopped trying anymore with 'friends' or anyone because it just feels like nothing is reciprocated. Every time i want to do anything its just not matched in enthusiasm and I always get cancelled on or ignored. its been like this my whole life and I genuinely don't know what to do. I deactivated my accounts and just straight up stopped talking to people but no one even noticed. i've been on the phone a lot with suicide hotlines and stuff but it just seems like nothing can help me anymore. Can someone tell me how I can be seen as more of a person and less of an annoyance?
614,"My dr prescribed me an antidepressant, and sometimes im just like no i dont want to take the medication i just want to die. Why do i not want to get better, even tho i am in so much pain and i just want it to be over, so why cant i just make the effort to get better. Its like i wanna get worse. "
615,"I've had chronic depression for 35 years.  I've been on every medication and done years of intense therapy.  I've had many remissions and wonderful times, but several hospitalizations as well (last one 2018). The isolation of the COVID lockdown triggered a whole new set of mental garbage, and I'm now agoraphobic on top of it all.

I'm no longer willing to do the therapy and work mentally to ""get better"" and leave the house more.  I'm more interested in making my lifestyle and home accommodate my condition for now.  I'm not giving up, but after decades of really doing the mental work for ""improvement"", I need a break.

Can anyone relate?"
616,"I just need to vent 
I was g*r*aped by my own dad during my whole childhood (im 28now) and i go to therapy and everything but the memories are just stucked there i dont go out bc i dont trust people, anyone. Even during my adulthood i got bullied in several jobs, i know im not the best person alive but sometimes i feel like i was born to suffer 
Im unemployed now and I cant pay for my psychiatrist anymore (its way more expensive than therapy), plus i dont either enough money for my medicines i dont want to die but i want to suffer to end 
I Just cant fucking leave my house i really try to “take mental health walks” bc also every wall in my house reminds me to my dad and all the awaful events, Im just in my room all day but its the same room where he did his horrible things. I wish i could just move out but again i dont have the funds. I feel like there is no safe space i have tried to kill myself but when Im about to i think about my pets and i dont to leave them i really want to get better but i wish i could just erase all those memories.

617,"35, single, male   
  
I have officially been off of Wellbutrin and duloxetine for about a month at this point. After three years of being on the lowest dose of Wellbutrin and the going on a year for duloxetine.   
  
I have zero drive to get up other than to go to both of my jobs. I have zero real friends and most of my family is gone. Feeling like a drone going through the motions every day is draining on my soul.   
  
I have no real family that would care if I was gone, nor a friend. I constantly find myself daydreaming about how many people actual would genuinely care if I died.    
  
There has to be more to this world than this. I would not have a child or really any family left behind stuck with. The intrusive thoughts to just take a header off the ben franklin weighs more on me with each passing day.  

If these are genuinely effects of how SSRI, and NSRRI's work in terms of side effects, I recommend doing heaving research before becoming dependent on these drugs for a level of pseudo-happiness with diminishing returns.  I have zero passion for any hobby I use to have.  The cycle is lay in bed, go to work, get back in bed. 

To those of you who do not deal with random thoughts, I envy you."
618,"*At 18, I find myself uncertain about my future. Society feels monotonous and uninspiring, with the same roles being repeated endlessly. I have no desire to engage in a daily routine solely for a paycheck that barely covers basic needs. Yet, I feel as though I'm slowly being pushed toward that reality. It's disheartening to think that a salary defines one's value as a person. Let me clarify: job opportunities often correlate with educational attainment. Ironically, being overqualified can hinder your prospects, as employers may not be able to offer compensation that reflects your true worth. Conversely, those without formal education may struggle to secure jobs or receive lower pay due to their inability to perform at the same level as their more educated counterparts.*"

620,"I think I'm starting to fall into depression. Not completely sure though but I have been getting a bit more emotional distress than usual lately. I don't have a complete understanding with these kinds of things since my country barely talks about it and all I have to go off is through the internet

My grades are dropping, I feel like all I can do is push friends away and stir up trouble, life's just generally been a shitshow lately and I really hate how my thoughts are starting to drift to suicide more and more. At first it was just disappearing off the face of the Earth like yeah I know my way around but I guess I just want to get lost and not see anyone again and possibly accidentally get killed by a car

I've been imagining that lately. At first it was all just jokes like ""can I just kill myself?"" when something cringe happens but now I find myself in situations I second handedly caused. Conflicts between friends makes me feel too many ugly emotions, the possibility of me not going to the next grade, stuff like that. I'm scared

I'm scared of dying and leaving my friends behind. I have an older brother and all those years seeing people say ""I can't let my older siblings bury their younger sibling"" it started to resonate with me in a way I never thought possible. I've told my girlfriend about this, subtly begged her to plead me to stay. I'm just scared that I'll lose control and before I knew it, I'd be gone"

I felt sorry for letting them see such a sight and didn't know how to face them afterwards.

Until recently. I’ve never had this sunken feeling in my chest where i just do not want to do this anymore and im sure about it. But i have a son, and he is the only person whom i cannot do that too. It’s bullshit, why did the courage come after i had a child? So here i am, sitting on my couch watching him play, thinking how he’s quit literally the only person whose life would be drastically affected if i left, and i could never do that to him because he’s just a innocent tiny human who did not ask to be here, and who am i to give him life then decide to abandon him and leave him with unfixable trauma because I’m sad?

626,"I feel so ashamed and i can't calm down. I'm ashamed because of some interactions that i know are going to happen and where i'm going to make a fool of myself. I'm ashamed because i just wasted this morning, this night (didn't sleep and didn't do anything productive), and yesterday too, even though i have so much to do. I'm also ashamed because it's 1pm where i'm from and i can't leave my bed because i feel too awful. I feel so ridiculous for being affected by something so small and freaking out so easily. I wish i wasn't as sensitive and weak. 

Life is so harsh and i feel so lost. I don't know what to do right now. I know this next few weeks are going to be a nightmare for me and i don't want to go trough it. I just want to relax, take my time to do what i need to do, and take care of myself, but it's like life just won't let me. Either that or i wish i could just function like everbody else. I know i should probably be more loving, caring, and understanding towards myself. But it feels impossible when nobody else is. I know i shouldn't be ashamed when i know i'm trying my best. But that won't change that literally everybody else i know will judge me and it's killing me. Now just because of one small inconvenient i'm left feeling helpless and hopeless. I just don't know what to do with myself anymore.

627,"Yesterday I lost the one ray of hope I had. 
TBC, wasn’t diagnosed with chronic depression. I ‘just’ have a tough life. The sadness I feel is a result of that. Recently started therapy. She said ask for help, reach out. I have had a history of people abandoning me during really tough periods. Somehow have pulled through when I thought I couldn’t. It took me a long time to open up. Going through some difficult period again due to external factors.
And yesterday I was abandoned again. Feels like a gut punch. That familiar feeling of the carpet being pulled from under your feet. 
How am supposed to come out of this darkness when I am just ‘too much’ for a friend. I didn’t choose my circumstances. Had the misfortune of being born into this. Now I have to continue going through all this completely alone. 
I know people only want to hang out with “fun” people. I have tried to be fun when it was possible. But I am struggling to keep my head up now. 
Why do therapists even bother to suggest this? When everyone really is a fair weather friend."
628,"I dont like myself rn. It is just sickening. It is just pain that hits you constantly and never seems to stop, it just varies in intensity. In all of my 6-7 years going through whatever this is, I am just asking for one thing now, an end. Over time I have become more greedy, more needy, more aggressive and a lot more things I dont want to become. I am no saint and frankly no one is but is too much for me. Maybe its my mind asking things constantly to compensate for something? Idk

Digging deeper and after some self-reflection,I found a list of things that I wanted. Nothing extraordinary, its some basic stuff I couldnt have. I wanted long-term friends and relationships, I wanted affection but not when I asked for it, I wanted people to think of me, I wanted people who i can be there for and them for me, I wanted to never be alone, I wanted a tight-nit friend group to play online multiplayer games with and then later meet them offline, I wanted a life-long partner, I wanted to be a father to daughters, I wanted pet(s), I wanted to do stuff with no fear of messing them up, I wanted a lot of things that would satisfy my inner-child and the adult me i dont want them anymore. All i want is an end. I tried to work and fix things, it helped a bit and then it stopped for a bit but then it comes back again. Got on meds, They helped a bit aswell but in the end they just helped to mask the pain and suffering to the outside world. It all stayed inside, but right now, I can feel the mask crack bit by bit and i cant help it all. 

I dont know who to blame for this? I guess mostly the world and people in it? A lot has happened in the past which led to destroy most of my trust in people. They talk over me, disregard my opinion, boycott me and cast me aside like trash. Only to remember or called when they need something and after that, ignored. I am the person who they call to fill in spots. The substitute. The expendable. The ugly and fat one in the group. The dumb stupid one.  I guess its who i am and the cards I have been dealt with. I am M24, 6ft3 guy who started balding in his late teens whose voice doesnt match their body. I think people think that am i creep or a pervert based on my looks i guess. I am no pervert or a creep yet i have been called them on couple of occasions. 

I am clinging on small threads of life that im too scared to let go. I dont know why i am scared. I am a coward. I should just commit and end it. I am one up fucked up day away of ending it and the bar of 'fucked up' is dropping day by day and i am glad for it."
629,"I’m 20, drinking age is 18 here. All my friends and everyone I grew up with just go out to bars and party and hook up and all that. Is it bad I just feel disgusting thinking about doing that stuff with them?


I don’t mind going to the bar once and a while, but all I’m hearing is about who hooked up with who, who is attractive vs who isn’t, I just feel gross about it all.

The social aspect is the part for me, I don’t think I have fun when I go out, I don’t really like drinking but I feel like it’s the only way I can meet people and all that.

It just stresses me out, I feel like everyone my age is out doing this stuff all the time, meanwhile I’d rather be home alone. Makes me feel like my life is paused, not to mention all this sexual stuff going on at these places. I just got out of a break up and honestly don’t even want to think about even flirting with someone. But the thing is I’m not happy staying home by myself, but I feel so much better when I can just be myself by myself. 

This is more of a rant, but is anyone else like this? 
"
630,"I’ve fallen out of touch with my friends. They don’t keep up contact and I was always the one to initiate. “Surprisingly” when I stopped, so did they. I now work from home and run my own business, so no more colleagues to get close with.

I’m turning 30 on Friday and I’m celebrating with my parents and brother. Which is nice. It’s fine. But I wish I had a group of friends I could go out with. People my own age, who aren’t “obligation” to party with. As it is, my brother has already made it seem like showing up and spending a few hours is just too much. I know my parents don’t feel that way. My mom wants to do more and I feel bad that I want to do things, just not with her, ya know? Like, I love spending time with her but I wish I had real friends my age still.

To be 30 and no friends is…depressing. I thought I’d have more people in my “village” by now but I don’t."
631,"I fucked it all up. I've been desperately trying to fix things but she will never let me. I can't even blame her for that. I can't go on like this. Why can't I let her go? Why can't I let someone else into my life? I'm so lonely, yet I keep cutting people off, keep refusing to move on. It's consuming me at horrifying speed and I'm terrified of how will it end."
632,"I feel so fatigued all the time and in pain. there’s nothing wrong with me physically as I went to a check up a few months ago. Just depression. There’s like a constant aching in my chest and the urge to curl up and lay down. I can’t find a job near me. My parents have health conditions but are managing them well. But I’m afraid for them. My parents aren’t married and my mom lost her health insurance after she got laid off. My dad’s supporting us but I can’t stand being around him as he’s constantly making sexist comments about my mom’s weight (she has arthritis and it’s hard to exercise) and mine as well and I’m in the average weight for my height. It’s selfish but I can’t break out of my fatigue or depression. All I can bring myself to do is my homework, try jog a mile twice a week, and rot. I’ve been crying at least once a week as I feel like a failure and I can’t sleep at night. I’m afraid of driving because I can’t sleep. And the public transportation literally takes 2 hrs for maybe a 30 minute drive. I’ve applied to every job near me and haven’t been hearing anything.  I want to help and be independent but I can barely clean my room. I have a therapist and progress has been slow. I know I’ll probably be worse off without therapy but I’m not doing much.

633,I’ve been on an ssri for a very long time and take adderall for adhd and that’s the only time when I feel somewhat happy and then it goes back to just feeling like God through me into this world with no plan. Feels like something’s always gotta give 
634,"Hi!

It’s hard to explain and probably hard for people to understand. I’ve dealt with depression for a long time and have gone through constant ups and downs. 

Right now I’m going through some kind of something. I don’t feel depressed like I have in the past. But I am constantly just sad, I feel like I could cry at any minute and there have been periods of time where I do just break down in tears and in most cases it is random. 

I do go to therapy and am on medication which I am working on constantly getting it tweaked. My therapist says that there is always a reason behind the tears, which sometimes I don’t believe she is right because sometimes nothing has to happen or I don’t even have to have a thought for the tears to start. 

I was talking to a friend about what’s been happening and he suggested that maybe after all I’ve been through the past few years, while I’ve been mentally working through it…. My body is finally coming out of survival mode. I’m finally in a good space mentally so I’m relaxing. And my body is catching up and processing and that is what is happening. I talked to my therapist about this and she didn’t understand and said the idea is ridiculous. 

But is this idea a possibility?"
635,"Im 27 male. Everyday the pain from my current situation is getting worse and worse, i feel more numb. I dont wanna kill myself but its starting to feel like my only option.

But i cant because i dont have a car and no job within walking distance, and no public transportation offered in my small town. To make matters worse im not gonna be able to pay my internet bill this month which is my only form of entertainment and how i contact anyone. Ive been searching for jobs online or online hustles with no luck. Im scared to tell the people around me how i feel. I dont wanna be hospitalized. Theres no form of medication or therapy that can fix my situation. I need a miracle but i feel as if im gonna run out of time. "
636,"Hi everyone,

I’m a medical student and I’ve taken a total of 3 years off so far due to depression, complicated family circumstances, and financial hardship. I'm currently working on getting better — therapy, treatment, self-care — and I’m planning to take two more years to really stabilize before tackling our national exams (allowing us to have access to residency). Sooo a total of 5 years. It’s helping — slowly — but I still feel this deep shame and loneliness. Not because med school is hard (we all know it is), but because of the *long pause*. I don't see many people with similar paths, and it's easy to feel like I'm falling behind in life or failing somehow.

Has anyone else had to take extended breaks during uni (or med school specifically)? How did you handle the shame, the fear of being “too late,” the feeling of being out of sync with your peers?

I’d love to hear your stories or just know I’m not alone."
637,"I am a free counselor and I strive for less lonely people in this world.

How would you show someone in trouble that you care for them today?"
638,"This is only my second therapist but it's been nearly a year and they're supposed to be specialized in helping people in my situation, but I feel like I've emptied myself and gotten nothing in return. It seems that I'm terrible at being a patient. 

I started antidepressants that are now in effect, but what little will I had to live has vanished. I haven't been to therapy in a while and probably won't return unless there's a dramatic shift internally.

I don't remember my past and am just a shell of misery, it makes me feel incurable. I live for my mom and brother but i'm wearing thin."
639,"Hello guys, I'm just here to vent a little with a bunch of strangers who won't think I'm pathetic for caving into the pressure, unlike myself.

I've got a huge backstory and lots of luggage, so why not give it all a big push, and spit it all out, nobody even cares about it lol.

Hey there, my name is Ben (fake name for anonymity), I'm 18, about to turn 19, and I currently live in Mexico, as I have lived there most of my life. This all begins with the premise of a few couple core ideas, values, and principles I've had for ages now:
 1-If something goes wrong it's on you, because you somehow had a say on it, no matter how small, you could've done something about it
 2 -You're all on your own, nobody will ever care for you as much as you can care for yourself. Nobody will care if you've eaten, gotten any sleep, if you're feeling amazing, or feeling like a turd that belongs at the depths of the filthiest sewer

With that said, my luggage begging somewhere around October and December of the year 2020 (5 year luggage is crazy). It was just at the beginning of the pandemic, and I got sent to a new school, where I knew nobody, and I was a liner for almost three months. But then comes this girl, whom I met because of one single class we had in common. She was into the same stuff as me, and I got along so well with her, up to the point where she was my only social interaction, since all my friends were too far away, and I was living with my grandma at the time, who never even cared about me. She slowly became my world, my everything, and I developed feelings for her in a wild way, I had never experienced before. Then she stopped answering. Hours of waiting between replies turned into days. Then weeks. Then months. It hurt me and I dare say traumatized me so horribly, and now I feel like everyone puts up with me just to not be an ass. And I blame myself, because I feel like I could've done something about it. I could've pushed harder to know what was up, or why she was being such an ass to me, or maybe she had some issues I could've been there for.
But that same year, during January, my dad got fired, he's a Quality Engineer, and he's a control freak, obsessed with being able to see me and control my every move an action at any given time, just because he's a megalomaniac. He made the house become a constant source of screaming, stress, and hate. I can still feel the pressure of him lingering around when he's near. It made me become mentally unstable, and crumbled what little self esteem I had, since he was always talking shit about me when we were alone, but if another family member came he would praise us and speak so grateful of us hypocritically.

Then after that, I managed to get away from him, since he and my sister returned to our hometown, and I stayed to live with my grandmother. I felt free, happy, for once in almost a whole year, and once we got back to school, I started skipping classes, enjoying my freedom, nobody questioning me and breathing on my neck. But consequences came, and I failed the semester, and had to wait another one to go back. I feared losing my freedom again, so I lied. I made everyone think I was getting straight As for almost 10 months, in which I barely spoke with anyone. The guilt rotted my insides, and the loneliness that came with not being surrounded by anyone made it even worse. There were full days that I didn't speak a word, since there was nobody to hear it. Even weeks. I developed the habit to speak to myself, as if not to descend into madness like a post apocalyptic survivor. It made me hate my guts so bad. And then they found out, and cut my freedom. I had to restart high school, and it felt horrible.

But I was determined to keep moving on, amd enrolled in a new school, where I became the top performance student, but my social live was still somewhat dead, since I had a position of authority to keep everyone else in check, and therefore around half the school hated my guts. But I pressed forward, for a year, and I almost thought I was finally happy, on track. Then we had to move out again. I could've stayed, with friends and family, to continue my studies, but because of my little stunt last year, I wasn't allowed to. Because of my fuck ups.

Then almost two years ago I got to this new school, having a constant reminder of me being behind two years because of my fuck ups, noticing how everyone around me were pretty much kids. But I pressed forward, I met lots of people, and ruined relationships with them because I was too naive, too dumb, too coward, and overall not enough. I am ever enough. I am never where I'm meant to be. I'm always away from the right thing. No.matter what I do, or how hard I try, it's the same shit all the time. I'm about to finally graduate high school, but a girl came into my life almost 6 months ago, and fucked me up real bad. It hurt my straight As grades real bad, and I'm in danger of failing. Again. Like the failure I am. I can't get anything right ever. I just don't wanna keep going, I'm not sure if I say this in a suicidal way, or in a ""just curl up in the basement and rot there"" kind of way. I've pressed on for years, and endured ahit nobody should ever endure, and things I would never wish to my worst foe. I don't know how much I can keep going. I don't know if I even can keep going. I don't even want to anymore. I just wanna lay down, and cry, ask for help, cry my tears, pains, and sorrows out for hours, or even days. But I can't. Because if you can't do your own shit you're a failure. Crying over your own faults means you're a failure, a mediocre person who will never amount to nothing. I'm drowning, and I can't ask for help because if I do, I'll sink to the bottom of the ocean even faster. I can only vent to random online forums on the internet.

It's all my fault. I'm the problem who hides all across the stuff in my life, and worst of all, I'm a victim of my own actions. There is nobody to blame but myself, no matter how hard I try, or how much I seek to blame anyone else. Maybe I'm pathetic, and a crybaby for coming in here, and stating my problems in a subreddit where people with real disorders come and seek help, nothing like me, who just can't stand his own shit, but I need to get thus out. I just can't anymore. Four years of fighting had left me with nothing else than sorrow and tiredness."
640,"my brother got below 33 in maths and science but the cbse replaced maths with information technology. So now maths is an additional subject.

so he only has to give one compartment exam that is science. Right??? I'm freaking out. I can't think straight.

what can i do to help him???? 
Home environment is tense. I feel really anxious.

i have no idea where to ask for advice. So please help me out guys!"
641,completely miserable and like Ive lost interest in almost everything I just want to disappear Im ashamed of myself every time I try to show up or be seen I remember that Im just a disgrace and a heavy burden Ive always been looked at that way my whole life with disgust at school in the street at home everywhere I just feel sorry for even existing all I do is live a miserable life full of pain and abuse sometimes I wonder why I cant just die an honorable death and free myself from all this humiliation I am just weird ugly freak I wish I could just die 
642,I honestly doubt people will respond but I need to vent. My ex told me she started seeing someone but we broke up because she was starting school in Germany and didn’t want me to wait which hurt because I helped her get her job in the Netherlands she is originally from Indonesia and I helped her sister pass her English test by taking it so she could  a job  and I also took her to Paris because she always wanted to go I feel used and I’ve been depressed because she got me through a rough time and now she put me back right where I was 
643,"i have high functioning depression and it's made my life hell. i am on the road to recovery (therapy, medication etc) but whenever the sad feeling sets in again i deliberately watch depressing content and listen to depressing music which makes my mood worse but i can't help it because it feels like the home i've finally found, the only thing that understand me even though it's ironically destroying my life😓 i feel crazy for wanting to get better yet not wanting to"
644,Just feeling awful and worthless. Can't stand myself. Nothing is going well. Want to cry but I can't. 
645,"“I love you, I’m proud of you.”
Those words — I’ve chased them my entire life.
I haven’t earned them yet, but I hope I will someday.

For anyone who needs it:
I love you, and I’m proud of you.
"
646,"simply put has anybody here found any useful strategy’s for dealing with their depression?
i’m sick of feeling like this so frequently and i’m especially sick of what it’s doing to my friendships."
647,"I wake up most days and nothing in the world seems to be able to make me happy. Not a partner, not a friend, not music, not gaming, not walking, not working out, not reading, not watching a movie, not working, not taking care of my garden, not talking to a family member, not porn, nothing. Im completely apathetic, I dont care about anything, I dont have any dreams or ambitions, im not creative, I have chronic pain, I dont believe in anything, im not spiritual, Im nothing, I live for absolutely nothing.

  
Im on cymbalta, wellbutrin and seroquel, I get extremely suicidal at night and without the seroquel I dont think I would be here writing this, I have been on multiple antidepressants and they seem to do absolutely nothing, like, seriously, nothing, no side effects either, its like the pills are coming out whole out my ass, not processed at all.



Someone please tell me what to do, I'm 19, when I see normal happy people I get a mixed feeling of vomiting (anger) and jealousness which makes me tear up sometimes, I don't understand why my brain is wired up like this."
648,"I'm sorry that I don't live up to the expectations of my loved ones, that I'm an unmotivated jerk who does nothing but whine about his life. I'm just waiting. Waiting for the end. That i'm falling into that hole again. Depression is burning me alive. Even pills don't make me feel decent."
649,I’m too coward 
650,"I have no clue what I have done in this life, or my past ones, to deserve all this shit, but I hope this life evens out the bad karma for my next lives. 


This week has been absolute hell. A textbook-record-breaking week really. I was told from work I wasn't ""needed"" last week so I was down $300 on all my bills. This then forces my already spread thin boyfriend to work extra hours at his work place. We then couldng afford grocieries. We live paycheck to paycheck. So my friends fed me for two days and my boyfriend went to his parents while i was away. 

Yesterday I decided ""life is rough. But i could go out and garden"" and found my utility wagon was stolen. I am physically disabled and this wagon was my only source of independence in my garden. It allowed me to haul heavy things that would otherwise make me have to wait for someone to have free time to help me lug things.

Today I go to work and I'm treated like a bug on the wall. I might as well not have been there. I sat there listening to them gab about how much they've been working since I wasn't there and haven't had a day off in three weeks. Just bought this and that, while hauling off a $62 vape.. while my boyfriend and I went to one meal a day because we couldn't afford food.. I just.. whatever the hell I've done to deserve anything I have been given in this life.. God I hope the next me is given everything they deserve."
651,Please
652,"I don't know how much longer it's going to take for that bullshit fucking lie you always hear:

It'll get better.

When? Fucking when? I've battled with feelings of hating myself and fighting off dark thoughts since I was a preteen. I had to grow up tough instead of a kid. Add to that the last 5 years of my life. I'm trying to keep it together, but I'm having a hard time if it. I moved to a new place because I had to. Which means I had to leave my daughter behind, who was with me 85% of the time. I hurt someone before the move because I was getting too close and I didn't like it. I'm in a place where you need a car to get around and I don't have one, so I go to work and then go home and pretty much just wait to go to work. 

Life is meaningless. The people and things I cared about are nowhere near me. I don't see the point to life. "
653,I feel so alone and overwhelmed at times. Education. Career. Entertainment. Health. Expectations. Future. Dreams. Money. Friends. Family. The list goes on. All these decisions and choices I'm nowhere even nearly mature enough for and constantly fear that I'll end up regretting. I see these people somehow juggling everything without a single hint of worry and not sacrificing sleep. Then why am I the one struggling? It's not like I'm not trying or they're straight up better. There's a thousand things on my mind I can't word rn. Just *how* are you supposed to do it all? 
654,"I'm in my early 30s, lost my job a bit over 2 years ago due to factors unrelated to me. I can't find a full time job now and barely scrape by every month. I'm unattractive, overweight, no personality. Can barely make myself do the things I need to do, can't make myself do things I want to do. Never been in a relationship, probably never will be. 

It was easier to accept hating myself when life was stable but now that it's gone, every day feels impossible. I'm a failure and a loser. "
655,I don’t want to burden people or anything I’m just feeling really mediocre. Would anyone like to chat? It could be about something random. 
656,"I've been depressed for years and always having a hope to get a new start but now I think it's too late. I can't tell all of my story because it's too complex and I'm not that good to write all of that in english since it's my second language.

I've been depressed for years and having to see the world only from my phone and without actually experiencing it. The depression made me having no energy to enjoy life and then I got more depressed knowing that I wasted all of life not enjoying life.

But the thing is all this years I always had  hopes for a new start, but now I think it's too late. I've been watching people having fun and hoping that one day I'd experience that but now I think it's too late. People would move on and I'd still gonna try to relive the live I've been dreaming all this years.

It feels like when a child looking at their friends playing but he can't cause his mom said no to him, but when the mother finally let him, his friends already gone. Or when you finally able to play a game you've been saving your for, but when you finally able to buy, no one would play it with you.

And I know I shouldn't compare myself with others but I don't want to experience something because other people doing it, I want to experience because I got interested of it and I actually liked it for myself. Like I didn't just a buy new video game because I saw someone playing it, but I bought it because I saw someone playing it and I think it looked so fun.

I haven't even watched a movie that I've been planning to see from 2 years ago, I didn't just want to watch it just because it was popular but I actually liked it but I haven't even after 2 years because of my depression, it's holding me back to do something that I actually enjoy, not to mention to do something that productive.

It feels so hard when you trying to experience something that you dreamed it all these years and then knowing that it's too late and the world already moved on without you."
657,How do I get motivated? Just for a little bit.. to get shit done.
658,"Hey everyone,  
I'm not in any danger or anything, but it's one of those days where everything feels heavy and hard. I know it’ll pass, but right now it’s hard to see that. If anyone has a few kind words or advice that helps them get through, I’d be really grateful to hear it. Just looking for a bit of light today."
659,"Tired of waking up, working, house chores, cooking, eating, talking to people
I am 24 and I am already sick of life"
660,"Hey, I'm 25, male, and struggle with depression and emotions. Can't exactly explain what I'm feeling but wanted to see what others could think and how do they manage with this. 

To be fair I have been depressed my whole life, struggled as a child due to being bullied or having all sort of family issues. My family doesnt really like me and I don't get along with them very well. 

Now that I'm 25 my depression and feeling of emptiness has been growing, being sucidal does not help either as these thoughts have been pushing forward as well. 

I thought getting into relationships would make things slightly better but, I feel like I do not know what love is or how to love, so I had to break things off most of the time. 

There is also the fact that I feel like life has no meaning and nothing intrests me, I try to get into things or into shape even, not that I'm in bad one, still quite good looking (from what people tell me at least),  although If I have to be honest I hate myself and how I look. Point is I lose interest in everything that I do. My job, my friendships and relationships, games, books etc. 

I have triee seeking professional help but I feel like it did nothing for me. I'm even taking pills but I feel like there is no progress at all. Been doing so for years, that is to be kept in mind. 

So how does one deal with the unwillingness to live, the disinterest in everything and the incapability to love while wishing they could do all, be normal? 

Sorry for the messy text and thank you for time. "
661,"I'm finally ready to reconnect with the world after isolating myself over a pretty rough bout of depression this winter. Having done this many times before, it's getting harder to do this apology tour to close friends and family: explaining how, despite ignoring their calls and messages for weeks or months at a time, I still love them tremendously. And although they usually understand, the words seem to grow more and more hollow every time I have this same talk. And a part of me knows that it's probably only a matter of time before I do the same thing again, so making any promises or expectations that this time it'll be different feels fake. It feels like my closest relationships deteriorate a bit more every time I do this. But nurturing these relationships helps with my depression - a lot.

Can anyone offer some tips or perspective on how to best approach this process of reconnecting without the self-damning for how terrible a friend or family member I've been, or the false promises that now everything will be fine? Or am I simply overthinking, just like my depression wants me to?

And how do you go about this with people who might not be so understanding as your close friends and family - your business network, acquaintances, etc.? People who can help change your circumstances, but don't have the same personal attachment or affection for you?

  
Thanks for any thoughts - everything is appreciated."
662,"I've never posted on Reddit before and I have no friends to talk about this with, but I've always grown too attached to fictional characters be it anime/comics/novels etc. If a character especially female characters are killed off or unable to achieve a happy ending I get knots in my stomach, my body sweats and it almost feels like when your breaking up with a partner. I'm sure it sounds stupid, but I'll go days/weeks unable to process or handle the emotions I can't explain, I'm not a child either, well into my late 20's and I still have these problems whenever a character is killed, it damages my work ethic and just my day to day feelings, does anyone else feel this way or even have any general thoughts on this? Thanks"
663,"Ok so I’m deeply unhappy in my life rn. Im fucking miserable and I was drinking to cope.
But I decided to quit booze and try to look after myself.
I eat healthy, make sure I’m getting enough nutrients. I exercise regularly. I try to stay hydrated. I don’t sleep well ok so theres that. But the rest should do…something right?
Nope, I’m still miserable as fuck.
I constantly faced with the reasons why I drank and it’s all I can do to resist going back to the bottle.
 
This post doesnt really have a point lol. I guess trying to “be better” doesnt fucking do anything if the underlying reasons for being depressed are still there. "
664,What should i do instead 
665,"I'm 18 and abt to graduate from an early college program, in theory. About 3(?) weeks ago now I tried to take my life, and up to that point I really dropped out of life. I passed all my classes but one, and the whole time I made sure I would finish all I needed to do incase I survived. well, I did, and turns out I still forgot some very important stuff. 

throughout the year every student has to do pretty easy things outside of classes, like goal setting and attending educational events. Seniors have to do even more. I completely checked out of this stuff, I was genuinely not thinking about any of it. you need to do at least 75 percent of it to pass, and I didn't do that. I am hoping that my counselor let's me make it up, especially since most of the stuff is simple tasks like sending a ss of our fafsa confirmation email.

I was accepted into a major uni. I am searching for roommates. I am so ready to be able to move out of my incredibly toxic home environment and live. like just live. my counselor has the power to take all of that away from me. I'm not sure what I would even do if she does. "
666,"I have done a lot of bad things in my life and i am trying to become a better person but the weight keeps piling up and i break down at night when everyone is asleep. I have thought about exactly how i would do it  the cold feeling of a barrel on my temple and the squeeze of the trigger, but then all i can think about is what it would do to my family and i am lost. I cant stop thinking about it no matter what i do anytime i am alone the thoughts start to pile up. I have even planned to make a video for my son for when im gone but every time i think about doing it i just break down and start telling myself i cant leave him. any advice would be appreciated i feel like im drowning."
667,Every day I consider killing myself. Every time I feel an ounce of joy it gets robbed from me shortly after. What's the point of living if I don't find the joy anymore. All I do is upset my Significant other and ruin her life more. Why should I be here if all I do is ruin everything.
668,"I feel really overwhelmed. I want my life to move in a direction. And its hard to stay committed when i keep thinking of suicide. I also feel really alone in this and that i cant do it. But i want to try. And the thing everyone needs is money. I cant get therapy or medication for my illnesses if i dont have a job. The thing is, i have trouble moving so a traditional 9-5 or a physical job is harder to obtain and maintain. Everything is so big. The world feels too big. How do i begin?"
669,"My social worker and my family had a heated discussion about my needs and my family are clearly not right here, expressing bad behavior and we are gonna call again today and meet in person tomorrow. I am disabled and nervous about how much I can advocate for myself and scared it will be emotional again. Being depressed and isolated, I am not taking it well. At least my social worker and my tharepist are on my side."
670,"I occasionally make the mistake of looking back at high school photos and missing the person I used to be and hating the person I have become. Mentally and physically but it’s physically that’s been bothering me lately. I’m 24 F and yeah, I know that’s technically not that young but I’m a glass half empty kinda person and look at my age now as “I’m already 24” rather than “I’m only 24”. I have sever anxiety over the, idk how to say, passing of time, the effects of aging? I reallyy hate watching my body age. And I am terrified to see what my body looks like at 30, 40, 50 and so on. I also really struggle to accept that the past is the past. I’m also one of those people that didn’t plan to make it past 18 so I have no damn idea what to do with my life and am scared of figuring out how to continue supporting my self and live a productive life which I have no desire to actually do. Lastly, I heavily dwell on past events and refuse to accept the fact that parts of my life are over and will never happen ever again, if that makes sense. Idk man perhaps I’m crazy.? Can anyone understand this?
Good night for now."
671,"How do people manage to do day in day out activities when depressed and they barely even want to live. I mean how the hell do even explain to people why you don’t want to get out of bed to do the most basic things like bath, the gym, the hobbies you used to like. It always comes off as just lazy and wanting and excuse at this point I’m confused on wether that is the case "

I (13F) am currently in Year 8 and have come to so many shocking discoveries about my own friendships that make me want to gag. For the past year I've been considering whether I have been depressed and overall have had a hard time. My current story goes all the way back to when I was 10. When I was in primary school, I had a friends group of 5. I'll call them 1, 2, 3 and 4. I thought that I was 1's bestfriend and would hangout and laugh and was the closest to her out of everyone. 2 and 3 were close but also were close to 1. When I was 10, friend 3 started showing signs of struggling with food and possibly depression. It was brought up to the teacher and I didn't play a large part in this but friend 2 and 1 did. They said that 3 didn't want us to know anything and it made me and 4 feel very left out. But we both understood it was because of privacy. But overall my year wasn't bad but the next year it was my last year in primary school. This was when everything went down hill. It is so much that I don't think I could cover it all in here but first I will go through the friendship Saga.

So this is composed up of firstly something that was my fault. While being dumb kids with hotglue guns on a project, I got glue on my finger and burnt myself and my 11year old brain's first reaction was to get it off so I accidentally got it on friend 1 clothing and she got really mad. I told her I would pay for it and I was terrified she would get me into trouble because I was a straight A, perfect child. When this happended I tried to help get the glue off but it would come off so it just looked like I smeared it around. She told me she was devastated and that her mum would kill her and that she didn't want to be cold because winter was coming even though she had a jacket still.  Friend 1 ran to friend 2 and told her everything and everyone i would talk to them they wouldn't say anything and would whisper. And in the end I got it trouble because she reported it and the teacher GENIUELY asked my bawling 145cm kid would couldn't speaking in full sentences and all she could say was sorry because she was so terrified of being a disappointment and scared of adult figures in her life, ""Are you sure you didn't do it on purpose because it looks like you did. Don't lie to me. "" at the time I thought it was wierd but normal but now looking back I don't know how a teacher could possibly say that to a kid who was crying so hard she could barely breath and I sat for an hour crying my hours in a air conditioned room as a group of possibly 6- 9 teachers had a fucking meeting and they didn't blink and eye. Only once did a single teacher, my own, ask if I wanted a tissue. So all they did was walk pass me and stared weirdly as a sat on the floor between two desks and stared at the walk and my sleeve as I had what I can possible describe as a panic attack, I was crying so much I couldn't breath and thought the room was going to collapse into me. And then after the hour passed. They walked me into the fucking room where my entire class was while I was bawling my eyes out and made me stand their while they went to grab papers so I JUST HAD TO CONVICE ME MY ANXIETY ADDLED BRAIN THAT NOT EVERYONE WSS STARING AT ME LIKE I KILLED SOMEONE. And the day afterward my friend 1 asked me, ""we're all good right? Were still friends and I only did it for my own good and yours too. "" while I was shaking walking into the school ground because it felt like everyone was staring daggers because I accidentally got glue on someone clothes. I proceeded to say yes and pay for her new jumper. I got in trouble and had to go to detention and as a straight A perfect kids first time in detention of any sort be because of their bestfriend shattered me. And their official reasoning for me getting in trouble was not damaging her property but using the hotglue gun without teacher supervision and permission but the entire class was and the teacher which was a sub didn't care enough and was on her phone the entire time. And then for a week I had to tell everyone I met including teachers, substitutes, friends that I had gotten in trouble. And for everyone information I was in a ""gifted class"" this class is something that everyone in it had studied for 3 years straight to join just because it could possible add to the possibility of joining a good high school. This means that all of these kids were not just smart but most were the type of kids Whoese parents would kill them and disown them if they got less than a 85 percent and it wouldn't be a question if they we're going to be in trouble if they made a mistake like mine it would be the question of when they are going to be disowned. So for a week my good two shoes mind thought everyone was judging me and gossiped about me behind my back. And not one throughout this whole situation did my friend ask if my burnt fingers was fine even though I hurt so bad I peeled the first layer of skin off of it. The teacher only asked once if it was fine and then left me to cry my eyes out.
so for a summary my bestfriend got me into the worse trouble I've ever gotten in because she didn't want to be cold in the winter after I told her I would pay for a new one and then the teachers thought I was a liar and I possibly had my first pain attack ever and then cried my eyes and got publicly embarrrsed for like a week and no one once cared about me burning my finger 🎉 

Okay part 2 is an incident about a project also in class when I was 11 - we were filming a video and 1 and 2 were arguing about something and I tried to tell them to stop and that we were running out of time to find a good solution and finish filming and then they stopped talking to me for the whole day. And even after we finished filming my teacher had brought in her dog because it would be fun to meet him and we got to pet him and everything and through it all they were whispering behind my back and EVERYTIME I would say anything like ""isn't the dog so cute "" or ""what r u talking about"" they would go quiet or say okay. I knew they were talking behind my back and later at home they told me and friend number 3 that we were bad friends. They said that I was mediating and telling them not to argue without providing a answer even though I did so because I wanted to try get all of us into a conversation about a solution without arguing and yelling. They then told me that I had the easier job (I the main character of the actors in the video) and that I was criticizing her when my job was the easiest even though they made me do it in the rain with short sleeves and then said that I couldn't retry even if I was embarrassed and that they would only do one take even if it was reallly bad. When it was her turn to act she said that I had to take multiple and then told me that me laughing silently was very rude even though that was what everyone else was doing in every shot I did. She then told Friend 3 that she was a bad script writer. Friend 1 got pissed because she said she had to spend so much time on the script but when we helped she would change it all because it was a story she had written (it was based on a narrative she had written). Friend three was often away struggling with her mental health and wanted to help with the project and so she offered to write another person ( I'll call her 5) part. When she did they said that person 5 had time and that she was just complaining and that person 5 was a liarer and she should have made person 5 write it. And then she said that she had to improvise the whole thing and I should have been laughing because I had a script and she didn't but she did. She just didn't like the script. And the entire time she would attack me by saying oh I think that your not apriciative of me and stuff and then get mad at me for things and then afterwards say oh I just want you to become a better person. After this I was convinced that I was the problem so much that I was terrified to bring up any problems I had even after I didn't entirely get over this and a term later I brought it up and told them how I felt and friend 3 did aswell and then they said that that was so long ago and I held grudges and even though it was mostly about friend 1 she didn't even respond once. She didn't text a single word but instead friend 2 defended her and this would happen most times were friend 1 wouldn't bring anything up except like bad stuff and then say that she wanted me to be a better friend and person and then make friend 2 defend her while she just said oh I hope that you can become a better person because of this. And I felt like she was walking around the problem and ignoring it. And when we finally apologized we all said something that we learnt and said sorry but not once did friend 1 say sorry to me and EVERYTIME I said sorry to anyone she would add onto it and tell me that she hoped I was also sorry or learnt this because it was important so it would be like ""I'm sorry for making you feel bad and not giving a solution"" and then she would say ""and to appreciate other because I don't feel appreciated tbh"" and then I felt like she always wanted me to apologize more and comprise because I was wasn't good enough or sorry enough for her. And when she apologized she said sorry to friend 3 which I defended because I though she didn't deserve it and because I was friends woth her and I was waiting to see if she would say sorry to me and she never did and I apologized LIEK 3 times and each time she said thank you or just gave me a thumbs up and didn't apologize for her part. 👍

So through out my 2 years of yr 5 and 6 I felt trapped and unappreciated and like my bestfriend was plotting against me or something but to scared to leave the friend group because I had moved to a new school so I had no one else to go to. EVERYTIME she would bring up a new problem I would apologize and compromise and when ever I tried to tell her how I felt she would spin my words into her feeling bad and then friend 2 would defend her and I would have to compromise and push down all my problems and thy would tell me I held grudges and tell me that they want the best for me and want my future friends to have the best me too. (I lost a lot of tears this year both in public and in my toilet ) it came to the point I thought every part of me was wrong and that if bestfriend 1 told me something I had to just accept that I was incorrect and even convinced myself I was a gaslighter who victimized myself and even from the first week to the last week of school in primary school 
 My friendship felt wierd and off and I was convinced that I was wrong.  They would also blame me when I didn't know something. Friend 2 once told me that I was a bad friend because I didn't know that friend 3 got her period because I wasn't online. 📲

That's is the most of the mainly friend ship drama when I was 11 but there was also another saga which I will call saga 3 because it was mostly about friend 3 and her mental health. So friend 3 when I was 10 had promblems with food and friend 5 told me that she thinks that she had body image problems but as a kid I didn't really know much about MH. I didn't really understand but in ye 6 it got worse with her tell us about scary situations with her parents like when they broke down her door with a brick to take her phone and then sleeping with her mirror as her door and sleeping on the floor because she was moving and the mirror falling in her. And then she would start skiping school and she had insomnia and could sleep and would fall asleep in class. So in yr6 there was a test you could take which could give u a chance to get into a better high school and since we were all in the gifted class we specifically went into this class for this highschool test. And every kid in this class was under so much pressure that normal adults would break under with the weeks before the test doing non stop testing with tutoring centers doing full week long tests with 6 hours a day for everyday during the holidays. It became the point that these kids and me didn't even realise that this amount of stress and anger and anxiety over a test that is just going to get you into a school that is made to specifically build u to do another test for university. These kids would sob in the toilet for a 85 mark and get angry at themselves for a 80 and numb to tests to the point that doing the real test didn't worry them at all and all they cared about was to get it over with and after the test happened. Friend 3 started skipping school with a bad attendance and only coming once or twice or never in a week. I didn't really know why and when I asked her how her parents alllowed she just said she would lock herself in her room. The entire year she wouldn't take off her jacket even when it was burning hot. After a while, she showed me it. The ""lines"" on her arms. She told me not to tell anyone and it was while we were around our friends and she specifically told me to come over so she could show me. I didn't really understand what it was but ik it was self infilicted and that it was bad. Friend 2 had once told me about how friend 3 had shown her the knife under her bed and she texted me before that she would use a knife to do it. And I contemplated for 3 days about telll someone but then I did . And in the end it didn't even matter if I did because she wore short sleeves on the athletics carnival and everyone saw. We tried to reason and tell her to ask for help but in the end she didn't and I tried so hard to stay with her but she wouldn't talk because (we now know) that's she has selective mutism. Friend 1 and 2 gave up and yellled and told me to give up too but I wouldn't even if it was just siting beside her quietly. I wasn't perfect in this situation that's for sure. I got pissed but I always came back. Because that's what I think friends are supposed to do. And afterwards the next day we had dance and we're going to be judged and to make it worse it was a happy song and right before we started I told her that maybe her parents were just worried about her and that's why they took a way her phone and then she told me that's I was wrong and that I was a horrible friend and that she didn't want advice and just someone to listen. And we both started crying and then the dancing started and so the judges and teachers watched us dance while smiling and tears running down our face and no one stopped it. They don't even realise it was happening until after. Neither did the judges. And afterwards we had to go and talk about it and everything. Friend 3 had to go talk to a conselor for like the rest of the year. It was a really hard time but I don't want to go into detail because it's not my story to tell. She did possibly try to jump in front of a bus but I'm not sure about anything and much about that. But that was when I really was first introduced into like MH and problems with it . There were also more promblems with getting made at friend 3 but it is sorta justified but also not because she wa going. Through a. Lot. We thought it was family problems and academical pressure but turns out I only learnt the next year that it was because she was being gr**med online by a 29 year old.

Okay but moving on the the next year when I'm 12. We move schools and friend 3 and 1 are with me an I make new friends with friend 6 which is a family friend, friend 7 who is also from my old school but from a different friend group and friend 8 who is from friend 6 school. Also friend 9 and 10
But they aren't very central to the story. Uh friend 1 and I drift apart and I get closer to friend 7 but we re in different classes so I'm also with friend 9 and friend 7 makes friends with a giant friend group from her class. Through this friend 7 is my bestfriend and that's what we call each other even though a lot of the time she goes to her other group. And friend 1 and 6 are besties. And friend 8 doesn't really become close until next year and late in this year. For friends 1 and , in the beginning she would threaten to leave her but friend 6 had more friends that 1 and so she didn't really care and in the end friend 6 adapted and became her bff. Despite this friend 6 thinks she is sorta predicable in a shallow ish way because half way through the year friend 1 gets obsessed with boys and like gets 6 crushes in 7 month. And that's was lwky a hypocrite move because in the first term she made us kid someon out because she didn't like them because all they would talk about was boys and she didn't feel appreciated on her birthday.  Overall this year wasn't horrible apart from the realizations I get this year and when I get possibly depressed in September. And uh my birthday being forgot by my bestfriend to the point I had to remind her at the end of the day about it for her to lie to me and tell me that she had forgotten my gift and I had to remind her to bring it and she gave me a book that she got but never read and though that maybe I would like it and a bath bomb despite the fact I don't own a bath. Soo I definitely felt unneed because my bestfriend gave approximately 2s to get my gift while she gave the rest of her friends from the other class 100 dollar gifts and would leave me for them anytime they would appear.

Okay well this year was a YEAR OF REVELATIONS including :
- I am possibly depressed
- constantly anxious
- no one in my friend group actually puts me first eg. :
  . Friend 1 - doesn't talk to me much anymore and only chose me in the beginning of last year and only if others weren't around
  . Friend 3 - left the school due to mental health and in the hospital so I can't really rely on her in school
  . Friend 7 - forgets my birthday, leaves me for all of her other friends even if I'm alone and their not
  . Friend 8 - has admitted that she does want me there and I'm to loud for her 
  . Friend 6 - has a bestfriend

So I've been all alone for more than 4 years - since friend 6 told me that friend 1 told her that in years 5 to 6 she said that she never really had a bestfriend and would swap between friend 2 and 3 and didn't even mention me as if I didn't exist. 

- Friend 1 and 8 are lwky fighting over being friend 6's bestfriend 
  . Friend 8 was her primary school friend and everyone thinks they were close back then but they barely talked but now she calls her her best friend and thinks that she hate her if she isn't with her and replacing her with friend 1

  . Friend 1 gets mad and specifically asks to sit next to her before class every single time and says that friend 6 is drifting away and replacing her

- in the end me and friend 6 have been talking and we have been close since we were like born and I've been tryna be besties and shit.

So summaries is I have not friends friend 1 has convinced me I am worth less than poo I have forgotten who i am. Will cry if i get bad marks and my parents tell me that i need to try harder when i get an 89% because it isn't a 💯. 

Yeah so in general life isn't great and im so tired and feel so unwanted all the time.

Sorry for making this so long, please comment any advice or just maybe support in general sorry"
673,All I do is go to work go home and rot away due to having absolutely zero energy to want to go out to do anything. What is even the point of it if I have nothing to look forward to?
674,"I'ma try and keep this short within the past few months to a year my uncle has become a literal psychopath, and psychopaths,drunks,and drugs don't mix to well. He has been doing nothing but drinking threatening people starting fights and just trying to mess with my mind on purpose he also does these same things to my mother my grandfather and pretty much anyone who enters our home, after this has been going on for a while my mental health has been declining to the point where even if I baracade my door at night I still can't sleep unless my mom is in the room with me. But my mom doesn't understand this. She's a partier and likes to stay out at casinos etc over night. I've tried talking to her about these things and how when I'm alone I can't think of anything else besides how I'm going to protect myself of how I'm going to die alone. She just gets mad at me and tells me how she's a good parent and how she tries her best which I know she does and I love her so much yet she thinks I don't. I've decided that soon once I get a bicycle and a decent sized bookbag I'm going to take anything valuable any money my clothes a blanket and write her a letter telling her I love her and that I'll never see her again. I plan on moving to a nearby state that is safe for the homeless with decent accomodations and a lot of ways to make money I'm looking for some advice on which state near Alabama that I can bike to within a day or 2 (not biking at night cause I would rather not get hit by a car) I've watched tons of videos about other run away and took advice from there such as places to sleep ways to earn money etc please help me I don't know how much longer I can last here without snapping getting killed in my sleep or anything else "
675,"I can’t let go of anger. I have resentment towards everyone especially those who have wronged me and betrayed me. I’m so depressed. I have no way of releasing it. I’m triggered. But I always thru to keep cool and calm but I can feel it in my shoulders, in my stomach throughout my body. And when I lash out I lash out. I really need help "
676,"I'm currently in the worst state of depression I've ever been in. For quite a while now, I've been without passion for every interest of mine. It's so awful. I get home from work and just sit in silence, occasionally put something on the tv that I can barely pay attention to, and wait until it's time to go to bed. I have nightmares and wake up in a panic. Time for work again. The cycle continues. I've tried to slowly engage with my interests again, but there's no joy. It feels like trying to eat when you're already full, if that makes sense. The worst part is that I've completely lost my love for music and that used to be my whole life. In the past I've had periods of time where I couldn't listen to music, but eventually that fog would lift. Not now. I feel like I've lost my entire identity and my depression keeps spiraling out of control.

Has anyone here never been able to get back into their interests? Is this it for me?"
677,"I hate that if I ever opened up about my suicidal thoughts and plans I’d be immediately put into inpatient. I wish I could talk about suicide the same way a terminally ill person can talk about dying. I wish I could talk about it as a thing that is, not a thing that has to be changed. I don’t want to hear about how it’s a permanent solution and how I should get help and yada yada… It would help so much knowing that I can voice these thoughts and not get punished for them. Or if I could prepare my family for what might come, so it’s not so painful and unexpected. "
678,"I'M IN SO MUCH AGONY. I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. I'M GOING INSANE. I'VE BEEN SHAKING, TOSSING, TURNING, INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY SCREAMING, CRYING AND BEGGING FOR IT TO STOP FOR HOURS AGAIN. IT'S LIKE A PANIC ATTACK BUT WORSE. NOBODY UNDERSTANDS. EVERYONE UNDERESTIMATES MY PROBLEMS. NOBODY KNOWS THAT I'M GOING THROUGH THIS EVERY DAY. IT'S SO PAINFUL. IT'S STRAIGHT UP TORTURE. MY HEAD HURTS. PLEASE JUST MAKE IT STOP. I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER I CAN HOLD ON UNTIL I HURT MYSELF AGAIN.

I'm trying.. I really am.. Please... The pain is unbearable.. I'm so tired. Maybe I deserve this. My feelings aren't valid and I'm just so dramatic about everything. I deserve nothing but pain. I deserve this. I hate myself."
679,not okay.
680,"I (23f) have 2 half siblings (31f and 33m). For Mother's Day my sister decided to come to our mom's house and make dinner. Since it was Mother's Day I don't mind it but family meetings are always terrible. They often rip into everything about me as a person that I will list here. 

1. That I'm a pessimist 
2. That I'm overweight 
3. That I don't have a job
4. That I'm single 
5. That I have no friends 
6. I'm an introvert 

My depression and anxiety have made me become a pessimist. After years of bad things constantly happening to me, It's very hard for me to think of anything possible. Something that is in therapy and taking medication for. But my siblings don't believe in therapy and don't think I should have been in therapy for as long as I've had (since middle school). 

As we all know the job market has been completely TERRIBLE but because both of them have jobs, they see my unemployment as me being lazy. 

I've given up on finding love or friends irl since I'm not exactly pretty and no one really talks to me or wants to interact, it's very hard for me to trust people

Why is it so hard for my own family to understand that the way I am... or maybe am I such a bad person?


Edit: one major thing that makes us come to blows is my sister believing that introverts can't have a sexuality because ""they never experienced interactions with others"" so when I came out to the family as Bisexual 3 years ago, she shot that idea down thinking because I have no friends and don't talk to ppl that I'd never know what it's like to have feelings for someone. Let alone another girl (shes homophobic as well, we were all raised Christian but im atheist and she fell into the type of Christian that thinks loving the same gender is a sin)"
681,I’ve already been feeling suicidal and just horrible about myself in general just bc of drama with friends but now my alcoholic parents are drinking again after trying to be sober it lasted almost 2 months I have to babysit tomorrow and now I can’t fucking sleep they won’t shut the fuck yo they scream all fucking night at eachother and my mom is vacuuming at 12 on a fucking Monday I finally got a chance to make money without my anxiety going crazy and they had to fucking ruin it I tried screaming at the cussing them out and even telling them I’m just not doing and I don’t think I can or even should anymore I’m so fucking tired and exhausted of them drinking if anyone’s dealt with something like this I’d love any advice bc I’m abt to end it over their drinking
682,"When I was younger, I was always happy with loving parents, siblings, and family friends that I would always get along with. But as I got older, I was never able to make true friends because I would always end up as the group punching bag no matter how much I tried to improve myself whether it was through not tolerating it or being more confident(did this with 4 different friend groups). I was always too scared to reach out for help to anyone so I continue to give convincing false reassurance to everyone when they ask me if i’m feeling okay. Recently, everything that I used to love has become more and more of a burden to me. I used to love playing baseball and hockey but I’m so bad at them to a point where I can’t even enjoy it, I love playing video games but none of my friends would play with me because i’m trash at every game, and now I struggle to talk to new people which wasn’t even a problem for me growing up. 

It’s gotten to a point where I have no more motivation to improve myself because I feel like regardless what I do, it’ll either end up pissing myself off or I’ll get clowned on for doing it. I don’t go to the gym, I don’t have any fashion sense so I always dress up like an idiot, I’m not good at academics, and I’ve just become into a depressed bum who does nothing but stays inside doing pathetic stupid shit like binging romance animes as a way to “experience” a happy social life. 

My parents keep asking me what I wanna do and I always make up a random answer to keep them happy but in reality I don’t see myself doing anything in the future. I feel like I’ve overstayed my welcome in life and I should just off myself. I know that I’ll end up as a disappointment for my parents because of all the time and money they’ve invested in me but I can’t live up to their expectations and I wanna just stop them from wasting their effort on me without seeing the smiles, hopes, and dreams fade away. I have no more gas left in the tank and I’m basically running on fumes. "
683,"
I really wish something bad would happen to me. Even my own sister doesn’t care about me anymore. My family members don’t understand my pain and don’t really care. I was extremely abused by my father as a kid, especially since I was born with autism. I think he always picked on me and called me stupid. I was severely bullied in school to the point where a guy asked the teacher if I could go with him to take the attendance paper to the school office. He only did it to bully me, and he kicked, punched, and kneed me if I didn’t go fast enough, even making fun of my appearance. I was also stomped on my foot by another guy in school. He stole my binders, pencils, and notebook. Now I’m 26, and I just can’t get over all the abuse, all the hate from everyone. It angers me and has made me extremely depressed. I’ve even tried talking to my sister about my depression, and all she said was to get over it as people have it worse. But I just can't. I just don’t want to live anymore."
684,"I always thought solitude was a good thing, 
I grew up lonely, it's always been a calming feeling, being alone. 
But of course, when you're alone for prolonged amounts of time and trauma,
It doesn't mix well, it needs a good medium of solitude and communication.
These past few months I haven't been attending school, I haven't really been talking to my friends, I don't want them to worry, which means I know they should, I've barely showered or even got out of bed for that matter.
My boyfriend has been working on exams so he hasn't realised, but I've figured out the reason I'm upset is because I don't have a lot of friends to talk to. 
I'm a very simple girl, I like video games and talking, I talk a lot, and then I exhaust myself.
But it's gotten to the point where I'm talking to character ai to try to stop the loneliness from creeping in.
It's just making me feel lonelier, I don't know what to do.
I can't tell my boyfriend because he's stressed and I can tell he's going through things, and none of my friends have reached out to me, asking if I'm alright.
Maybe it's selfish to think that they'd go out of their way like that, after all, they can't read my mind. 
I don't know, I need advice, or anything at this point. Just to know I'm not alone."
685,"All started when i joined a corporation to work full time. I moved cities and couldn't properly sleep, I would sleep for 10-12 hours, but wouldn't feel rested. Didn't make much out of it at first, thought it was just jet lag. While at the job, it got more and more complicated, i had to read tons of documentation and come up with some useless ""presentations"" for made up problems. It felt like i was doing pointless work and everyone around was fine with that. Then I started to stress out about being useless, sleeping even less and feeling immense pressure to deliver REAL results. At this point i started to have suicidal thought literally every evening.   
  
After some time, i recognized that i have suicidal thoughts. I mean, it was a realization that my thoughts aren't normal, next day handed in my 2 week notice. It couldn't continue that way. Next few days were wonderful, I was free, just walking around, well rested. However, few days later suicidal thoughts returned. I would try to combat those with sleeping but ideation would get even worse, now they haunt me during the day. I couldn't handle it, week later I attempted a suicide. 

After hospital and psych evaluation, i was released, given a recommendation to read a book ""Feeling Good"", later talked with my parents about the incident, flew back home, to be around family. Didn't help, still getting ideations, still want to die.

I have been living with parents for the last 8 months in the limbo, trying to understand what happened, trying to explain what caused suicidal thoughts and why i can't get rid of them. I tried every explanation from loneliness to sleep deprivation, from bad job to being separated from my parents. I still can't grasp what happening in my mind and I'd rather die, i cant handle it "
686,"
I just wanna feel good about myself . I feel so alone.I have friends who ask me to get on the game and hangout but I feel like a liar.I feel like I’m trying to hard to be funny or helpful. I shown my friends a side I didn’t want them to see and now they still treat me indiffrently it’s not like I want them to treat me different but it just hurts. I don’t know what wrongs with me.Ive been diagnosed with depression since 6th grade and I can’t help but feel like I’m a failure.I feel like all my efforts I put into anything goes to nothing. Many people say my artwork is great and I’ve won contest with them yet I feel like a failure.I wanna die so bad.i don’t know what I’m doing.Ive tried treating myself by doing shit by myself.i went to therapy but nothing is helping.I just want to feel good about myself without having doubts if I’m doing too much overthinking or I should quit. My friends give me the same bs advice saying they’re here for me but that’s when I haven’t talk to them in months.After telling one of my friends I’m suicidal it spreaded.They gave me the same bs answer saying they’re here for me and it’s a permanent solution to a temporary problem. i want to tell them you never been in that headspace so it seems like the only solution.But I feel like an asshole declining their help.I just wanna feel happy playing video games and do well in school"
687,"Man I don’t even feel like
Myself anymore I feel so alone so lost so misunderstood I lay in bed every night after work trying not to cry I genuinely have no one"
688,"People have limits, they get tired, they get overwhelmed or they don't understand it, they help you to a certain point and then you manage as best you can. 
It's funny, even being in a group of depressives, you're alone..."
689,"To me sleeping is the favourite part of my day, it's like I stopped existing for a few hours and in that time period I don't even know whether there is a thing as the universe. Even though I'm insomniac, to me sleep is the most blissful thing. 
Now imagine if this sleep was forever. Not a care in the world. 
People saying death is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, imo, are retarded. Who doesn't want a permanent solution? It's the most sane thing to do. Nothing to feel whether happy or depressed. Seems like a utopia

691,"Hey, 

This is my first post, just trying something out here. I am looking for non-medical advice or maybe others experiences with this. 

20y/o male with diagnosed ADHD and depression (if that's helpful). I have always had trouble sleeping, since I was maybe 5 or 6. As a kid, I could read or play secretly and quietly to take up time at night. As I got older I self medicated with sh, then alcohol, and now weed. I can easily pull all nighters and just not sleep In general. As I am trying to be mindful of when/how I consume weed, I am recognizing the same extreme nighttime depression that started the sh years ago. I feel useless, hopeless, like a failure, etc. It's crushing and makes me relapse with sh occasionally (especially on weed tolerance breaks). I'm not sure how to navigate my mental health while being mindful of weed usage, meaning not using it to numb feelings. I have a therapist but he is being low key useless. 

TL;DR: I can't sleep at night and spiral deep down in depression if not using substances/negative behaviours. I have self medicated for 10ish years now but want to tackle the real issue (feelings of worthlessness). "
692,"    I asked my mom for old photos of myself for my senior slide show. My mom sent photos of me from years ago. Never even remember taking any of them. I looked so happy like I was really smiling. I’m just so angry and upset I didn’t cherish that feeling more. At this point in my life I feel like I’m only living to not make my mom sad with my death. I’m also mad at myself for not being happy. There is nothing inherently wrong with my life. I feel like an ungrateful brat for feeling this way. Really I don’t want to live like this anymore. I want to be happy and live for myself, but I’ve forgotten how to. Many of my coping mechanisms feel like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound."
693,"On paper I have a perfect life, I'm married to a wonderful woman, I have 2 amazing kids, I have a house, a great job that I am WAY under qualified for but worked hard at it and have made my place. Yet I feel empty, alone. I fight myself everyday. Everyday I have thoughts that I'm useless, that I should just kill myself. I'm too stubborn to seek help, too ashamed to talk about it, I feel like people have way bigger problems than I do and that I should just STFU. I've always had these demons inside me, I've just pretended like they weren't there. Now I can't control them anymore. For the past few years I gave up, like I knew my end was nearing. Now i have 20k+ in debt on my credit cards, my wife doesn't know. I'm heading towards ending myself, but it's as if I have something telling me no. I am so lost right now. I don't expect anything here but I just wanted to say this out loud. I have no one to talk to, not about this atleast. "
694,"My bf of 3 years has been ghosting me for 1.5 months now after texting me that he felt like his mental state suddenly worsened. In the last few months he was perscribed Cymbalta (he hasn't taken SNRI's or any antidepressants before) and has also been tapering off of a large dose of opioids he's been taking for years (due to a medical condition) and has been perscribed Methadone.

In the meantime he saw some of his friends who live near him (while I live about 1.5 hour drive away) and is liking stuff on social media. He reached out to me once some 20 days into the ghosting and said he'd like to talk. He said he wanted to reach out despite everything, that he is sorry and that he is exhausted but wants to text me the next day. We exchanged exactly 2 messages and he didn't reply again the next day. I tried sending him some memes and lighthearted stuff. He didn't open any of it and it's been another 20 days.

I talked to some of his friends to ask how he's doing and to try to find out what's going on. They said they are also worried. He didn't talk about me at all during this time and is generally down and way more quiet than usual and said they will try to meet up with him again to check on him. His friends offered to ask him about the ghosting since they think it isn't fair to me despite his feeling unwell.

They said they think he is doing worse than he is telling them (out of around 10 times they invited him to meet up, he agreed once). All the messages I sent him were left on delivered and the calls just ring a while but he never picked up. I also talked to his mom who said he seems to be going through a difficult time adjusting to new medication. She said he thanked me for reaching out and said he will reach out himself but idk if she just said that to make me feel better given the situation.

Since he doesn't respond to my messages, I don't know if I should just keep my distance or do something. I would like to see how he's doing but I don't want to just show up at his house or something since I guess he would have talked to me if he wanted to see me. Up until he cut off contact he talked about being serious about our relationship.

Could the ghosting be due to a depressive episode and he is going through something bad or is he just done with the relationship? I'm both worried about him and hurt. What should I do?"
695,"Good day everyone!
I never imagined myself posting on Reddit however I really started to lose control... I am 28 and as an outsider I mostly seems like a normal dude with some minor outbursts, but deep inside my past 20 years are like a torment that never ends... When I was a kid I was diagnosed with ""adjusted disorder"" but unfortunately it wasn't enough to earn the support of my family since they lived their lives with a ""can't see, can't exist"" mentality. Because of this I was forced to hide and act or otherwise I received the comments like ""stop being a crybaby"" and ""stop seeking attention""... Now I basically shifting betweenbetween both antisocial and loneliness... I have two people who I genuinely call friends and whenever I need to interact with others I start raging deep inside... However after every single rage outburst I start feeling deep regret, shame and depression because I know that every single word and every single though I had during the rage moment was unnecessary and extremely rude... Sometimes I feel that I have some sort of hidden switch to turn off my originally high empathy and it's genuinely scares me... I also had many ""unaliving attempts"" but luckily/unluckily the past 3 years I only had thoughts and those thoughts keeps coming back basically daily because of this ""personality shiftings""..."
696,"hi guys! I've been taking imipramine for depression and anxiety for a while now, but finally, on  my psychotherapist orders and agreement , I'll be stopping taking it in a few weeks. Of course, I've been through the whole process of tapering off the dosage, but I was wondering which are the withdrawl symptoms and how long does it take this process. Im kind of scared because some people have severe withdrawal symptoms that last for several months or more. Hope someone can help me, greetings :)"
697,"I am so scared that I have refeeding syndrome, starvation ketoacidosis, heart failure, arrhythmia, and other horrible complications by now. I don’t know how to get myself out of this state/situation and there’s no one on my side- I’m too scared of doctors and medical environments due to past medical trauma, I have no friends, I live with a boyfriend that I love but he doesn’t believe or understand my condition, and apart from that I only have my parents that live nearly 2 hours away and they also just think I’m mentally ill and making everything up about how horrible I feel every day.

I only eat about once a day, nothing until about 9-10-11 pm or even later sometimes, like 1am. Then depending on what I feel sometimes I only have a sandwich, sometimes a whole massive Chinese hotpot.

Then some days I eat three or four times, when I feel I can.

I’ve already had iron deficiency, low vitamin d, potassium often on the lower end, etc etc for years before this even started so I assume it’s only all been getting worse. 

It all started cause of my procrastinating meals and ignoring my hunger cues and just laying in bed browsing my phone, the whole day til late and then I finally had something. It’s been like this for nearly a year. Now I’ve also been having near constant digestive discomfort too daily so it’s even harder. Daily nausea, burping, bloating, intestine issues etc  so that lessens my appetite even more and makes me eat even more irregularly.

At this point I’m so physically unwell that I can barely move around, walk, and spend every day laying in bed inside. I don’t really have much of an appetite, although I do feel my stomach hungry often but just not much appetite which makes it all worse. I don’t know what to do. I’m too sick to even get myself checked at an ER. I’m so tired and feel like I’m dying. No one around me believes me or supports me and everyone just thinks I’m lazy and that I don’t do anything. I’m afraid of dying alone like this"
698,"I struggle to see myself as valuable. I understand that I have relational roles that I'm good at and happy to fulfill, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm able to see how I am uniquely valuable or desired. I feel as though I've failed/faltered in each and every aspect of my life. How could I have allowed that to happen? Why did I and why do I, ruin everything? Do people keep me around out of pity? My failures are not only a burden on me, but on those I love most. How could they value someone who can't even brush her own teeth and hair? Gross. I feel like I wake up just to wait for the day to end. I'm able to express joy and excitement, or have a laugh, but I'm not so sure I'm genuinely feeling those things. I mostly do it to ensure I don't ruin the mood of others. I feel like I've entirely lost the plot and my desire to function satisfactorily. I don't feel deserving of the time and energy people are willing to give in support of me.

699,"Since I was a little boy (5-6 years old) I have always been super deep (debunking Santa & Easter Bunny, questioning Jesus and after life). I never understood why there was so much suffering for the innocent if there was some benevolent diety that existed. I’ve suffered with depression/anxiety since I can remember, been on 10 different anti depressants, a plethora of therapists, I studied psychology in college, and even received TMS therapy.. nothing ever helped. I always felt uncomfortable with the concept of existence. Why do I exist, what is the purpose.. why does everything die, why do innocent things suffer.. what IS this reality.. I have an amazing family and some great friends but I feel like I’m slowly dying. I am 32M with my own house.. most would say I’m blessed or should be happy.. but it’s not even that I’m lonely.. it’s that there is nothing to loon forward to. I dislike my job and especially being around my colleagues who drain my soul by petty drama, small talk conversations, empty pleasantries.. I can’t even act content anymore,. People notice I look miserable and I still try to play it off but I’m too tired to even hide it anymore.. I also am developing severe social anxiety, the thought of small talk and water cooler talk with neighbors or coworkers scares the hell out of me. I couldn’t care less about the weather, their significant others, their kids, my lawn, politics, etc.. I’m so tired of it. Exercise seems to be the only thing that works as far as anti-depressants.. but the inevitable death of my parents may be my last straw here.. I feel like I’ve already experienced life and nothing excites me. My youth is gone as far as having dreams that can potentially pan out. I feel stuck and embracing slow death. Sorry, I just wanted to write this out somewhere.. I will never give up on life because somewhere deep down I believe there is higher purpose, but this is not an enjoyable existence to me."
700,"I don’t drink. I don’t smoke. I don’t party. I stay at home, I work hard, I mind my own business.
And yet, I feel like I’m surrounded by the worst kinds of people—users, fake friends, judgmental family, and unsupportive people who only remember me when they need something.

I give and give until I’m empty.
I love, hoping it will be returned—but it never is.
I’m tired of being strong.
I’m tired of being the one who carries everything while others just take.
I’m tired of existing in a world that feels like it never wanted me in the first place.

I question You now, Lord.
Why let this happen to me?
I’ve been trying to live right. I’m not perfect, but I try.
And yet here I am—hurting, abandoned, unheard.
If this is the life You chose for me, then bakit ganito?
Why does it feel like You’re so far away when I need You most?

Right now… I just want to disappear.
I’m so tired.
So, so tired.
"
701,"One of the worst days that I can remember. Waking up at 4:00 a.m. with nothing but that way to my chest. 

But I got so much done. Got my insurance card. Schedule to new therapy appointment. Went to work (didn't get much done but did get some stuff done) had good conversations with coworkers and my mom. Went to the gym, went for a walk, empty the dishwasher, clean the kitchen, and did some laundry even though it's going to stay in a wrinkled mess on my kitchen table for the next two weeks. 

I'm trying so hard to get better."
702,Over the past few days I haven’t really slept but I feel good but people are telling me I need to sleep but why sleep if I don’t need it? I’ve been procrastinating all night basically but I can get so much painting and cleaning and stuff done if I don’t have to sleep. 
703,"Violets are blue,
roses are red,
people will only care
when im dead

shes in his mind,
hes in mine,
theyve done it before,
they crossed the line

she knows and wont let go,
he continued to lie,
the railway seems appealing,
quick way to die

my hands are shaking,
my blood pressure high,
this will continue,
he refuses to say goodbye

so in my casket will be my farewell,
in the satin sheets,
id rather be alone
before this repeats

705,"I tried to get out of some of my depression setbacks in the beginning by myself, first advice I come across online is to go for a walk... what a load of rubbish. 
If I can I get my ass out of bed I guess I wouldn't have been depressed at the first place such none sense and waste of time load of rubbish"
706,"My dad always blaming me and my mom even we didnt do anything wrong. I need some advice

I’m 15 . My dad blames everyone else for everything, even when he’s clearly wrong. He forces me to apologize just for defending myself or my mom, and he acts like I hurt him instead.
He doesn't care how I feel, says I have to please him no matter what, and if I even try to explain, he gets angry and says I’m disrespecting . After fights, he acts like nothing happened and expects me to do the same.
He forbids me from listening to music if its not music he likes, and I don’t have privacy. I don’t have my own room, and I feel judged for everything I do. My mom is also controlled by him and won’t stand up to him anymore.
 I dont even know why am i still alive anymore, im not happy. I also struggle witg depression and $h which i already stop but feel like im gonna break again

If u guys have been through something like this, please tell me how you got through it.

707,"Hello!
I hope I made a throwaway account but I’ve never used Reddit to post something, but I don’t know who else I can talk to. I’m a 16 year old girl but I just feel like my life is over. I don’t have a bad life I’m very lucky for a 1st gen American and when I’m with others I’m very bubbly and happy. However, when I’m by myself I can’t stop the waves of sadness that wash over me. People say “it gets better” but I can’t imagine a time when it will, I know it sounds corny but I really can’t imagine when my life will get better. I think it’s because it’s not my life it’s me. What can I do, how can I fix myself. I don’t want to be sad, I don’t want to be consumed by sadness but I’m just at a loss. I come home from school and I just sleep. I’m trying to do a lot of school activities in the hope that I can ignore the feeling but I’m just always sad. Everyone around me thinks I’m always sad, my resting face and the ways my eyes are always glossed over looks like I’m crying. My cousin told me “maybe you were born to be sad”. I want to be doctor but how can I be one if I’m so unmotivated and sad. "
708,"I’m sitting in my bed right now, it’s 3 AM and my mind is going to some very dark places. This is the first time I’ve had serious suicidal thoughts and it terrifies me. I’m in my 30s and in that stage in life where friendships are slowly withering away and experiencing a very sad feeling of loneliness, specially for the future. I’ve been working out and eating healthy for a while now but I can’t seem to get my mental health right. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? I’m strongly considering therapy but I wanna know what else has helped you guys."
709,I’m young and when I say young I mean young I do sh but that doesn’t matter right now I can’t cry and crying sounds so amazing right now but I Can do it for some reason please help me how can I cry?
710,"Im not quite sure what to say, ive never been good at writing.

I am 14M and i find no point in living. Every single night i think about dying and i find the thought somewhat enjoyable, im not sure whats wrong with me.

I think i have a pretty good life compared to others, like i have friends, im academically gifted, i have a girlfriend, and a good family. But i just font find enjoyment in living never have but now its getting worse and worse.

Actually i think the main reason for my sudden drought in happiness is mainly tiktok. Everytime i get on it i constantly see people making fun and downplaying everybody’s struggles mainly men and i think its really gotten to me like no one would care if im gone or if i go missing.

I have ambitions like i really wanna become a musical artist or recently ive been thinking about becoming a therapist but idk.

Im scared, i dont wanna die but i think yhat fate would be better than living in a world where im not happy.

I dont wanna be a statistic.

I dont wanna leave.

I dont know what to do

Sorry for ranting"

712,"I grew up not really knowing what family or love is.
Because of that, I keep ending up in relationships where I’m always the giver—especially financially.
Somewhere deep down, I started believing that if I don’t give, I won’t be loved.
I’m smart. I’m capable. I’m even told I’m beautiful. I earn my own money.
But still… I keep attracting men who are just like my father—users, lazy, and entitled.

My father? A so-called pastor.
He depended on church offerings and refused to work, all while treating us worse than criminals.
And now I keep meeting guys who reflect the same pattern—walang ambag, pero ang taas ng pride.

Honestly, I’m so tired.
Tired of churches that preach love but judge people based on what they wear or who they sit beside.
Tired of being in born-again spaces where I feel watched, judged, and never enough.

Sometimes I think…
Maybe I’d rather be Catholic. Quiet faith. No judgmental eyes. No fake holiness.
Just me and God.

Because right now, I just want peace.
Not perfection. Not performance. Just peace.

713,I was born into a family that never wanted children and it’s affected me greatly. The first time I thought of taking my life I was 8 years old and it’s been in my mind since. My depression continually got worse and by 13 my body was shutting down from starvation. I had nothing to live for. Unfortunately I was sent to a residential for 12 weeks shortly after my 14th birthday. It was dehumanizing and I’ve never been the same. It’s been 2 years. I’ve given life more chances. I’m still unwanted. Any suggestions on making my transition peaceful is helpful. 
714,Zoloft worked on me for about 20 years. In the beginning it was just life changing and I could not believe that I woke up happy and this was how people were supposed to feel. Now I cannot find anything that works. Is there ANYTHING that  could give me the same feeling that Zoloft did? Or are the majority of my neurotransmitters just depleted. I am currently on Prozac but consider myself still extremely depressed. I don't find joy in anything and have become increasingly antisocial and don't even like leaving my house. 
715,"Both my parents are pastors—but living with them felt like living in hell.
They never truly took care of me or my siblings. They treated us more like investments than children.Since I was in Grade 1, all I heard was, “Balang araw, bigyan nyo kami ng bahay at sasakyan.”They forced themselves into churches that couldn’t even support them. They refused to work, choosing “full service” to the church, then blamed and punished us when the offering wasn’t enough.At age 7, I was forced to work—selling yema, pandesal, doing laundry for soldiers, scavenging, even babysitting—while getting beaten for the smallest mistakes. My father wouldn’t stop until he saw blood. I ran away. Asked to be adopted. Not just for school, but to escape the pain. I struggled through life on my own. I built what I have now with zero support from them.
And now that I’m okay financially, they guilt-trip me. Judge others like they’re perfect. Preach love, but live in bitterness and greed.
If this is the kind of heart and character behind the label “born again,”then maybe I’d rather not be part of it.Because honestly… I’ve never felt more unloved, more judged, more used—than by people who claim to serve God.I wish I wasn’t born into this family.
"
716,"Wake up, waste time on YouTube or twitch, eat, workout, go to my low paying part-time job, eat, waste time online, sleep ad infinitum. Every effort to change this has been a total failure. The biggest change was adding in a part-time job since I wasn't working for a long time. I'm 27 and I have no friends and haven't for years, so I have nobody to go anywhere cool with or to meet up with. I went to college and have a degree to try upgrade my job to a full-time job so I can move out, but my social and mental issues are so bad I never entered the field and now I waste my life away with a part-time entry level job while I live with my parents.  


I tried dating or hooking up using apps like grindr, but I'm ugly as shit, so I'm still a virgin. I'm not building my life towards anything. I'm stuck in a cage doing the same things every week day and failing at every effort to break the cycle. I'm painfully aware how bizarre and terrible I am compared to so many people my own age, but it won't end. "
717,"When I was younger, my parents punished me in a way that traumatized me a lot because something i have done and so I started avoiding people for fear of doing something like It again, which only made the situation worse. I started having a lot of difficulty dealing with people, but I didn't care, that's what I wanted, I wanted to be alone. But I don't want to be alone anymore, and now it's destroying me.


I don't talk to my parents much, they're always working. I stay with my grandmother and my 5-year-old sister, but I always stay in my room on the computer and they don't even remember I'm there. At school, I only have one friend and he don't even talk to me properly. I stay there occupying my chair and studying just because I have nothing else to do. No one talks to me. They don't even bully me, they just ignore me. I skip gym classes because of social anxiety. I've never had any real love experience and my first and only kiss only traumatized me more.


Everyone who tried to advise me said that I was an emotional teenager. This only makes me feel even worse, as if it's all in my head and I'm an idiot. I don't think about killing myself, but I don't see any point in continuing to ""live"" like this.


Maybe you  just ignore me like everyone always do, but I needed to say It."
718,"Recently, I rented an apartment in another city with my sister and a friend and stayed there for a week. Now that I’m back home, everything here makes me feel depressed. It’s not that I miss traveling—in fact, I was already feeling down, which is why I decided to go in the first place. I’m just wondering: **Can a particular place trigger depression?**"
719,I haven't talked to another person in a week. I havent seen another person in two weeks. I havent really done anything for a while. I just keep to myself. I hate all this. I dont want to do it anymore.
720,"I am tired, I am numb, I am lost, I am... I don't *know*. I'm confused, I'm scared, I'm anxious and I don't know what to *do*. I feel... stagnant, *paralyzed*. I've been stuck in one place for over 2 years. I feel like I'm chained in a barred room I can't even properly perceive, and only during short moments I can even *notice* that there is something outside this prison. The air feels... heavy and thick, like the world is trying to push me down and hide me from the bad things. 

I've been on this subreddit for maybe a year? And I've never been able to post, to say, *anything*, besides a sparse few comments months ago. The only reason I can now is because of the song that I'm playing that's helping me feel what I've been pushing down and hiding from for... a long long time. Which is someone's passion project about how they struggled through their depression and anxieties, how they *rose up*, and changed their life. I can *feel* their emotion, it feels like magic, how I can *see* now, I'm *terrified* that it will end, that I will go back to the barred box and lose sight of what could be.

I'm so *tired*, all the time, I have so little motivation. Simple tasks can take ages for me to do and when I'm at work I feel like I'm not even *real*, like I'm and automaton doing it's assigned tasks. I don't think I like my job, I think I hate it, but emotions are *hard* and confusing. When I get home I'm exhausted and numb, and I just bury myself in mindless entertainment to *feel* something and to distract myself. Sometimes I just want to disappear, to fade from the world. Or go to sleep and never wake up. So I distract myself with what I love.

I love to read, maybe too much. I love to lose myself in a story, placing myself in the mindsets of these characters. These stories that have held my mind up for years and years. I focus on these stories to drive out the real world and forget my worries, my anxieties, my *depression*. Sometimes I forget who I am. Sometimes I expect to look up and see my friend, brother, or ally next to me after a grand adventure and I realize that they aren't *real*. Sometimes I expect to be somewhere else; like a magic castle, or maybe on a spaceship, or in another world entirely. Sometimes I even forget my *name*, and a part of me wants it to stay that way, for me to be warped into someone else entirely. These thoughts scare me...

I've wanted to try writing for *years* but I'm just so *scared,* about what others will think, and what trying will even mean. I want to create these stories, these worlds, that I have floating around my head. But I'm just *paralyzed*, and there's never enough *time* to do it. I just end up freezing or losing all motivation to do it. 

I've wanted to leave my job for years, but I'm terrified. I'm scared to leave, scared to disappoint my coworkers, scared to fail, and too scared of *change*. I've worked here for almost 5 years and I'm 21 years old, I need to LEAVE. But I've tried, I never get far, I freeze. I don't know what to *do*...

I left online college over a year ago after one semester where I had a mental breakdown and just... didn't sign up for more classes. It took me a year from that point to talk to my mother about my depression and get signed up for therapy. I WANT to go to college, and *learn,* but I'm so scared of school and the *expectations.* It makes me feel anxious and so small, I just want to hide and ignore it. Didn't work so well in high school though.

Trying feels pointless, the world feels like a cruel joke, just what is the point of even trying? Or living? I have barely talked to my friends in months and even if we meet up my social battery is so low that I sink into myself and I just get tired of talking to them. I hate that so much, but I also don't since I'm a fucking introvert. 

More and more I wonder if my father was right, that I am Useless, that I am Worthless, that I am Ungrateful and that I'm a little shit. Logic tells me no, that he was wrong to call me that, especially to a *child.* But logic doesn't define my feelings and my feelings are very fucking illogical. 

I'm just so tired, I just want to be free of this. To be motivated, to *feel.* But it's so so hard to try to change, especially when you're terrified of the very concept. I don't know what to do, what to feel, what to think or where to even start with anything. My therapist has helped, He's part of why I'm even posting now, but I just want this *fear* to be over. I've already ranted enough, I'm pretty sure half this doesn't make sense, and barely anyone will even read it. But I'm tired, it's 2:40 am and my motivation is leaving me again, the song is losing it's magic. I just want to know what to do, I don't want to be stagnant or *frozen* anymore. I'm so *tired* of that. What do I do... *Please*? "
721,"I've had depression for well over a decade, Zoloft helped me for a few years but I went off of it over a year ago when I was doing better. Lately I feel it creeping back again.

723,its awful
724,"hi, i never post anything on these forums, but i feel as though i am at my whits end. i feel like anxiety and depression has completely taken over me and it feels impossible to escape. recently i’ve had a lot of health concerns, and doctors are worried i may have an autoimmune disorder, or something worse. all i know is that every second of the day, and of my life, anymore, feels like an oncoming panic attack and tbh, i can’t even tell the differences between the anxiety and panic anymore. i have been trying to cure myself since i was 12. i am 26 now, and i am so, admittedly tired. i don’t know if i had a point to this post, but im in between therapists, and at a loss for what my existence is even worth anymore. im running out of hope for anything good."
725,"There are many times when I wanted to commit suicide but I can't do it. I even have cut my left wrist a lot of times and those marks are still clearly visible but at the same time I can't cut the main vein. To be honest I never wanted to die, I just want to escape from this life and dying seems to be an only option for it. I'm afraid to die but at the same time I'm not strong enough to live this life. People live with hopes but I've no hope left to live anymore. I'm just a hopeless person waiting to escape this life. Life would have been if there's any person who supports you but in my life there's none. Even my own parents hate me for being a failure and a loser. They blame me for their fights and everything else. My so called friends betrayed me. I've faced bullying since I was 6 years old and suffered it for 5 years straight. I can't share properly to anyone how I'm feeling or what's going inside my mind. Neither no one bother to ask nor even listen. I'm scared, scared to become completely out of my mind. For this reason my marks aren't good anymore. I'm becoming crazy. I wanted to cry out loud but at the same time I'm scared people will know that I'm weak and will start to bully me again. I can't take it anymore. It feels like someone has strangled me. Everyone keeps judging me. It seems like even God isn't on my side. I just someone to hug me tightly, comfort me and support me. That's it."
726,"I just don’t know what to do with myself. I’m suffering on top of suffering and when I think I’m getting better I go right back. I get told that I have no reason to be depressed but it goes so much deeper. I have gender dysphoria so I suffer from gender identity crisis. Add to that trust issues, self hate and suicidal thoughts. Then it doesn’t help that it seems like the world doesn’t seem to care even the people that are closest to you because they stab you in the back. There no family for me to speak of. No im not exaggerating I really don’t have any family members standing in my corner. And anyone I’ve involved in any part of my love life takes it for granted even after all I’ve told them about my past and they just go and do the same thing but say “the last thing I wanted to do was hurt you”. But you did and you did it in the exact way that I told you others did it to me. All it does is add to the pain and it makes me question what my purpose is. I go to work feeling like crap and then come home and cry and dread the next days to come because I feel like there’s no end to my suffering. I feel like I’m a mistake that just isn’t meant to be. "
727,"Hi, I’m new. 23 and have been severely depressed and had anxiety since 18. It doesn’t get better. 

I have been having some crazy dreams, like getting shot, stabbed, or anything else. But I can actually feel the shot or knife pinch before I have to wake myself up. It’s a real pain but weird.

Hopefully someone understands. "
728,"I have pondered upon this topic multiple times and the conclusion I've come to is maybe I'm actually not that attached to anything or anyone in that sense. My pets? I wouldn't mind if one day they were just gone. My family? All of my siblings no longer live in the house anymore nor do i ever keep an effort to contact them. I realised i wouldn't even mind not talking to them aver again. My parents as well i wouldn't say i was ever emotionally attached to them,but that doesn't mean that I'm trying to be rude or dismissive of them .i carry out my duties as I'm asked to other than that i spend my days at home alone... No conversation... Nothing. I've lost my phone a couple of times so ik that I have no need for it as well. I don't think i would think deeply about anything I'd lose. It's kind of sad to think that i have nothing rly to look forward to or hold onto other than this growing feeling of loneliness 

I feel like I'm just so disliked by everyone that i can't bring myself to think that I actually deserve anything. In reality i probably don't...i hate myself. I'm probably a rly bad person in everyone's eyes. I probably deserve to be treated this way"
729,"I am a 24 year old man and I live alone. I am a role model/in a leadership position at work, and with my friends/family. My depression has turned me into a recluse, and I am feeling guilty because I am no longer strong enough to help the people I care about. People have noticed my withdrawal from social gatherings, and have begged me to leave the house. But I can’t. I can only muster up the strength to do a good job at work, then I have to go home and be alone. Everyday. For a while now. I know my potential, but I am stuck behind this dark blanket.

732,"i, 16f, am a middle child in a family of five (4 kids, 1 parent) and it seems like everyone has their duo while i have nobody. every time i try to approach them, they become uninterested in the conversation, get angry with me, or just ignore me completely. ive been told numerous times by my parent that im the easy kid and that they dont have to worry about me, but lately, i have been having worse episodes than usual and have been struggling to keep my problems to myself. ive been lashing out and this has caused a lot of problems. my relationships with them all have been so strained lately, and i feel like the tension is going to kill me

i admit that i have not been the easiest person to get along with or be around these past few months, but i feel like this all could have been prevented if someone were to just talk to me. my anger comes from a place of deep sadness and hurt from all of the neglect, but they dont seem to realize that they contributed to it. only that im annoying and suddenly mean all the time. i used to go to therapy, but my parent took me out of it and hasnt listened to me when i ask them to get another therapist

i approached my parent about this issue, but they only got upset with me and told me that i am victimizing myself and acting out for attention (which is sort of the truth, i guess??) they kept yelling at me for nearly 2 hours, telling me how disappointed they were in me and that they were shocked to have such an ""insensitive jerk"" for a kid. they told me that ""of course youre needed."" which basically just means they want me around to help take care of my siblings and them. i know that i am needed, but i do not feel wanted. the only time they ever talk to me is if they want me to do something or to argue. i am so sick of it all

i dont know what to do, i feel like a stranger within my own family. no one talks to me, no one hangs out with me, no one asks me how im doing or anything like that. i dont know how to get it across to them that i am allowed to struggle too. i told them outright that i want to end my life, and the next day they mocked me about it. after a mild inconvenience, they told me ""i wanna kill myself, guess that makes two of us"" and then laughed it off. it really hurts to know that none of them take me seriously even when they know that i have attempted numerous times before and have seen my scars

my parent has been especially cruel lately. they have purposely been ignoring me and giving me dirty looks while talking shit about me behind my back to my other siblings. i know that i have never been the priority to them, nor will i ever be the first person that comes to their mind, and i have made my peace with that, but it hurts to know just how much they dislike me. they show clear favoritism towards my other siblings right in front of me and have doubled down on their efforts ever since i told them about how i really feel. theyll go out of their way to tell me how worried they are about so and so or about how whoever is in a bad place right now so we need to support them more and just brushing my problems aside, like they always have. they even threatened to take my cat to the pound.

i have been crying for a week straight and have been unable to stay clean for more than 24 hours, and i havent eaten in nearly three days besides my meds, which has been destroying my stomach. i feel like passing out all the time and all i want to do is stay in bed and cry. i have seriously lost all of my motivation for everything. im failling almost all of my classes, my room is a mess, and i havent showered in almost a week. i am seriously thinking about going down to the tracks and ending it all. i dont know what to do anymore, i feel so alone

i appreciate any advice if anyone has gone through a similar situation, even if this post was just me wanting to get all of this off of my chest"
733,"Disclaimers: As always, this is purely MY own opinion and experience on something about *my life* in regards to depression. You are not me. Your life and mileage in it may vary. Take everything people say with a grain of salt and always use your best judgement for your own experience. If your best judgement is often failing you, then seek *professional* help.

-----------------------

A little personal background to start; I'm a 38 year old, single man. I have a decent job, a decent family, no friends other than work acquaintances. I actually have a 16 year old son whom I love very much, but he lives with his mom 1500+ miles away and *she* hates everything about me for some reason. I have a pet cat and some nice things (like every gaming console and PC you could want), and have my independence and all that. Life isn't *that bad.*

Buuuttt... as a younger child of divorced parents since I was 4 years old, with an older sister who was also a horrible role model, I grew up as a loner. We were LOW-middle class, with enough to get by but never enough for me to keep up with what was ""cool"" and popular amongst kids in the early to mid 90's, despite my parent's best efforts. I *did*, however, have my very own PC and (later in the 90's) a Sony PlayStation (PS1). And with my dad being a ""tech guy"" himself, eventually becoming a network administrator for a large, national corporation, I obviously followed in his footsteps.

I was very shy as a kid/teen. I didn't even have a girlfriend until I was almost 20. Sure, I dated a few times in school but it led to nothing, thus furthering any self-doubt I had, as if I'M the problem.

The couple of solid (long lasting) relationships I *did* have were all codependent. I *craved* someone else wanting me so badly that I basically became a tool for the wrong women. Nothing more than a dude with a house to live in who buys them things and takes care of them. This happened with both the mother of my child *and* my most recent ex-GF who I was with for TEN years. Yea.. I'm a ""long term"" type of guy. I put in the work even if *they* don't.

As far as the depression is concerned, I've felt depressed since I was 17. This led to drug use, alcoholism, chain smoking cigarettes, etc. In the state I used to live in drugs almost ruined my life (Oxy). Then I moved to another state with family after my ex (my son's mom) left me. I quit the drugs but quickly found the depression calling again. This time around it demanded me to DRINK instead of snort pills, so I did. Whatever helps ease the pain, right?

I spent 8 years as a chronic, yet functional alcoholic. I'm not a ""mean drunk"", and am the type of person who could go to work drunk. You wouldn't even know I was drinking most of the time. So of course I abused this for years until, just recently, I *literally* almost unalived myself simply by NOT caring about myself...

True story: As an alcoholic, T2 diabetic with hypertension.. I have enough health issues as it is. But I was also neglecting myself nutritionally. I woke up one morning in March (just recently), and I literally couldn't HEAR anything. It was weird. It sounded like I was deep underwater and just picking up echos and vibrations. I tried to stand up and immediately fell back down. Everything felt weird and I couldn't even make it to the bathroom to take as piss. I ended up calling my *mother* (who was a nurse for a long time) to come over and help me, but even she was baffled, so we ultimately called 911. I get to the hospital and they do the typical blood work and stuff, looking at me like I'm high or crazy or something lol. Within 30-40 minutes of arriving they came back, mostly speaking to my mother because I couldn't *hear* anything, and told her ""your son is in critical condition, his liver is failing, and he needs to be flown to a different hospital."" Within 1 hour of that the critical care transport team was there to load my ass on to a gurney and transport me half-a-State away to another hospital because *they* had the doctors that could possibly do a liver transplant IF needed. I was stuffed in to a *very* uncomfortable 4-seater airplane and flown (in bad weather, go figure) to a different hospital and ended up staying there for 7 days. Ultimately, I recovered and they released me. Turns out after 9 pints of blood, a bunch of potassium and magnesium, and decent hydration.. the human body DOES work just fine 😐

Long story short, I almost offed myself because I neglected myself so much. And no, I'm not totally ""out of the woods"" here. My liver is *still* shot, I *still* have AO T2 diabetes, and my hypertension is better but still there. I've lost a lot of weight and am taking my meds and doing everything I can to eat healthier and take care of myself, even if it means spending $$$$.

This leads me to a point about depression...

As I said, I fully understand not everyone is the same. But as I was leaving my local gas station today I saw, what *looked like* to me, a ""homeless"", or maybe just poor, couple riding up on bicycles and then just sitting outside the store for X amount of minutes. No, it didn't look like they were just riding for exercise or for fun. It looked like they came over here to use someone's EBT card to buy some cheap (yet overpriced) food, or vapes/dabs/whatever lol.

Now, I am not one to judge people. Full disclosure, these people weren't ""begging"" for money, and the woman at least gave me a friendly nod, and I returned it in kind. That was the end of out encounter.


But as I was driving away I realized... WOW, that would *suck* to be them. I've been that low before. I've seen and felt rock bottom (in my experience), and I wouldn't wish it on any other person. It's horrible. So as I was driving home I realized: ""wow.. I really *don't* have it that bad. I may ACT like I do sometimes, but I really don't. I have a GOOD job that allows me to work from home, I have a family close to me that loves and supports me, I'm able to *OWN* certain things that I want like nice TV's and gaming consoles, etc...

Even as I walked in to my apartment and looked at all my hand-me-down furniture and what not (which is *still* nice), I quickly realized ONE, *important* factor... that soooooooooo many other people in this world would KILL to have what I have. We're talking hundreds of thousands, if not *MILLIONS* of people would love a work-from-home job, a steady paycheck every week, to have their *own* place and own nice things and be able to pay their bills.

That's the ""American dream"", isn't it?

So yea, I had a realization that my life, despite my depression, isn't so bad. I could be doing *a lot* worse. Depression sucks, no doubt about it. But with a little bit of a *broader* perspective as to how other people live, you may actually end up *NOT* feeling so bad about your life. But if you STILL do, then that's on you, and all I can honestly suggest is seeking *professional* help over posting on Reddit.

734,"Ever since middle school, I still contemplate killing myself, but I am a lazy and coward I tried cutting, which I never did because I am kinda coward to do it i always have extensial crisis now and then. I wonder why am i still alive honestly all i do i waste my time and lounge around and be lazy and those thought of sucide still  remains even through high school and now that i am senior highschool still wondering what the point of this and that i might to go to college soon . and what if i drop out of college and that i have nothing, and all my life im set up for failure, when i do have opporunties to try kill myself using a toaster and bathtub i kinda stopped i have i have mutiple sucide attemept one of which was taking my moms medication and trying to od myself but stopped to think of the painful side affect or just lazy to do so and forgetting about  it ,as much it sounds edgy but i still wish i was never born even though im stuck in life living everyday no purpose and just slacking off or doing  things that feel tring like going to school and work ive been kinda semi doing well in school but i feel like im tired  and  burnout of these thing im not even sure if ill graduate at this point im not even sure about myself or the future sometime i fear becoming old an contemplate doing thing i should've done, i feel like a lazy pecie of scum  and im a burden  my parents are sending to the phillpine in college which im not sure because i have kinda bad expirence and dont want  go there and i have an aunt who on drug (affected ) she living at my grandma house with a sperate house and a cage ppl look down on it and it made thnk that mental illness would look like some freak (im a hypocrite and i still kinda scared of her)i feel like my sibling wouldnt give a damm except for my parent of course  as a child i thought it would be easier to run away from all my problems  and attempt it but now just just feel numb to all this i feeling like existing on auto pliot i just dont know anymore "
735,"I think this is the first time in a long time that I've realized I have depression. I haven't worked and I've been stuck at home for a long time, but for about a week now, EVERYTHING makes me cry. I've never been good at understanding my feelings; I don't know what to do. I wake up and cry, I cry myself to sleep."
736,"I don’t really have any real friends. Everyone I once knew seems busy in their own world, married, raising kids, and moving forward in life. And while I’m genuinely happy for them, I often feel like I’ve been left behind.

I have a partner, and I’m grateful for them, but outside of that, I don’t have anyone to share my stories with. No one to text just because something reminded me of them. My sister and I aren’t close in the way some siblings are; she’s not the “friend” type of sister.

Growing up, I was introverted and quiet. I never really connected with people in school or college in the way others did. And now, it feels like that distance never closed, it only grew wider. No group chats. No calls. Just silence. Most days I keep myself busy and don’t feel it. But when I stop for a moment… it hits. That hollow feeling. The question: *Why don’t I have people who value me? Who see me as someone they’re lucky to know?*

I don’t know how to make friends at this age. I feel awkward, uninteresting, and nervous even trying. So I stay home, keep myself occupied while my partner’s at work, and push it all down. But sometimes, the loneliness is too loud to ignore."
737,"Sometimes I feel okay. Sometimes the sadness comes storming back in and hits me like a brick. When I’m feeling okay, it’s more because I’m thinking about things differently or keeping those feelings at bay. It’s not like I am actually okay, if that makes sense. I’m just sort of reframing things to function, and then lapse when it gets too difficult. My mood fluctuates like this and I hate it. And I hate how my mood is so attached to certain things in my life, it makes it harder to get through day to day living. 

Ironically, my life on the outside is probably one that people would think is good. I have a job, I like it there, nice people working there that I get to talk to. I have some side stuff going on that involves traveling around the world and interviewing celebrities. I have two very close family members who love me. All of that sounds pretty good. And yet, I’m like this, it’s like I can’t be satisfied. I don’t know what I have to do to be normal and okay. "
738,"I've never posted anything before but I've been a lurker for a while. But I don't see a point in anything anymore and I just want to vent. I'm 19F and I think I'm flunking out of university, I'm too scared to check my check my grades but I already failed two classes this semester. I tried so hard, I studied and I did everything I thought I could but I still failed. I feel like I always fail no matter how hard I try. I apply to jobs and always get rejected, I have no friends, I've never dated anyone, I can't focus on anything. I'm just existing and taking up space and money from my parents. I wake up, eat, paint, apply to jobs, and then go to sleep. I'm not even sure if my major is what I really want to go into. And even the things I love like painting have no use to me besides something that I can do. They're not good enough or interesting enough for anyone to buy or anything and I don't even know how I would start with selling them.

I just feel like there is no point anymore. Like I'm just taking up space and like I'm a burden to everyone around me. I just don't know what to do anymore or what I even can do."
739,"I've read lots of stories on here. Lots of us no longer wanting to be here due to current circumstances and I feel my situation is a bit different and wanted to see if anyone can relate or am I crazy for thinking this way. My initial situation was very hard, but there was a way to fix it. My reason for not wanting to fix it is this huge epiphany I had that there will always be problems, and that perspective really discouraged me. Knowing that even if I don't have another problem for the next five years, something horrible will come one day and change my life forever. A loved one will pass away, I'll get some sort of illness, etc. so basically I feel like living is almost a mockery. You get close to ppl in life, and then they die. Yes memories are great but it's almost like it's easier to not be close too people so you can deal with the end better. I feel like I want to go now because there are certain things I just know I wouldn't be able to bear. If I got cancer I wouldn't go through treatment because once I'm healed physically I would have to heal mentally from all the paranoia and pain. So long story short is there anyone out there that gave up not because the present was too hard, but they feel the day to day future will be? Like it's too long? "
740,I am just drained and been feeling down for a while and idk what to do 
741,"I’m (m15) someone where from the outside my life probably doesn’t look bad at all, I’m decent looking, tall, good social circle, keep up with my clothes/appearance, etc. but my point is if I told someone I wasn’t very close with that I was struggling they probably would look at me funny but inside my head it’s a mess. I had a bad childhood to put it short I had a father who left when I was 4 but a step father that stepped in, a abusive mother that I don’t live with anymore, and I was bullied based off appearance (fat lil kid) and to be fair I was a bit weird. So growing up I always felt alone I could count on 1 hand how many friend I had before the 4th grade when I met my first good friend and eventually had a small friend group. I’d say my social mistreatment (I guess?) ended about a year ago when I lost weight (abt 60lbs) and it really does change how people treat you but that’s whole other thing. Also very important to add I stopped living with my mother about 1.5 years ago. My whole life I’ve been a bit discouraged per say and I got in trouble a lot as a kid so you can say I’ve had a bit of issues but I’d say depression probably really started in about the 6-7th grade when bullying was really taking a toll on me and suicidal thoughts didn’t start until the 9th grade, but since then even moving out of my mothers and losing weight my mental health has just been plummeting, obviously the compulsive thoughts of negativity are one thing but the almost constant anger, stress, derealization/depersonalization has been getting to me. 

I also have severe issues with my attachment and how i feel about relationships emotionally, not to gas my self up at all but I would have absolutely no issue getting into a relationship even such with a partner that I find VERY attractive but it just seems like my personality prevents it. On one hand when a girl likes me I’m very avoidant but I will play into it at the start but in the end I kinda always end up ghosting, on the other hand when I like a girl it usually ends the same if it makes it past just flirting but 90% of the time if I like a girl I refuse to talk to her because of stress or when I do, I look back and realize I wasn’t even flirting and if anything seemed like I was trying to brush them off (only sober of course) and I almost practice celibacy if anything (in the sense I don’t really seek out a relationship or anything like that), not to come off insane but I almost find it hard to view a woman as anything other then just another person to talk to or someone to flirt/have sex with. To make it clear I will and I’m good at flirting with people I don’t really have much interest in but not someone I do. I honestly struggle with a lot of human connection, I’m decent at making friends although some people dislike me, I also struggle to talk to my family unless I’m in a good mood. But my point with that last paragraph was that whether it’s my fault or not I kinda feel unloved and alone, that combined with my other issues honestly just make it hard, I kinda wanted to just vent but advice would be nice."
742,"For long time i did not feel that someone love me. No family no friends. I left them on past. So many family issues and what are not deep frendships all i have. I will broke up from my bf in 3 months. I feel disgusting. Miserable. Lost. 
I have a job, two cats except for bf's cats. I live alone. Have so many time, just 15 workdays in a month. 
Im so terrible. Unhappy word is not enough. Im scaring to do sth to myself. Currently sitting on corner of room and crying for hours. I cant talk anything. The scaring thoughts turn around in my mind so fast. I cant even write them. I have nobody to share. I feel lonely. I dont wanna feel sth anymore.

I dont know how to live. The other people how can they live without anyone else ? Life is just meaningfull with your family, friends maybe a lover. How to live ? Why do i live ? I feel so trashy. There is a big space inside my whole body. 

My dad pedophilia sob. My mother have bipolar disorder and they groomed me so bad. I dont want see them anymore. When sb ask them i say that i lost them. I live alone since 2022. I already left them on 2019. My friendship is just about conflict of interest. The only real friend i had, i lost him on 2019. This gave me separation anxiety. And last thing is my bf cheated on me but i cant forgive him in my inside. It s been already 9 months ago but i could not breakup with him because he need me. I cant trust him anymore. I feel so lonely. 

How will i live alone ? Before I had dreams about live in abroad. Going Germany. Living in there. Working in there. With my boyfriend and our 4 cats. Now how can i do all of these things on myself? Or can not i ? I feel so dumb. I feel ignorant. Callow. Useless."
743,"While everyone’s out there living their normal lives
I’m stuck living mine in a messed up country a miserable house and an exhausted soul, why was I even born in this place ?in this body?I wish I was born somewhere I actually belong but instead I’m here in a place that just drains me"
744,"It may sound a bit childish. 
I am gonna die soon in simple words.


Actually I am 20, parents are divorced , no love from family or above average financial support. I was raised an introvert, COVID 2 year isolation also played a role. 

I liked a girl , an year ago, externally i look a normal college student ( college topper initially, now below average), no one can tell what's going on. Looking at my miserable condition, a bit of ego( don't know why) I never told her about it. Even stopped talking to her. 

Now I saw her with her boyfriend. 
I have no friends by the way , cause school ones got seperated.  In college i build a group with scumbags( wrong people)
 

All this combined- loneliness,zero social skills, wrong mindset ( actually initially I used to think my family really love each other) + a fracture an year ago ( I met an accident, cause I was stressed and thinking about something else while driving)  , bmi < 18.5 + career stress. I have not studied properly from 1 year. Right now I can study even for an hour. My parents pay my bills to make me survive, this will go for about 2-3 years. 

I have no hope left i have lost before too , in different ways , but this time I don't wanna fight , I don't want win , it feels either I will die soon or commit suicide, most probably the first one , cause I am coward enough not to do suicide.  "
745,"The recent months have been a true rollercoaster of emotions. From a hopeful and energetic start to now a depressing cope with reality, the harsh truth is: I was being blind. My head was cloudy, I was fooling myself into thinking things weren't ideal but I could figure out. My friends, some things are meant to be and some things are not meant to be. I'm a 27 yr old loner, unemployed, no money, still living with my dad and brother, aimless in life. I dropped out from college in 2023 because I was unhappy, I was feeling that it was all a waste of money, time and energy, I thought it was vain, that college was diverting me from my real dream which is to have my own restaurant, to become a chef of cuisine, so I dropped out from college thinking it was for the best and that I could finally start my career. It turns out that I never found that career, I'm unemployed for two years in a row now, I simply cannot find a job in this area.

It doesn't help me either that I live in a country, in a specific place where there's absolutely no opportunities for me to grow. It doesn't help me that the economy is so bad, it doesn't help me that I'm a loner with no connections, it doesn't help me that I don't have a plan B, C, that I don't have anybody to offer me a hand, nothing helps me. I know people that had a bad start just like me, they had people giving them a hand, giving them a chance, I don't.

So here I am, wanting to grow, wanting to move from my current place, wanting to get a job somewhere, wanting to start a career, wanting to start my personal projects, wanting to somehow get a life. A true tornado of emotions right now, and you know what? This is all for nothing. I am coping with reality, I'll probably never achieve my dreams, I'll probably never see my own projects realized, I'll probably never become something, I'll probably stay where I am.

Some things are how they are, not how we wanted them to be. I'm not happy. I'll always be frustrated with reality, I'll always be hurt by reality. I don't know how to move on from now. I have met with the cold reality of this world dozens of times before, I survived depression, I survived bullying, I survived traumas, I survived loneliness, I survived everything but mediocrity and misery. I don't know if I will.

If I can give an advice to someone else going through the exact same thing of not being able to live the life you so much wanted to be living, I would not say what everyone says which is ""Fulfill your dreams, don't be afraid, jump right into, you only live once, everything will be ok, you can do it"" no, but I would say Think wisely. Think wisely my friends, because the harsh reality is that some things are meant to be and others are not meant to be. This is an advice that I should've followed a long time ago but I guess it's never too late to start thinking more wise.

So yeah, I'll probably never reach my goals, I'll never become the guy I wanted to be. I don't know what this means right now, I still need to evaluate some things, I still need to choose a path from now. I will only say this: I will never give up, there is something bigger than this world, there is something bigger than myself and my dreams, for the sake of this 'thing' I'll never give up, I wanna see where this goes."
746,"Addiction is shit, on the first day you feel like watching something, on the second day there's a break, but the desire remains, Lingering in your mind waiting for any opening to boredom, any free time to strike, the will to stay and fight being replaced by just ""Go, just one more time"", You give in and a huge dopamine rush hits your brain. Soon after, depression sets in, The shame of seeing yourself in this state, looking at the wretched filth that is passing on your cell phone screen, A taboo, something worse than that that shames the body and soul, overflowing into the thought of all the times you've done it with the excuse of ""it's just one more time"". But worse than this feeling that eats away at your body from the inside out, is seeing the self-help app scrolling through your cell phone screen, Having to restart the miserable count of just one day and go back to nothing, Your fight against this shitty addiction is meant to be this, Nothing, just a fight doomed to failure and loss."

I think I'm the problem because everywhere I go , everyone I sit with really ends up showing their true colours towards me .
Im just feeling so sad . I might think of ending my journey . "
748,"I don't have anyone to confide in like that. Not even a stuffed animal. But I just feel sad a lot of the time.

"
749,"Not because I want to—
But because I’m tired.

Tired of men who don’t work.
Men who are lazy, entitled, and stubborn.
Mamas boys who never grow up.
Men with zero emotional intelligence—who can’t listen, can’t understand, can’t care.
Men who only know ML, but not how to be real partners.
Men who aren’t consistent, who show up just enough to keep you hoping, but never fully.

Actually… I’m done.
Done trying.
Done fixing.
Done believing that love from them is worth the pain.

I don’t want to date anyone anymore.
I just want peace.
And I’m finally choosing me.

750,"Today i was throughing tantrum on my mom and my sister called my dad and i was shouting (he's too scared to kill me) idk some thing like this as I was crying and I cry a lot when I'm angry or irritated,now he called whole family and is saying he will kill/throw me Outta house when he comes back I need urgent help or I wont be saved.

751,"I fucking hate humanity. We kill millions of people out of some vague sense of ""moral superiority"". Our side is unquestionably good, the other is indefensively evil. There is no such thing as gray zone.

People sometimes try to restore my hope in humanity by showing someone ""indefensively bad"" being put through the wringer. I'm talking anything from being made a fool to outright killed. People expect me to be happy that some bad guy was hurt. But I simply don't.

There are some truly evil pieces of shit out there that feel no empathy for anyone. But these people are in the vast minority. Most indespicable people has some kind of external force that if not *forced* them, significantly encouraged them. It's easy to say ""I'm above that"" as a person. But you were privileged enough to never even feel compelled to do them.

Take murder for example. It's easy to say ""I would never kill someone"". But you've probably haven't had to ever serious consider it because of things outside of your control. You've probably haven't had to deal with the mental health issues that would compel someone to do it. You've probably haven't had to do this to protect your livelihood. You probably grew up in an environment that told you murder is wrong, but what if you didn't? What if you were raised in an environment that taught you murder was ok, like a gang?

This doesn't excuses anybodys actions. If it did, there would be no point in punishing anyone ever, because everyone has some kind of motive. But the idea that any one man is above acts of evil is absurd. And the idea that commiting immoral acts back to them is justified because no moral person would ever do them is extremely ignorant to why humanity typically does this sort of thing in the first place.

And yet, too many people still have an extremely black and white view on human suffering. Instead of trying to help out people to prevent the motivations for this sort of thing, we rather dehumanize the problem to prevent us from having to consider our own ""evil"".

With the internet, it's easier than ever to see a snapshot of someones life and immediately coin them as indefensably evil. We see public meltdowns, people who were rude or selfish/entitled people all the time. We never stopped to consider what could have led them there, we just watch and treat them like their whole lives were representative of that one moment.

I guess what I'm saying is that it's really makes me sad how we continue to perpetuate terrible things by never thinking about what would it take to be in their shoes. More often than not, it's less than you'd think. And while not every action should be excused, nobody is above any action."
752,"Someone very close to me has depression and is on meds (I don’t know exactly what but I can check). They work too much, don’t make plans with friends, rarely make conversation with family/freinds, etc.

Recently it has been noticed that they are drinking a fair amount, in private. Very bad deal. My hypothesis is that their meds make them numb to everything and they are turning to drinking to try to “feel something”. 

How can I help? What can I do? I don’t know how to approach the situation but something needs to change. "
753,"Yesterday was Mother’s Day and while I got well wishes from those who knew I was a mother, my husband didn’t help my son (who is autistic) to get me a flower or anything. No card, nothing. Then after church, I must not look like a mother because that didn’t happen either. 

I’m worried my birthday, that’s on Friday will be passed over too. I don’t fault my kiddo, he doesn’t understand. I can’t help that I’m walking through life like cellophane. I put in a lot of effort for Father’s Day, birthdays, Christmas, or at least I try. (Hard to do anything special when you’re broke XD). I started to be really naughty, and haven’t gotten caught yet, and I’m waiting for that to drop. The attention I get from that gives me a boost but I want love…and not the kind from parents or family. We have been married for 10 years, I’ve been with him through the death of his mother, his disability diagnosis, and he has stopped trying. I’ve tried to talk to him, ask him if he is depressed but…nothing. I want to be numb. "
754,"I feel like everyone around me already doesn't want to talk to me anymore because I'm so depressed. They haven't told me to my face but I can tell. Talking to me is draining.

But people always say get help. How? How do I ask the people around me, that already show they don't want to talk me, to help me? Opening my mouth just drives people further and further away. And what can talking even do? I've been on the other side of the conversation before so I can already guess. ""Think of your friends and family. You have so much to live for. Things will get better."" Things will probably get better once I'm dead.

I wish suicide wasn't so taboo. What's so bad about dying anyway when we all die at some point."
755,Ever since I can remember I've been deeply emotional. Sometimes it's hard to understand what is even wrong...I just sit there with this weight on my chest. I feel guilty because there are so many other people who are going through so much more than me. Why does it feel like I can barely live? I'm always on the brink of tears. Maybe I'm weak and just can't handle life but I get the most intense feelings of loneliness. I don't want to die but I just want the pain to stop. I feel so selfish...so self absorbed. I have food and a place to live and a family that loves me. Why am I sad?? Why am in so much emotional pain??
756,"Sa pamilya, na dapat sana safe space ko—pero ako pa ang laging sinisisi, ginagamit, binabalewala.
Sa love life, kung saan ako yung laging nagbibigay, nagmamahal, sumusubok—pero laging ako rin ang niloloko, pinapalitan, at tinitiis.
Sa mga kaibigan, na lalapit lang kapag may kailangan—pero pag ako na ang nangangailangan, bigla na lang nawawala.

Wala akong bisyo. Hindi ako masama. Hindi ako perfect pero nagsusumikap ako.
Gusto ko lang naman ng tahimik at masayang buhay, ng pamilyang buo, ng pagmamahal na totoo.
Pero bakit parang lahat ipinagkakait sa’kin?

Ang sakit na. Ang bigat na.
Lagi akong may tanong:
“Lord, ako ba yung problema?”
“Bakit parang ang malas ko sa lahat?”
“Bakit lahat ng tao sa paligid ko, puro panakit, pananamantala, at panloloko lang ang dala?”

Ang dasal ko dati, isang masayang pamilya lang.
Pero kahit yun, ang hirap-hirap makuha.
Parang sa lahat ng aspeto ng buhay, talo ako. Wala akong panalo.

Pagod na pagod na ako.
Lahat ng tama, mali ang balik.
Lahat ng pagmamahal ko, nauuwi sa sakit.

Hindi ko na alam kung kailan ako makakaramdam ng tunay na “bahay.”
O kung mararanasan ko pa ba talaga yun sa lifetime kong ‘to.
"
757,"Sometimes I get little sparks that finally make me do something with my life, but that’s all just temporary and it makes me angry and just want to give up. 

God.. idk man, consistent work just seems like a fantasy to me, and I can never bring myself to do anything consistently, so I just end up dropping it and slowly forgetting about it, or it lingers in my mind 24/7, and I just ignore it.

This isn’t right, something is wrong, I wanna fix this, idk how. Idk if I care to fix it, idk if I even want to fix it anymore.

I don’t wanna imagine the person I could’ve been, I want to become the person so I don’t have to waste my life “imagining” the person I want to be.

Someone help pls"
758,"(sorry if the formats weird or something idk im on my phone and i need to vent)
edit : i lied id kind of like some advice in what to do or how i should cope or whatever. critique or anything idc i cant just keep crying into a void anymore, online and irl

My brain is basing all my value on how I do in school (im in college). I only have one class right now because i struggled so badly in my first semester last year, so i figured I should just start with one class this semester, and as the semesters roll in I figure out how much I can handle in classes. 

As much as I’ve had my ups and downs with school, I’ve never good in English or writing really. That’s the one class I’m taking right now and I’m just sooooo. idk I feel so dumb. The texts I can get and understand but writing an a research paper is fucking me over right now. I was doing okay in the beginning of the semester, and now I’m struggling over this. And like, I know even if I fail this class, it’s not the end of the world for me. I can always retake it, I’ll have to change my ways of studying and some understanding but it’s do-able and I just have to jeep trying. But my mind is just so scared right now I feel frozen and whenever I do try to ask for help now I just feel stupid. If I fail this class it’ll crush me and the low self esteem i already have. My mind is switching states of like “it’s okay if we pass, cool. if we dont pass its still okay. you’ll learn from your mistakes.” to “you should drop out if you cant even do this.” Both voices are loud and messing with me.

And the more I spiral over this, the more I think about other aspects in my life. Like if I cant get over this one class how can I expect myself to do anything else in college? Or in my life? If I do pass this class, will i spiral over something like this again in another class? If I dont do good in college whats the point of me existing?? i dont have any other good qualities about me so if i dont have college to stick to and make even the smallest of something of myself, i dont know what ill do. I know thats just how life is and you have to make mistakes, fail at things, but idk.

i just wish i could blink and be like 10 years in the future. i dont want to be present for any of this. at the same time, now i dont want to necessarily die, but itd be just so much easier than to be in my mind 24/7. but i love my parents too much to do that to them, so i have to hang on and do something"
759,"I feel like there’s a general consensus of activities and things to do to help with the depression: going outside, journaling, setting a routine even if it’s just baby steps like brushing teeth, saying yes to plans, therapy, medicine, staying healthy etc.

But every time I go a few days with me thinking I may be slowly inching my way towards recovery, a wave of depression washes over me out of nowhere and I just feel desolate. I really really am trying my best- taking workout classes (not a lot but I’m off to a slow start), reaching out to friends I haven’t talked to in a while, taking long walks and getting at least 10k steps a day, I stopped ordering grubhub, tried therapy so many times, and am on Wellbutrin(it’s been ~2-3 months). It takes so much out of me but I’m truly giving this my best effort.

The thing is, I’ve pushed so many people away for so long, I have almost no friends even though I’m 25. They’ve all moved on and it’s quite lonely, but I realize it’s my fault. I’m constantly tired, and I find it so hard to enjoy anything. The therapists I’ve tried just tell me to journal and they never understand how I feel. I’ve been on a few different medications for a while and yet I’m still at the bottom of what seems to be like a black pit. 

The only consistency in my life is work from 8am to 8pm everyday. 

Those who have recovered or made significant strides, how do you keep up the motivation? I don’t know what to do. I want to badly for this to stop. It’s such mental anguish and I’m so tired but these huge waves of depression that knock me down are so overwhelming. I’ve never felt anything like this before until I turned 24 and it terrifies me that I’ve been like this for a year and it’s destroyed all the accomplishments and connections I’ve formed in my life "
760,"Everytime I try to do school work for example, I just can’t bring myself to do it because I don’t think it’s worth it at all. Also, sometimes I get small sparks and finally do something, but it’s all just temporary and now I have no energy to do anything. My last resort is to kill myself, but I don’t want to think about that, I want to become someone, finally prove myself that I’m not a loser who just faps all day"
761,"Im only a 16 year old, but why I feel like a 65 year old guy, i constantly think about my future in what I want to be, what will happen and above all the memories of the past. I am overwhelmed by the studies that despite the fact that I study I am not a normal student who passes everything but I continue to fail some and will that really decide my future? My parents had a hard time getting to where they are now and I live well, they on the way to all this did not have a good time and I am grateful for it but I want to go back to when I was 8 years old, I constantly accompanied them to work and I had a good time although I was very shy, from place to place living my life. I curse the fucking coronavirus it took everything from me, until I was 11 I spent them like this always but when the quarantine came and my little sister came everything changed. I don't say it in a bad way, I love my sister too much but she takes up a lot of my time, when I was little I always accompanied my parents to work as I said but now with my sister I just stay at home taking care of her taking away that time to enjoy it and I want her to enjoy it too like I do, not locked up at home with me but it would be very selfish of me to tell my parents to take her to work because I would bother them and as we are now they earn well. This summer I will go to all those places I went to as a child and I will try to find myself and know what I really want to be when I grow up and take one last drink to what made me truly happy and I didn't know how to value."
762,"Yesterday I cried hard enough to throw up. I've cried every day since Wednesday. My depression has kinda been in a ""remission"" of sorts. Anxiety and stress still through the roof. Last week the woman, who i hope hasn't decided to leave me, we got into an argument over some shit, and ive just been stuck with my overthinking, alcohol (great choice right?)and music. I don't do meds because I don't like the other effects they've had on me, so I've been raw dogging it for the last almost 20 years now? I know the whole ""medicine has changed since then"" and ""don't be so down over a girl"". She ain't just any girl. We're both pushing 40 and know what we want, but outside circumstances made us both stress a shit ton. Just trying to vent for a minute, don't have many friends anymore, 1 or 2 that are close.just trying to get this out there is all. Thanks and sorry🖤"
763,"I can't even do the slightest bit of work at my school, I'm just a husk that wakes up and walks every day, and my parents try to help me but I don't want help at this point, forget all the dumb bullshit counseling, I don't want to be social with old fucks who don't know me. I can't do anything and I've accepted that at this point, people just need to leave me alone and let me starve to death already, the only person I can trust telling is my mom but she sucks at helping, and my dad might be my least favorite person I've come to know, he thinks oh all you need to do better in school (my depression is beyond school now) is some HARD WORK, HOW THE ACTUAL FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO WORK WHEN I HAVE NO MOTIVE, SO I GET REMINDED OF SCHOOL WORK EVERY DAY NOW AND I GET YELLED AT WHEN I AVOID IT, GOODNESS HOW HARD IS IT TO DEAL WITH A DEPRESSED PERSON, SO NOW HOME AND SCHOOL ARE SHIT, EVERYTHING IS JUST A PILE OF SHIT, I HAVE NO PURPOSE IN THIS DAMN WORLD, IT WASNT MEANT FOR ME, I HATE EVERY SINGLE FUCKER IVE COME TO KNOW ON THIS STUPID PLANET. I'm tired of treatment, and I'm tired of talking to anyone, everything pisses me off, they want me to do music, I wanted to do music, now I fucking hate it, it's bullshit, I can't even do the thing I studied in right, now there's 2 weeks left of school and I can't recover from anything, my grades are a dumpster fire, BUT I DONT CARE ANYMORE, THE ONLY REASON IM GONNA LIVE IS SO I CAN KILL MYSELF WHEN I GET THE BEST OPPORTUNITY, I HAVE NO FUTURE, GRADES DONT MATTER TO ME. My parents say they don't care about my grades when I need to worry about my health but they do the exact fucking opposite, I've lost my mind and I can't even think anymore, I spend more time on my phone then the total amount of hours I'm in school or talking to anyone, everyone in this world fucking sucks, I can't get any help, it won't work out, and any help that will come is too late to change me, I hate every instance of optimism in this failure of a life, kill me now."
764,"I’ve been struggling with depression for a while now, and honestly, some days are just... really hard. The kind of hard where even simple tasks feel like climbing a mountain. Getting out of bed, making a meal, or even brushing my teeth sometimes feels like it requires more energy than I have.

But here’s the thing I’m learning: it’s okay to not be okay."
765,"To basically start, I’m 34m, I’ve been overworking myself since my early 20’s often pulling 12-15+ hours days multiple times a week for the last 10 years or so; I quit taking meds for adhd when I was 18 because I thought I “didn’t need the help” when in fact I’ve been suffering a lot of the consequences of not taking meds, as I’ve been suffering more and more from depression and anxiety every year. I’m finding myself becoming just randomly overwhelmed when I get home by complete loneliness or sadness. I’ve isolated myself from people outside of work, not to mention live an hour away from pretty much everyone I know, even though I’m one of the most outgoing and well spoken people I work among, I don’t really have any “friends”, I have people that come and go but most often they don’t really talk to me outside of work or just lose touch. I’ve struggled with relationships and being able to maintain one due to how much I work, or not honestly emotionally connecting to anyone really. I own my own home, car, have a small business and work for a small hvac company and have a really good boss, but I still struggle to just pay my bills. I feel like I’ve missed out on the best parts of my life, my time to have a family of my own, to have someone to get old with, as the only person I’ve felt anything with just feels like they’re growing more and more distant. Im always working, 6-7 days a week as I can never get ahead, I’m exhausted from dating. I’m exhausted physically. I just don’t feel like I have a place, or like belong here. I don’t have anyone; and I feel like that’s honestly probably my own fault too. I try to focus on the good things, but I just feel like they’re overshadowed by either terrible dumb luck, or just life. I just feel alone and I don’t know who else to turn to or talk to. I’m really trying my best, and some days I just wish someone cared. "
766,"I had my first therapy session today – and sadly, I walked away feeling more confused and dismissed than supported.

I’ve been feeling emotionally numb, low on energy, and stuck in this strange sense of emptiness for several years now. There are phases where I can barely get out of bed, where even reading an email becomes overwhelming. Despite this, I try to keep going, but it’s exhausting.

So I finally took the step to talk to someone. But within just a few minutes, I felt like the therapist had already made up his mind about me. He barely asked any follow-up questions, seemed puzzled by what I was describing, and said things like: “That’s just life as an adult,” and the one that really hit me: **“I feel that way too sometimes.”**

I tried to explain how hard daily life feels in those moments, and gave an example: “Sometimes I can’t even read through an email.” He replied, “Well, do you want me to read them for you?” – which felt incredibly invalidating.

I also briefly shared about difficult family dynamics that have weighed on me for years, but he didn’t ask anything further. No questions about suicidal thoughts, no real exploration of how I was coping, my support system, or anything personal beyond the surface.

In the end, he said he didn’t really think I needed therapy and recommended mindfulness classes – but only for self-paying clients.

I get that therapy resources are limited. I really do. But I didn’t come in demanding a diagnosis or treatment plan – I just wanted someone to **take me seriously** and help me understand what’s going on with me. Instead, I left feeling like my feelings were just brushed aside.

**Have any of you experienced something similar in a first session?**  
Did you try again with someone else?  
Right now I’m unsure if I should keep trying or if I’m just “not bad enough” to deserve help.

Thanks for reading."
767,"I don't understand how people survive each day , i envy almost everyone. I wish i would just pass away rn , tired of everything "
768,"i cant escape, everything is reminding me of the thoughts, of the pain that i felt. I dont know if its some sort of trauma, or my brain just wanting to fuck with me even when the thoughts had stopped, but struggling with OCD was one of the worst things to happen to me and i just cant get away from it. Its like when the thoughts stop, everything around me still reminds me of myself. Existing in this life, realizing that a year ago in the exact moment i was probably crying myself to sleep and doing horrible things to myself, it haunts me. Mind you, having to face the people and things that your thoughts would attack is so hurtful. Its like i dont think i can live a normal life, i will always be reminded of the thoughts, i will always go by what i should and should not do, believe that i really am just a fucking monster, that i will never be able to have children, or a husband. That the existence of a man makes me feel physically sick because the thoughts my brain would tell me that these men were going to brutally hurt me. Im so tired, and im so sick of it. Ive basked in the pain for so long that anything else put emptiness feels wrong and foreign. I dont think i will every be able to be my old self and that makes me so so so scared for my future. Mind you, im failing highschool because i took a year to prioritize fighting my brain and trying to stay alive. So now my first year of high school, and im fucked. I dont know what to do anymore."
769,"i dont have friends, barely any family, so there is really no one to talk to, and therapists are real fucking expensive in my country, thats why i come here. for the last weeks i have been feeling like im in this type of limbo, this purgatory where i hate my life, yet im so tired and unhappy to even kill myself, or maybe not even that, just not doing it, so im just stuck in this limbo where the only thing i do is remember my awful past, look and my present and say ""man, i havent changed at all, im fucking filthy"" and go back to sleep and occasionally go to school to see all the happy people and remember how miserable i am. how do i get out of this nightmare and at least try to like life so i get out of this cruel god's punishment? the closest thing to therapy i have is this and listening to solace by earl sweatshirt on loop."
770,"Hi. I’ve been on antidepressants for years now and recently, I’ve had more bad days than good. I’m pretty apathetic these days and while I have moments where I feel genuine joy, they don’t last long. The main issue is that I’m too apathetic now to do much that would help, like getting more sleep or drinking more water or something. I’m waiting for a psychiatrist referral but I really think something needs to change soon and those referrals are usually months out. 

Idk does anyone have any suggestions? I miss my old self. "
771,Hello I lost my earbuds yesterday and that was the straw that broke the camels back. I’m going to divorce my wife and quit my job. I’m sick of this shit. 
772,"Alice in wonderland the cartoon one....whem she gets big and cry's a bunch and then gets small and ends up in the bottle just floating and she says something like ""boy I wish I hadn't cried so much"" I feel that regularly 😂 especially when I'm depressed and crying after when I sitting there that pops in my head IDK why I feel bad crying and being depressed...like I big disappointment. The fact I have all this problems and my brother is normal really pisses me off...my mom said he was in the navy and he went through stuff and idk how he feels about that and I understand that but I constantly hate myself and wanna die once my mom dies IDK what I'll do. When she dies I die I say that to her often and she always says no you'll have money live on go on a trip buy things...she doesn't get once she is gone no one will love or care about me like she does....she has been through every mental hospital I've been in ( 6 times I've tried to kill myself clearly God hates me wants wants to torture me) my brother doesn't care and my dad also has depression and he is there for me but my mom is my rock. I don't have a boyfriend (I feel bad having men deal with me) I don't have kids (also feel bad I don't want to be like my dad I remember his depression when I was little) all I have is a dog 
Sometimes I wish I had a kid just someone who would love me forever and maybe if I had a kid I could figure everything out but I don't wanna do that and bring a kid into this world when I'm depressed 24-7. I don't wanna hurt a child who didn't ask to be born. I just wish I was normal. I'd give anything to be normal if God popped down and said if you die right now you'll be reborn and normal and all youwant will come true if so I do it instantly but I know that you ont happen. I eveny normal people.

773,"First of all I have a long post. Feel free to skip if you do not feel like reading right now.

I don’t really know where else to begin than at the start. On thanksgiving 2023, my wife was pregnant. We also have two other children. I work as a firefighter/paramedic and on the drive from our home to my MIL I began to feel sick. I spent the entire thanksgiving with fevers and it progressively got worse.  When we left it got to the point where breathing was hard so we went to the ER. I was diagnosed with influenza A and while it isn’t that dangerous of an illness it was a pretty bad one for me this time.  

Anyways, I passed it to my wife and after five days of coughing aggressively and feeling in the dumps she woke up to the entire bed covered in blood.  My first impression was she miscarried. After getting things cleaned up we went to the ER again and she was told she had a hematoma but the baby was fine. This happened at 12 weeks gestation. 

She continued to bleed every day for the next 9 weeks. She was in and out of doctors offices and was eventually diagnosed with marginal placenta separation.  At 21 weeks and 5 days gestation her water broke and the doctor at the hospital sent us home and told us to prepare for a still born.  I decided to take her to another hospital that was near where I worked and was a children’s hospital where they admitted her. 

At 22 weeks and 2 days gestation, my wife was rushed in for an emergency cesarean section due to the baby’s heart rate dropping.  She gave birth to my son who weighed 1lb 4oz and was 11 3/4 inches long.  We spent 176 days in the NICU during this time.

When my son was born I took a leave of absence from my job to be there for my wife and kids.  My wife stayed at the NICU while I took care of the day to day with the other kids. In August my son was discharged from the NICU on some oxygen and a feeding tube.  Nothing we couldn’t handle.

Well in January my son contracted human metapnuemo virus and RSV. This required a hospital visit and they admitted him on January 10th. On January 17th they had to intubate him and put him on a ventilator.  We have now been in the PICU since January 10th and we’re just told that they don’t expect us to be out before the end of the year.

He is still on a ventilator, has a tracheostomy, g/j tube now, a broviac catheter for vascular access, and we were just told after he had to have eye surgery that his eye disease is the worst the surgeon has ever seen and that he will eventually go totally blind.

This whole time I have fought with my depression. I am very familiar with the darkness (I am a combat veteran who fought out of alcoholism and depression before). This depression this time is so intense though. I have gained nearly 80 pounds in the last 15 months, I have found myself lacking basic hygiene like brushing my teeth or forgetting to put deodorant on. I have always been a physically fit person and hygiene has always been important to me. 

I sit here and think that I am just watching my son fight a losing battle and that he is slowly dying on me. I am assured by the doctors that that is not the case but I can’t help but think that. I have shutoff from my wife and have watched here grieve in silence as she just thinks I am an emotionless asshole but the whole time I am crying inside. I know I will get through this and by acknowledging I am depressed I can finally begin to climb out of this hole.

I have been going back to grief counseling for the past month and I have spoke to my wife during that time as well.  We are working through it but man sometimes there are things I just can’t say to her about my feelings.  

If you have read this far I appreciate it. I’m not really sure what I’m looking for but I’m accepting any and all advice on ways to get out of this hellhole."
774,"I'm only 19, how will I do this for the rest of my life? I hate my job, I have hated all my jobs. All I can think about at work is how much I want to kill myself when I get home. But I don't have the guts to do that. I wish I did. I got denied the job I really wanted, now I'm stuck at a terrible place where every day is so boring that when I get an angry customer it is almost a good thing. I hate it, I don't want to go another day, someone please end the pain. I am not going to eat anything so that when I go to work I might pass out and get to go home."
775,"I’m going through a nasty breakup. Reading and engaging with posts on this subreddit helps me get through it, just as it has in other rough patches of my life. Seeing that other people are going through similar circumstances as me reminds me that I am not alone. It’s ok for me to have this pain, and I am not a failure. So if you’re feeling worthless, know that you being present here and sharing your stories means the world to me. "
776,There’s some female friends I was considering to be my girlfriend but they gave me signs that I wasn’t fully worthy for it. I’m almost becoming empty after a long time not finding the one woman for me.
777,"I’m 15 and want nothing more than to kill myself, the only thing stopping me is knowing that i’m loved and i can’t do that to my family. Everytime i think about it i also think about their reactions and it stops me. I also can’t cry i think it’s emotional suppression, i took cutting myself as the alternative but i can’t even do that recently which i guess is a good thing but i want to so fucking bad i just can’t bring myself to do it. Growing up i’ve always been super emotional and known as a crybaby and a bitch and now i can’t cry at all and i don’t know what to do with myself. I just drag myself through the day picturing blowing my brains out constantly and im too scared to ask for therapy. Recently i told my gf abt most of it and i regret it, i only did cuz she was sleeping and i was drunk and fell asleep before i could delete the message. we had a hard conversation and she basically said i need to try to get better or she’ll breakup with me, she said “i wont date the shell of a person” so im quitting drinking and quitting carts im only gonna smoke gas occasionally. Idk what to do i want to cut myself so bad and i can’t it’s making me feel worse about myself and i already fucking despise my self with all my heart anyone got any advice abt how to stop holding myself back and just fucking cut.

(EDIT)
i see a lot of you talking about my gf and she has offered support before she said that in fact and to be fair i haven’t really been trying to get better and she said i need to try harder and then said that. Only saying this to see if that changes anything not trying to defend her or attack her in anyway. "
778,"But I don't hate her. She makes me cry more than I've ever cried with anyone or anything else, and I try to deal, because she's bipolar but she always flips her attitude to me she gets mad at me then she starts speaking to everyone else like nothing happened. I try not to be mad, she always has something to say. She doesn't like the way I dress, she doesn't like the way I do stuff, like how she calls me lazy, for jumping around she said ""No ____ you don't have ADHD your just lazy"" I don't get how ADHD ties up into being lazy. She never listens to what I have to say, and she tells me to talk to her about what happens at school, then when I do she says it's too much drama like it's my fault. Yes she buys my clothes feeds me makes sure I'm alright but it gets to a point where I cannot stand to be around her now I'm catching attitudes towards her on accident, cus it just slips out. But what am I supposed to do when bad stuff just keeps getting thrown at me like rocks that have been thrown at me for a real long time. I don't like being around her and Everytime I actually am happy or energetic she acts like all the life is sucked out of her. But I don't know what I'm supposed to do because she does all this stuff for me and I feel like I owe it to her now. And I'm stuck on really staying to myself or being that real nice person everyone likes, like all the people I see. Then when I really do it she doesn't like it, but she swears I have to keep my head up and be happy. So I'm not gonna stay this is really a plan I have, it's obviously not easy but it kinda needs to happen "

780,"I have no thoughts at all. I cannot follow movies or books, I might as well be staring at a wall instead of trying to watch or read. The only thoughts I have are wondering where I went wrong. I can’t get a job because I quite literally cannot process anything. I’ve been like this for at least 7 years. What is the point."
781,"My Sibling ignores my text and from others.

When we have family gatherings he doesnt show up. When I am near his house, I stop by and knock on his door but he never opens the door. 

I am worried he is depressed or needs help but I don't know how to help. 

Should I just let him be and let him figure out his own problems. FYI we have never had bad blood between us. So I don't know why this started. It started during Christmas time.

782,"So I had a bad day, depression has been high. The fears of dying alone with no.. family of my own have been pushing in. The fear of not finding a wife, or kids, or having meaning in my life really got to me. So much so that I caught myself playing ark survival evolved and spent an hour just.. commuting suicide. Jumping off cliffs feeding myself to predators. Anything to do it. And I oddly felt better I'm not sure what this means. My education in psychology is high-school level at best. "
783,"Lately I wake up and get ready, go to work, class and home, but I’m so mentally tired.I already went to a psychiatrist and they gave me medication for depression and anxiety, but I only used it for a month cause my family doesn’t believe in that and my mom made me quit it (Im under her insurance and I’m a broke college student)I was doing better for a bit  after I stopped taking them but then at night or early in the morning I just feel like I’m a waste of space and just wonder how much better it would be if I wasn’t here anymore.I’m a bit of a coward to actually do something to myself( I do consider it an option on a daily) but I just wish my mind would stop suffocating me. I can’t say I have a bad life I have a bf, friends and my parents, but I just feel like I’m a burden to all of them. //Me and my bf have been dating for a year, but our relationship has been declining //and My friends are nice but I can’t really discuss stuff like this with them, I don’t want them to think less of me. And my parents are just sweet but the pressure and their expectations of me are so high I just don’t think I can do it, I’ve tried asking them to cut me some slack but they don’t seem to hear me (I sort of understand because I’m an only child for some part)I know everything sounds good but In my head I just don’t understand why I’m so miserable and no matter how hard I try and how much I keep telling myself that I’m just fine, I just keep falling down. I’ve been taking Benadryl to sleep for months because at night my thoughts just consume me. There’s so much more in my life going on but I really don’t want to go into details and I’m scared to go to a psychiatrist again, b/c I never really opened up to her about the feelings I had of just offing myself but my mom said she’s ok with me taking medication again because of a conversation I had with her when we were drinking.But I’m just so scared to ask for help atp. Please someone tell me if there’s other ways to help me get out of this hole.I feel like my mind is so deep buried under ground than my body ever will or it might idk anymore."
784,"sometimes i get like delirious? i dont know. and like i want to cry, but i dont cry, i can breathe, but i cant breathe, i feel drunk a lot and talk fast and walk fast and just talk for no reason. and i want to run and dance and jump and be wild, but then i also want to sit down and never get up. my legs feel weird as well and my brain is either racing or has nothing in it. its weird. like then im okay for like a second, and then i think about the thing thats giving me a ""panic attack"" and then it comes back.

i might think this is a panic attack because i always get them. i feel like they are normal at this point. i already feel lighthead just writing this down.

i feel like im faking it, but i dont know. is this a panic attack, and if it isnt, then what the fuck happens to me when this happens?

i feel like this is just some sort of mental illness, but like im only a teenager and maybe this is normal? somebody please tell me if this is normal or not. "
785,"Hi guys. I’ve recently got into a break-up that wasn’t mutual, and I was the one who wanted it. She was very sweet but I just did not want to be in a relationship anymore and I often dreaded having to talk to her. She had lots of emotional baggage to where I had to comfort her nearly every day and it took a toll on me, mostly because I didn’t have a chance to talk about my feelings more often.

Prior to this I think I was already falling into depression. Every day going into school just felt like a punch in my gut, I always wake up wondering when it’ll be over. I don’t think I’ve ever felt like this until this year. Every day I contemplate if I should just drop out, or if I can endure this any longer..

Because of my break up, I no longer have any friends. Everyone already has their own friend groups figured out. I don’t want any shit like “putting yourself out there”. I’m just done. Completely. I have accepted the fact that I have no close friends and will have to push through for 2 more years. I don’t wanna live here anymore, I want to move. Anything to get rid of this hole in my chest. To get rid of this unbearable feeling of sadness whenever I’m alone.

I find myself trying to distract myself from the things that I have done. The thoughts of myself in my head, how lowly people must think of me. I want to change but how can I? How can I when whenever I do it all seems wrong? No matter what I did for her it was wrong. No. Fuck that, I don’t want to change anymore. Whatever I do, whatever friendships or relationships I have I just manage to lose it all. Everything. Why is it different when it comes to me? Why do shitty people get the most friends? Why doesn’t anybody want to be my friend? Why do people look at me as if I’m a monster? 

Sorry for this blabber. Maybe I should have put it in r/OffMyChest

786,What’s one thing you do to lift yourself up when going through a very dark time? 
787,"Planning a wedding with a partner that tells you ""I have no feelings for you"" and you still have to hang on because you've been together for almost a decade. 
You went against family and religion and your parents took your side which is difficult putting them in a strained relationship with their relatives and forcing them to lie.
Being the only one out of many coworkers to not be invited to things anymore when they used to invite you a lot last year. Telling them how nice we should go out again and the next day seeing a picture of them hanging out without you. 
Can't talk to any friend about my relationship issues as it's embarrassing. 
Going to work everyday dreading it. I love my work and I love my manager so much, he lets me get by too many things and I don't see myself leaving. But dreading going there and sitting alone at lunch break every single day. Because being alone would be better than sitting with others and hearing them talk about their hangouts. Because they will keep asking me about how the wedding planning is going and I have to lie and pretend everything is perfect.
Realizing that the only close friend you had, didn't share her secrets with you for 5 years because she's ""very reserved"" meanwhile you realized you told her everything about you from a-z expecting a real ""best friend"". Having that same friend raise her voice at you at a restaurant. And keeping that same friend to be your wedding witness because she's still the closest. 
Having people ghosting me throughout the years. 
I'm that overly friendly friend that says sorry 10000 times, who people say ""stop saying sorry, it's tiring"".

I hate living. 
I never liked it. 
I never asked for it. 
I lost a friend so I know the grief it leaves people. 
And I can't burden people with that grief. So I have to stay like an empty shell. I hate life. I hate it so much. It's so long. So, so, so long. "
788,"So after 15 years of depression I'm having an okay period. Turns out a keto diet is what did it for me? It was definitely not high on my list of possible solutions, but for some reason my Prozac hits totally differently on it.  
  
I got my shit together enough to just barely complete a 1 year diploma, in the hopes that it will help me get out of retail work which is soul-crushing, and earn more so I can have a decent lifestyle someday. Everyone's happy for me.  
  
But I just finished the course and I keep swinging between being proud and optimistic, and feeling completely overwhelmed by the path ahead. I don't know if office work will actually be an improvement or I'll just be miserable again. I know job searching will be an absolute ordeal. The anxiety and depressed feels like it's just waiting for me to slip so it can get its claws in me again.  
  
I also feel guilty when I see my family so relieved, realizing how much stress they felt about my condition. I'm trying to focus on the fact that they're happy now, but it gnaws at me, tells me I'm a selfish piece of shit. I don't want to go back, I CAN'T go back. I just feel like I'm Sisyphus and I finally got the boulder to the top, only to find out I have to just hold it there forever now."
789,"Hi all my bf had severe depression and also some other mental things. If u have any advice other than just leave him in would appreciate it immensely. We have been together over a year and he has times where he suddenly no longer wants to be with me, due to overthinking and wanting to protect me.

This time he has said that although he loves me and wants to be with me. He craves isolation more, away from expectations he feels i have of him or his own. He said he’s not at peace with himself and he just wants to be alone. He feels like he’s drowning .. and i just want to be there and be with him.

is there anything i can do to help him feel like being with me is less hard. Anything i can say to convince him to let me come see him to talk and TRY (long distance relationship but i am meant to be going to him this week)"
790,"I’m retired now, but I was a wage slave for 40 years.  I remember how life sucked when I was in my 20’s.  At that time, I lived alone in a one-bedroom apartment.  I had no friends, no spouse, no family I cared about.  The people at work were the only people I interacted with.  I didn’t like them, and they didn’t like me.  I had no furniture, just a mattress on the floor and a TV.   It was work, eating, watching TV, sleeping, and repeat.  (no computers or smart phones).   It was mind numbing and I often thought about ending it all.  I probably would have too except for one event.  I was in a terrible car accident.  I was T-boned by a mac truck, and my car was absolutely demolished.  Yet somehow, I walked away without a scratch.  Nothing.  If you saw the car, you would have said no way.   

Here's the part where most people say they found God and lived a fulfilling life.  Not me.  Life continued to throw crap my way.  I found someone, got married and for a short time, life was bearable.  Then she ran off with our dentist and divorced me.  Her dentist lover had the money for a great lawyer, and I ended up broke.   I was back in a one-bedroom apartment except this time I had to pay for child support.  I came close to ending it all again, but I kept thinking, why didn’t I die in the wreck?   There must be a reason.  I used to yell at God, “why are you torturing me?”  I would imagine being surrounded by little devils with pitchforks jabbing at me.  But I didn’t kill myself for one reason, I just couldn’t do that to my son.  I finally remarried, had more kids, and life became somewhat bearable.

I think when you get old, you build up a type of shield around yourself and things just don’t bother you the way they used to when you are young. So, I trudged onward.   Now, as the end draws near, I find myself eagerly waiting for the afterlife.  I can’t wait to get there.  I have questions.

794,"Hi, I have a strange question. I want to know if anyone else is like this too. 
 For a backstory; my dad lives in a smaller town, while my mom moved to a large city. I’ve been living in my dad’s town since 2017. However, recently i moved with my mom to the city for the summer. Being there for a while made my depression easier to manage, and I’m really happy there. For some reason, every time I hit my dad’s town, dread fills my stomach and after a few days, my depression becomes less manageable. 

My therapist has noticed I’m feeling/looking happier since I’m in the big city. (I don’t want to say with my mom bc I barely see her due to her work, same goes for my dad). I just feel like my dad’s town (I was born and raised here) is too much. 

  I can explain more if you’d like; but this is a mini rant- I hope someone else feels the same, because I feel crazy. 😭"

It never fucking leaves me, all I want is to simply feel okay and to feel safe and secured it’s insane to me that I’m literally asking for the bare minimum I shouldn’t be struggling this much life is simply not meant for me. Why am I still trying it fucking aches  "

797,"it’s my first Reddit post ever I literally signed up 10 minutes ago, so I don’t really know what to expect but I just thought I should share some stuff. I’ve been dealing with depression pretty much my whole life, in my teenage years anxiety took over mostly cause I was too busy with achieving and being perfect. But, ever since I had to create my own life and actually use my free will I felt this overwhelming numbness and exhaustion, nothing felt fun or worth the effort or the anxiety. I’ve never been su|c|dal, cause death terrifies me, and because I’m so baffled by the fact that so many people actually enjoy life that I can’t just ignore that. I want to know what it feels like so bad, do people actually feel content and fulfilled, or just live through the days without thinking about it, what makes them get up in the morning? Just racing though capitalisms predetermined life plan of work with the occasional simple pleasures or vacation and social interactions? How is that worth the effort? And I can go on and on about relationships which are a whole other mystery for me, I’ve had many friends in life but lost most of them and never felt like I actually get that deep connection that everyone keeps talking about (I’m talking platonically) anyway I can try to explain myself forever but I guess I should stop here and wait to see if I will set any discussion, please be kind thank you :) "

799,"My mother passed on Valentine’s Day. My soul dog passed the November before that. As I’m still not adjusting well to that I realize that I haven’t been loving my life at all for a while.

I’m running out of motivation to do anything anymore, I pretty much just run on inertia at this point.

Just 2 weeks ago my dad took me to the capital of my hyperfixation and i felt nothing. I didnt have the heart to tell him.

802,"Hi all,

How do I cope with my health slowly declining? I've been doing my best with doctors appointments, trialing supplements/meds/lifestyle changes, and therapy but I'm not able to adequately control my physical symptoms. My mental health is garbage as well and that makes things so awful - I have to do a million things to control it (journaling, meditation, acupuncture, light exercise, talking with friends, therapy, etc) and it's still not enough. These things will just get harder as my body declines. I can't tolerate antidepressants due to severe side effects (my mind and body are apparently extremely sensitive to med side effects and doctors don't know much about this). Leaving my home for treatment is very strenuous due to fatigue. I develop a new symptom every couple months at this rate that limits my life even more. How do I cope with getting further into a psychiatric and physical hell and slowly dying? Is there any way to make it not hell or do I have to accept a living hell for the next few months or years? I'm sure there are things I can do to lower my chance of this happening but there's no guarantee that I can reverse my symptoms, so I think I should prepare for this possibility. I don't think science has caught up to me and my health."

807,"Hello, I'm an Indian girl who recently turned 15. Just some basic information. Please read this so you understand why it's hard for me to speak to my parents.
Yes, there are stereotypes that coloured people beat their children. It's true for most... but what I go through is abuse. I wished this was a joke. But it's not. 
My mother and father bith have drawn blood by how much they hit me.
I have OCD and they still hit me in the dirtiest places of the house and spit on me... and bit me... and once, as a kid, they made me eat my food on a dirtied place on the floor. Yes, no plate, just floor.

So, I think, it's serious. No, I won't be telling any authorities about my parents. Seriously, I have my reasons.

Anyway, so now it's clear why I can't tell My parents that I have depression. I have cut myself A lot. My anxiety made me harm myself to bleeding point at school, too. My teachers didn't tell my parents anything. Anyway, so, I have tried to kill myself 3 times now. Once by almost jumping (my maid called for me), second by slicing my wrist (didnt hit anything), third by slicing my neck (too shallow, but there was a white line). 

I used to have a counselor at school. I told her about my parents' abuse. I no longer went to her after that.

So, enough with the pick-me, my point is, how do I tell them? I'm supposed to give my boards (equivalent to SATs or smthng) and i'm not allowed to sleep more than 5 hrs. I really need this sleep, I literally can't think. Well, my parents are hounding me even more. My mother has threatened me and kept me in line by using her own suicide as a method. My father... only screams at me but never speaks.

How can I tell them such a thing? Please please please help me, online strangers. I cry with no feeling and want to die with no passion; how do I tell them I might have depression?"
808,how do i stop my depression?
809,"please if you're as old as me or around my age, please talk to me. im indian so if you're one as well there would be more to relate on. let's talk about our worries and traumas and whatever. im tired of relying on imaginary people in my dream for comfort. "
810,"I think hope is the devil. It has been offered to me by family, friends, and healthcare professionals and it doesn’t help. 

“I just have a feeling things are gonna get better for you” 

Or

“You gotta just think positive about the future. Tons of people get better”

Or the absolute worst:

“For some people it take YEARS before they find the right treatment.”

GEE THANKS, that makes me feel much better. Meanwhile, while y’all are looking at an invisible fantasy that you have NO PROOF of that could take YEARS, I am stuck, horrifically suffering in the present. 

Let’s cut the crap. We both know that neither of us have any idea if I will get better. 

“You could get better” is the exact same thing as saying “you could not get better. “ 

So please stop offering hope. It’s insulting. Instead, try to meet me where I’m at. Where it’s frightening and painful and nobody really knows if it’ll get better. Then you will actually be being a friend and helping me feel less alone and I will feel like you actually see me. 

"
811,"I (28F) feel so exhausted by my family and it’s draining me mentally and physically. 

For context, I have lived here for about a year and a half. I moved back home after leaving an abusive relationship with my kid. I had nowhere else to go and my family wanted me to come back home to support me and help me get back on my feet. I’ve been extremely blessed to have a supportive family, but it has definitely been a struggle trying to get into a routine with them. Being independent and living on my own for nearly a decade has made it a struggle to live here as my parents (especially my step mom) tend to argue with me on my lifestyle. One example being that as a newly single parent, I was going to therapy and trying to date around. However, my parents would constantly be nosy and then lecture me on how they don’t want me doing that and to go to church and do my own thing. I agreed with them to an extent, but told them I’m an adult and that if I choose to try and meet someone, that’s my decision. I’m not a child anymore. While I understood it was also their house I’m living in, I left one relationship to where everything I did was monitored (by my partner) and now I’m back in another one with my parents. It’s suffocating me. 

Another issue has been living with my sister again (23F), and she is hot and cold with me. Sometimes we get along and I’ll buy her food or we’ll hang out. Then other times she’s complaining about me to our step mom, other siblings (on the game), telling everyone my business or trying to say I’m not doing anything or helping her. Mind you, I have helped her out so often whether it was financially or support wise. She has come to me for things she would lie to our parents about, but then throw me under the bus when she got pissy about something. She gives me an attitude, uses my things I buy (shampoo, sanitary pads, lotions) but if I try to use hers she flips out and locks them in her room. My step mom favors her over me generally.

Recently, I am just at a point where I am miserable. They have exhausted me to the point I don’t even want to hang out with them much. I’m in a new relationship with someone for the past 6 months, and we want to marry before moving in together, so it’s been difficult trying to not to imagine running off and just eloping so I can leave this house. I have gone to school and when things happened, I have to wait to go back, it has been hard to find a job that will give me enough to move out, and I’m just extremely depressed from all of this. My step mom and my sister have made living here miserable and suffocating, and while I love them and am grateful, I miss having my own space where I could do what I want when I wanted with my kid. I have even decided that when I am able to move out, I will distance myself from them for a while to just take time for myself and my kid. I am just tired, and I feel so guilty because they have let me move back until I can get back on my feet. But it just feels like one trapped situation to another. I don’t know how to deal with this, I don’t want to suck it up anymore. I want to leave, but finances keep me trapped here. "
812,"I’m tired. Everyday I wake up and it’s a struggle to do anything. I don’t want to kill myself, I just don’t want to do anything. Everyone thinks I’m so lazy and unmotivated but I don’t want to be like this. I’m just so tired. Tired of getting up everyday and doing the same monotonous routine day in and day out. I know that this is just what being an adult is but I’m struggling. My boyfriend thinks I sleep in for fun but it’s actually because I try to avoid starting the day for as long as I can, because I don’t want to live it. He thinks I’m lazy since I can’t get the same grades he did and lose every time in chess but my brain is so tired and foggy all of the time. I can’t bring myself to try anymore. Therapy is a waste of money because I’ve intellectualized all of this already, and medication just makes me even more apathetic. I’ve lived like this for over a decade already and I don’t know how I can’t live this rest of my life like this. I don’t even know if this is something that I can treat anymore. Sometimes I make the joke that I was born sad, but it doesn’t really feel like a joke anymore. "
813,"Drugs. 

they didnt mean help, they all meant i needed drugs. 

really fucking heavyweight drugs. 

i let it out, i talked like they told me to, the shrink discharged me because my problems are real, and i pretty much did CBT all on my billy. 

thanks for that. it was fuck all help.

so they gave me a chemical 'shut the fuck up.'

and i tried it. and it works. and withdrawal is fucking horrible and if i miss a couple of doses i lose my fucking mind and if i take it i feel like a halfwit for the first 3 or 4 hours of the day and i cant sleep without it and sometimes i cant sleep with it and i cant eat or drive or think straight and i get twitches that the doctors say i might need some more drugs for.

drugs for my drugs?  

but they were right. apparently everyone else is a lot more comfortable now im fucking sedated. 

  
life was better when i was a fucking psycho and i didnt care."
814,"22 male. I have this insane thing where I feel as though I don’t deserve anything. Not in the sense of just basic things like I don’t deserve happiness, but literally everything in general is something I don’t deserve

My self hatred almost feels like a comedy sketch. Like it’s extreme to a point of feeling almost like I’m trying to fulfill a quota of stupidity

Everyone feels depressed at points, it’s a part of life. But I feel depressed like 24/7. But I still get out of bed and go to work because I fucking have too. I don’t deserve to say I have MDD, it is an insult to the people who genuinely have it and experience it on a daily basis. I’m just a weak idiot bitch who needs to get his shit together

Everyone goes through shit, I barely have bad things in my life and yet I act like it’s over and I’m fucked for life. The fact that I barely have gone through life and feel this depressed every fucking day proves how weak I am

I don’t deserve to say I’m clinically depressed. I don’t deserve medications even. It’s all a waste in comparison to someone else who is genuinely suffering from the illness. Everything sucks. I am a piece of shit who genuinely cannot do anything right and it sucks. Why do I fail every fucking day? Why do I always feel like a burden and as though I’m hurting people by merely existing? It feels like everything is wrong and I can’t fucking fix it

Why? I don’t event deserve to make this post on Reddit, who am I to feel this way like genuinely? It’s probably not that deep. I’m probably exaggerating and all of these negative emotions are fucking me being an absolute weak idiot who doesn’t deserve anything

Maybe im secretly a hedonistic bastard who just craves pleasure and dopamine 24/7 and isn’t actually suffering at all

The fact that I qualify my good life position rn as suffering proves that I am so weak beyond comprehension

Even if there are people “doing worse than me”, they got their reasons man. Childhood trauma, bad life situations, bad family etc.

I have no reason to be this way. I’m just fucking dumb

I just want to slit my skin, nothing deep, just skin breaking but I am worried. Its not easy to just reach out to someone as I also have social anxiety. The reason I am worried is because I don't know where the best place to do it is to make sure I don't like break arteries/veins and I only want to break the skin to bleed slightly.

I even started being more sociable and less socially anxious as I’ve gathered the courage to reach out to a person I’m interested in- and it’s actually going incredibly well. 

Yet, I feel as if I can’t shake away the crushing loneliness and sadness that has been haunting me for my whole life. 

I know I should be happy, I know that my life is going great right now but I just cannot feel any of the happiness I should be feeling. 

It’s almost like I know things aren’t going to stay that way/ and even if they do I am so scared of always being depressed. I just don’t want to live this way. I don’t want to be unhappy for seemingly no reason at all for the rest of my life.

I generally don’t like speaking to others about my feelings (which is why I use Reddit lol) as I don’t want to burden anyone with my problems or even worse: Make them feel bad. 

But at the same time I don’t know for how much longer I can keep going on like this. I feel like I will eventually “explode” after keeping so much emotion, so much sadness, anger and loneliness bottled up inside of me. 

As much as I want to connect with people I fear always being the odd one out because of my inability to truly share and express myself in my emotions and personality."
818,"I (M, 22) was T-boned on my way to work last March and I’ve been in pain every day since.

I am the youngest of three, my two older brothers are on the Autism Spectrum and I’m expected to take care of them after my parents die. My mother is chronically ill. My father and I are the only sources of income for my family.

I suffer from chronic daily migraines and chronic back pain. I’ve only just began to get medication for my migraines, but have to fight tooth and nail with my health insurance to receive treatment. Currently I am without any medication because of insurance denial and a shortage caused by the tariffs.

I’m tired. Tired of the constant pain. I still have to work despite the excruciating daily pain. I’ve seen a therapist for my PTSD. All of my free time is spent in doctor’s offices or lying in bed, paralyzed from the pain.

The only thing that brings me relief is the thought of death. I have too many people relying on me to kill myself. No one knows the scope of my pain, only the surface level. My doctors say that there is a chance that it will go away, but I’ve given up on that prospect. No one knows about my constant suffering or my suicidal ideation. My true thoughts are too dark for the people in my life to truly understand.

I just wanted to experience some catharsis by sharing this to a bunch of anonymous strangers, that’s all."
819,"Is it normal to think about dying it's been an reoccurring thing since middle school I mean I did research h on it but no plan just an odd curiousity it's a frequent thought popping up in my head, Im in university a good one I should probably feel proud, first time venting I never really talk to anyone I have friends but I don't want to bring negativity, also if it's an factor I always wanted to outside my hobby but i have no money, I often see no point feel like the future is gonna be bleak but I'm productive like I'm normal, so I guess people are like these everyday? I haven't talked to therapist it's too expensive, Id much rather get food, English are not my first language sorry have to talk because it's kind of heavier nowadays so I can't let it be too heavy I feel like it's gonna affect my work study life thank you"
820,"Lost two close friends to suicide, one to cancer, they are all such awesome, loving amazing people, that I will no longer be able to ever open up to, I’m alone again, and I don’t know what to do with all this grief, they’ve helped through late nights in which I felt suicidal, but now I’ve got nobody, and I try to fill this hole with other people, but nobody will ever be like them, how can I deal with this, knowing I don’t have them around anymore, knowing they’re gone, that they didn’t deserve it, but they’re gone now, how do you live with the knowledge that the closest people to you are gone and theres nothing you could’ve done, they deserved so much more, miss them all so much, don’t have anyone anymore"
821,"I feel like I’m just wasting time till I die. I don’t think anything is ever going to improve - I am heavily disabled and cannot function for shit in this world built for fully functioning neurotypical individuals. I don’t derive joy from anything, really, anymore - I’m just distracting myself for whatever time I have left. "
822,I don’t want to end it. But I wouldn’t mind a big extended break where every waking moment didn’t feel so fucking difficult. 
823,"I broke my skull riding a bicycle and lost conciousness. Wake up in the hospital being told that i had a stroke, internal bleeding in my brain and that they had to do surgery inmediatly. I asked if i was going to die and they said that i could in fact die. So i just accepted death and let go of everything i felt peace for once in my life. Then i woke up and the surgery came out great, but, now i feel like i have been given life again but without any meaning or sense. I thought i died in my mind but no and that feeling still carries until now. Something tells me i should have died but i didnt. As people cant see that i have a 10 cm in diameter hole in my skull that is barely held up by 4 screws, they think im ""all right"", as if it was only a sprain. People expect me to smile, to be grateful but i dont feel like i belong here anymore."
824,"long shot, i haven’t ever posted on here

I’m 17M and i’m waking up everyday in constant flight or fight, i’ve little joy throughout the day, and my brain is so loud. I feel icky and disgusting whenever i leave the house and no matter how many times i shower , clean my room or practise affirmations i always end up back here in this rut.
I’m in my leaving cert year and im on anti depressants, i don’t know why i feel this way and i guess im looking for some advice, insight or help? anything is helpful"
825,"I (F28) have been depressed with high anxiety for years. More than a decade.  I have decided I want to end my life, and I can’t do it until next month, after my sister’s birthday. So she has a nice birthday.  I’ve been thinking about this for months, this isn’t a quick decision - and I am not against changing my mind, I just don’t see it right now.  I’m on anti depressants that I’ve been on for about two months now. 

But recently, I don’t know if I am at peace with the realisation I only have a month left to live? Or if I am changing my mind? Does anyone know the difference? I feel it is at peace (and I am not against not going through with it, I just don’t know) has anyone felt this way before? "
826,Does anyone have any recent experience with this treatment? I’m seeing a new therapist for EMDR therapy and she recommended NeuroStar in addition to EMDR for Major Depressive Disorder and PTSD.  I’ve taken antidepressants and hated the way they make me feel and the side effects.
827,"Everything has been done before, everything seems like a repeat of the the day before. My passions seem to fail me. I feel fake. Like I’m cosplaying as a person who is living this lifetime. My relationships with people don’t fulfill me and I know it’s my fault. I don’t think I can be helped. This feeling of displacement will never go away. My relative unalived themselves and I was a bit jealous… people should really think before they have kids what kind of opportunity or outlook they’ll be awarded in life, because I sure af didn’t ask for this. "
828,"It’s so absurd I could almost laugh if it wasn’t that my life is fucking tragic; living in a rural area with my parents, having no friends, no job, no future. Every night I hope is the last one I get to spend on this earth. "
829,"So yesterday I found out a girl I was talking to loved me (not in a ""friend"" way) and I don't know what to do (for context, this is a long distance friendship. I met her on Reddit a few weeks ago after venting on this subreddit, she asked if I wanted to talk, I accepted, and in the course of a few weeks, we became good friends). I really like her, she's great in every way, but i'm so stressed, scared, and just depressed that I think I would just fuck up this relationship. I hate myself and think she deserve way better than me, and my only concern is her happiness (she's pretty much the only person holding me back from doing very stupid things). She is also in a difficult period herself and I don't want to break her heart if I say something out of place. Do anyone have any advice ?"
830,"Some days, you just have to forget about ‘healing’.

You have to stop trying to feel better, trying to overcome your emotional wounds, or trying to be anywhere other than where you are.

You have to embrace the day as it is.

And you have to give yourself the most sacred permission of all:

To shatter.

To break.

To be an ugly mess.

To lean into a place of utter humility and powerlessness in yourself.

To cry out to the heavens, “I can’t do this!”

To admit utter defeat in the loss of the life you had imagined.

To crumble to the ground, lonely and hopeless and profoundly ruined.
To want to die, even.

And there, in the darkest places, in the blackness of the underworld, you may begin to rediscover... life.

And learn to love the beginnings.

A sacred reboot:

A single breath.

The way the sun warms your face.

The sound of a tiny bird singing in the tree over there.

The raw simplicity of a single moment of human existence.

Hell has been transmuted, through love and patience.

You have discovered the wholeness in your brokenness.

You have given up your idea of ‘healing’, and you have uncovered something infinitely more healing:

Your authentic self.
Beautiful and true and utterly unfixable.

~ Jeff Foster

832,"22m here

I want to improve my quality of life

However, the job market is the only thing that's in the way of me achieving that goal, and it's been decimating my senses of morale and self esteem.

Knowing that I'm less skilled or useful than hundreds of millions of other applicants in the US is beyond depressing."
833,"This is a young woman in her early 20 s with unstable parenting. i dont know why i am feeling to much frustrated. i feel lonely and, importantly, i am a single child. I was bullied throughout my school days. During my college days, i got certain friends, i started to explain what i am going through and how i feel. But they probably couldn't understand. I opened upto almost everyone around me. But what i heard was you are too sensitive and some people says that it is common and everyone feels the same. I can understand that everyone goes through a depressive phase in their life but I coundn't progress myself towards the future. I just need someone to hear me when i am upset or emotionally unstable. Is that wrong ?"
834,"37 M. I look like an absolute horror today. I can’t make eye contact with my co-workers. I think about all this awkwardness and if I wasn’t here it would take away that stress or anxiety of talking to me. In imagining it my heart felt light instead of heavy. They could go along their lives more peacefully or something. 

I had a dream last night. I was in a tropical place putting sunscreen on my ex. Then later we were in Munich and listening to Steve Jobs give some presentation. My ex laid in my lap in the stands. I held him in my arms. It was one of those magical relationships moments. Practically ubiquitous in a relationship and impossible to remember while they’re ongoing, yet, though somehow banal, somehow even more human and even more transcendent than any other state or situation. A feeling of companionship and unity that is a close to a purpose in life as there can be! It seems to stop time even.

My dreams huant me. 

It takes me so long to process anything. We lived together for several years and it wasn’t until these nightmares started maybe 8 months ago that I actually started to feel like the relationship was over. I was stuck in some sort of denial. Even though I let him go. Even though he lives with another guy. Even though it’s been like 4 years, somehow I convinced myself it wasn’t real. I can’t believe it’s been so long. I feel even more guilty than anything. When the first nightmare happened I immediately texted him and said “I’m so sorry.” I could even begin to express it, I don’t know the words. He said it was all water under the bridge. 

I have dated since then and it’s a disaster. Now I just don’t care for anyone else. I don’t want to try with anyone else. I want my old life back. There’s no a single second of the last 4 years I care to repeat. Nothing particularly tragic has happened but nothing I appreciate either. It has been a void. I am so far from my friends and family, I feel like I’m on Mars. I originally moved across the country to be with this guy. I don’t have hobbies. my house is a mess. I have no religion.  Should I stick around to make other people feel good about themselves? They can see my unhealthy existence and be relieved about their life choices? 

I can’t go forward. I can’t go back. I can’t stay here. I see my future as a hermit that has been completely forgotten. No family or friends. Despised by my neighbors…..

Life feels like an eternity living this way, has passed so fast I think it’s 2020. If any part of me is in my soul and makes it through to the afterlife, it would be my regret (my strongest feature). So death in that case would be just the same as life. Maybe that’s what hell actually is. A prison of joyous reflection or of painful contemplation depending. 

Maybe writing this was therapeutic. My SI is calming down. The work day is half over and I almost feel strong enough to start a work day without crying. 

If anyone is wondering: I work out! I eat the pills my psychiatrist gives me! I have dogs! I have never done therapy though and that might help. Oh for 5 more minutes of one of those dreams that absolutely wrecks my life… "
835,"I’m so fucking done. It always ends up the same. I like someone too much only for them to leave me soon after even though I shared a lot to them. They would be like one of my favourites and I think about them 24/7 only for them to not care at all. I always say I won’t get too attached but then I do and even when I try to control myself to not be too clingy and text them all the time, I fail and then they start ghosting me. Maybe I’m too clingy but I just can’t. There has to be someone who can tolerate me. Or I’m just annoying and desperate. 

This is doing no good to my already bad mental health and now I just feel like more and more people hate me and I wanna kill myself even more. If only the sharp items weren’t hidden from me ugh"
836,"Как понять что у тебя депресия? Я маленькая девочка 12 лет. У меня нету денег на специалиста, знаю что это немного глупо. Но я спросила у чата джбт. Тот сказал что это депрессия( признаки писать не буду. Будут к ним вопросы, отвечу обезательно) так же я прошла тест( какой-то псих больницы типа(?)) тот показал тяжёлую версию.

837,"I am currently living abroad, half the globe away from my family and friends. 

I was always the one reaching out to my best friend. Had a feeling that I kept watering the dead plant, I stopped reaching out and never heard from her since.

I am currently unemployed.

There has been a lot of things happened between my husband and I and even though I thought I had forgiven, I am still uncertain whether I could ever mentally move passed it, or if I could ever trust him again.

I know my mental health is low right now but therapy isnt something I can afford. I feel stuck every day and dont have the energy or motivation to wake up. But there are responsibilities that I have to get done everyday. I wonder how much longer I can do this."
838,"I've recently been struggling with eating. I find it odd because I used to be on the opposite end of this spectrum, I often couldn't stop eating. But now I just....don't feel like it. Eating feels like a chore now, food tastes like sand and I'd rather just drink a meal replacement and sleep. But working out and going on walks in nature really help with my depression, and I can't do either if I have no energy. It's a perpetual cycle of don't feel like eating-> too tired to do anything-> feel more depresssed and so on. I think this is only getting worse because I've been unpacking a lot of heavy stuff from my childhood with my therapist lately, and so I've decided I might need some advice. 

I'm broke and I work a job where I'm on my feet all day, so I really need to make sure I spend grocery effectively or I'll just eat out. Which I find I tend to eat more if I eat out, but obviously that's pretty expensive and I can't afford to. Plus then I feel nauseous for the rest of the day. I've been pretty much eating just popcorn, fast food and meal replacements. Not great. I have other food in the fridge, and I'll look at it but not touch it. Most of it's moldy now. I have to get groceries today, but I'm really struggling to come up with anything that won't just die in my fridge or in bowls around my room. I'd like to ideally have something healthier that I can stomach, but I haven't found much of anything that works for me. I'm getting a little sick of popcorn as well. I can't bring meal replacements with me to work because my coworkers are very sweet and will ask questions, and I can't deal with people caring about me right now, it's so tiring. 

Honestly this was exhausting to type and I'm not sure if I made sense at all. What do I buy to sustain myself throughout a week? How do I feel like a person again and eat enough calories so I don't get annoyed at my coworkers? "
839,"This was my dose of copium for today 🖤   

Have you ever tried to minimize your situation to keep moving forward?"
840,"Video games? Boring. Youtube? Boring. Shows/Movies? Boring. Music? Boring. Going outside? Boring, takes too much effort and even makes me feel worse. Spending time with friends? I guess that's kinda fun but takes too much effort and is exhausting. I'm also an introvert with a social battery that depletes quickly and depression is making me isolate myself. I don't have hobbies, and if I did they would become boring too. I can't sleep. I can't escape.

Nothing is enjoyable. Nothing is fun. People say to do something you enjoy to feel better. Well I enjoy nothing. I didn't even enjoy writing this. I simply have nothing better to do. My existence is just that. **Boring**."
841,"Im tired of this life. but i wanna live. im a student, the only thing i should be doing right now is studying but i cant even do that. i cant focus. my exams are in a month and i still have a year's worth of material to study and practice. and i dont even wanna start. i dont know where to start. im overwhelmed. im tired. im bored. im stressed. im depressed. im discouraged. i dont wanna study. im done with everything. i wanna die but i dont at the same time. i wish i could go to sleep and never wake up again. im scared of hurting myself. im scared to attempt anything. but i dont wanna live like this. i dont wanna live and i dont wanna die. will killing myself be easier? im too much of a coward to do it. and im too much of a coward to accept not getting good grades. im so so tired. i wish i was never born in the first place. i wouldnt have to struggle like this. 

ive tried reaching out to people. i even told my mum straight up that i want to kill myself. she doesnt get it. she keeps saying if i start studying i wont feel like this. she doesnt understand that its a loop. if i dont study i get depressed and when i get depressed i dont study. i dont have the privilege of seeing a therapist either. even if i did, i dont have time. im so done with life. i wish someone would kill me. i cant do it myself."
842,"I kinda want to have an open discussion bout “sewerslide” Ive been planning this for a couple weeks now and I’m curious about how people feel about it. 


People that want to , what’s keeping you here ? 
Why do we want to ? Why is it that not everyone feels like this life is pointless? I don’t really get it. 


People that know someone who has. What’s something you wish said person would have done before leaving ? Maybe unsaid words ? Maybe something didn’t happen you wish did? 

I’m kinda nervous mostly because it’s kinda dramatic and embarrassing if you really think about it lol. But I’m hopeful it’ll be okay if all goes well. 

If you never experienced depression to this extent and have questions about my mindset I’m open to that aswell. Just very curious on everyone’s thoughts "
843,"I’ve struggled with depression for a long time, but living in London as a young adult has made it significantly worse. Despite spending weeks applying to hundreds of jobs, I’ve had little to no response. The few roles available offer such low pay that they don’t come close to covering the cost of living here. I urgently need to move out due to overcrowding at home, but without a stable income—and with rent prices rarely below £1,000 a month—it feels impossible. My mental health is steadily declining because I feel completely stuck, like there’s no way forward for me in this city."
844,"Why? They just talked about my sis, her grades and talked about how bad it was and she has to do a better job.

845,"PLEASE REPLY 🙏
[I have posted here before. he did get better since then but it's happening again.]

I've been with my boyfriend for 1.5 years now. his depression has been getting worse these past 7 months, to the point that he told me a few days ago that he isn't as attracted to me anymore and that he doesn't know why. he says he loves me and cares for me and tried to break up with me because he does not want to hurt me anymore. and we did in fact break up after crying a lot, at 1:30 in the morning. then, at 2:15 A.M. he called me, broke down again, told me that he feels the safest with me and asked me if we can be together as usual until he comes back home (we currently live in different cities; it's been a month since he moved). I said okay, because I have semesters coming and I don't want to lose my shit and breakdown during such important exams. I couldn't even fathom not texting him every morning I wake up or calling him. so I said okay.
we have been okay for a few days and then today, he hasn't contacted me at all. didn't pick up calls, didn't text back. the cycle is repeating again.
and this hurts so much.

my heart is so heavy.
I know how to deal with this, but I don't have the strength to deal with it.
how do I keep going and try to achieve what I want in life when someone I love so much can't even try to save himself? it's such a mind fuck for me.
I don't know how to help him and he is clearly not getting enough of the help that he needs and I don't know what to do. 
I don't even know if he will ever help himself and that hurts me even more because I don't see potential, I've actually seen the person he is when he is normal, when he is okay with himself and can laugh his lungs out; and he is amazing.
how the hell could I possibly walk away from that? how can I ever believe that person isn't there anymore? if he is, how can I walk away when he is in so much pain? I understand depression can consume a person; I've felt it. but I never felt it to his degree and I don't even know what caused his self loathing. I just wish every day that one day he just decides to get up and think about it, dissect it. that's the only way. that's how I picked myself up, at least.
and since then, it's been so tough to keep trying every day and I have come so close to giving up, so many times. but I haven't. 

I really wish he gets the strength and picks himself up somehow, in some way. I don't want the world to lose his fairy dust. it's wonderful and beautiful and he has the smile that makes others feel at ease, feel comfy. it makes you want to smile.
I want to see it again. I really want to. 
it really fucking hurts.
and I genuinely don't know what to do. he has told me I can't help him because he won't let me. his parents can't help him because he doesn't let them either. he goes days without talking to them. he barely keeps in touch with his friends too. 

what do I do?

TLDR: my boyfriend is going through a major depressive episode and has tried to break up with me. as of now we aren't broken up but he is ghosting me again. please tell me, what can I do to help him? I really want to support him and stay with him."
846,All things work together for good 
847,I have booked a few days over the next two months to complete suicide.  I will finally be free of the pain.
848,"the title says everything. i feel like i'm getting absolutely no where in life, and i don't even know what to do about it anymore. i'm 24, 25 in a few months time. despite this, i still live at home with my mum, i have no friends (asides from three people who live half way across the world), i'm stuck between dead end jobs which i grow bored of, and i've never had a romantic relationship -- or experience -- in my life.

it makes me feel pathetic. i know i shouldn't compare myself to those around me, but seeing just how much everyone else is able to do with their lives - seeing them with their partners, in their own homes, going on trips with their friends - it genuinely makes me die inside a little bit. i hate my life, i'm bored of it. i feel like a background character in my own day-to-day existence, i feel invisible.

obviously, i'm depressed. i was diagnosed during my third year of university, i dropped out because of it. dropped everything and just went home, probably jeopardizing my entire future by doing so. it's been two years since then, and absolutely nothing has changed. i'm currently in therapy, but i only have a few more free sessions available, and the only real focus is my anxiety. nobody ever really tries tackling the depression side of things. nobody even refers to it as depression anymore, just 'low mood'. at least i'm able to feel something with the anxiety, any other time i just feel completely numb.

i just don't know what to do anymore. i'm practically drowning in debt, i barely get enough hours at my current job to cover most of my bills, i get invited to interviews and then rejected whenever i try to apply for somewhere else. i feel completely trapped. as if everyones lives are moving on around me, and i'm just stuck here doing nothing.

i hate my life. i hate the loneliness and isolation. i hate the fact that i don't even know who i am anymore; i've not had the chance to explore and develop aspects of my personality. people always say it gets better with time, but so much time has past and i am still stuck here.

maybe it will be like this forever. that thought terrifies me."
849,I hate everything. Waking up. Eating. Working. Meeting people. Why shouldn't I kill myself?
850,"I (29F) have battled depression for most of my life and I’m not even 30 yet. Been diagnosed with MDD, take daily meds for it, see a GP when I have to, have been to a psych, voluntarily admitted myself to hospital etc, but I’m just so done. Nothing has worked out in my favour for years and years. My partner (31M) and I are constantly bickering and arguing (probably because I can’t really see the good in anything anymore), my workplace of over 4 years has made it abundantly clear to me that I’m not respected, majority of my family relationships have crumbled away. I feel like I work so hard and yet I have nothing to show for it. I’m always just trying to scrape by and honestly, I haven’t seen the point in any of it for a long time. Each day I am becoming the worst version of myself and I hate it. I’ve tried therapy, counselling, meditation, exercise, medication and probably other stuff too that I just can’t think of, but nothing *actually* helps.

At this point, I’m ready to give up but aside from just leaving my job, letting the debt pile up and staying in bed until I rot away in my own filth, I can’t do anything about it because I know I’m a coward. Even as I’m writing this, I don’t even know where I’m going with it. I don’t even want to bother anyone to “ask for advice” because I really don’t believe I want it. I spent years pouring my heart out to people I thought cared about me, but they ultimately got tired of me and distanced themselves until I was no longer in their lives. I mean, why should they have to listen to someone constantly complain about their existence? I have no friends because I’m exhausted literally all the time and don’t enjoy going and doing anything anymore, so of course no one wants to waste their time on someone like me. I get it, I really, really do. 

I really just wish I could disappear, I wish I could erase myself from existence. I wish I could remove any memory of me from anyone that’s ever met me. God, that would just make things so much easier. I wish I was just a figment of someone’s imagination at best, a ghost, a breeze. Anything but me."

I wanted to do my doctorate but I just can’t get myself motivated enough to do it, the past 2 years while I did my masters in this city were awful and another 3 more years feel like I’m gonna crash out and big time. I told everyone I was planing on studying my doctorate and now when is so close I want to give up. I wanna cry and I haven’t been taking my pills for a while and I think is cause while I was with my friends I was in a very happy and oblivious place and now I have to deal with reality. I despise so much every aspect of my life but at the same time I feel guilty cause I know a lot of people would be jealous of my life. I just can’t deal with anything right now and it feels so overwhelming and I would have texted my friends about it, to have a shoulder to cry on but part of me feels guilty for doing so cause I know some of them would get angry that I have the thoughts that I have. For a while now, my best friend started getting angry at me when I would try and come to her for comfort about some of my thoughts surrounding my paranoia and I feel both guilty and being scolded for having this thoughts that I can’t stop having, I know her boyfriend helped her a lot over the years with her mental health and I just can’t help but feel jealous at her. I can’t talk with my family cause they are more fucked up than me and I feel like I have no one once again, I hate feeling lonely. Sorry for the long post but I needed to get it out of my chest "
852,"I've fought hard. I've fought hard for my parents, my brother, and my dogs. I've fought hard because I know they couldn't deal with the pain. I know me being gone would affect them. I know all of that might be said by someone reading this. The truth is, I'm tired. I know people get tired of me being depressed and anxious all the time, but the harsher truth is I'm tired of living through it. I'm tired of being told to stop waiting for things to happen and make them happen. They say that because they saw it on YouTube and can speak from a place without this level of pain. I've worked my ass off to ""make things happen,"" and they don't.

I cannot take it anymore. I'm actually happy, I'm ready. I need the rest. I need the break. I took on risks in trying to get ahead in life, of trying to give my parents the retirement they deserve. But, like everything else in life, I've failed. I'm paying for that risk everyday because I took on debt thinking it could work out in business. When that failed I applied to every job I could. Spare me the ""oh he's too good for the jobs that are out there."" I'm fine with taking anything, but my family isn't. Its seen as a failure, as shameful.

So, everyday is just a struggle to dig myself out of the hole, and every tiny bit of progress gets met with even larger setbacks. Every. Time. Car needs repair, home is falling apart, the clock is ticking. Every day is a constant stress wondering if this will be the day my family finds out what a complete failure I am. Its like having a bomb strapped to me and no way of knowing when it'll go off. Just little alerts and then I have to move to stop the explosion. Add on top of that the constant commercials that keep reminding me of all this crap that needs to get done or that could happen. Not only do I have a bomb to worry about, my stress get so elevated I'm just shy of having a heart attack. I've prayed for that to finally happen, but never does. If it did, it would be enough to do serious damage but not kill me.

Today I got paid more than I was expecting from my current work. Quickly it was all taken away, and then slammed with a potential explosion of that bomb. Again, tiny bit of progress, larger setbacks. 

All life is is just struggling to make it another day and hope that some day, this mayhem will end and life will finally be worth living. Hoping I can have one day where I get, can smile, and just do normal stuff. Hell, even to have stress but just the stress from normal, everyday life.

I have come to the realization that it is not in the cards for me. I have worked hard, and I keep failing. I am going to finally escape this hell, and that does make me happy. It does give me some sense of joy. I know people will be devastated, but for once I need to do something selfish for myself. This week I'm going to start giving away my stuff. I don't have a lot, but there are some things I hold dear and know whom I want to have what. I guess my purpose of this is to start to process everything. I plan on being gone by the end of the week. I cannot handle another weekend of stress and anxiety. 

I thank you if you read this to the end, I just needed to be listened to for once. I know there are good people out there.

I'll delete this before I go. "
853,"About a month ago, my relationship ended. It wasn’t perfect, but it was meaningful. My ex struggled with PTSD, depression, and autism, and was in treatment for all of it. In the end, she just couldn’t handle the relationship anymore — and suddenly it was over.

Meanwhile, I’ve been in the middle of getting assessed for ADHD, autism, depression, and possibly giftedness. I’ve got appointments lined up, and I’m doing an IQ test this Friday. But honestly, I’ve been struggling for years. My mind never stops thinking. I overthink everything. I feel uncomfortable in my own skin, and in my own head.

This weekend, I was finally off work, but I was just exhausted. I didn’t do anything. I felt so down. Today I had a work shift (I’m a nursing student in my first year — I work and go to school one day a week), and I got some criticism from my supervisor. Ever since, my mood has been shit. Honestly, I feel so fucking awful. I hate life right now.

My dad died of cancer when I was ten. Life has always felt different for me. I don’t know who I am. I feel like I’m not good enough. I’m scared of failing, scared of life, scared of myself. Not in a dangerous way, but more like… am I even built for this world?

Sometimes I think: I wish I just didn’t exist. At the same time, I do know how beautiful life can be. I’ve had amazing moments too. But right now, I just can’t feel any of it.

I feel ugly. When I’m at the gym, I’m completely in my head. I can’t relax. I’m thinking about everyone else instead of focusing on myself. My thoughts never stop. I’m so restless — I can’t even sit still, my legs are constantly moving. My brain feels like chaos. I forget things, both at work and at home.

I don’t understand myself. Why am I like this? Why do I feel so awful most of the time?

I have euphoric moments, sure. But 7 or 8 out of 10 times, I just feel miserable. It’s horrible. I can’t find peace. Without a relationship, life feels empty — but to be honest, I felt miserable before that too.

I bought a guitar, but I don’t have the energy to play it. I have a PlayStation and friends I hang out with sometimes, but I don’t even feel like gaming. I’ve been thinking about getting a PC, but again… I don’t know.

I’m just so tired. Of everything. Of thinking. Of feeling like this."
854,I simply can't. I have been trying to enjoy life. But it is pointless. I am hidding behind a mask. Making people think I enjoy it. But I do not. I want to tell someone I don't feel well. But for some reason I can't. I can't open up. It's not like I don't want to open up. But for some reason I have this fear of being judged. I feel disgusted by who I am. I jerk off not because I like porn. I do it because it's a relief. It doesn't bring me joy but for a few minutes I feel relived. But after that I regret it. Every day I wake up in the mirror thinking that I will do the same thing again and again. With nothing changing. I never taught i will do it but now I am writing this. This is probably the only time I'll ever post on here. Who ever is reading this. If you feel down get help. Don't be me.
855,"Hey! Im asking for advice from anyone who has felt the same as me.

Im 22F in the UK and have had mental health issues since I was a pre-teen. I have learnt many ways to cope and life hasn't been the easiest for me but I'm proud that I've gotten through really difficult times. Right now, there's nothing bad really going on, I'm just horrendously depressed. A lot of it comes from insecurity about myself and who I am and my relationships. Since being about 18 I've  felt that I've never fully connected with anyone. I used to love being around my friends so much and craved human connection but somehow that has gotten lost. 

I have real trouble striking conversations even with the people close to me now. I have a small group of friends who I live with and have a wonderful girlfriend but constantly question why they even want to be around me. Maybe also worth mentioning I don't speak to my family, and live 5 hours away from my hometown. I'm not 'fun', I do 'fun' things to try and force myself to become a normal human like roller skating, knitting, jewellery making, art, I've tried every hobby but all of them leave me feeling the same emptiness as before. I've been in therapy for most of my life, nothing works because I'm already too self-aware, I've tried medication, I have a healthy diet and get enough exercise  from my full time pub job. I just feel lost and don't know what to do. 

I feel BORING and never have anything to say to my coworkers. Can't remember the last time I giggled. All I wanna do is lie in bed all day but I'm always trying to push myself to do things. It sucks because this is not me! I used to thrive around my loved ones and was always a fun person to be around! Now I'm an empty shell.

I feel exhausted and hopeless

I’ve been thinking of making a counseling appointment but it’s gonna take a long time until they’ll finally be able to help me. The sessions take too long, they usually see me once a week, and it’s gonna take months until I’m finally able to make progress if I even do.

858,"Hello I'm a 23 year old male from India. I am gay. I was outed to my family when I was 16. I have completed my Master's degree in English. But there's a National Level exam which makes you eligible to be an Assistant Professor which I need to crack. I completed my Master's last year and the results were late. 

My mother wanted me to be a lawyer, it's not something that I wanted to do, but I joined law school. And the professors there couldn't really teach. I didn't really like going there. So I dropped out. I got the  fees back. But I technically wasted one year. My mother who was very supportive during my Master's course suddenly changed her demeanour. She started calling me unemployed, and that I was leeching off their money and other things. It is painful to hear. 

I was on anti anxiety and anti depressant meds since the beginning of 2024, and I'm still on anti depressants. But my mom makes it worse. There are fights breaking out between us and I don't know what to do. 
I have the exam in June/July. 
There is a war going on in our country and idk if the exam will be postponed. 

We come from a lower middle class family whereas my cousins and their parents come from rich and affluent backgrounds. My mom often compared me to my cousins and their achievements. I don't really know what I should do. 
I thought off taking my life last year but then started seeing a doctor. 
But it's all coming back again.
I do not have friends. Maybe 2-3 and they are busy in their own lives, some even pretend to be busy. Disconnect my call. I can't share my feelings with anyone and there's no one to listen to me. I almost cry to sleep every other day. 

Dating is difficult as people do not find chubby men attractive. I just want a painless death. "
859,"I am fairly young but i cant see a bright future ahead of me. I am only a dissapointment and a source of pain for my family and anyone close to me. I am fat, ugly and i hate myself. I am scared of dying but i am scared even more so than living this terrible future i have infront of me. I feel like i cant change anything and no matter What i do and no matter What i try its not going to get better.

I am at peace with the fact that i probably wont be living for long if this keeps going like its right now.

862,"Hello, I just thought I'd make this post to rant a little bit.  
Sorry if the text makes no sense at some points, I just pretty much went through a mental breakdown.

I'm 14, Online schooled and my parents are split up. My parents split up when I was 12 because my mom was texting another guy, which she stopped after my parents split up, and I've lived with my Mom since. Everything was fine for about a year, until my Mom met a new guy, who was the Dad of my friend and my Dad was also friends with him. My mom and he started talking, going out on dates and all that, until Mom decided he wasn't the right person. Ever since then, my conspiracist Dad hasn't stopped telling me that Mom's supposedly bipolar, mentally ill, a love bomber, cheater and some other stuff. I hate it so much. For a year and a half he kept going on and on about this topic. I'm online schooled because of covid, my parents didn't want me to get a vaccine and tests. It's made me so antisocial, I can't motivate myself to do my assignments, but when I know I have them, it's hard for me to do anything else. Then there's also the constant pressure from my parents to get good grades, because I can go to the school for free if I get a certain average score on all of my assignments, and it has drove me into a constant state of panic, sadness and anxiety. Now, back to my parents' situation. This year, Mom has started a relationship with another guy she met a few years ago, and wants to start something real with him. My Dad really hates him, so I get another speech from him. However, I also don't like the guy, he just gives off bad vibes to me. My parents now want to fill out the divorce papers, but Dad wants to split the properties to sell them and buy himself a new house for us (Me, My brother and Sister) to run away from here, because Mom wants the guy to move in here. So now there's even more pressure on me to choose whether I go live with my dad which I despise fully, or stay here with Mom and her boyfriend. Also, the guy lives across the country, and he comes to visit occasionally, and then one night, I heard them having sex, which also deeply traumatized me and made me hate the guy even more. My whole life just feels like I'm gonna explode from all the pressure that's been put on me. I love my Mom, but it's all too much. My childhood is the worst part of my life, and it's not an argument."
863,"lately i fell into a very deep hole of depression and relapse again after serval years. 
i’m trying to do all the casual things i love but nothing seems to really work because it feels different and „empty“ to me like it lost it‘s spark. 

usually i‘m listening to a lot of music but i can‘t even do this as of now because my maladaptive daydreaming would act up and consume a huge part of my life. 

i‘m hoping and fighting atm, living day by day making small steps to get better but i‘m so scared that i‘ll be falling again. i know that falling again is ok and that it happens to grow and move forward. i‘m trying to spend time with people as much as i‘m able to and to get outside but i‘m also unable to do this most of the time since it‘ll exhaust me at one point. 

if anyone has some enouraging words or tips on what else to do as distraction or to lift my mood up i‘d be happy.

864,"TLDR: I am really struggling to eat and know I am not getting the nutrients that I need. Looking for greens/nutrient supplement powders/mixes that actually work.

Last month I broke my elbow and had to have surgery to repair it- which prevented me from cooking for the majority of the last month. That made getting the proper nutrition really difficult, as I struggle to eat food that anyone else makes for me. I just had a family member pass this weekend and now I am struggling to get anything down at all because I can’t get myself out of bed. What greens/nutrition supplement powers/mixes are actually worth it? Googling it just leads me to a bunch of neurotypical people saying that they’re all scams and to “just eat fruits and vegetables”, so I thought I’d ask others who understand how impossible that can feel. Not looking for a forever solution- just something to help while I feel like I’m drowning in every other aspect.

Thank you so much, in advance!"
865,"Hello,

Currently dealing with a case of medicine-induced chemical depression (this has happened before on this med so am aware what’s going on). It takes a week or two to wear off. 

I’m having a severe lack of energy and motivation. Pretty much can just lie in bed and sleep. Speaking is difficult and I sound monotone/upset/bored when I do. 

Have a work call tomorrow evening. This person is helping me with something by my own request. How do I come off personable and not a total bitch? Should I say something to explain my tone of voice or say I’m just not feeling well? 

Also agreed to a dinner tomorrow but need to back out. Can’t feel any positive emotions rn and just am not up for socializing. Don’t want to say….hey no thanks I’m depressed. 

Thanks for any suggestions in advance."
866,"""did you know exercising can increase your mental health and is 1.5x more effective than medications!"" i do not care. why the fuck would someone with avolition go out & exercise. i don't have any energy or motivation to do that, plus i hate exercising. how would it possibly make me feel better. it exhausts me even more and increases my need to sit down & do absolutely nothing. 

""you only have depression because you don't have a car!"" yes i've actually seen this one. no i'm not lying. like what could not having a car POSSIBLY do with having depression?? this shit is so unbelievable, if anyone here thought i was lying about someone saying that, i wouldn't even blame them.

""get some sunlight & have a balanced diet!"" how would radiation, light, and food cure all my problems. that won't make me feel better. it doesn't get rid of my situation nor my mental problems. 

""drink more water!"" wow, i've never thought about this useless advice, thank you. i love water, i really do but it's never enough to cure how i feel. no matter how much water i drink, i will remain the same.

""go for a walk!"" right, a walk. the perfect cure for depression. why didn't psychiatrists suggest this first rather than putting you on meds? as i said, no energy, no motivation. it's hard to get out of bed alone, what makes you think i can walk the whole neighborhood?

my god, like yeah, some of these things are helpful and if they helped you feel better then good for you. but jesus christ, this being passed off as common cures for *MENTAL ILLNESSES* is crazy. why do people who don't have depression think its so simple? like depression = sadness type simple. when it's 100x more complex than ""i'm feeling sad today."" everyone really must be a doctor if they can cure these deeply complex disorders!"
867,"maybe not today, but someday, maybe even in a few years, i’m going to end it. i haven’t told anyone and i don’t even know where to start. it’s selfish of me to have a partner and friends but i don’t know how to let them go so i can go. i have a lot of health anxiety but somehow it feels nice that at least my death can be on my own terms. and i hope when i do it, i can erase any physical items so it’ll be like i never existed. i don’t want to exist anymore and i’m sorry that i have for the past 21 years.

868,Idk what else to say but I cried alone again today because I was so sad 💀🎀 no one likes me and idk why. im not bullied but it’s just that no one wants to talk to me and idk why. I’m not good at talking to people 
869,"tldr; my boyfriend can’t pick me up it’s resulted in me eating less than a 1000 calories a day and he only gets angry when I bring up what caused it to start.

.
.
🎀

For starters I have always had an extreme issue with my own weight, growing up I was morbidly obese reaching 320 pounds by the time I was 17. I had weight loss surgery and lost a lot of weight and now my weight is 200 pounds. I am a tall girl, I stand at 5’11 and the recommended weight for me is 160 but it’s been so hard for me to shed off the remaining weight.

My boyfriend is my best friend, I have known him since middle school but we only started dating last year. He is 5’5 and a little bit on the bulky side but personally I think it suits him and it’s cute. 

He loves to tell me how he wants to just pick me up, and spin me around and personally that’s also been a dream of mine. I have always been a girl addicted to idea of fairytales and fantasy and I have never been princess carried or spun around in my life due to my weight. When he tried to he struggled a lot. He dropped me pretty hard and laughed it off and I could tell my weight was an issue for him and now I don’t let him try to pick me up anymore.

As a result I have for the past year had an extreme issue with eating. I am severely depressed, I struggle to eat any more than 800 calories a day, I refuse to enjoy any food that isn’t low calorie or healthy in some way and it’s put a strain on the relationship. He wants to eat burgers or get pizza and I break down crying whenever he pressures me to eat. I have explained to him how bad my eating habits are and he agrees it’s bad. I even explained to him that the reason it all started was because of that one moment where he dropped me and he gets really angry with me every time thinking i’m accusing him of being weak when in reality it isn’t even that I just know i’m fat and that’s the truth.

I feel so broken. I only eat when I know i’m working my part time job because I know the steps i get at work will balance out the calories I eat in the day. But if i’m not working I eat little to nothing at all the whole day so it doesn’t influence weight gain. I just wanted to vent because I feel like i’m at such a dead end with my own life and I am so miserable with myself and with how things have been like in my relationship. Part of me wants to get mad at him and ask why he doesn’t lift weights, he insists he’s strong but he can’t lift 50 pounds without struggling. 

I have brought up even just the idea of him trying to lift heavy weights because even if I got to 160 pounds he still wouldn’t be able to pick me up- and he insists he’s already does but I know he’s lying because he has a hard time even carrying the garbage bags, and if i bring it up again he’ll get mad as well."
870,"I have been fighting depression and have frequently felt like the 'stupid' one in the room—quiet, uncertain, and ignored.  In my heart, though, all I want is to be noticed, to connect, and to make an impression, not with flawlessness, but with genuineness.  I'm trying to discover my voice and demonstrate that there is significance even midst the chaos."
871,"since i was 6 i got pushed to start sport, my father were a sport fan and pushed me to do it. i did it for almost 15 years, and last 7 years, i felt like i only did it for my parents. well felt, i would say ONLY did it for my parents. school from 8-16, and then travel home, eat dinner and sport, some days i could be social, but got called to come home to go on sport, (like does my parents think i dont know the clock??, why you think im not home, and always gone). dint come home one day, my parents got so mad at me for skipping sport, like punished, and was horribol and engativity everywhere. so ye, boom i guess thats my life now.

same sheet at school, make so many fuss coments every day when going to school, if i got homework, what happend to school, how is it on school. one day i said i dont like it, boom, my mom said its my fault for not liking school, and got angry at me and its becusei  game alot, and dont even try to like school, so ye, i just said yes yesy yes to everything. otherwise my mom got angry. and does she think i dont know i got homework or when school start? does she think im like brain dead or something, like idk. how would i tell her if i got homework or not if i dont know xD. that was every day, making fuss every day about comments if i got school to do or remind me of school 4 times after school. i just said yes to everything. i guess it made hate shcool way more.

i had no issue passing at school, did basically nothing and passed, so i wouldnt say im dumb.   
high school ended, free to just chose whatever i wanna do, but got pushed to do sport and uni. if i dint do uni, got pushed to work aand univiersity and rent. so i just did sport and uni, and honeslty couldnt care about anything, my grades were somewhat avrage, or maybe a bit under avrage, so it was most degress were out of sight (norway free education and requires a grade avrage the more popular a degree is). 

i just had no goal, and i did what my parents do. i failed and dropped out after 6months first uni, i just said yes to im at uni still, and said i dropped out right before summer, to fucos on my sport. then they were so mad at me, and i couldnt deal with the atsmophere for 2 weeks, but it calmed down, and pushed me to get a job with my sport, so yee, kekw. (i also had job in most vacations since i was 16). like they are helping me alot, they do alot for me in things they pushing me in. for example my dad cleanse skiess alot and prepping stuff for my sport and buy stuff. and i felt bad when i dint even wanna do it. so yeee, did it. yes yes yes, i felt like a yes slave to everything. well if you see i have no motvation foreverything, and just said yes that i was working on my sport, even when i dint, and yee kekw

i ended my sport carrier shortly after 1 year. was a disatser like my life, started uni again, and they pushed me again to get a job besided uni. basically almost a full time besided uni, when i had no motvation for anything. guess what, i just passed doing minimal stuff, maybe like avrage 20min a day, and passed 4 classes out of 6, those two were the hardest ofc. anatomy and some other class. took up them and failed, boom 3 times and i got kicked out of my uni, still saying to my parents im going to univeristy, and supposed to finish my degree in some weeks and they want to come to my degree celebration, but heey, i will not be there ops. 

so idk, i have no hope for anything, and i have no motivation to do anything. i just want to die or move away then say anything to my parents. do i have some issues, im 25 male."
872,"I feel alone all the time. I don’t have friends, I don’t talk to anyone. The pills didn’t help, staying in the hospital didn’t help. I hate my looks, my face, my body and everything about myself. Everyday I feel like I want to end it more and more, I feel like there’s no reason to keep on and I can’t keep lying to myself every night that everything’s gonna be fine. I just want to be normal, I want friends, connections, talking to other people. I just want to be like everyone else. How do I make friends? It feels impossible, when thoughts in my head constantly tell me that people around me laugh behind my back and insult me constantly. I just want to have friends, talk and feel like somebody cares about me."
873,"This is her 3rd bout with cancer and this time it's gonna win it's only a matter of when. She starts chemo in a few days and it's so shitty because I'm finally doing we'll, I've competed on a professional level in my sport and am making good finical decisions as well as good diet choices. Then my mom gets cancer again and I feel like can't be proud of what I've done recently because I'm overwhelmed with the fact that my mom is going to die. Ill get thru it but life's never going to be the same now. If you read thisnall thanks I hope you have a good night.  happy mother's day"
874,"I often think about what it would feel like if someone hugged me.
