1,2,"I’m a 20-year-old girl and lately I’ve been struggling with this overwhelming fear of death. It’s not just the fear of how it will happen, but more the idea of just not existing anymore. I can’t wrap my head around the fact that someday I won’t be in this world that I’m in right now, full of people and places and things I love and hate and laugh about and cry over.

Sometimes it hits me, like when I’m lying in bed at night and suddenly I’m filled with this panic. I don’t know how to cope with this fear or how to stop it.

Has anyone else gone through this? How do you deal with the idea of not existing someday? I just want to know I’m not alone."
2,2,"I am struggling like no tomorrow. I finally thought my life would be on track but it’s not. I always been anxious, shy, low confidence person. Went to uni got myself BSc in biology graduated when I was 24 then took  a break worked random jobs and started respiratory therapy school did good academically. Now failed clinicals and restarting clinicals with little hope that I will pass. I have so much anxiety it stops me from doing anything. Struggling to be a good student( I keep making mistakes, I keep getting freeze). If I don’t graduate my three years hard work( I studied really hard) , time money spent wasted. Still have Student loan. Don’t know what I will do? My parents will be super disappointed. Don’t know if I will find a job enough  to pay off student loans and go back to school again. Don’t know if I go back will I like that. Don’t know if I will ever gain any confidence in me back after this. I feel like biggest looser who can’t possible think and use my brains. Every day I wish I would die car accident or I would get a critical in illness. It sucks cause I want to be grateful for life. But I just can’t. I just want to end this . I can’t see my parents face when I tell them if I couldn’t make it . I just don’t have it in me to restart. I don’t have the money nor the energy. I don’t want to have the victim mentality but life’s been really testing lately it’s just getting harder and harder to be optimistic. I just needed to vent so I am posting this. "
3,2,"Hello!

I am seeing my primary next month and have had a **ton** of anxiety in the last months. Like, can't sleep- no mental breaks-impacting my life-physical symptoms-anxiety. In the past, I have tried Buspar (hated), Prozac (was fine but didn't seem to work well for me at any dosage), and a third medication that I can't remember the name of--I think it was an antihistamine that doubled for anxiety meds? 

Does anyone have any recommendations for something strong to combat constant, unrelenting anxiety? I would rather stay away from consistent benzo use but might consider speaking with my provider about having something on hand for ""as needed"" situations. I am concerned about taking anything addictive and would prefer not go that route--if possible. Obviously, I have responsibilities and a life that I need to maintain, but at this point I will take walking zombie over fight and flight mode. 

I am U.S. based, if that makes a difference. My anxiety is severe but situational, if that also makes a difference, and I don't have any mental health diagnoses. 

Thanks! "
4,2,"For the better part of a year now I’ve been suffering severe severe panic attacks. I’m not just talking 20 minute episodes and gone. I’m talking rolling, constant 10-11 hour attacks. In the past month I’ve been to the hospital every week for a severe panic attack regarding my heart. I have extreme cardio phobia. They’ve done EKGs, X-rays, CT scans on my pelvis, abdomen, and chest. All results come back the same every fucking time. I have severe light headedness and horrible faintness during these attacks and laying down doesn’t help, sometimes makes it worse. Chest pain, left arm numbness, nausea, upper abdomen pain, headache, etc. I get so detached from reality that I feel I’m going to pass out right there, feels like my limbs aren’t even there anymore. I drank a pint of liquor a few hours ago and then took a .5mg Xanax just to try and sedate myself so hard. Guess what, didn’t work and just made me panic more because of how crappy my head felt after I did that. Severe chest pain, left arm numbness, can’t even do breathing exersizes because it hurts to inhale. Call the crisis line and their only advice is to go to the ER. I don’t have insurance, I can’t keep racking up a 2000 dollar hospital bill just for them to tell me I’m not having a heart attack. I’m tired, exhausted, and sick of this crap. I have no idea what to do, therapy didn’t help, my benzos are becoming more and more ineffective. Grounding doesn’t help, deep breathing doesn’t help. The pains I have are real, sometimes they’re what trigger the panic attack in the first place. Got referred to a cardiologist just to clear things up but without insurance it’s tough. Can’t stare at something for too long or else it feels like my head goes nuts, gets heavy, severe hot flash and instant cold sweats like I have a 105 degree fever. Does anyone have ANYTHING please. ANY advice. I can’t do it anymore, I’m ready to end my life just so I don’t have to deal with this garbage anymore. I can’t stand it, I’m ruining work, friendships, and more. These symptoms I’m getting are very real, but the faintness, and shallow breathing are what really terrify me into going into an attack. TYFR. 

Edit; they’ve also done a CT on my head, didn’t find anything there either. Also got tested for Lyme disease, negative. 

Edit again; also, muscle fatigue and severe weakness. "
5,2,"I have GAD and I’ve been going through a rough patch with my anxiety lately. I get a ton of physical symptoms and I want to know what symptoms other people have and how you’ve dealt with them. Some of my symptoms are: 

Chest tightness / shortness of breath

Tension headaches / feeling pressure in my head 

Feeling nauseous 

Feeling a lump in my throat - I hate this feeling but I usually try to drink or eat something to prove to myself that it’s just anxiety

Sharp pains in my chest - this one is so scary it doesn’t happen often but I hate it when it does

Palpitations - also very scary and doesn’t happen often

Feeling hot 
 
Feeling pressure on my left side near the bottom of my ribs 

I read that the pains / pressure come from muscles tensing. I’ve tried taking baths to help with that but it only helps in the moment. 

I’ve also tried splashing cold water on my face when I feel panicky and it helps somewhat

Exercise also helps take my mind off of anxiety 

What worked for you when it came to anxiety symptoms?"
6,2,"I recently had a health scare regarding my chest, I did get it checked, everything went okay, there is something there but I was told it wasn't anything serious to be worried about. I had thought after getting checked it would ease my anxiety but I'm still struggling with it everyday. My other symptoms that I had are pretty much gone, I do get minor chest pains still but every time I feel them it scares me & of course think of the worst even with what I've been told.

My health anxiety also started to affect me in other ways like about what I eat, accidently hurting myself, if I feel any sort of other pain in my body, I just feel like there is something wrong with me in the worst way possible. I'm starting to have a hard time working & leaving the house by myself because of something possibly happening to me & it's affecting things I enjoy doing. 

I've always had anxiety & have been able to control it pretty well but ever since this happened to me it's just gotten worse & experienced an anxiety attack at work because of it, I've been struggling to find ways to help. I was just wanting to know if anyone has anything that really helped them with their health anxiety? "
7,2,So I wasn’t able to sleep last night and I’m typing this as I’m still tired in the morning. Whenever I walk around or think I sometimes see a figure that’s not there and I get a little paranoid. This all started happening when I took melatonin a couple weeks ago and I started seeing random figures and I got really scared. After that I calmed down and I haven’t the figure for a while but now that I’m tired and I haven’t gotten any sleep im starting to see them again. Is this normal?
8,2,"Just got home from work and was doing okay in terms of anxiety today, but as soon as I got home my forehead started to feel warm. Immedietly I got anxiety from it and now im just in my head. I did just ingest alot of sugar so im wondering if that had alot to do with it 🙄 
I do have health anxiety so I tend to freak out when I don't feel normal"
9,2,"Ever since I was young (maybe 6 or 7) I’ve had this deep fear that specifically my mom was going to die in a car accident. I have no clue where it came from. I’ve never been in a bad car accident and no one in my immediate family has ever died. It’s only getting worse now though and I don’t know what to do. I’m moving to another state soon and I’m so scared. What if she dies and I left, how awful would I feel? I logically understand there’s nothing I can do about this, but I think that’s making it worse. Everything is so out of my control and I feel like the more I think about it the more I’m making it come true. Like this is some weird prophecy that I learned about way too young and now can do nothing but sit back and wait for it to happen. Does not help that my mom does do stuff like text and drive and that her car stalls so she puts her foot all the way on the gas. I don’t know I’m just freaking out right now. How do I stop thinking about this allll the time???"
10,2,"I've got a long history of trauma to work through, I've lost both parents and grandparent in the recent 5 years of my life. My brother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and my auntie attempted to take her own life multiple time all in that time as well.

I had a small breakdown which caused me to be anxious and then the intrusive thoughts came and wouldn't stop. I know they aren't a part of me, but I'm really struggling to the point of being suicidal to just stop them.

I don't know what to do anymore, my mind feels like a prison..I'm on the waiting list for CBT trauma therapy and I feel like I'm barely holding on. My job is stressful but it also helps distract me from being so busy and at night, that's when my thoughts start to race.

I'm exhausted from fighting this battle for so long.."
11,2,"

Okay, so, I’m an autistic woman, btw, with an anxiety disorder. I stay inside a lot. I’ve no friends in real life. Only on the internet.

I had a friend on an app for almost three years. He missed me when I was gone for a while. He told me I was his favourite person on there & he was mine. He was actually (& still is) one of me favourite people in the world.

His account got suspended & I’d make loads of posts asking people if they knew what happened before I learnt it was suspended. I hated the fact he was gone & was waiting ages for him to come back. & just felt like yk he wouldn’t like abandon me.

& he did come back & told me he was looking for me for ages & was so happy when he found one of me posts. Told me he missed seeing me rants & I was delighted bcz I missed him too. & only really enjoyed the app bcz of him. I wanted to leave it loads but didn’t want to abandon him especially seeing how he didn’t like when I wasn’t around.

Ehh so recently he told me he was okay & that life was good like when texting me. Then a day or two later he made a post saying he’s not slept for three days bcz he’s monitoring the situation & that he just needs a hug & several years of warmth & darkness. So I texted him apologising for me recent text saying “hope you’ve a lovely, lovely day” & said that seems insensitive of me to say & asked if there’s anything I could do & how I’d fight the people bothering him for him. He told me it’s grand & that I couldnt have known.

He explains some man tried to intimidate him & he got him to go away & threatened him. Kept telling me he was grand. & I told him I’m glad he did that & how I felt useless (we live in different countries) being all the way where I am unable to help & referenced his post, the one where he said he needs a hug & several years of warmth & darkness. He just kept saying not to worry about him & that he’s a strong soldier n all.

He told me he’s always in survival mode & has been since his friend died in his arms when he was teen. I told him I was really sorry to hear that & that he’s been through so much & that it’s completely understandable.

I asked if he’ll be getting any rest tonight & what he’ll be up to. He said he’s going for drinks with his friends. I said i hope his friends take good care of him & that I was gunna go to sleep. He told me he’s thankful for all me kind messages & that he really appreciates me & that I’m a good friend. He said he hopes I’ve a good sleep & said you too. & that was that

Then I wake up the next morning & I’m blocked. & initially I tell meself it’s okay. He was probably embarrassed? About what he told me? Or regrets it? Like I would deactivate me account loads when I made vulnerable posts on there, so I thought it could be that. & for some reason, I just assumed the block would be temporary. I also wondered well he said he was going out for some for drinks. So he might’ve blocked me accidentally? & meant to block someone else?

It was literally a nightmare come true & an unimaginable thing for me, something I never thought would ever happen never in a million years. & I don understand it.

& of course I’m hurt bcz the friends I had in school bullied me, then the other ones also bullied me but then stopped for a bit & now don’t want anything to do with me.

Friendships for me don’t usually last. & I do feel like people don’t like me which I hear is common for autistics to feel. Like I don’t have this strong desire for friends. I feel like I’d live longer without them bcz then I’d be hurt less. Just I would prefer not to lose amazing people like that. I really really really really really liked him a lot! I also told him this in our last convo when explaining why I felt awful not being able to help. I’m aromantic btw so no it’s not romantic.

Have been in tears for three days & literally going to sleep in tears waking up & remembering & ij tears. & I’m just confused like I don’t think he lied about appreciating me. I just don’t see why he wouldn’t like at least let me know he doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore. I wouldn’t have argued. I mean I understand I’m not entitled to that. & he doesn’t have to explain anything to me. I just would like to know what I did wrong? I spoke to someone about this & they said it mightn’t have ahyhinf to do with me at all.

It’s really shite lol his bio says he’s looking for his old friends. & I was one & he found me & now I’m blocked & I’m just so upset like. Just never feel good enough to be anyone’s friend & I do feel disposable. Like I’m the friend everyone blocks & nobody wants. Did I make him uncomfortable? Probably suffocated him? If he told me to feck off I would have understood. The way he kept telling me not to worry was probably a kinder way of telling me to feck off, I think.

12,2,"Truly wasn’t sure how to tag this, but I have a symptom question? As of recently, usually when I’m in the car (not driving) or really tired (like I am now), my anxiety manifests into this very fuzzy and heavy feeling in my head. It’s SO hard to explain. Like I feel lightheaded but I’m not, so fuzzy is the best word for it I guess? It doesn’t feel great, almost like my head all of sudden weighs a ton but also wants to float away. My hypochondria kicks in and I start spiraling, thinking I’m going to have a seizure or something. I have no history of seizures and once I’m distracted, the feeling totally goes away. So it definitely anxiety. I would just like to know if anyone else experiences this."
13,2,I struggle to tell what's anxiety and what's depression so I would love to know how anxiety manifests for you 
14,2,"Some many things are happening, I can sleep, I am constantly worrying and praying. I feel like I can’t do this anymore. Will everything be okay ? "
15,2,"Hey guys,  
I’m 42 and recently started having this awful pattern where the second I step into work or any slightly stressful situation, I suddenly feel like I have to pee **urgently** — even if I just went. I’ll go, then 10 minutes later it hits me again.  
It’s totally messing with my life and confidence.

I’ve ruled out infections and prostate issues. Now I’m starting pelvic floor therapy, and I suspect this is more **nervous system/anxiety related**, but it’s hard to find other men talking about it.

If anyone’s gone through something like this — bladder urgency tied to stress/anxiety/pelvic tension — I’d really appreciate hearing from you. Just knowing I’m not alone would help a lot.”"
16,2,"i was watching a bunch of creepy internet videos and obviously tonight has to be the night this happens. ive gotten 30+ calls back to back no break from a no caller id, havent answered a single one but im terrified "
17,2,"I’ve been dealing with severe anxiety for a while now and some days it’s just so bad. It affects me physically and makes me feel sick. My head hurts, I feel weak, my eyes are heavy and I’m just so tired. Right now I’ve just been so dissociated and it feels like it will never get better. I want to cry. Nothing feels real. I feel so weird. I’m just so so sad"
18,2,"Hello everyone, I am a 29 year old girl who has suffered from this since she was 18, my diagnosis? Anxiety disorder. At 18 years old I was aware of my first panic attack, a lot of over-demanding of myself to be the perfect person. I could spend hours and hours filling this wall telling you how my anxiety disorder cut my life short. 
He didn't let me go to university anymore (I didn't finish my university degree).
He didn't let me make new friends.
He didn't let me be free walking the streets of my city in broad daylight out of fear.
He did not and does not let me live.
At 29 years old, I am more aware than ever that this has clipped my wings, it has not allowed me to live like a normal girl. 
A normal girl takes a bus trip and is not afraid. A normal girl is not afraid to attend a university full of people. A normal girl lives, I don't live. 
I'm tired, I cry because I'm fed up, because I still want to live and they invite me to make plans and I can't say yes because it scares me. And sometimes I wonder... why am I not normal? Why can't I lead a normal life if I'm already medicated, I'm already ""on track.""
This is not life. And I want to live... 
"
19,2,"It all started back in 2021 when I went to a new barber shop because my usual one was closed. While I was sitting there waiting for my turn, I began overthinking — wondering how the new barber would cut my hair, whether he’d mess it up, and if I’d regret it. That spiral of thought slowly turned into my first full-blown panic attack.

Since that day, nothing has felt the same. From that one moment, my mind and body have never fully calmed down. Every day since then has brought a different symptom — sometimes physical, sometimes mental. It’s been a cycle that’s lasted from 2021 all the way to 2025, and I still feel stuck in it. No clear diagnosis, just constant overthinking, fear, and exhaustion. It’s like my nervous system never turned off after that day."
20,2,"This has been happening for the last week (I have a history of mental health issues) and I haven’t been able to fall asleep for a few hours each night because of the sensation that I can’t get air. I feel like if I just ignore the feeling my breaths become too shallow and I feel like I’ll die. It doesn’t help that I already have heart anxiety and freak out that I can barely feel my heart at night. Please, I just want to relate to someone. This is absolutely debilitating and is causing genuine panic. "
21,2,"I wanted to share a bit about my experience with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and see if anyone else relates. I found out about this roughly eight months ago, and it’s been a journey of ups and downs.



I’ve been on medication for GAD. Honestly, the meds have made a big difference for me but I know everyone’s situation is different. If you’ve been thinking about medication or already taking something and feeling like you’re going through it alone, I’d be happy to chat here or in private. Sometimes just knowing someone else “gets it” can lighten the load.



One piece I’m still working through is childhood stuff. My relationship with my parents is good now, thank God, but I can’t fully shake the effects of past hurts. If you’ve dealt with similar family wounds and found ways to heal, I’d really appreciate hearing what’s worked for you—anything from small daily practices to therapies or conversations that helped you move forward."
22,2,"this anxiety has made me extremely depressed, it begun as an existential fear but developed into more of an urgent one fearing i may die everyday, its honestly paradoxical because i attempt to get better and my brain intrusively tells me “whats the point of getting better, you’re still gonna die”. i cannot enjoy life with this anxiety. i feel so temporary at all times, knowing that the void is staring me down and there’s nothing i can do about it drives me fucking nuts. i’m also scared to sleep so there’s that."
23,2,I know it's common to hate phone calls especially in my generation but I have no problem talking to people even strangers over dms or texting and even overshare quite a lot lol. Like I can yap for ages but if anyone asks me to hop in a call or call them I will literally start having a panic attack. Just weird that it can cause such a different reaction in my when it's basically the same thing.
24,2,"My anxiety lately has gotten really bad with all the news recently and the state of the world. I was wondering if anyone had some recommendations for music that's funny, I like music like Nick Helm and Bo Burnham but I don't want to associate them with this current bout of anxiety."
25,2,"Have you ever actually not heard them call your name at the doctor, been forgotten and too scared to remind them and then actually missed your appointment? I have this fear every single time I sit in a waiting room, even though it literally never happened before. Am I just lucky so far, or is it really just super irrational? Also I got Loop earplugs recently, they would be sooooo helpful but also would make me more anxious in this specific scenario… do you have any advice on how to deal with this?"
26,2,"I really didn’t want to do this but I feel like I have no choice if I really do want to get better so I came to the internet to maybe find some tips or at least maybe an answer to wtf is happening to me. Im currently struggling significantly with my mental health and life due to my anxiety. 

My anxiety has been increasing for the past few months. I use to have anxiety attacks/panic attack during my senior year of HS which would be 2 years ago. However all of sudden and I literally mean out of no where my mental health crashes down to the ground and is now 6ft deep. I now have extreme panic attacks that happen multiple times a day basically almost everyday for the last 4 months. 

And I have no idea what’s the reason. Nothing bad changed causing the extreme anxiety. Idk if something is wrong with me but I really think I’m losing grip of reality due to it. My memories are either blurry or just blank. I don’t even feel like myself. My attacks can last from 30 mins to 1hr+. Can’t stay on task or easily distracted. I’m somehow having more than just one thought at the same time 24/7. It takes barely any type of stress or overstimulation to have an attack. Or sometimes it comes out for no reason. 

I want to get better. I’ve been trying to switch my meds (Not having fun with that). It’s a hassle but hopefully soon I can get something that might be helpful. My meds I’m on rn do help with anxiety but I’m mainly on them for depression (my depression is actually low considering I’ve struggled with that the most for years) but I just kinda wanted to share my thoughts and also see some suggestions/ answers/ advice related to anxiety and anxiety/panic attacks 
"
27,2,"Let me explain. My grandma put out a bowl of water on a tree trunk for birds and maybe squirrels. A couple days ago I had to touch it to put it back up, after washing my hands, I started to basically place seeds of doubt in my own head. Thoughts like ""what if a rabid animal drank out of that bowl?"" Then after that I convinced myself that an infected animal drank out of it, and my mind has started to go wild. I've had history with Anxiety and I have had a couple panic attacks recently. I live in the northeast region of the USA, and Rabies here is just as rare as other places in America. I already washed my hands, did research about the disease, but my mind keeps wondering if somehow that the planets aligned and I got rabies, but I know I don't have it, I wasn't bit, scratched, and have no open wounds. I won't tell anybody because they might think I'm crazy.

Any support is welcome."
28,2,"Hello, I am withdrawing from .5 mg 1-2x a day for about a year. This is the worst thing I’ve ever gone through. I think of death and wanting to break up with my long term boyfriend. I cannot eat, feel like nothing is real, and keep throwing up. The last time I took Xanax was .25 3 days ago and feel like I should be done by now. Just wondering if anyone else has gone through this before and what your experience was like. ❤️ Thank you "
29,2,As he tells me he has the same issues as me he has attempted suicide he lives with his mother I have a wife and another kid and I feel horrible for me and his mom not working out and all the issues he has.

Idk what to do but support him and talk to mom
30,2,"I am/was addicted to porn since young age, i have internet access since 2005 and since then i am/was addicted to c0\*n, i have tried to stop it so many times. I have really long streaks of nofap for the last 2 years. Had some relapses. I started fap when i was 14, now i am almost 34, had only one girlfriend with which i had sex only few times for several months relationship (it was terrible experience for her, since i am very inexperienced in girlfriend-boyfriend relationship). My friends joke about me never going married and not having girlfriend. My best friend is narcissistic person and loves to watch me suffer when he has a hot girlfriend and i don't have and his laugh about my sex life is destroyng my existence and joy of life. He says he is just joking, but in reality i suffer without showing it.

I am currently seeing a girl on daily basis, but she is not an attractive girl, she is a bit overweight and i am trying to like some parts of her body, but i just can't get an errection. I haven't even tried to kiss her. Our connection si only on a character level, but there is no chemistry between us so that we have sex. She doesn't know i used to be a chronic masturbator in a fap ""dungeon"" for years.

I look good on the outside, had a pretty visible 6 pack, train, eat right, but emotionally and physically i am exhausted from all the suffering caused by c0\*n induced ED (PIED). I am scared when a girl likes me and when we go to have sex that i will not be able to get a hard on, because of the c0\*n usage over the years.

I am ashamed when i see my parents because they really want grandkids and they are still wondering why i live alone.

Had a girl last year that i hanged out with, she was a bit better looking than the current one that i am seeing, but we only kissed and make out. When i was with her i was constantly on viagra pills because i was expecting her to want to be alone with me, but just the thought of going alone in a room with her and me not getting a hard on scared me. Once she told me let's go to your apartment and make out. I agreed, we made out, but i didn't had sex with her, that night i took one viagra pill and had a really long hard on.

I can only get an errection with viagra (sildenafil active ingredient) because of the panic, anxiety and stress i go through during alone time with girl. I think the spot on word for this is anxiety.

I don't know what to do. I feel pain, anxiety, sadness, anger. I can't turn to anyone. Sometimes i share with friends that i am a nofap guy and they laugh.

Give me some freaking advice."
31,2,"I spent my time in marijuana induced anxiety 
And I came up with a few conclusions 
Note that I’m not a mental health professional these are all my own experiences research and knowledge 
First let me give you an example my name is abneer I’m 17 and I smoked some weed one day had a bad trip 2 months passed by and I was okay it all ended but one day out of curiosity I was ruminating around that bad trip all came crashing back I had 24/7 anxiety symptoms after that I lost my personality I wasn’t even able to perform a single task I was completely taken over by existential and illogical thoughts which made no period no absolute sense but somehow it made some sense my mind even tho it didn’t at the same time it was just something I can’t explain on the other hand there’s my friend from Japan who had the same experience as me word to word same experience the only difference being that she felt the symptoms of anxiety with a touch of depression and dpdr but she her personality didn’t crumble her social life didn’t get interrupted things didn’t go half as bad for her i used to wonder what could be the reason now when i have answers I’m gonna sum things up a bit many people have different explanations for the cause of an anxiety disorder but now what i realize is there isn’t a single cause or a single way of someone’s suffering let me explain in my case everyday i felt like there is something that’s lacking in my brain there is some reason for all this and somehow i felt like till it’s not completed i cannot return to a normal living which I now realize was an actual chemical imbalance otherwise i see no other thing that could cause my personality to change my behaviors reactions emotions to change cuz when it came to my friend that all remained the same it was only the anxiety factor and she never even felt the need to rely on any medication for it this made me realize what differed in the both of us which was she had more of a nervous system issues whereas i had an chemical imbalance issue let me get this straight I accepted every ounce of anxiety for 5 straight months i never fought it with any technique or anything period i tried going on with my life everyday till it became impossible due to the brain fog and illogical thoughts I had that’s when I realized that i had a chemical issue if I didn’t this wouldn’t have been happening now realizing that I wanna say if anyone struggles to the point where they struggle to be functional try getting on medication cuz that’s period the only way out for us people with non chemical issues might have a different story but for us it is what it is better do things timely before creating trauma to address later "
32,2,"i’ve had anxiety for 7 years now and had a period of time after graduating college last year where my anxiety was down, i was happy, good on 5 mg of lexapro. but i had a super stressful move a month and a half ago which has somehow triggered my anxiety to rebrand itself completely 😭

i thought i knew my symptoms inside and out at that point (panic attacks, chest pain, etc etc) but now i have none of those, just extremely bad health anxiety. i’m convinced im dying 10-20+ times a day. i got some sinus thing 3 weeks ago and still have headaches and every single time i get one i think it’s life threatening. i upped my lexapro dosage and it may be a little easier to fight with those thoughts in the day but at night it’s the same. especially bc the higher dosage makes me wake up at 3am on the dot. 

i know bodies and brains change i get it im just so tired and frustrated. i met with a therapist but she wasn’t the best so ive had to find another. ive been through this whole process so many times, just usually i know what to expect. there is just absolutely no way of convincing myself im fine. i read posts from here of people fighting it ive been to urgent care an embarrassing amount of time. i do have a yearly physical tomorrow where ill get my blood tested so i am hopeful that will help (after i think im dying from blood loss or something).

i know ill get better as i have everytime in the past. thanks for reading my rant. "
33,2,"Well my title pretty much sums it up I’m absolutely terrified I’m going to get it at some point and I hate how much this fear overwhelms me. I just need any advice on how to move past this and not let it get to me 

I appreciate y’all

34,2,i got some blood test results back and they show i could have liver damage or bone problems or possibly cancer. the doctor says they want to see me face to face and i’m terrified they’re going to tell me im dying. i’m supposed to be going to university in september. 
35,2,"Hi everyone — I’ve never really posted much before, but I’m in a really dark place and I need to know if anyone has actually come out the other side of something like this.

Back in November 2018, I was 17. My cousin brought over a vape pen — I hit it once. I didn’t know it was laced (still don’t know with what). Within minutes, I flipped out. Full-blown panic. I went to the ER. My body felt like it broke. I was hallucinating and dissociating for days afterward.

Since then, my entire reality has changed. It’s been 6 years, and I still don’t feel normal — not even close.

I’ve lived with constant head pressure, especially in the back of my head and neck. My hearing feels like I’m underwater or in a fishbowl. My vision is dim and blurry, like my brain can’t even process what I’m seeing. My eyes twitch a ton. I get jaw tension, my throat feels like it sticks when I swallow, and I often have no appetite at all. I’ve lost weight and thrown up multiple times from pure anxiety. Panic attacks and constant racing thoughts/inability to think. 

The worst part is the cognitive fog. I feel like I can’t think clearly — like my brain is stuck in molasses. I don’t feel grounded. My thoughts race 24/7. I can’t focus, I space out constantly, and I feel like I’ve lost my ability to be “me.” It’s like my brain is stuck in survival mode and never lets up.

I’ve had every scan imaginable — MRI, CT, EEG, bloodwork — all normal. I’ve even gone to Mayo Clinic. Still no clear answer. I’ve just recently started meds (an SNRI maybe), but I’m scared they won’t help. I want to believe in them, but it’s hard after so many dead ends.

I live at home, and I work as a credit analyst, but I’m seriously falling apart. I don’t feel joy. I don’t feel safe. I feel like I’m barely surviving. I’m not suicidal, but I’m so scared this is permanent. I see other people my age living life, and I feel completely left behind. I graduated from college, did well with a 3.6 GPA, but I had to transfer/withdraw 3 times as I couldn’t stay on a campus and had to come home. 

Has anyone gone through something like this, after one bad drug experience and actually healed?

Even a partial recovery would give me hope. I just want to feel like myself again. I want to look at the sky and feel it. I want to see clearly, think calmly, and be a person again. If you’ve been through this, please let me know.

I am really really hoping the right medication can sort out most of this and help me feel things again/stop panicking/have some calm/stop the physical symptoms/get my life back. 

Thanks to anyone who reads this. "
36,2,"Went on a longer hike today, trying to detox from thc. Ended up going to the urgent care afterwords because I started feeling a little off and very dehydrated. The Dr told me it was mild and not bad enough for an IV or anything. Just to go home, cool down, drink some Gatorade and take it easy. This was all about 8 hours ago. Now my anxiety is making me afraid to go to sleep tonight, thinking I’ll have a heat st in my sleep. The only sign I have now, is sweat, which I have been sweating more due to detoxing. Am I going insane, should I go back to ER just to double check? My bp, temp, was all normal."
37,2,"I'm just trying to not feel so alone...

Heart palpitations. 

I've been numerous doctors, had echos, ekgs, an entire MRI done on my heart AND am on beta blockers because my anxiety around my heart is so bad

At 19 years old, some doctor diagnosed me with a tachycardia arrhythmia and I thought my life was over. Any time my heart even rises to 90, I freak out and my anxiety convinces me i'm dying 

I've since then been to another doctor and they said my heart was healthy and fine. 

Ten years later, I'm still freaking out about the random palpitations I get. Even if it feels like i'm doing nothing but relaxing, BOOM HR increases and so does my anxiety... i'm convinced i'm going to have an arrhythmia and it's going to end me...

Anyone else have cardiophobia like this?

38,2,"Hey everyone really needing some external input! Has anyone had these symptoms and if so how did you get rid of them! 

I’ve been having this weird hot feeling in my head like I’m going to faint and also like a tight pressuring headache usually accompanied with a feeling in my chest that’s like dragging me down or really heavy inside. It’s getting really scary and I’m getting worried about it being a major health problem. Has anyone else with anxiety experienced this? My anxiety usually isn’t even triggered by anxious thoughts but rather after an intense panic attack about a month back my body hasn’t been the same. Physical somatic manifestations occur daily and when they happen is when I get really really anxious and more panic attacks ensue. This feeling in my head is consistent and makes me think I’m going crazy. It’s hot, annoying, gives me a dizzy but not so dizzy feeling and makes the rest of my body panic so much! 

I’ve also experienced a strange icy cold feeling in my chest for months! Has anyone else been through this feeling? It comes and goes multiple times a day and no one I know has experienced it. It isn’t painful just uncomfortable. I could really use another experience! 

Please if you’ve experienced these as a part of anxiety let me know I’m getting worried I have a tumour or something. "

I’m a 27-year-old woman, and I’ve been struggling with what feels like either social anxiety or possibly autism — I’m not sure which, and it’s starting to really overwhelm me. I’ve been working full-time since graduating college, and I can barely focus at work because I’m constantly worrying about what my coworkers think of me.

I work in a cubicle office setting, so I’m surrounded by people every day. I feel incredibly anxious around them, even just talking to them feels hard. I’m worried they think I’m dumb or incompetent, and since I haven’t really connected with any of them, my anxiety just keeps building. I hate feeling like this.

I feel like an embarrassment — like I’m failing — and I don’t understand why. I’m miserable at work and honestly thinking about quitting because I can’t focus or get anything done. By the end of each day, my mind is completely exhausted from the constant worrying and overthinking.

This isn’t new. I’ve realized that I’ve felt like this for years, but it’s become much worse since I started working full-time. I don’t know if I’m autistic, or if it’s just anxiety, or a combination of both — but I do know that I’m suffering, and it’s affecting my work and personal life.

I don’t know what to do anymore. Any advice would mean a lot."
41,2,For context i decided i wanted to quit vaping and move to zyns because i started a full time internship and ive been wanting to for a while. Its been 3 weeks and my anxiety is the worst its been in a long time. I cant eat anything that wasnt prepared at home without freaking out about food poisoning. I contacted a therapist about this just about an hour ago so hopefully they get back to me. Anyone else who quit have the same experience? I feel like this is withdrawal and it’s amplifying my normal anxiety. 
42,2,"When anxiety turns to panic and reality melts away, like staring down an infinitely deep well, only to wonder why you inhabit this body in this place -- there are some things you can do. TIPP is an excellent grounding technique that includes Temperature, Intensive exercise, Paced breathing, and Progressive muscle relaxation. I've been doing this since I was a kid, well before DBT gained prominence, and it works very well. For example: putting water on my face, holding ice, stopping to do physical activity, practicing breathing exercises, and making up dances that activate different parts of my body.

However, when nothing seems to work, and your panic subsumes your person into a form of terror, there become more options. Some of these as we know are very unhealthy -- I won't go into detail here. Still, amongst these options sleep deprivation becomes a valid treatment in the short-term. The health affects of lost sleep are easily outweighed by the dulling affect that it has on our alertness, our vigilance, our overwhelming fear. The ability to move your mental state away from that stressful place can mitigate trauma and other adverse effects.

So if you're in a panic and are feeling tired, maybe stay up a little longer. You could stay up 24 hours or more. Anything past 72 hours and you should consult a doctor. People will say this is an unhealthy practice and yet they don't know the stress that many of us endure. Keep trying and I know you'll find what works for you."
43,2,"A strange sensation when I'm relaxed or when I'm trying to sleep. It's like a feeling of energy running through my entire body. It doesn't hurt, I don't know how to describe it. And sometimes it makes my hands and legs feel weak. I'm afraid I have multiple sclerosis."

45,2,"A week ago I (M20) ended up having an SVT episode for the first time ever (heart rate jumped to 220 for around an hour) and it was eventually treated after going to the hospital, (they said i was fine and let me go) still not sure whether I am physically healed yet but ever since that day I feel like i completely changed mentally.

I go to the gym daily, don’t have many friends (have one close friend), on summer break from university. After the episode, I was unable to go to the gym, and also had to cut down completely on caffeine (which ended up with me having caffeine withdrawals)

I’ve always had some anxiety, was a part of my life, but ever since that episode it’s just been extremely bad. I’ll have moments where I feel lightheaded, chest tightness and shortness of breath (nothing physical since my vitals were all fine), almost feel like i’m about to panic, and it’ll be over basicallly nothing. I also feel like my emotions are extremely fragile and any slightly sad thought would completely change my mood from happy to really upset. (Guess u can say i’ve been having crazy mood swings) Also, Weirdest thing is that I don’t feel that scared thinking back to the SVT episode itself, it’s almost unrelated attacks of anxiety from nowhere.

One huge example was the fact that i broke up with my ex 6 months ago, and was very sad and broken about it but eventually felt better over time, but it’s just gotten extremely bad where I’m nearly crying / crying over the breakup now and feeling extremely lonely due to my lack of friends (that i usually am ok with) Idk what the svt episode did to me but i’m worried about whether i’ll ever recover from this and return to my old self, because the anxiety and sadness i feel now is extremely taxing.

It’s been 8 days now since the episode and I feel like I am forever like this now, with constant shortness of breath and such. If anyone has tips on how I can calm myself during these attacks let me know.

I’ve already made an appt with a psychiatrist and an electrophysicist next week, i just wanna see what anyone has to say about this now."

Therapy has brought up a lot of trauma. It’s causing me to ruminate everyday about these things. This really sucks. I’m not sure what to do. I want to quit therapy. I don’t think I am ready for this.

49,2,"I am in thyroid readjusting and went to er because i could not breath well. I have been in some kind of medically induced hyperthyroidism for months but ( or so my endo and i think) and in that time,  started takimg lorazepam ( i have been taking it for 3 months).

The ER doctors told me to stop takimg lorazepam ( i only took 1 mg at most all these 3 months, i refused to take more) and start taking Xanax 0.25. I took a dose yesterday morning and it let me calmed but I still had that breathing fatigue. And when it effect weared off I felt lots of anxiety although it passed after a couple of hours. Took another at night and I could not breath properly since 3 am. At 6 am the effect started wearing off snd felt s bit better but at 7 am I started feeling super anxious again? Is it for the Xanax or the lorazepam withdrawal?"
50,2,"# Hey everyone,

I’m working on something really close to my heart — and I could use your insight.

I’ve been through periods of deep emotional pain where I felt alone, misunderstood, or just… invisible. I remember wishing I had someone — not to fix me, not to give advice, but just to *stay*. To *listen*. To *be there* in a consistent and caring way.

I’m exploring an idea for something that might provide that kind of emotional presence for people — especially for those who don’t always have access to therapy, or who just need a gentle check-in at 2 a.m. when everything feels heavy.

If you’re open to it, I’d love to hear:

* What has helped you the most during your lowest times?
* Have you ever used mental health apps or chatbots? What worked? What didn’t?
* What do you *wish* existed to support your mental and emotional health?

You can comment here or DM me if that feels safer. No pressure either way — just grateful to learn from your experience.

Thank you for reading. You matter."

52,2,"I was prescribed citalopram in the fall of last yr due to extreme anxiety and panic attacks due to work and personal related things. The first week or so of taking it was pretty awful- exhausted, social anxiety was heightened, tight chest- but that was expected as I heard these can be a side effect when first starting on the medicine. Eventually it leveled out- BUT I really never felt there was that moment of euphoria or thought that it was reallly helping. Sure I had some good days, but the bad ones overruled. I continued to take it- thinking it would eventually just start working and slowly things got worse. I went in for a routine in person check in with my prescriber (not my normal doctor) and told them how I was feeling and I genuinely didn’t know if it was helping and she suggested increasing my dosage. I agreed- I mean she’s the doctor here so I wanted to trust even if I wasn’t so so sure. From there- horrible headaches, insomnia (pulling one nighter on a random week day every two weeks), low appetite (I lost 15 pounds and I’m already petite- I went from healthy weight for a petite person to my bf and close friends are asking if I’m ok, scary weight and I didn’t know  how to answer bc I didn’t know why I was dropping the lbs), tight chest where it felt like I had a million pound weights on me and I would have to concentrate on my breathing-deep and long sighs, waking up in the morning immediately anxious. Some days during work I had insane fear going into calls, wanting to cancel or make an excuse I was sick, just bc of how anxious I was and didn’t want to talk to others. I also felt really dizzy all of the time and like I had vertigo. When I’d go to the gym and run on the treadmill, I felt like I couldn’t keep my balance or like I was swaying side to side. And then I was so focused on it it was all I could think about while running, the fear of losing my balance or tripping and falling off the treadmill- so basically took the fun and happy feelings of working it lol. Eventually- last few weeks before I stopped taking it became so so bad, headaches, insomnia all spiked- I felt like I was losing control and scheduled an urgent appt with my doctor. Got on the call with her and told her the deal & that I didn’t think this was the right for medicine for me- she acted surprised & that my symptoms were atypical considering how long I’d been taking before this all started getting really bad. I almost felt like she was thinking I was lying, saying things like “I met with you on xx date and you said you thought you were improving” where I had to explain to her i had good days and bad days and that was probably a good day- I also just wanted to believe the drug was helping me. Like I was doing better like a placebo effect or something of the sort. I genuinely couldn’t really tell if it was or not but I wanted to believe it was. Again, I never had that moment where I was like wow I feel normal again- there were good days but it was always there dormant- I don’t think the medicine was ever helping me, especially towards the end.  So again- she suggested I increased my dosage- now from 20mg to 40mg per day. I expressed a lot of concern- I was honestly scared. Here I was telling her I think this drug is making me go insane & she wants me to take more. I was really uneasy but I felt like I had no choice no matter whatever I said back- she didn’t give me much choices. The next day I took 40mg and i felt like an actual zombie- I was so incredibly irritated, couldn’t hold a conversation, the worst anxiety and fear I’d experience through it all- I was angry. Why am I doing this to myself- I know my body and the person I am and this is not it. So I stopped. I cut it cold turkey, which I know you’re not supposed to do. But I was f*cking fed up- I couldn’t do it anymore I was terrified of the medicine and was so tired of feeling that way. And let me tell you- 1 week later I started to feel like myself again. I felt so incredibly lighter, the fog had disappeared. The headaches, insomnia, struggle falling asleep/waking up and not being able t go back asleep- disappeared. I haven’t woken up with insane anxiety or tighten chest- there’s been a few anxiety moments here and there but it’s all been situational or responses to personal matters- not just plain ole anxiety from literally nothing, poppig up out of thin air. The only unusual feeling I’ve had lately is extreme anger or annoyance towards something super random- like I got so pissed about my curtains and how the Taskrabbit hung them- they were touching the floor and I got so angry a few days later looking at them and ripped them down- I know this sounds crazy and this def not like me- but I’m just being real and honest rn and I do think this could be the only negative side effect from stopping cold turkey? Or just in general from on it for a 6-7 months 

I do feel better tho and I’m happy i listened to my body and stopped taking it- but disappointed in how my doctor handled this. I messaged her and told her I couldn’t do it anymore and she gave me steps to ween off it- which I didn’t do- but then never followed up, asking me how I’ve been or providing an alternate solution. Prior to increasing my dosage she said she was “extremely concerned” taking me off the medicine and here she was later telling me how to stop taking it but not checking in afterwards and or talking through next steps/providing alternative solutions. 

All this to say- I’m curious if anyone else has dealt with similar experiences with this anxiety medication? I’ve seen a lot of positive experiences on here and I feel a bit alone that I may be one of the few that absolutely did not mesh well with this medicine "

I have suffered from palpitations now since 2022…. They started on a nightshift travel assignment. My chest would flutter all the time and specially when laying down. Palpitations got better after going to Dayshift. I got a halter monitor for 14 days that showed 0.01% burden of palpitations or extra beats… virtually nothing!  And a normal Echo. I am
Super active and have a low heart rate mid 40-50’s so I refuse beta blockers. 
I now have at least 1-5 palpitations a day (one at a time) as far as anxiety goes, my anxiety is more situational in nature. I am
Not anxious 24/7 but I can overthink just about anything…. (Hence palpitations in question) No depression. 
They just won’t seam to go away… they happen when I am doing absolutely nothing and at rest. Rarely when working out but has happened. I am just now getting anxiety about feeling them. It’s not normal to have them on a daily basis. 
Has anyone else experienced this? I really just want to know if this is just a anxiety issue and not a cardiac issue. 
I will have to follow up with my new PCP for a cardiology consult again. 
But the PCP just wants to prescribe propranalol as a bandaide fix…. When I would probably get very dizzy and drop in blood pressure from it. "
58,2,"I’ve been off my meds for almost 6 months now. Not because I wanted to. Not because I was feeling better. But because my folks weren’t okay with it. They didn’t support me taking meds for my mental health. And somewhere along the way, I started skipping my doctor appointments too. Maybe it was guilt, maybe it was shame, or maybe I just didn’t have the energy to deal with it anymore.

And now I’m paying for it. Every single day.

My anxiety is through the roof. I wake up feeling like there’s a weight on my chest. My motivation is zero. I’m still in college, not earning yet, and trying to look for part-time work or internships — but nothing’s working out. And to make it worse, I come from a financially weak background. The pressure to earn is constantly hanging over me, and the growing financial crunch is making everything feel heavier. I can’t even focus properly because my mind is always split between survival and self-destruction.

I get irritated at the tiniest things. Mood swings like crazy. I overthink everything — every word, every silence, every expression. I get offended by stuff I used to brush off. Then I feel guilty. Then I get angry again. It’s like I’ve lost control of how I respond to life.

Worse, I get triggered easily now. If people are fighting around me or even if I see videos online of arguments, I can’t take it. It hits me like it’s personal. I imagine myself in their shoes, or worse, I imagine myself in the middle of it. I don’t even know why. It’s like I’m constantly bracing for a fight that’s not even mine.

I’ve become so insecure lately. About myself, my future, everything. It feels like I’ve regressed. I’m back to how I was before meds — but this time, somehow even worse.

And I’m scared to go back to my doctor. What if she scolds me? What if she’s disappointed in me for not showing up for months and just letting myself fall apart like this? What do I even say? “Hey, I ghosted you and now I feel like shit again?”

I know I need help. But asking for help again feels heavier this time. Like I don’t deserve it.

I don’t know why I’m posting this here. Maybe to get it out of my system. Maybe because I’m tired of pretending I’m fine. If anyone’s reading this, thanks. Really."

i woke up at 4am my throat really hurt and suddenly i felt like i couldn’t get a full breath of air in my chest felt really really weird and i started hyperventilating and trying to get a full breath in and not being able too and i kept hyperventilating and my chest felt really weird 

i’m unsure if i feel gassy or something like that but it just felt like i could not get a full breath in and my chest hurt a bit and my mind went to the worst places possible  and i was inconsolable 

it’s 5am and i woke my dad up hyperventilating and panicking asking for help he knows about my anxiety so he tried calming me down 

i’m now in the garden i still don’t feel right my dad said he would get me a doctors appointment today but im so scared

66,2,"I don’t know why but I feel like I have to share this. 

I have pretty moderate anxiety disorder, almost everything in life makes me anxious. So much so that I’m scared to take action for very important things and I’m also unable to just be in the moment, this will lead to being disorganized and distracted. 

I have been reading a lot, mostly anxiously trying to find what’s wrong with me. I am expected to begin Prozac soon, but I decided to try a b complex.

After the first tablet, within an hour, my mind was almost blank. 

Like the racing thoughts that were particularly intense that day just dissipated. 

I have no clue if that’s even possible to see effects like that so soon, but I took it again today and same thing, calmest work day I have ever experienced. Mood lifted as well. 

Wasn’t as afraid of my coworkers as I typically am. 

I just want to suggest this. I will most likely still be getting on the medication I was prescribed as I still feel very anxious, just less so. 

"
67,2,"I have always been aware of my anxiety, it has ebbed and flowed in its severity. I have been on/off meds. I recently came to the realization that it has taken over my life. It’s like it’s been building and building and building and I was brushing it off as other things and suddenly it’s just too big. 

I am terrified all the time. I can’t sleep. I am overwhelmed by everything. All day I think about my loved ones dying, about horrible things happening to my children, about myself doing horrible things, I feel like everyone hates me and my children and sees me and my youngest as burdens. I feel like I’m failing at work every day, my anxiety is impeding ability to work as quickly or efficiently as normal, I’m not going out and doing things I would normally do because I am so scared that something terrible will happen. I do not want to get specific because I do not want to trigger anyone but I hate living in my mind. It is so, so dark and scary. I don’t recognize myself. I hate the thoughts I think and I cannot make them stop. 

I have been under extreme stress and was taking a break from therapy for a month or so, I just started seeing a new one I really like and I’ll be asking for a recommendation to a psychiatrist to start meds again. I’m just too scared to talk to any friends / family about this right now. I feel like in their attempts to help me feel better they’re just going to end up invalidating my feelings and fears. I just needed to say this to someone so it feels a little smaller. "
68,2,"Little back story first we got my dog when she was 4 months old and now she is 6. She’s a very nice German shepherd. Has never been aggressive, she makes friends with all the cats and the lizards in our yard. She is basically just a big baby. She’s scared of thunder and likes to be in my room when it’s thundering. I was bit on the head by a pitbull in 2022 why working at a retail store. I have never seen dogs the same after that. I stopped interacting with dogs outside that people walk on the street. I request to meet slowly with my friend’s dogs. I don’t even like walking on my street any more because people leave their dogs outside on their lawn. Since I got bit I’ve had a dream like once a week that either my dog attacks me or another dog. I haven’t been able to get that vicious growl out of my head from when I got bit. Anyways whenever my dog is scared she will get up in my face and I’m up all night either sitting up in my bed or literally standing so she’s not in my face. I know she’s trying to seek comfort but it’s very scary to me. And my dad believes she would never bite any of us but I still think if she’s in a scared state she might she’s still just a dog. Any comments for helping get over this fear or just helping my dog would be great thanks for reading!"
69,2,"a couple months ago, i began experiencing back pain seemingly out of nowhere. i am 29, relatively healthy. i work out 4ish times a week, go on constant walks, and i eat a pretty balanced diet of whole foods.

this back pain came out of nowhere and when i was searching for solutions for the pain (my doctor was not helpful), i read somewhere that sudden onset back pain that comes and goes can be a sign of pancreatic cancer.

i’m freaking out and spiraling because i have never had back pain, it started suddenly. i’m so scared, i can hardly think straight. i’m so scared that i have pancreatic cancer. 

i haven’t been able to be around people without taking xanax because my constant anxiety in my head. i wish i had never read that 

i’ve been trying to do all of the things that usually help me feel better. walking, making music, cooking, spending time with friends. i can’t get it off my mind. i need help. i wish someone right now could just reassure me that i don’t have it but no one can do that. i have another doctor’s appointment next tuesday where bloodwork will be done and i’m FREAKING out. i can hardly eat. i need help. i feel so desperate for relief from anxiety "
70,2,"Hi everyone, hope y'all are well :) 

I've been struggling with moderate anxiety for the last six months that's recently become more severe. I've had (of course) an elevated heart rate, muscle twitching and tension (most notably a neck that feels stiff and tense), ""unsatisfying"" breathing (very conscious of it and feels like I can't get a good breath in) and pain in my chest that is minor to moderate that doesn't seem to worsen with exercise.

With that said... Just wanted to get other people's takes on my experience + hopefully give someone solace if they're experiencing something similar. Thanks! "
71,2,"About two years ago upon leaving a toxic environment I got hit with what we call the effects of anxiety.
It was terrible, all the symptoms like full blown multiple panic attacks a day and headaches and nausea and unable to eat barely livable,
With lots of therapy and support I’ve been able to now navigate it
The best part is the search opens up a massive party you, you wouldn’t know exist if we didn’t have this terrible thing.
Not to sound cliché, but there’s a whole world outside of this that anxiety leads you down

72,2,"Hi everyone! I took my first dose of Prozac yesterday, around 24 hours ago (10 MG). I was wondering if anyone else had an experience where they began feeling side effects from Prozac so quickly -- I know it's normal for anxiety to be elevated for the first few weeks after starting but tbh I have felt off all day today. (I take it with my dinner so my first dose was yesterday at dinner time and it has been a full day since then.) I currently feel more anxious than normal. I feel restless which is not really typical for me when I'm just at home. Is 10 MG enough to cause this side effect so early? I tried researching online and I couldn't really find any sort of timeline that's to be expected. Am I experiencing a placebo or could it be a result of the medication? "
73,2,Never was told and never knew that ppis can increase benzo levels and side effects. Now I’m worrying about it. I don’t want respiratory depression or die or something 
74,2,"Hey everyone,

Over the last few months I’ve been having some hypnic jerks (those sudden muscle jolts right as you're falling asleep). At first, they were mild and kind of leveled out, but lately they've gotten worse — it's been happening every single night for the past two weeks.

During this same two-week stretch, I also started having spasms while I’m awake. I usually notice them when I’m lying down or just sitting still with my legs relaxed. These ones feel lighter than the hypnic jerks, but they come with this weird electric shock-like sensation in my left leg.

Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if it could be anxiety-related. I deal with health anxiety a lot, but I’m not super panicked right now — it’s just been really annoying and messing with my daily routine.

Thanks in advance!"
75,2,"I currently work in IT at an MSP but I am wanting out. The company I work for has grown substantially and changed very dramatically over the 4 years I’ve been with them to what seems to be industry standard. It’s very triggering for my anxiety, but other options I have been looking into are at a high risk of automation due to advancements in AI. 

This is the only tech job I’ve had and I need something I can do long term with better work life balance. I still have 30 years at least before I can retire.

If you have a job that works for your anxiety…. What is it?"
76,2,"Not sure if I should post this in the anxiety or depression subreddit since I don't really know which one fuels this feeling.

Most people have an afternoon slump to some degree. But, some days I get this really foggy, fatigued feeling, coupled with a complete lack of motivation or drive to do anything. Engaging with any task seems impossible, like I'm stuck or trapped. It's like my body/mind is forcing me to lay down because that's all I can manage to do. Almost feels like executive dysfunction made worse by this brain fog, tired, stressed, apathetic feeling.

It varies day to day of course, and can also depend on how much sleep I got, what I ate for lunch, if I'm nearing my period - but I have many days like this throughout the month and I absolutely hate it.

It's so incredibly frustrating! It really seems like it's beyond just ""feeling tired"". I think it's worse if I've been particularly anxious or stressed about something recently - like that feeling after leaving a social gathering and being utterly drained.

Does anyone relate and have any advice? If I get 10+ hours of sleep this doesn't seem to happen as severely but I feel rediculous for needing this much sleep :( I've also been on antidepressants for 7 years but I remember being like this before them as a teenager."
77,2,"My birthdays coming up and it's making me soo depressed and anxious   
Things to know about me is i had a very bad childhood and my dad died when I was 13 two days before my birthday and this is also the second birthday without my mum 
Everyday it gets closer the more I think and It makes me more depressed and anxious "
78,2,"Hi Reddit, I’m not even sure how to start this without sounding overly anxious or self-conscious, but here goes. For as long as I can remember, I’ve had this nagging feeling whenever I’m out in public that people are noticing my nose and maybe even talking about it behind my back.

It’s hard to explain exactly why, but my nose is a feature I’m really sensitive about. Sometimes, I catch people glancing at me and I immediately jump to thinking they’re focusing on my nose — like maybe it looks different or “weird” to them. Other times, I swear I hear whispers or see people whispering when I walk by. I know logically they’re probably not talking about me, or maybe not even talking about me at all, but the feeling just sticks with me and it’s so distracting.

It’s gotten to the point where I feel super self-conscious about going out or being around groups of people. I start overthinking my every expression, how I hold my face, or if my nose looks “off” from certain angles. It really messes with my confidence and sometimes even ruins my day.

I’ve tried reminding myself that everyone has things about their appearance that they worry about, and most people are focused on their own stuff. But this particular anxiety about my nose feels so persistent and intense. It’s like this background noise in my head that I can’t turn off.

I used to be bullied about my nose in school, and have received many comments about it. Now I can’t tell if people are talking abt it in public or if it’s just in my head. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve confronted strangers asking if they said something. When I walk by, I swear I hear the words “big” “nose” “pointy” it literally drives me insane 

I’m wondering if anyone else has felt this way — constantly worrying that people are talking about a specific part of your appearance? How do you manage those feelings without letting them take over? Any coping strategies or personal stories would really help me feel less alone in this."

80,2,"Currently on my first trip abroad from the US. I am unbelievably excited to be here. For context I’m from Michigan and currently in London and heading to Dublin in a few days. 
I sometimes go in spurts with poor sleep. I am a highly anxious person in general about just about everything. I slept about 8 hours Sunday night, didn’t sleep on the fight Monday but when we arrived here Tuesday I dozed off for probably 2 hours. I was exhausted all day still despite pushing through and came back to the hotel eager to rest but I haven’t slept at all due to anxiety. 
Now I’m fearful I’ll be in a cycle all trip of worrying about sleeping and being rested to do the activities. Tips plz? "
81,2,"Maybe I should stay off the internet, because I keep stumbling across articles that scare me. I read in multiple articles that chocolate contains cannabinoids, and cheese contains an ingredient that reacts with your opioid receptors. I’ve been afraid of chocolate for a while because of the caffeine, but now I’m convinced I’ll never eat it again after reading all of this. I guess I just need help with not spiraling about this. "
82,2,"To make a long story short for the past few weeks or so I’ve been having constant shortness of breath, chest pain and it feels like my heart is pounding and sometimes irregular. I’ve always been a health freak and I do have anxiety/panic attacks, mostly my thoughts get the best out of me and I think I’m seriously ill or gonna die. Does anyone else experience these issues? I’m worried lol

-Chest pain when breathing in deeply and out sometimes (mostly near the heart area)
- Not being able to get the greatest breath in 
-  occasionally pretty extreme night sweats
-  feels like your heart is pounding or skipping a beat/irregular
-  tingly arm occasionally (specifically left) could be my imagination again 

I will repeat I do tend to overthink A LOT of things and I do get paranoid over stuff frequently. I also have cardiophobia (obviously) or whatever it’s called lol. I’m hoping it’s just my anxiety playing tricks on me, but I don’t usually get panic attacks. I just get a worried feeling and thinking something bad is gonna happen to my heart or lungs. Please reach out thank you! "
83,2,"I(35M) believe I’m experiencing a serious bout of change anxiety which is new to me and wanted to get advise on how I should move forward, steps I should take for me. 

In the last 6 months I’ve moved jobs, then moved back again because the new job was not aligning to my career path(unfortunately a theme at this point in life is trying to continuously progress with work) and my wife(31F) in that same time has undergone a vast body image shift after loosing nearly 60 pounds by working out really hard which is just so amazing. 

During the same 6 months, she’s got this new found levels of energy, and new perspective on life. Once she was more like me, extroverted when required, but mainly introverted, content in familiarity and routine, could watch movies, play PC games etc and be relaxed. But now she hates being at home, can’t focus watching a movie or TV show etc. It’s not like we did nothing on weekends, or weren’t spontaneous, we would travel regularly, go on get away trips, we went to 6 major concert/ events last year in addition to regular outings and date nights, also even when one would deserve to sit and relax, she doesn’t see that as relaxing now. 

She’s now just flooding our life with a whole bunch of new ideas - wants to movie cities, got into running, wants to move overseas, wants to get a second job to earn more money, wants to go to raves/dancing, wants to start a TikTok, wants to start dances lessons, wants to and has become abit more independent. Additionally she has been abit more focussed on the physical, and made some insensitive negative comments about my appearance which I pulled her up on and she was extremely apologetic. She has also made comments that she’s felt the last 3-5 years she wasted because she wasn’t happy with herself physically.  I’ll be honest, I received this negatively too, as I was apart of that time and generally thought we had a good time but I’ve always been aware she’s not been happy with her weight so I’ve interpreted it as she hasn’t been happy with how she limited herself over that time. 

Overall it’s really amazing to see her become more confident, and of course who wouldn’t want to try everything in life after finally being happy in their own skin, I mean if you were lactose intolerant and one day you could finally drink milk without issues you’d eat all the dairy products you could. 

It’s just at 1st and still, I am absolutely trying to be her number 1 fan, however I have found myself unfortunately reacting or thinking more negatively, second guessing how I interact with her, or react to her ideas as she keeps coming up with new things. It’s now also gotten to the point where I am not enjoying being at home, sleeping less (gone from a healthy 8 hours down to 5 on average), as I feel our ‘routine’ is no longer ours, and our space, has changed. 

I used to be so nonchalant, so upbeat and positive, open and receptive to new ideas, in fact I used to be the one who said we should move cities, move over seas, do more etc, but it’s as if its just flipped and once I was the positive happy go lucky, go with the flow person, I’ve now become super sensitive to any notion of change, digging my heels in, where as she’s taken the mantle of having all these ideas, being more extroverted etc. 

Whilst I’ve spent a lot of the post discussing our relationship, im not asking for advise on it, as I believe my wife has every right to experience life in this new mindset. This post is about me wanting to be more positive about her and her journey again, and moving away from a change anxiety driven pessimistic mindset - I’m naturally chill, but right now I feel like a worried mum whose kids been out too late and hasn’t called.

84,2,"A family member is going to sell us their house for a really good deal. It has everything we would need and it’s the only way we could afford a house like this. The problem is this all happened very suddenly and I’m completely overwhelmed. I don’t want to sell my current house, but I don’t see how we could stay here forever so we would need to sell it eventually. But this is the only chance we have to buy a bigger house for a price that’s doable for us.

But it’s just moving way too fast. I don’t even know what I want to do. I want to stay and I don’t want to pass up on this opportunity. What I really need is a couple of months to process everything and slowly prepare mentally and physically for the moving process. But I don’t have that option. The family member is moving full speed ahead and if we don’t want the house they’ll just sell it on the open market.

 I’m completely overwhelmed. I wish I could handle this like a regular adult. Instead I feel like I’m regressing to childhood. Like I just want to scream and cry until everything stops. If I didn’t have my family relying on me, I’d be on the verge of actually hurting myself just to make the pain and anxiety stop.

I’m trying to get on medication but couldn’t get an appointment for another month which is too late. I need to do it now.

In addition to not actually wanting to go, I’m also terrified of the actual moving process. I don’t want to sell my house. I don’t want strangers in my house looking at it. I don’t want them taking my house from me.

If I do this and I don’t like it, I can never go back. There’s no return policy or cooling off period. Once it’s done it’s done. I wish there was some other way and there isn’t. This is the only choice but I hate that this is the only choice.

I feel like I’m losing my frigging mind, but I’m a grown up with a family and they’re relying on me. I just want to turn off and relax and do things at a reasonable pace. I don’t like change and I don’t like things moving quickly. I can’t handle it. My world is falling apart around me and I just want to handle it like a normal functioning adult."
85,2,"I really miss the days I didn’t constantly think about my health. I remember the exact day that everything changed. I was about to go on a family trip when I started getting these weird thumps in my chest. I tried to just deal with it but it got worse and worse as the day went on. That night I thought I was going to die. I didn’t want to go to the ER as that’s embarrassing but I was silently really going through it. These symptoms continued and eventually I ended up in the ER a few months later. I had a full cardiac work up and wore a holter monitor for over a month but nothing was found. Since then the frequency of these thumps has died down but they still are annoying. After that I started to get throat and facial pain that I am still dealing with. The doctors and dentists say it’s probably tmj as they can’t find anything wrong but I just sit and think about what if they missed something and there is something seriously wrong. It just constantly consumes my thoughts and it’s really hard to find peace. Now, i have this small lump in my neck above my collarbone. It’s small and hasn’t grown since i noticed it but I always think of the worst case scenario like its sarcoma or something. I feel like I’ve had this for a few months but I really don’t remember when I first noticed it. It’s worsened by the fact that in the past year I’ve had one friend pass away due to lymphoma and one who is currently in treatment for a rare sarcoma. Both were mid 20s just like me and so it’s always on my mind. Sorry this is all over the place I’m just trying to get this out there. I want to feel normal again."
86,2,"For the past few months my anxiety has been pretty bad. I know how strong the mind-gut connection is, and sadly a lot of my anxiety manifests very physically and affects my digestion. 

Recently I’ve noticed that specifically at night, I often get persistent lower abdominal/pelvic pain, right in the region of where I’d typically get period cramps. This pain is pretty dull and just achy. I don’t have many other symptoms, but I do tend to hyperfixate on this pain and probably make it worse by worrying about it. 

It doesn’t matter what I eat, when I eat, or how much I eat. Typically I will have this pain 4 or 5 nights out of 7 a week, which is way too many in my opinion. It is is very frustrating and I’m not sure what to do about it. I’m not diagnosed with any GI illnesses and don’t really have any other persistent symptoms beyond what I noted above. Does anyone else experience any pain similar to this with their anxiety? It’s really starting to bother me and I don’t know what to do. "
87,2,"For reference I'm 18 and looking to become a medical assistant since I finally got my certification, but due to past experiences like giving injections and having very noticable uncontrollable shaky hands I'm extremely worried I will not be able to work and have been avoiding getting a job because of this, I also can barely present in class even if it is one simple slide, this year is when I really noticed the extent of my anxiety which is difficult because outside of school I didn't have much trouble talking to people one on one and am really extroverted around my friends, I eat ok, play soccer with my friends where I can, and my sleep can be better but I woudn't necessarily say they are what causing my anxiety, I have always denied SSRI's from my psychiatrist and started taking Propranolol 10 mg for like 3-4 weeks now, haven't noticed the CRAZY difference that people talk about and my haven't really gotten to put my hands to the test since then but they're still naturally a little shaky when normally, from what I've read about people's experiences with SSRI's I cannot see myself taking them, I have read about many who have become dependant on them, and a lot who said it changed them permenantly for the worst and messed their life up, I also noticed a lot of people who have taken them seem like life is not in orde rnad I'm not judging it's just I guess at the same time It's hard for me to accept whats going on.

I get pain in my sternum that hurts basically 24/7 and a sharp pain on my left collarbone/shoulder. And awful soreness on my ribs/breasts. I don't know what to do!

91,2,"Hi everyone. I don't have money for a therapist, so I need to ask questions here. I've been trying ACT and had some strange responses.  
  
Some background first. I have been having what I call 'panic episodes' for decades. I have anxiety and depression, but I can live a normal life. However, about once every six months I will get an intense weeklong panic attack that completely crushes me.

I tried to improve these things by doing lots of outside work, exercise, diet, not drinking, and just trying to do productive things to make my life better and hoping they would never come back. However, in the last year or so these panic episodes keep happening more and more frequently. 

So now I have tried to get a handle on it by reading some books. I read DARE, and the argument made a lot of sense to me. Mainly, I had always tried to fight these panic episodes. If I recognized one coming on, I would always try to fight it. I would exercise, meditate, etc to try and stop it, but it never worked.

Now I'm trying to accept these feelings a bit more, and allowing them in, so hopefully after a while they just don't seem to be as threatening. I started reading the happiness trap and learning a bit more about ACT.

I've been doing this for the past couple of months, and my panic episodes seem to have changed.   
  
In the past, I would have a week of absolute hell, and I would often need benzos to sleep at night. Then I would magically feel fine and get back to my life.

Now, my episodes seem to be less intense, but they seem to be much longer. Around two weeks or more. But they are certainly nowhere near as catastrophic as they have been in the past. It's definitely a lot easier to just 'sit' with the feelings, and I haven't needed to take any benzos in this state. But its arguably more frustrating as they seem to hang around for longer. I still get some really dark periods.

I'm just wondering what other people's experiences have been if they've ACT stuff before?

TLDR; Trying ACT, my panic attacks are much less intense but last for far longer.

94,2,"I’ve never really tried a post like this or reaching out over the internet . But anxiety and dissociating has become such a heavy issue in my life for over 8 years now. I know thousands if not millions of people experience and deal with it, but due to most people with my level of anxiety not even leaving the house much, i feel so alone and feel like nobody i know in real life deals with this . Only stories from therapists or friends who heard about it. I know it sounds silly but I’m just venting and wanting to see if others deal with it this often . I don’t mean to be insensitive , as I’m aware so many people deal with mental health issues , i hope you understand . I just find myself doing therapy, medication, and even making great strides this last year and improving , yet even when i make huge leaps in bravery and get out more , i have weeks where i crash and feel hopeless like I’m some kind of freak or will never beat my anxiety. It can be so exhausting when everyday feels like a chore or mission to complete instead of just existing happily like so many of my loved ones do. None of them understand dissociation or the feeling of panick attacks or not feeling real . They try to, but just CANT. I feel isolated and alone and scared most of the time and feel like nobody understands me in my life . I know that’s cliche and silly. I’m proud of my progress and i know I’ll have a future some day and i haven’t given out hope; I’m just angry, bitter, sad, and exhausted that this has become a part of me . It has made school impossible , i quit. It makes working any type of job feel terrifying . And it makes the idea of ever being a normal functional person seem like a far off fantasy as opposed to a goal or possibility . I have done things like dates, parties , etc and worked really hard to make friends and get out of the house more, but at least once a month i have waves where i feel it all crashing down, i don’t feel real. I feel overwhelmed and fevered , i can’t eat right , and just going out feels like a nightmare . "
95,2,"It all started back in 2021 when I went to a new barber shop because my usual one was closed. While I was sitting there waiting for my turn, I began overthinking — wondering how the new barber would cut my hair, whether he’d mess it up, and if I’d regret it. That spiral of thought slowly turned into my first full-blown panic attack.

Since that day, nothing has felt the same. From that one moment, my mind and body have never fully calmed down. Every day since then has brought a different symptom — sometimes physical, sometimes mental. It’s been a cycle that’s lasted from 2021 all the way to 2025, and I still feel stuck in it. No clear diagnosis, just constant overthinking, fear, and exhaustion. It’s like my nervous system never turned off after that day."
96,2,"I live in Florida where bugs are plentiful, but about 2 weeks ago I was sleeping and felt something tickle my arm. It ended up being a palmetto bug (a giant cockroach). I shot up out of bed and had a mild panic attack, squished it and flushed it down the toilet. I spent the next several days fortifying my apartment. Spraying everything with bug spray, saturated my entire room in peppermint oil, 2 diffusers going, etc. palmetto bugs are mostly outdoor roaches, they’re not infestation type roaches. They come inside when it rains or is super hot. I literally cannot get a good night sleep since then. I feel like I always feel something tickling my leg, arm, face, etc. I end up ripping the covers off of myself several times and flailing around thinking there’s a bug on me. It got to the point where I’ve completely shaved all of my leg hair off to prevent it from tickling my leg as well. I have no clue what to do. I know this sounds so crazy, but it has literally disrupted my life for 2 weeks. "
97,2,As if I wasn’t anxious and struggling enough 😩 I can’t tell what’s true and what’s people just trying to scare people or not telling the full story. I try to avoid seeing it but it’s just everywhere. I’m in the UK and the government never stops making stupid decisions and getting too involved in things they don’t need to. The anxiety around it is just getting worse each time I come across it.

99,2,"Hey all, I just slowly tapered off of Zoloft and have wanted to try natural supplements in place of Zoloft. My biggest issue has been controlling anxiety as I get anxious very easily over small things. 

Has anyone tried ashwaganda, l-theanine, and / or Magnesium. 


I want to try these out, but want to hear others thoughts before I do. Any input would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks!

100,2,"Random bouts of anxiety & suicidal ideation.

About every 3 months or so, I burn out from too much stuff happening at once & then I go through at least a week of anxiety, primarily in my stomach, plus suicidal ideation where I have a devil on my shoulder telling me to do something that rash but instead of that im terrified of doing it and the effect it would have on the people in my life. 

Anyone else go through this and have any advice? Im currently waiting for my therapy to start for everything generally wrong with my mental health etc.Thanks all. :)

101,2,"I've had a medication turn my shins into scaly rash.

I also gotten a severe dystonic reaction from some script given for food poisoning.

i've had other reactions to other things but i think those set roots for it.

I wouldn't even take advil when I developed migraines a few times a week for several months, a couple years ago. or shingles.

the thought of having to take pills scares my inner self to tears. It just knows they are going to harm me. 1 part panic attack at the thought, 1 part flashback with fight or flight.

but I gotta try something, the stress of the recent triggers for my worst health issues in over a decade are destroying me.

i worry about reactions, side effects, and withdrawal. dependence, meds that don't work or have the opposite effect  and  long build up, adjustments, and tapers, during which there may be no benefit but still sideeffects. "

I was delaying registration until today, and there's no going back. I'm so nervous to the point where I'm scared I'm gonna end up not going last minute. I'm not a very social person in general, not very good with looks and all that. I'm relieved that make-up won't really matter because Im gonna be wearing a mask anyways. But my wardrobe is so poor, all I have are tops, t-shirts, couple of button ups, a few short skirts, pants and jeans. Shoes wise I only have three pairs of sneakers. When the discussion about the event started everyone was excited to show off their new dresses & suits. I am so worried I'm gonna be sticking out with my clothes. I wish I could bring someone with me so that I at least wasn't so nervous but I don't really have friends here. Usually with events like that back in my home country I'd go with my sisters & family and would just hang out with them, not really with anyone else. I don't really know what I wanna hear from you guys but any tips/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

P.S. I am on my way to buy a mask right now, hope I don't end up looking stupid."
105,2,"So I semi-recently discovered that I have such terrible anxiety in the working world that it is genuinely impossible for me. I'm a 17 year old and had finally got a restaurant job about 8 months ago. However even before clocking into my first shift I felt so anxious about working I was shaking so hard on the drive there I nearly crashed, and was so nauseous I almost puked. Then I only ever ended up working four shifts at the damn place because the third one I got so stressed during not even that much of a rush that it triggered a full blown nearly two hour long panic attack, most of which was spent hiding in either the bathroom or the walk-in. I managed to work through that day, but the next shift, before anything even happened, I started uncontrollably crying within the first hour just sweeping the floors. It was like my brain permanently associated the building with evil. I ended up faking sick and quitting. 

And now every single time I try to look at new places to work, or even *think* about working somewhere, I start *crying.* It doesn't matter how much I tell myself it's not that serious, cause *I know it's not.* But nothing helps the fact that I'm someone who can't even *think* about getting some minimum wage average teenager job without crying my eyes out and feeling genuine actual cosmic-level dread. I wanna work so badly, both to get my parents off my ass, and also because I just want some fun money! I wanna be able to do what everyone else does and have fun in my teenage years using my paychecks to by silly little stuff that makes me happy without having to worry about bills. But I can't do that without, for some unknown reason, losing my shit.

So basically what I'm asking is literally *what* am I meant to do. I know retail or something generally less high stress than food service would be a step in the right direction, but again I can't even think about going back to working without getting anxious and nauseous. Medication hasn't worked either, as I've been medicated for anxiety for about two months now and still feel the same about this issue as I did before. So I'm looking for some tips. Thank you all <3"
106,2,"I’ve been having really bad health anxiety for the past month or so. I had a ultrasound done and they found a supposed lesion on my liver. Got bloodwork done and everything came normal aside from low ferritin. Had an MRI done and they found no masses but they did find a focal fatty infiltration on the right lobe of my liver. 

My new doctor doesnt seem concerned about it. Obviously I’ve been trying to eat healthy and even stopped socially drinking alcohol entirely. I still get these aches every other day or so, I’m wondering if it’s gastritis or something. Has anybody here experienced something like this before?"
107,2,"Hi all,

I have been in talk therapy for anxiety for a while, I definitely do have anxiety with specific symptoms. However, I was recently prescribed an inhaler for exercise induced asthma. 

Anxiety and shortness of breath goes hand in hand for me for the past couple years. Benzos improved some of this. But I discontinued them. 

I tried my inhaler today before exercise, and I immediately felt like I could breathe easier. I had attributed the shortness of breath I was feeling to having just met my mom out for dinner. 

Has anyone had shortness of breath symptoms attributed to asthma? For a long time now I was thinking the anxiety caused the breath issue but now I'm almost thinking it was the opposite. 

To describe my breath issue: it just feels like I can't breathe in good air all the way. Shallow breath, not hyperventilating but shorter breaths that are higher in frequency. I'd get the ""Sunday scaries"" every evening. So I thought it was solely anxiety.


Thank you"

Just the thought of waking up alone in a dark house fills me with anxiety and I wish it didn’t.

My partner is only gone four nights but that’ll feel like a hundred by the time it’s about done. I worry for her and I worry for myself and it’s exhausting.

Family / friends are too busy to come stay with me for a few days as well. It’s just really hard and I don’t currently work so I’m at home alone mostly.

110,2,"Hi everyone, i am currently on holiday in sevilla, Spain and i really need some support. It's sooooo incredibly hot out at the moment, temperatures reaching 40+°C in the afternoon. We booked this months ago and i didn't think about the weather at the time. Yesterday we arrived at our accommodation in the early afternoon so we went the supermarket and got some food and drinks since it was way to hot out. This is the point were i started to feel a little panicky but nothing too bad. At 18:30 we decided to explore some of the city and do some sightseeing. 1 hour later and i am starting to feel really bad. I could not keep my hartreate under control and felt like i couldn't breathe in the heat. I started to feel nauseous, dizzy, weak, i could not engage in a normal conversation anymore. We had a prepaid visit planned for la setas the seville (a big achitectural structure where you can promenade on the toplfloor with amazing views of the city), so we still went. By the time we finished i felt soo bad that i was convinced i would pass out or throw up, it was awful. I managed to get down and told my boyfriend i felt really bad and wanted to go back to the accommodation. I eventually didn't throw up (i did came very close a few times) and after laying in the AC for awhile i felt a little better. But now my anxiety has been triggerd like crazyyyy. I think i suffered some kind of heat exhaustion and i am sooo incredibly scared to go back out there tomorrow. It's currently 2 o'clock in the morning and i have barely slept because i am so anxious. What can i do? This is supposed to be my birthdaytrip and i feel like i am ruining it already....
And there are so many beautiful things to see here but the thought of going outside is already making me nauseous again. On top of that have i barely eaten anything all day because of the nausea but rn i think i am feeling nauseous because i have nothing in my system. 
We leave on saterday but tbh if i could step on a plane and leave tomorrow, i would be gone asap. 
Anyway, thank you if you're still here and read al the way down. I don't really know what i am after/what i am trying to find here. Perhaps i just needed to vent but any kind of support or some kind words are appreciated, thank you! 💕"

Sometimes when I remember my childhood, I get overwhelmed with fear and anxiety. I start wondering if I might turn into a bad person like my parents, who abused me.

Does anyone else feel this way?

Do you ever get anxiety or even panic attacks from the fear that you might turn into your abuser or become a bad person?

I really want to know if I’m not alone in this.

I was straightening my hair and let the straightener on my laptop,which melted it. I tried not to get upset but I started feeling so stupid for making such a preventable mistake. Then I start feeling like I’m worthless,that nobody loves me and will never love me,I’m an idiot who’s going to end up being a failure and disappointment people and end up proving them right with how stupid I am,and finally how I should just kill myself and end  my suffering now because no one will miss me anyway.

Even my hands started shaking uncontrollably.

For me its basically impossible though to learn them all, i unintentionally want to rush, and all of them together plus other things like playing/making games, making music and watching movies/anime is way too much, but i cant think about not doing any of these things. What should i do? i cant leave something out, i dont know what i like most even after months of trying, ive been stuck in this cycle for at least months, the only way to not think about it is ignore it, which doesnt solve anything and i eventually get to feeling like this again after a few months."

Guys, I'm FREAKING out. I went to my doctor today because I'm having left side chest discomfort for days now, some coughing due to allergies, etc. I made a post here a few days ago, worrying about a heart attack.

She listened to my heart and lungs and said everything sounds clear, but she still did an ECG.

My ECG was normal, my blood pressure was normal (114/79), I just had slightly elevated pulse (101), but they cleared out anything going acutely wrong with the heart. Which was a HUGE relief. But the doctor did say, she'll forward me to do some lab work.

My high sensitivity troponin was normal but I did have elevated D Dimer. The normal levels are till 550, mine was 554. Now I'm freaking out that I have a clot travelling in my body or a pulmonary embolism 😭 I'm 28 by the way.

119,2,"Hi my name is Mary and I want to know if anyone haves this problem like I do. It’s a very annoying problem, and it affects me a lot. Let me explain. My partner has joined the military and we’re in a long distance relationship now, so it makes it hard for us to see each other. The last time I saw them in person was when they came to see me was in January, but when they were here, I was anxious the whole time. I get really anxious around my partner, I don’t know why, they’re my safe place but ever since they have left to the military. My anxiety has gotten really bad. The day I said goodbye to them at the airport, was the worst time of my life. I stopped eating and my anxiety just gotten really bad, like yeah back then I would get a bit anxious here and there but it just got really horrible. And when it was time to fly out to see them graduate. It was so awful. I ruined everything. I was having really bad anxiety attacks. I didn’t get to enjoy my time with them. And I made myself a fool in front of their family. I don’t want that happening again. but this time I’m on medication.. but I’m still anxious to go see them. I’m able to go see them next month but I’m really nervous to see them again. I'm even deciding not go to because of my anxiety.. but it makes me sad that I'm missing an opportunity to see them again and being there for them.. And I know I'm hurting my partner..they want me to be there but ofc they also want me comfortable, and don't want to make me do something I'm not comfortable with.. and that means not going to see them. They know I have this issue but it makes me mad because why do I have this issues.. it's so annoying. They never did anything wrong to me. They care for me and love me. Why do I get so anxious when I see them. I wasn’t like that back then. But it’s only when they left to the military I started to get anxious to see them again. Does this happen to anyone else? Getting anxious to see their love ones or a friend again after a very long time? And what do you do to cope with this. and why does this happen :("
120,2,"Hey, so I’ve been smoking weed daily for about 3 years. I smoked very little — about 5 grams would last me a month (very low tolerance).

Anyway, about a month ago, I started getting slightly more anxious than usual when smoking, but I didn’t think much of it. Then suddenly, one night after smoking, about three hours passed and I had a really bad panic attack — to the point where I almost called the ER. (I’m certain my stuff isn’t laced because it’s the same stash I’ve been smoking for months.)

The next morning, I felt very off. I think I experienced depersonalization — everything felt unreal, like a video game — so I decided to stop smoking. After a week, I felt 90% fine, so I decided to try smoking again.

I smoked daily for about another week, but I started to feel more anxious again, so I stopped. It’s now been 8 days since I last smoked, and I feel fine. I still feel a bit off sometimes, but much better than I did in the first 5 days after quitting.

My question is: why is this happening? I’ve had panic attacks and anxiety before when smoking, but nothing like this last one — it really messed me up. Nothing major in my life has changed that could have caused it. I have a great relationship with my family, I’m doing well in university, I work out five times a week and have a physique I’m proud of, I have a good job, good friends, and a loving girlfriend.

But out of the blue, cannabis just stabbed me in the back for no reason. After reading some posts, it seems like other people have had similar experiences. So, my question is: what’s happening here exactly, and why now? Any ideas?

**P.S. I don’t use other substances or drink alcohol. I really like weed and would like to smoke again, but I don’t know if my body will allow me to continue.**

Thanks."

Jaws too, but it was bearable. But a day ago cramping in jaw became very strong and it hurts. I feel very strong tension here. Like it became paralysed. I'm began to panicking, and asked ai what these symptoms means. And it mentioned ""tmj dysfunction"". I never heard of it before, then remembered about clicks. I googled symptoms, and now I'm sure i have this. And severe deficiency probably made it worse.

124,2,"Over the last few months, my general anxiety has blown out of proportion due to moving states, family issues, and being irresponsible with recreational activities (nothing crazy just took a lil too many shrooms one day). Ive started feeling out of control most days, like Im watching my body move like Im watching TV from inside my head, feeling overly worried about everything or nothing at all, sometimes I get moments of confusion and can't figure out what I was doing or piece together a coherent thought. Sometimes I have panic attacks, where I feel like Im in a dreamlike state, I cant get enough oxygen, my head hurts, I feel like Im developing a new mental illness that will never go away and I'll never be normal again. 

I've started taking the steps I need to take care of this, Ive talked with a doctor and Im waiting on my insurance to approve therapy and stuff like that. So far I haven't had any explosive experiences, no breaking down, no lashing out at anyone, nothing like that, I feel Im very good at keeping things under wraps as much as I can, but Ive noticed Im having issues with productivity in work and feeling like im not a person when talking to people sometimes.

So I (19F) need help. At just 18, I moved 7 hours away from my parents house. I did that because I started college but also to be in the same area as my boyfriend (24M) with whom I've been since nearly 3 years now.
I developed a huge separation anxiety both ways since then. I dread having to do all the traveling journey to either go back to my family or to my boyfriend. I cry a lot everytime I have to move from a place to another. 
I've been crying for the past 5 days randomly throughout the day because today I had to go back to my family. Last time, I cried 3 days in advance because I have to go back to my boyfriend.
I try to make everything positive, think about nice things, but nothing seems to make this angst go away.
As I'm writing this, I feel a panick attack coming the same way as it did yesterday. How to cope with it ? How to stop crying everytime I have to travel ? Anyone with the same experience? If so, what did you do to get better ?
I'm very upset at myself for being this way because I feel like I ruined the evening/night of my boyfriend yesterday because I couldn't stop crying, I feel very guilty.

My arms feel like very heavy as if i cant lift them at times and my hands have been shaky along with feeling like i dont have total control of my hands. I have been a bit worried, i did drink alcohol last night and typically my symptoms are excuberated because of alcohol but still im a bit worried about my hands and arms as my arms are heavy and my hands are cramping and just feel tight. Has anyone else undergone this? Thank you"
128,2,"Hi guys, new, not sure what im here for but I thought maybe on reddit someone will understand me. If you dont want to read everything skip to ""my current situation"", im trying to make this short.

Ive had anxiety issues as long as I can remember, this is not something new, and I have been managing. However, i feel like in the last months its really getting overwhelmingly worse. 

Im anxious about a lot of things, but i think the worst for me is anything that has to do with my health. But also my studies, life, future and the completion of daily tasks.  

I dont know if the following paragraph could be triggering but just in case i warn for potential health anxiety trigger. 

A bit more than 3 months ago I was sick and fell unconscious for a few seconds, enough to fall on the ground. I dont know if i hit my head but i spent weeks worrying that i might have some brain damage, or any other issues that might be caused by the fall. I had episodes which i dont know if i can qualify as panic attacks, but defenitely overwhelming anxiety, with fast heart beating and difficulty focusing, and getting out of those situations was hard.

Then i had a 1 month trip where I was feeling great, all the thoughts went away kind of. Of course i still had my usual ""standard"" anxiety but nothing big that affects my daily life. After i came back, the 1st 1 month i was feeling great, so more or less 2 months of pretty alright time. Then i found myself a project for my bachelor thesis, and since then ive been constantly anxious about anything.

My current situation: 

I get random heart palpilations, increased heart beating, i had a few cases of feeling light headed (tho that might have been related to blood sugar and food). Once i feel like my heart is slightly irregular in any way, i get into a big anxiety episode where i keep focusing on it and imagining what sickness it could be, which makes it worse and its just a big cycle. It is particularly bad if i have coffe or sweets, so ive been trying to avoid them, and it does indeed improve my situation quite a lot. The heart thing almost doesnt happen, so i think those 2 really increase how i feel. And i dont know, im just worried about my health, my education and the future to come... And damn i miss coffe. Those 2 have never caused reactions like this before, but since around a month its a standard.. 

I want to get some professional help (i currently live in Germany) but you have to wait for months to get an appointment. I know i should but how can i talk about stuff that happened 3 months ago, when the emotional connection isnt there. Im not sure what i can do to improve my situation. 

As i said, I dont know what im searching for here but I thought why not... I guess just getting in touch with people in similar situations would be nice. I might delete this post as its a bit personal and i usually avoid that here on reddit. Thank you for your time. "
129,2,"Any way to deal with the stress around just...having objects? My ADHD makes me more prone to forget where important things are, so the more clutter there is, the more the risk I lose something important when it *really* matters. So I just live in fear of waiting for the next shoe to drop. And for it to be very clearly my fault. The best I've been able to manage this is just to make sure I have as few things as possible to minimize the number of ""moving parts"" in life. I've tried so many organizational strategies and they never stick, so the relief I understand others get from those just ends up feeling hollow to me. Any help? 🫠"

She can just do it herself and probably please her even better than I will ever do and can.

I'm known to get anxiety after (and during and before) any medical procedures. Today my de tist insisted i get a panoramic x ray at another clinic and come back to him. But after the x-ray in a few seconds I immediately felt a loss of energy and focus. It turned out I didn't even need the x-ray which later made me feel worse (mentally). But I'm not exaggerating about the physical symptoms I immediately felt afterwards. Any replies to cheer me up are greatly appreciated..

I think the worst part of the trip was that the dentists were blatantly laughing and looking down on me for my dental hygiene, which isn't completely my fault as my previous dentist said my teeth are just very weak naturally. Kind of lost confidence in myself afterwards. Also just looking at the x-rays and how much work needs to be done (and money paid) took my stress/anxiety levels even further over my normal limit..  Was having such a beautiful week/day prior to this.."

Since then, everything has spiraled — anxiety, panic attacks, chest pain, heart palpitations, insomnia, health fears. I’ve done tests, seen doctors, been told it’s anxiety or grief, but I can’t believe that when my body feels like it’s shutting down.

I don’t feel like myself anymore. I can’t even enjoy simple things. I’m constantly scared — of dying, of something being missed, of never feeling “normal” again. I feel isolated, even when people are around. I’m tired of fighting this invisible war every day and pretending like I’m okay.

I mean that’s the only way I can describe it, but I don’t actually feel like I’m being watched and I certainly know that I’m not. It’s like I am on film all the time or something. It’s like every single thing I do is being watched and analyzed. Perfect example of how this affects me is that I was standing at my kitchen island and stared to use it to do some stretching. Home alllll by myself mind you. Some of the positions I was putting myself in were funny looking or even provocative and so I stopped doing them because it was as if there was someone standing right next to me watching me which made me feel self conscious. Not a soul around. What the actual fuck!? Does anyone else experience this? "
135,2,"I’ve been on 20 mg of fluoxetine for about 3 years and recently upped my dose to 40 mg as I’ve been dealing with more and more spikes of anxiety and depression over the past 6 months or so. I researched the side effects because I haven’t changed my dose in so long and wanted to be prepared for what might change. I felt like I had side effects within 24 hours (jittery, fast heart rate, more anxious) but this could have been a placebo because I also have a lot of health anxiety, especially about my heart. And even thought I’ve been having the same symptoms since the start I’m now worried I may be developing serotonin syndrome. I know that’s not likely but I can’t help but worry. It’s been about 2.5 weeks since the increase and I’m still experiencing jitteriness, restlessness, palpitations, increased heart rate, some spiked anxiety, a little brain fog, and kind of feeling floaty like out of my body at times. Exercise is important to me and I usually do cardio but with the medication increase I’m getting fatigued faster and am paranoid I’m going to hurt my heart while doing cardio when I have palpitations or increase heart rate. But I know if I don’t do my routine workouts it will increase my anxiety too. I’ve cut down my caffeine intake a lot to lessen the jitters and restlessness but I’m feeling really hopeless right now. I was feeling so crappy before the med increase and was so excited thinking this would be what I needed to improve my mental health. I have lots of therapy tools, I exercise and have good nutrition, I have hobbies and good people around me. I’ve always been someone that needed medication to be chemically balanced. But now I feel like things are almost worse on the med increase. I know there is an adjustment stage and it can take 4-6 weeks to fully acclimate but I feel like I want to go back to 20 mg. Then I get upset that I’ll go back down in dosage so the side effects will go away but my emotions will be wrecked again.

Just looking to see if anyone else has had a similar experience when increasing their SSRI dosage. Does it get better? Has anyone been successful in reducing their dosage back down? I’m lost at what to do right now. Thanks in advance!"
136,2,"Hello. I always get two or three sinus infections each year and get them treated just fine. This past winter I had one and was treated with antibiotics Augmentin, with no complaints. The past 3 weeks I’ve had a sinus infection, tried Doxycycline and had horrible panic attacks. Dr switched me to another antibiotic, Azithromycin, more panic attacks. Now they want me to try Augmentin but I am scared I will just have another panic attack because I’m having them now. Do I take it and risk the panic attacks or just hope this forever sinus infection doesn’t get worse and goes away? "
137,2,"I keeps this short. I'm 19 and a first year in university and academically I'm doing great. I don't feel too much pressure, no friends, I'm just doing me. I recently wrote an exam and I know did great, I actually knew and understood what I was writing about. But the thing is this wasn't me a few months ago in g12. I performed poorly. I tried different study methods, stayed up all night and even when I was sure i did good in a test, I didn't. Since I'm doing well now, I've become suspicious, because I had gotten used to the failing. I know this could lead to self sabotage and overthinking in the future, I obviously don't want it to. I was at my hs for 5 years and have many core memories there (like my first panic attack), I got used to expexting poor grades, but I can't help it. Maybe it was just luck or the test was that easy. I feel like I am unworthy of this success."
138,2," trying to find the right way to describe this feeling I get at work. Usually my day to day is pretty chill. There are busy periods but I’m expecting them. My issue is when there is a sudden surge of work they came out of nowhere that I can do. But my body is panicking and tenses up to where it hurts. Mainly in my back and chest. I try to use music to distract my mind but sometimes it kinda makes no difference, especially if the music is fast paced. Once everything is done and settled down. I feel my muscles relaxing but the pain is slightly there from the tense feeling "
139,2,"So I had a package marked “delivered,” but I go outside and… no package. Of course, I immediately assume it’s been stolen because anxiety doesn’t let me think rationally for even 3 seconds. I’m looking around, and my neighbor has been sitting outside for a while, so I think, “Okay maybe he saw something?” (This is where it all starts going downhill.)

I walk over in my Daria t-shirt (which becomes weirdly relevant), and I’m already anxious, like fully spiraling internally. I ask him if he saw a package by my door and before I can even finish, he compliments my shirt. “Yo I used to watch that show back in the day.” Sir. You’re like 22. 😭 But instead of just saying thanks like a normal person I go “Thanks! It used to be my favorite show” WHICH IS A LIE??? I don’t even know why I said that. Anxiety had the wheel.

Anyway, he swears he didn’t see anything, and we’re both clearly uncomfortable but being overly polite. I apologize. He apologizes. Neither of us did anything wrong. Peak awkward.

So then I’m walking away like “Great, I just accused this man of stealing (I didn’t) and now he thinks I’m a weirdo (I am) and possibly racist (I'm white, he’s Black, and my brain immediately jumped to 'he’s gonna think I’m a Karen').” Just FULL spiral.

THEN, I get back to my phone and realize the “proof of delivery” photo I saw? Was from LAST MONTH. I had the wrong tracking number. The correct photo showed it was delivered to an entirely different apartment complex with the same door number. So yeah. No one stole it. I’m just dumb.

So what do I do next? Like a normal person, just move on? Nope. I walk BACK to the poor guy and APOLOGIZE FOR ASKING HIM IF HE SAW A PACKAGE. Because my anxiety told me I made him uncomfortable and I couldn’t live with that.

He literally laughs and goes “shorty, you thought you made me nervous?” like sir I am DYING inside 😭

I don’t even remember what I said because my brain blacked out from panic but I know I was word vomiting and explaining that I wasn’t accusing him of anything and that if someone did that to me, I’d be creeped out, and it was just a mess. I basically had a panic attack at this man’s doorstep in a Daria t-shirt over some damn makeup.

Anyway, he was really nice about it and probably forgot five minutes later. Me? I’m still lying on the floor hours later reliving every awkward moment in HD.

Oh and yeah, the package was just a box of free cosmetics I get for reviewing stuff. It’s being resent. Crisis averted. Can’t say the same for my dignity tho.

Moral of the story: check the tracking number before anxiety turns you into the neighborhood weirdo

140,2,"My anxiety has gotten so bad this year, to the point where I should probably be on medication. I was on sertraline around 8 years ago and it really helped, but my boyfriend at the time made me stop taking it. I tried taking it again 2 years ago, but I had brain zaps and confusion on the first day, so I stopped because it made me scared. Fast forward to now. I'm seeing a psyhiatrist and he said it's not normal to have brain zaps on the first day of sertraline, so I might need something less strong. I was going to start guanfacine, but after more research I learned that you shouldn't take it if you have low pressure. My doctor confirmed my blood pressure usually reads low (100/60). 

I just want something that won't cause brain zaps and something I can take even with low blood pressure. I don't know if a mediciation exists that would be right for me. I take ativan for panic attacks, but I need something for daily anxiety. 

Any advice?"
141,2,"I’m a 27f female who has had an absolute horrible time with anxiety and major depressive disorder and OCD my entire life. I’m medicated, but was recently upped because I’m having such a hard time lately and have been stuck at home(currently jobless and car-less) I reached out to a respite center and they’re supposed to call me in a couple of days with a spot opening but I’m scared. Leaving the safety of my home to do this sounds like a nightmare to me. I’ve been considering inpatient but I just don’t know if it will help me. I’m anxious 24/7 with some relief that is Brief during the day and then at night when my partner is home and we’re going to bed. I’m maybe getting 4 hours of sleep and then waking up anxious.

143,2,"Hi. I usually never write into any subs, but this time im really struggling and i need help or someone whos in the same boat or any advice really.
 I struggle with ocd, anxiety and bipolar disorder. My anxiety is so bad i cant eat normally bc of my huge fear of choking or being allergic and dying from being allergic. We are at the point where i lost 15kgs in one and a half months. I can only eat puréed foods and liquids tbh. My psychiatrist gave me stimuloton (hungarian medication name ik it’s weird) its sertraline. I took 5x 25mg doses, everything went fine the first 4times, the 5th i felt my throat itch for 2-3mins MAX, 3hours after taking the medication, ofc my mind decided im allergic to it so i havent been able to look at it, not even taking it again.. my condition is getting much worse. with severe depersonalization and derealization. Is there anyone out there struggling with this? This huge fear or taking meds bc of allergies? If yes, how did you work over it? How did u do it? And the eating part? I feel so hopeless and lost bc everytime I decide im going to take them again i fail bc of how terrified i am. I really need help, im going for a medication based allergy test in a month and it takes another month for the results, and i fear i will go insane until then. Thank you guys in advance ."
144,2,"Throwaway cause I don't like being too emotional on my main.

Please note that I live in a 3rd world country. 

Almost 2 years ago, I had my lower right wisdom tooth removed. I received lingual nerve damage. This is a rare thing, especially permanent damage. All the studies I've read says less than 2%. 

Half my tongue is in a constant state of ""rawness"", like I just burned it from eating too hot food. I'm in constant discomfort, sometimes it crosses the line into pain. It took a while, but I've more or less accepted that my life has been permanently changed because of this.

Until my dentist (not the one that injured me) told me that my only other fully erupted wisdom tooth, the upper right one, needed to be extracted. I feel like throwing up. 

She says that, based on the x-rays, it's not near any nerves. The chances of nerve damage are low.

I can usually calm myself down by thinking, ""Millions of other people do this everyday"", but how can I calm myself down when I've already experienced a 1 in a million injury? I just feel like crying.

I've been putting off the extraction for a fews months and have just been tolerating the pain. I take a lot of pain killers. "
145,2,"Note: This is not proofread or greatly thought out. Just a piece of pure desperation right now.



Hi, I just needed to share this somewhere because I’m really struggling right now and have no one I can reach out to.

I’m currently on a short solo trip (not my first), only 2 hours by train or car from home which I decided to go on because the last 6 months have been incredibly rough anxiety wise and May has been, not a new but still very deep low, depression wise. I’ve been dealing with general anxiety and social anxiety since I was a kid and developed health anxiety around 2021.
I thought this short trip might help me make some positive memories regarding being away from home (because several mainly health related incidents from last year now make me incredibly anxious or downright avoidant to go further than 20 miles from my home) and to get a break from my family, who have been the cause of some pretty severe breakdowns the past month.

The arrival day was not perfect but good enough that I actually felt quite content if not actually happy and even before the trip began I actually felt excited instead of dreading it. But today a mix of heat, dehydration and overstimulating caused an anxiety attack that made my pulse go up to 140 even though I was just sitting and I had to leave the place I was eating at after only taking two bites of the food. I fled back to my hotel and have been in my room since lunch time, crying, still feeling anxious and unwell and desperately just wanting to give up and go home as soon as possible. I drank lots but couldn’t eat much. I’m still feeling nauseous and am also a very picky eater, plus I’m conveniently extremely paranoid about getting food poisoning, which obviously makes it really hard for me to find anything to eat right now. That being said my pulse is still pretty high (6 hours later) and approaching bed time (despite just sitting or lying down).

It just hurts that I was actually so excited to go and had all these things planned. I was so convinced it was gonna be such a positive experience and that I’d be able to travel more this year, maybe even to corners of the country that can’t be reached within a few hours or even out of the country, but now I just have another negative experience my anxiety will cling onto and remind me of next time I want to go further than just my usual grocery store. 
I’m also stressing about all the things I still had planned. I already spent money that I won’t get back and have several other things planned, that once I start them I can’t easily abandon for the safety of my hotel like today, but the thought of doing these things makes me so anxious. One the other hand not going would make me so depressed and disappointed and would just fuel future anxiety (plus waste my money).
And ironically enough the thought of packing and making sure I got everything and dragging my luggage through public transport and several train rides until I’m back home also makes me anxious, so not even my “flight” option sounds appealing and safe right now, making me just utterly frozen.
And to top it all off I’m also extremely anxious about having a health issue (like a random diarrhoea attack that I’ve had before several times and that actually are the cause for this specific new branch of my anxiety) while on the boat now, because I ate at this food chain place today and last time I ate at that place (but different location) I had digestive issues the next morning.

Generally I feel like I don’t really have a chance to live life like this (the topic of therapy and medication is such a lengthy one with me that I don’t want to burden this already too long text with so let’s just say it’s not an option). 

I know I should take it one hour at a time. Just wait and see what happens and just focus on getting through it, even if I spend the next few days in my room or go home early, but I just really need some advice or comforting words or anything that could help even a little.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far and thank you so so much to any of you who decide to reply."
146,2,"Hello there,

I'm just looking for advice for those with experience. For a long time, at least since high school over ten years ago, I've been on Zoloft. It has helped me, but I feel I am at a point that I want to wean off of it. I don't want to be taking it my entire life, but I'm scared that my anxiety will just get worse again. I have an appointment with my doctor about my medicine in about a month and I am going to bring this up to her. I had a period where I suddenly stopped medication, due to losing access after college for a bit, and it didn't feel great. Had anger issues that I never dealt with before as a withdrawel symptom. I know thats because of it being sudden, but I am still quite nervous.

So, I just wanted to see... has anyone else had experience quitting their anxiety medication? How did it go, and what should I expect so it doesn't take me by surprise?

Thank you, I hope you have a wonderful day."
147,2,"Hi, so I've got needle trauma and two blood tests scheduled + an MRI with contrast sooo it's bad. I've started panicking around the end of May, but managed to survive without xanax even though the physical effects of the anxiety are excruciating. But now, an IBS flare up has joined the fun. Meaning I'm in even more excruciating pain which makes it hard to even get out of bed, until I take a xanax and all the pain magically stops. I already take Prozac, and Buspar 4 times a day, and it's helped a little, but the anxiety is just getting too strong. And another thing, is that 10 days after the MRI I'm going on holiday, where I'm also gonna take xanax every day for a week, bcs my brain does not know when to shut up and let me live. So. It's bad. I have had other times where I took xanax every day for some time, and I always managed to taper off it, and take as needed again, but I don't think I ever took it for so long. Sorry if this post is chaotic, I can't think properly bcs of the anxiety 😭
EDIT: just to elaborate, I would be taking the xanax for a bit more than a month, counting also the holiday"
148,2,"it usually switches between heart palpitations or just feeling out of breath, like this morning i was walking in my kitchen and had to sit down to catch my breath for literally no reason. it could also be due to low iron (or maybe the tempertatures rising) but i've been very sad and alert for the entire morning so that surely doesn't help... i had a similar episode a couple of days ago too, i was talking to a friend but at a certain point i had to stop texting her for a bit cause it got very hard to breathe, it's just that this morning it lasted maybe 10 seconds while that time it went on for a good hour even after she stopped talking to me. it's been happening for maybe 2/3 months decently frequently, idk is this common?"
149,2,"I'm so nervous about going to college, I've never left my hometown. I'm not worried about my grades or waking up on time I'm worried about having to talk to a bunch of people. I have really bad social anxiety and I don't do well with a lot of people but I also can't do online learning with my ADHD. "
150,2,"We all have our ups and downs. The following is a message I sent to my husband about 15 minutes ago and his response.  Thankful for his sense of humor because it made me laugh.

Not necessarily asking for an opinion just need a place to vent. Sorry I don’t really have any options.  And you probably don’t need to or want to hear this but don’t know what to do with all I am experiencing.

I have felt strange since I got up with some anxiety (fortunately haven’t had it for a while) it kept escalating and then I thought I was in a reprieve. I am experiencing so many emotions and physical symptoms at once and it is so DAMN (uncomfortable. ( sorry for language I am thinking worse. I have been trying hard to relax mind and body and I feel intense frustration and anger. I close my eyes and see me hurling bricks at buildings with everything I have along with some expletives.  I am trying to release the anger, hurt, and frustration with each brick. 

I am so tired of doctors and medicines and problems. 

I feel like my insides are being ripped out too. 

I am asking God to make it stop. Took more meds. It is awful. No answer to this but why do I have to go through this craziness? Especially after things have been going well.

Great now I am crying. Guess you are my journal. 

I have fought for so hard for so long and honestly have tried everything. I am so done. 

But no, I have to somehow pull myself together in less than 15 minutes, put a smile on my face, and move forward to get the kiddos. 

I don’t want to be trapped in this HELL anymore or ever again. I was so thankful the last couple weeks that I almost felt normal.

I know, hold on, it’s going to get better. I am hurting mentally and emotionally in ways I cannot even express. Have no clue why now. Of course, it is affecting me on all fronts.

I will be down in by the time we will be leaving.

Sooo, want to make sure I understand... you're not feeling well? 😂😂😂

151,2,"I have SEVERE debilitating health anxiety and OCD. I have been terrified of like dozens of diseases over the past many years. I am 31 and have had this since I was a kid.

About 5 years ago one of my obsessions was melanoma. I overanalyzed all of my moles and measured them and took thousands of photos. I have the type of health anxiety where I avoid doctors. So I’ve never seen a doctor for any of my health worries. I just dwell and google and obsess until they pass.

I gave birth to a baby girl 2.5 months ago. Pregnancy was physically perfect but mentally SO FRICKEN HARD. I was TERRIFIED of going to appointments (I had to take Ativan beforehand!) and all day everyday I was convinced something would go wrong (pre eclampsia, baby coming prematurely). 

I am back on melanoma again. My obsession started 3 weeks before I gave birth. I was obsessing over something on my stomach that was pregnancy related and then I came across this very large mole again on my boob. And my obsession switched to this mole. I’ve had this mole for at least 5 years (when I first noticed it during my last melanoma spiral 5 years ago). It looks like it became puffier and one of the edges is sticking out a bit more. 

And now I am 100% sure I have melanoma, and it is likely advanced at this point since it’s been there for at least 5 years. This time, I have a dermatologist appointment. It’s in 2 days. And I am crapping myself. I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, I cry all day long. My heart won’t stop pounding through my chest. I AM SO FRICKEN SCARED. How do I get through this?? I can just picture the dermatologist having a concerned look, saying we need to remove this now, etc. And then I will have to wait for the biopsy results which will take weeks. I can’t do this. I am going INSANE.

My husband is great and thinks I’m being unreasonable and that I’m fine. He said he didn’t notice anything different with the mole and it looks like a fine mole. But it’s very obviously not a normal mole. It’s so weird. I think I am going to have a heart attack!! And I’m going to leave my newborn daughter because of cancer. 

I have an appointment with my family doctor tomorrow to talk about anxiety management. I am currently on Zoloft and seeing a psychologist. 

But how do I get through this??? I am in a crisis. "
152,2,"Hi

I wanted to ask, what’s your deeply fear and how do you deal with it?"
153,2,"So I have a really bad class. Like, really bad. They gossip, and are really mean to a guy with Asperger’s syndrome. The situation is getting rly bad. I do have 2-3 friends, including that guy, since he is actually really nice. One of the reasons I hate going to uni is because of them. Is there any idea of distraction from them, I know meditation (idk how to do it tho), drawing, having my headphones on…
It does work but It is hard when you have to listen to a professor and you can tell people are staring or judging."
154,2,"Im rly struggling to accept I had a panic attack. Went to the doc who said so, I felt crushed by the reality of how my life may change now. 

I’d prefer to have a heart condition so that then I know it’s a physical condition that has clear treatment.

It’s almost like now I know I’ve had a panic attack I’m hyper aware of even feeling a teensy bit anxious then freak out another attack will happen. It sends me into a spiral of despair. Funny thing about it is I was feeling really great before it happened, no triggers or anxiety at all. It’s such a head fuck. 

Has anyone found diazepam to immediately help when you’re having an attack? I’ve never had them before but now I do just in case ‘to take the edge off’ as the doc said. 
"
155,2,"So I'm stuck with a primary care doctor who specializes in sports medicine and obesity I'm 180 lbs 40 yr old male. I have social anxiety disorder ,Generalized Anxiety disorder and MDD
I'm afraid he is helping yes prescribing my meds and things but keeps offering to go to therapy IV been thru therapy but I'm uncomfortable with him also.....anyway I can tell him in person next time for a referral to a doctor of my choice who treats anxiety and depression rather than him? "
156,2,"I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression a while back. I’m currently on medication and attending therapy, which has helped a lot, but things still feel…off. Especially when it comes to friendships.
Backstory: My mental health really took a nosedive when I started grade 11 in 2024. It had been gradually worsening, but that year was the lowest point. After months of depressive episodes and even failed attempts, I was finally diagnosed and began treatment.
Friendship-wise, I’ve always been more of a floater. I never had friends who truly stuck around. The school I was in before high school was full of toxic people who gossiped about me behind my back (I only learned about it later). But when I got to high school, I finally found a group that made me feel included. Like I was wanted. Like I belonged.
Then came the school trip this January. I had just started medication, and I decided to let the group know what I was going through—figuring it was better to be honest in case I started acting differently due to my condition or meds. They responded supportively, at least at first. But during the trip, I had a very bad relapse. Not just the group, but a lot of students and teachers ended up finding out. After that, I started pulling away from everyone. I was scared of being a burden, of hurting people just by being around. And depression makes me isolate, even when I don’t want to.
After the trip, I sent the group a long message apologizing for my behavior and mentioned I was thinking of dropping out of school. My therapist and parents were even suggesting I take a break and rejoin next year. But I stayed—partly because I thought my friends cared, and that their support, along with therapy and family, would help me recover.
Present: I did get better. I’m much more stable than I was, even though that stability is heavily supported by medication and a lot of effort. But the bond with my friends feels different now. Distant. Like I’m on the outside again. Sometimes they forget about me entirely, like not noticing or caring if I’m at group events or not. I can’t help but feel like once they saw how difficult my situation really was, they started stepping away.
Recently, I felt signs of another relapse coming on. I messaged the group letting them know, just to explain in case I acted different. Only one person replied (the one I talk to regularly). The others didn’t say anything, and honestly that’s not new. Even if I say a simple “hi” in the group chat, it goes ignored. I don’t know if it’s because of my mental health or just me in general. I’ve been told they sometimes don’t reply because they don’t know how, but I see them replying to others just fine?
Even with my online friends (some of whom I’ve known for over 8 years), I feel the same pattern. Many of them are mentally ill too, and while I try my best to support them, I don’t often feel that same effort returned. I know no one is obligated to help me just because I help them. But it’s hard not to feel forgotten.
Is it me? Am I the one messing everything up? Am I expecting too much from people?
And if that’s the case, how do I stop? How do I stop making people uncomfortable? How do I become someone that people want to talk to, someone who isn't just seen as a responsibility?
I don’t need people to carry me. I don’t even need people to constantly check up on me. But a simple “hi” every once in a while would mean the world. 
"
157,2,"Been obsessing over the fact I might have lung cancer these past two weeks because I developed a sore throat and cough that doesn’t go away. Last night I dreamed about me coughing up massive amounts of blood and being diagnosed. My brain is so fucking crazy lmao.

Never mind the fact that I
- Have GERD
- Take Vyvanse
- Have (yet) untreated sleep apnea
- Could just be sick without any other symptoms

Nah, this is cancer guys. I’m that case in which the perfectly healthy 23 year old gets it. Because I’m different and unlucky.

Lol, I just wrote down my exact thought, and the funny part is that writing this out made me realise I sound like an idiot. Health anxiety is a bitch, but sometimes venting and writing it down could serve as a reality check."

I hate how many awful physical symptoms this can cause. I expect to feel bad when I'm actively worried but this just never seems to end. 

/Rant"
161,2,"TW: Mention of health conditions, pollutants. 

For starters, I have health anxiety and I'm a hypochondriac. That said, there's also a side of my health anxiety that's very much related to food. 

Growing up, my dad was really into holistic health and all the woo woo stuff. Cleanses, detoxes, MMS, gallbladder flushes, you name it. He really drilled it into me that certain foods were toxic, you couldn't mix carbs with fats, milk caused inflammation, blah blah blah. 

When I got older I started educating myself on nutrition and realised he was wrong. While I no longer align with those beliefs, I get anxiety from eating certain things. I just had an ice cream and I can't help but feel like it's going to damage my brain and make my digestive system go all cattywampus. 

I also have this constant feeling of dread that there's something wrong in my body, be it heavy metals, microplastics, parasites, etc. I just never ""feel"" healthy. 

I've considered the possibility of having orthorexia, but I don't let my anxiety affect my eating habits. I eat healthy and still have my treats, I just constantly feel like my body is breaking down and the food I'm consuming is ""inpure"". 

Again, I understand logically all of these feelings aren't rooted in reality, but I can't help feel this way. I've been in therapy for several years now but this still affects me. 

Does anybody else have experience of this? What's helped you, if anything? "
162,2,Hey all! Question for for those on Gabapentin. What dosage is working for you? Currently I'm on 300mg 3times a day and it works great while it lasts. Thinking of asking my Dr. for an increase.
163,2,"I am taking zoloft 50mg, lamictal 300mg and now my psych added olanzapine(Zyprexa) to the regime. I was taking risperidone before this but had to discontinue it because i started bedwetting ( it was doing its job)

I am diagnosed with anxiety disorder and depression with mild hypo episodes.

I was put on 10mg

How long until it starts working for the anxiety/intrusive thoughts? What should I expect?

I was stable for a whole year on risperisone/zoloft/lamal. Shame I had to change risperidone. Anxiet and depression  came back these past weeks."
164,2,Last week on Wednesday or Thursday. I let my dogs outside. We have a fenced in yard. I didn’t know there was an animal in our yard. My dogs seen it and attacked it. It seemed like forever because I was outside and yelled at them to stop. But my ring camera said it took like 7 seconds to kill it. It was a groundhog. It wasn’t rabid and tried running away. It barely fought or had time to fight. It never scratched or bit my dogs or me. My dogs had a tiny bit of blood and what I assume was feces on them. I ended up having to get paper towels and soap and water and clean them. I didn’t let them inside u til they were clean: I got a small amount (like maybe dime size or smaller) of feces on my foot and a pen tip size blood on my hand. I never went near the animal. I cleaned my dogs and immediately ran inside and took a shower. I know with no one getting bit or scratched and it not being rabid and I minimally came in contact I’m still panicking that now I have rabies and will die. Even though I read rabies can’t live but a few minutes on surfaces. I’ve spent the next few days disinfecting my everything in my house. I read the incubation and symptoms and said what am I gonna sit here and panic over the next year. I keep coming up with new ways and new instances I could’ve got it. Even though I have no symptoms over than a small sore throat I’m still panicking saying I’m showing the symptoms. This is the end of me. I can’t pay any attention to my everyday life and spend all day thinking about it. Idk what to do. I’m afraid I’m gonna be scared for a year. I was finally able to reach out to someone for therapy but still waiting on a call back. I’m spiraling.
165,2,Hello everyone! Has anyone ever tried buspar (Buspirone)? I have been scared to try a lot of daily anxiety medications so my doctor put me on hydroxyzine to take as needed but it has not helped much. As a result i have decided to try and daily medication and my doctor prescribed me Buspar but i am nervous to take my first dose especially with gaining weight. Any one have experiences? 
166,2,"I’ve always had a hard time speaking in front of people. I get stuck in my head, second-guess what I’m saying, and sometimes just shut down completely.

Has anyone found anything that helped them practice speaking when anxiety is a huge block? I'm looking for something that feels safe, judgment-free, and ideally lets me ease in at my own pace.

Would love to hear from anyone who's been through something similar. Even small tips are welcome."
167,2,"I always had quite a lot of anxiety when it comes to talking to people but just now i had a reality check that it really only is a question of talking to people in italian (my main language), doesn't matter if it's online or irl i never feel like speaking with other italian people yet whenever i have to talk in videogame lobbies or when i travel i don't have any of those issues since i speak english and like, i could easily make friends and even hookup with girls.

Idk what to do about it and like, just realized that. Thinking about it with the few italian people that i'm close to whenever the convos get a bit serious we both talk in english.
Is this some autistic (asking because i have it) trait or smth else? i have no ideas besides that but it makes me feel so bad with myself that i can't speak my language comfortably and idk, if anyone has any advice on how to approach this it could help me"
168,2,"Hiya 

I am going on a flight on Thursday and I have Xanax 0.25mcg pills for flight anxiety. I also have had a cough for the past few days and I am prescribed the bufomix easyhaler for my asthma. Does anyone know if combining this medication is dangerous? Google hasn't really helped, and I'd be worried to go without either of them on the day of the flight. 

Thanks ♥️"
169,2,"Hello friends. I would like to see if anyone here would have therapist recommendations that are licensed in the NY/NJ area who specialize in anxiety, depression, PTSD, and ADHD or a combination of these. Ideally using tela health/remote sessions. My mental health has been going down the drain lately. I've used therapy twice before but the ones I have found, I haven't really connected to. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. 💕"
170,2,"I’m not gonna lie, my mental health has been horrible these past couple of days/nights. Even feels like I wake up having a panic attack. It’s been agony, and even leaves me wondering if I’m just going insane. I have those moments of disassociation during my attacks, but it feels so much worse lately. I just wanna hear from others to know I’m not alone."
171,2,Has anybody on here had there Zoloft dose increased from 200 to 250 mg and had intense side effects ? 
172,2,I’m 26M and my heart races constantly especially at night out of nowhere this has been going on for to long now and it’s ruining my life especially when I get angry my heart races and skips constantly anyone else experiencing racing heart everyday from anxiety?
173,2,"I’m in a constant state of anxiety, and I started Ativan about a year ago, it definitely relieves a lot of the anxiety but I’ve never learned how to relax, and I think that’s part of the reason I used to smoke and drink and get high, I never knew how to relax. So what’s the secret, to truly feel loose and relaxed without getting high?"
174,2,I’m sitting here with decision paralysis. I’m 30f with no kids. I live in an ocean side town of 300 so there’s no shopping or anything. Ocean is too cold for swimming. Yesterday I spent the whole day dillydallying and feeling like I wasted it.
175,2,"I know this is a bit of a wild question and it may ruffle some feathers but I try and like do this to myself sometimes and just say to my self “nah I’m not gonna do this anymore” and in the hopes it really works but so far, no dice. Just intrigued to see what anyone else has to say about this. 
Forgive me if this has been posted before.

176,2,"I keep having to have more more colonic irrigations but even they are only providing some relief for my IBS pain and that's nothing seems for my anxiety either benzos do virtually nothing, olanzapine just gives me stomach pain as soon doesn't make me tired. What to do when nothing helps? I think some of it all of it is in my head.

I just don't want to do anything half time I just don't seem to have energy or motivation to doing anything my body is just telling me to get more rest"
177,2,"I’ve been having real bad health anxiety for the past couple weeks, probably up to a month now. It all started when I immediately started freaking out thinking I was going to go into anaphylactic shock. Then I started thinking I was having a heart attack, I do have a past history of heart problems so that’s mainly why. Now I keep feeling like I’m having a stroke, I do have high blood pressure and I’m trying to get that under control. I keep feeling weak, my body is shaking, I just feel out of control and I hate it. I’ve been to the hospital three times this month already, yesterday I was put into an ambulance and taken to a hospital.

It’s like my mind just starts making up symptoms and my body starts feeling like I’m going through these things in real time. I know when it comes to things like a heart attack and stroke you don’t want to wait around to see if that’s what’s really happening but I can’t just keep going to the hospital every time I feel a certain way. I’m trying to set up a doctor’s appointment but all of the doctors around me are completely through the end of the year. I just need some help. Any advice/tips would be greatly appreciated. I would also like to read about other people’s experiences and how they calmed down. "
178,2,"Hey, my left upper back and left arm feel very weak, as if they could fall off at any moment. I have gone to horrible anxiety and stress the last couple months and have gad. Literally cannot think of a moment that I was calm the last few months. But now my arm feels like it can fall off at any moment and my shoulder blade is more visable on the left then on the right and it freaks me out. I can use my arm in any direction and have decent strength but it just feels as if it can detach from my shoulder at any moment, my physiotherapist said there was nothing broken but he felt that I was very tense. Does anyone experience the same or something similar?"
179,2,"I have a weird form of anxiety, and I don’t know anybody struggling with the same thing. I happened like a year ago and I can’t get over it. I struggle with being in enclosed spaces, like a bus, plane or an exam but only if there is a lot of people and usually quiet. It’s a feeling like I can’t escape without someone noticing me. It’s so frustrating. I struggle with taking the bus home from work so sometimes I have to take an uber because I just can’t. I was invited on holiday with a friend which requires a plane ride that lasts 4 hours and I really really want to go, but the feeling of being closed in one place with nowhere to escape is really scary. I don’t know what to do, the things I used to look forward to now are scary and I dread them. I don’t struggle with talking to people or have anxiety in that area. I just struggle with large closed of spaces. I also think that the fear of getting anxiety is marking it worse. Does anyone struggle with the same thing or have any tips? I am really desperate"
180,2,"This is getting harder and harder to fight, I'm not going to lie. There's only so much strength one person can have and I guess I've been running on fumes for a while.

Something deeply disturbing is happening to my body and, once again, I can't tell if it's all in my head or if it's real. I can't trust my own body to tell me what's wrong. I can't trust anything anymore. I don't even know what the point of all this is! I enjoy living too much that I'm terrified of dying, and yet, with anxiety and the constant fear of death, I feel like I'm barely living at all. Hello?

Is life some kind of joke or what? All that shit you go through, all of it, only to end up HERE. Aside from the fact I'm too much of a coward to end my life, the only reason this has been worth it to me is because of the idea that maybe, just MAYBE, I will finally find some sort of solution to this. (Or maybe someone will rescue me. Or maybe my mother will decide to love me. Or maybe, some day, I'll stumble upon exactly what I needed without realising I needed it. Blah blah blah.)

I know what this looks like, and yes, I hate it too. To sit here again, feeling sorry for myself, furious at things beyond my control. ""I wish"" and ""If only"" and other such nonsense. 

But you really have to wonder if it's sustainable, doing all of this on your own, figuring it all out on your own. Six fucking years ... Oh my god. Time and time again you think you're getting somewhere only for it to crumble down around you. ""Tried everything"" seems dangerously fucking close. 

Now we're at the end, for the millionth time, and sometimes I wish it would just hurry up and kill me already. 

But then what was it all for?

"
181,2,"I have been dealing with panic attacks for years, but i have been dealing with constant panic attacks for the better part of 3 weeks now and they mostly occur while I’m driving if not always while I’m driving. Maybe it’s a trauma response to my first panic attack happening in the car? But this morning I was already on edge, knew something was bound to happen and BOOM the wave crashed and I was shaking profusely(especially my legs which makes it tough to drive). 

To try and remedy the situation I put on my favorite music, immediately started doing deep breathing exercises and giving self affirmations like, “everything is okay, its going to be okay, I’ve been here before”. The difference is today I didn’t pull over and decide to call in to work, but rather just had the courage to keep pushing through. After 20 minutes I finally felt the rush calming down and was able to coast out the last 10 minutes of my ride to work. It was still so draining, but I’m really taking a moment to celebrate a small victory for the day that I was able to push past the fear and not let it impede on my day like usual."
182,2,"I have generalized anxiety disorder and adult separation anxiety. I have struggled greatly with both all my life. I do not like to travel, especially by plane. I have been trying to “conquer” my anxiety and since my husband loves to travel, I planned a mini vacation for us for our anniversary that is rapidly approaching. The problem is, my son won’t be coming. He will be staying with his grandparents who we trust and who he is with multiple times a week due to our work schedule. We did give him the choice to come with us or go with his grandparents, and he chose his grandparents which I was proud of. I don’t want him suffering from separation anxiety like me. 


I am now spiraling and making myself sick about leaving him. I will miss him terribly and I’m fearful of all the “what if’s” that can happen. Thankfully, we aren’t flying (huge fear of mine) and it’s about a 5 hour drive from home. We leave on a Friday and come home Sunday. I know logically it’s a short trip, but I feel like it’s too long. 

I would love to hear any tips, reassurance or even just someone tell me I’m being ridiculous. I feel like I’m dreading going and I don’t want to ruin my husband’s time either. "
183,2,"i’m so terribly anxious over flying like it’s embarrassing at this point, i cry during take off like a baby. any advice on how to not feel like you’re going to die and not treat the days before your flight as your last days?"
184,2,"Hey friends, how's your day? I just joined this community today and have looked through some posts. I am glad that I can find so many people who are experiencing anxiety due to various kinds of things; they are just like me. However, I am still not happy that we are suffering this; none of us deserves this.

I'm very glad that I can find people here who share the same feelings as me, and I know that there are people in this world who can truly empathize with me.

As a highly sensitive, low-energy and anxious person with sleep disorders, many times my reactions to certain things are not understood. Friends and family, they might care about you, but they cannot truly understand you. They don't understand your way of thinking, and therefore, they don't understand the panic you are experiencing.

But being understood is very important for people with anxiety. So i am glad to find here.

I watched ""Inside Out 2"" a couple of days ago. When I saw that Anxiey was trying very hard but still failed, I was deeply moved. I realized that all emotions might have originated from our best intentions, but they might have been too extreme or used in the wrong way, causing us to experience abnormal emotions.

Don't be too hard on yourself. From my experience, when you realize that you are ""once again"" in a state of anxiety, it can also cause anxiety. You might think, ""Oh, why did I break down over such a tiny thing AGAIN?"" I really want to give a hug to everyone who is in this state of mind. 

Please tell yourself: It's not your fault. It's okay. I can continue living/working even if I am in an anxious state (limited to mild anxiety. If there are already very serious physical reactions, please seek medical attention).

I am working on dealing with anxiety and will keep trying. Hope you well today:)"
185,2,"Since last Wednesday I have been strapped into this super intense anxiety ""rollercoaster"". I will feel the tension rise and it stays at peak for about 30mins-hr, but after it subsides I dont get the feeling of relief like its gone. I can count on more than 2 hands the number of panic attacks I have had in the last week. I have bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder. I was on a medication regime that greatly helped, but due to insurance complications and financial constraints, I had to stop taking them. 

What im asking is does anyone have any idea how to make it more manageable? I have tried grounding techniques such as the 5 4 3 2 1 and 3 3 3 and breathing techniques and none of it helps. 

Sincerely, someone who needs to take their life back"
186,2,"My bf (26M) had a fender bender on the highway on his way to work this morning, nothing major happened and he says he’s fine. I’m also at work (doing my placement at a health care center), and I want to leave work to give him a hug. 

Literally when he texted me he had a minor collision my heart stopped, I couldn’t call him back because I had patients, si o kept replying are you ok?, is the person you collided okay, is the car okay?… to what he replied ”all fine, I’m fine”. But I keep ruminating in my mind that he says he’s fine just because he needs to finish his job (works in finance and tradings) and stock market opening hours are his most demanding time. 

I can’t keep my mind from thinking to ask permission to leave early and head to his office to keep him company. When I know he might in fact be okay. I don’t know I just can’t wait to see him and the nurse in me, to actually check he is in fact fine. 

How can I keep my mind busy??? What else can I do for him??

187,2,"Hello community members, I am going through anxiety period for almost 8 months now, 2+ months into therapy..seeing positive changes, tried a psychiatrist also, was so afraid to see her as she would prescribe medication, now after all analysis she told that some other techniques would be helpful as per the condition and wont prescribe medication as of now as progress has been made. Now even the medication hasn't been prescribed, I again feel sad as though the medicine was some ray of hope to assist me through these days or may be I am looking for a shortcut, what to do now? No doubt progress is there, that too a lot but I am so tired of this heart racing at times, pls suggest."
188,2,"I’m about to start therapy soon, but I wanted to reach out here to see if anyone has been through something similar or has advice. For the past 4 years, I’ve been living in constant fear of c*ncer at a young age. This fear has completely consumed me and stolen my early 20s. I barely recognize myself anymore, I’ve become a shell of who I used to be.

In those 4 years, I’ve seen more doctors than I can count and have convinced myself at different times that I had lymphoma, skin(multiple times), testicular, colon, tongue, brain, and more. It’s exhausting. Mentally and physically, I feel completely drained.

I honestly don’t even know if therapy can help me at this point, I feel so lost and broken. But I’m trying. If anyone here has experienced severe health anxiety or hypochondria, and has any advice, coping tips, or even just wants to share their story, I would be incredibly grateful. I need help more than ever right now. Please know you’re not alone either."

190,2,Hello to everyone! I am experiencing the worst time of my life! I developed excruciating anxiety and panic attacks a month ago which are constant day and night! I should have started with Lexapro and Canax but Xanax did nothing for my anxiety and Lexapro heightened it and in that moment I couldn't wait for the two weeks for Lexapro to kick in! I was put on pregabalin 2x50 mg a day to stabilise my nervous system and then start Lexapro again but I also do not have the relief which I expected from pregabalin! Doc says to wait a week to see because it should increase the concentration in the blood but I am so devastated for some calmness and anxiety free time! I am unable to work and tala care fully of my little children and I am so scared that I won't make progress and will suffer constantly ! Please some advice will be very helpful for me! Is it true to wait longer or should I insist on another medication! 
191,2,"Basically the title. If I ever have to wake up before 8:30am I get so anxious about it that even if I go to bed early and fall asleep fast, I wake up in the middle of the night and start spiraling about the thought of having to wake up early, knowing I'm going to be exhausted regardless if I got 3 or 9 hours of sleep. This ends up showing up on my fitbit and seeing how long I'm up or in light sleep is painful (I don't always wear it and still get anxious). I'm someone who both needs at least 8hr 30m of sleep to be fully awake, and any time I wake up before 8am I am so tired that if I can't get a nap in later that day I will be non-funcitonal by 3pm. In college this doesn't affect me as much because if I schedule an 8:30 class I just make sure to block out time for a nap later and its fine. But if there's an event that takes place early, and goes for a long time without leaving a break for a nap - no sleep the night before. It's a cycle that I absolutely hate and wish I could function like a normal human being (that's what my therapy is for but damn does it take time...). Anyway I hate anxiety, it can go sit itself in a puddle of curdled milk and cry about "
192,2,"Lately, I’ve been feeling completely overwhelmed by everything going on in the world. Every time I try to stay informed, whether it’s through social media or the news—I end up spiraling. I start thinking about worst-case scenarios and feeling like something really big and terrible is about to happen.

It’s exhausting. I want to be aware and informed, but it feels like the more I learn, the more anxious I get. I don’t have a deep understanding of politics or history, and I feel kind of embarrassed about that. I wish I had more context so I could process things logically instead of just reacting with panic.

It’s like I can’t find a balance between staying informed and protecting my mental health. Lately, it’s just been constant anxiety and overthinking, and I needed a place to let this out.

196,2,"Hi All,

I’ve been drinking decaf coffee & lattes for about 2 years after having a major cardiac event. Today, I picked up my usual decaf latte from Dunkin, have drank about half of it but I haven’t eaten breakfast yet when I usually eat while drinking it. 

I’m feeling quite jittery and anxious all of the sudden. Does that happen to anyone else? There’s a very small amount of caffeine but does it really make that much of a difference if you drink something like that on an empty stomach? I’m just taken by surprise since this is something I drink on a basically daily basis! "
197,2,"So I’ve suffered with anxiety for years and I’ve dealt with it pretty well in my opinion I feel like I don’t really have the ability to turn my brain off 90% of the time. I sometimes I get this weird feeling in the morning, especially when I’m trying to figure out money issues I’ll have this cold feeling come over my chest and it kind of takes my breath away for a second and then I gotta have to ground myself And just tell myself life‘s all right and it goes away in a minute or two but every time I feel it, I’m like wow this is happening again. Anyone have any idea how I can work on this besides hitting the lottery lol  "
198,2,"This has been something i’ve dealt with for years. I’m 19 years old, and I believe this whole thing started when I was 12.

I’ve always had a problem with pulling on my hair, even ripping it from my scalp, leaving uneven strands and sometimes causing strange swelling/irritation on the skin beneath. It would always usually be the back of my head where my hair meets my neck, or my scalp.

Last night, my anxiety was very bad, and I didn’t even notice how much hair I had pulled from my front scalp. I have bangs, and I was pulling in that area where they are.

I was able to stop myself at some point, and I looked in the mirror. There’s now a very short strand of hair, and weird small strands that stick up because of how short they are. I’ve tried styling my bangs to cover it, but it didn’t work.

Now I have shitty hair, and it’s my fault. 

I just can’t seem to stop hurting myself in some way. Whether it’s hair pulling, scratching myself, not eating, etc. Sometimes i’m not even anxious, and I just do it unconsciously without even realizing it."
199,2,"Hey there everyone, I wanted to share experiences of mine happening over the past year. I used to be a heavy stoner would take 10mg edibles every night sometimes multiple times a day on weekends. I used it to cope with problems in my life and a bad living situation. And everytime I got high it made me feel happy. In June of 2024 I moved out and starting living on my own. July of 2024 I noticed my weed habits were really started to affect my productivity my ability to clean on my own, take care of all the new responsibilities I had in my life. So I gradually started cutting down and by the time March of 2025 came along I was down to only using weed 1-2 days a week and at much lower doses. I went to Las Vegas in May of 2025 and took an edible that gave me massive anxiety and a panic attack. Since the trip whenever I take any sort of weed even if it’s a small small dose I find it gives me  anxiety and an unpleasant time. I almost feel the feeling of it lingers multiple days after ingesting too. Can anyone relate to this and should I just quit completely?

200,2,"My wife is always telling me to get off Reddit forums and only '**crazie's**' go on there, and now is insisting that i no longer come on here. I said that i find forums like these involve thousands of very normal people who are struggling with their mental health, and are often not getting enough support or understanding from their loved one. friends and family. Partners especially have to deal with their partner' mental health and often feel powerless themselves, and don't truly understand why people go onto these forums.

The truth of the matter is that an extremely small percentage of prescribing medical , professionals have ever taken an antidepressant or other psychotropic medication so cannot empathise with side effects, and the eternal 'hope' that this next medication will work.

I think that forums like this can be very helpful in terms of building knowledge and understanding of the medication they are taking, e.g an MAOI, in this case. Also, the forum contains real life experience of thousands of people who have been through side effects and either successfully overcome them some how. The real-life knowledge and experience within this forum is extremely powerful.

At the end if the day, our bodies and minds are unique and we all absorb and metabolise medications differently. But forums like this can support us with the start up of such medications and can be an extremely powerful tool in helping us to manage our conditions and make informed decisions when consulting with our own respective medical professionals, be they psychiatrists, mental healthcare professionals, local GP's etc.

I just wish my wife and family understood how powerful a resource this sort of forum can be in helping me regain my mental health. Phenelzine has been life changing for me but i might not have even heard of it, or how to overcome it's challenges without many of you on here. So i say thank you to you all. I just wish my wife would understand"

I’m sorry I can’t sleep. 

All day long, everything wants to knock me out and when things are finally quiet, I can’t sleep. I feel like a deeply sick person in a deeply disturbing situation that never goes away no matter how I frame my perspective and I  need help, but I don’t have enough faith to ask because everyone’s said ‘no’ all my life.

We're all crazy busy with our own insane trilling, and I don't normally post because I keep my brain in a different digital bag online, but I feel sick. 

Are you guys messed up? 
We need society to consciously select to raise up empaths for survival. You need us like the bees 🐝

202,2,"Yesterday I passed out because I got too hot in the shower, ended up in the ER the entire morning. I’ve been really worked up about it since and I’ve been crying all day. I don’t think I’ve ever been so afraid in my life. I’ve never passed out like I did that time before in my life.

i hate living like this. my health anxiety has gotten worse since last december for many many reasons, and everything was looking up for me until yesterday happened. Now i’m afraid to go in the bathroom, when the temperature gets a little high in the house I feel like I’m going to start screaming I’m genuinely that afraid. I can’t take my glasses off without being scared it’s happening again

Every day since december it’s back and forth been looking things up, “no i won’t look things up anymore,” “this symptom im feeling doesn’t feel right let me check reddit,” and over and over I do this. I find arbitrary cures that exist for illnesses my mind has made up for me and if I don’t do them then nothing will ever make me feel like my body is okay. 

I’m so worried that all of this is leading up to something big and I won’t expect it and suddenly (snap), i’m gone. 

i’ve just been sitting in bed all day. i don’t know what to make of any of it 

i just want to be okay. the headaches every day and the constant stress are starting to be too much to handle. i try to remind myself that if i’m still here everything’s OK, but that’s getting harder to believe in now"
203,2,"When it tears at you until you want to claw out your brain with medicated needles. The happiness is that we have this whole world to ourselves. Live, life is not a problem. It is if you make it one. I hate it, when I make problems of nothing.

When i forget everything because of these memory erasing medications iv'e been clinging onto for years. I feel like half of what I used to be but at the same time I am still half of what I am because of the stress.

There is so much, so much I just can't get out of my head SOMETIMES.

Life just, hurts sometimes."
204,2,"I suffer from anxiety since I’ve memory, but never related to this, but recently turn 20, I a few months ago it hit me the fact that I’m getting older and that I’m going to die at some point, to be honest, I have quite a good life, I’m goodlooking. I do modeling, a have a good family, I’m heading to Europe in a month for work and vacation but I can’t enjoy anything cause I know I’m going to die eventually, I feel so lonely also; it’s all so emotionally hard I feel like nothing makes sense anymore, I’m afraid of dying, and I also feel very alone, I have no idea how I’m gonna make it trough "
205,2,"hi! looking for some advice pls. 

I’ve had quite bad shortness of breath since around 11pm last night (it’s 1pm here now). slight chest pain and now dizziness has set in and i feel quite lightheaded and slightly nauseous too. went to the gp this morning and my sats (bp, oxygen) were normal but he booked me in for bloods & ECG to be sure. However, the appointments aren’t for 2 weeks. 
I’ve had anxiety all my life practically and never felt like this before?! I’m not particularly anxious over anything atm and nothing is really triggering it, it just came on completely randomly before i went to bed last night. Shortness of breath gets worse when i’m laid down and gets better when i sit upright. 
The doctor told me to seek further help if i still felt unwell but i’d just feel incredibly silly going to a&e only to be told it’s my anxiety? 

If anyone has any advice or any techniques maybe I could try that may help? "
206,2,"So last week for a very long time. I had all the energy in the world. I felt amazing. This week I feel horrible! Heart burn, constant nausea, feeling like I need to poop all the time but it's not an unpleasant poop. Anxiety and panic attacks. Fatigue, yawning, gassy and burping, very noisy tummy. Over stimulated. It's my stomach that starts the anxiety and panic attacks but Iv had all testing and they can't find anything abnormal. 

If this is you... what helps you ? What do you take ? I need relief from this it's putting me in a massive depressive spiral. I can't plan my life or do anything I feel sick and panicky all the time. 

"
207,2,"I’ve been experiencing derealization since I was a child. I remember moments that day I would walk by a mirror and everything would get fuzzy and I didn’t feel
Like me. Move forward I’m a women in early 50s that still deals with this. It’s my main anxiety symptom. I used to get the physical effects but that went away. It hits me every damn morning about two hours after I wake up. I’m so sick of this it’s making my agoraphobia worse. I can’t drive when it hits since my eyes are all blurry and things look small. I’m having  finding a job. I’m on Zoloft  50 mg for about 4 months now. Anyone else have this as a main symptom. What do you do to ease it? "
208,2,"I've been out of work for the last year aside from house sitting part time. Been going to therapy, on medication etc. but still struggling. One of the (many) factors of my anxiety is I've never known what to do with my life and I'm too afraid to get out there and try new things. I've considered remote work, but even that stresses me out when I start thinking abour having to interview. Just wondering if anyone has any job suggestions for someone with severe general and social anxiety."
209,2,"It’s so ridiculous how severe my anxiety still is. I recently turned 26 and I feel like I’m at square one. I’m riddled with fear and symptoms basically all day and it has a profound effect on my sleep as well and every other category of being a functional adult. 

So I’m “rawdogging” life and have been for a while. The meds I’ve tried haven’t helped. Been consistently trying stuff since I was 16. They seem to only cause side effects so technically I’m even worse off on them. So I’m forced against my will to “raw dog” life. I wish I was on meds, in fact I’m still open to it. I just began a 2nd trial of Buspar but I feel no difference whatsoever so far, been a few weeks, in fact I think i feel worse. 

It’s just so crazy to me that what I go through on a daily basis feels like I basically have no shield or protection against anxiety and the pain it causes me. I think of meds as a sort of shield that grants you some extra armor. It feels like I have no armor whatsoever and like I’m extremely sensitized to my thoughts, symptoms, sounds, what others are thinking of me, ALL OF IT. "
210,2,"So, basically 10 days ago (ironically a year after another one of these happened 🤦‍♂️ ) I hit a vape pen from a guy I was playing magic the gathering with who’s a friend of a friend of mine at the game shop. 

So this cart turns out to be veryyyyyy strong. Basically had an escape the world moment that I’m now realizing was just me hating the sensation of being THAT damn high. 

And then my existential ocd kicked in for many days after that which was awful. Basically thought I was trapped in a dream or, like the movie Smile, trapped in an illusion by some evil entity. Really stupid stuff to be worried about but that’s ocd for you. 

Most of that anxiety has subsided though there is a little left in the tank, but the most concerning symptom left is that my sleep is super disturbed. I can only sleep like 2-4 hours at a time before waking up. 

I went through a similar thing last year after trying edibles for the first time. My sleep did eventually go back to its weird normal, but I was wondering if anyone here knew how to get sleep back in track after something like this. 

I guess the ocd is worried that I broke something in my brain and now I can never sleep normally again but I know that’s just me being irrational. Thank you for any advice! "
211,2,"So yes, it took a very long time to muster the courage to write this, but since I have the courage for it now, I pledge myself to write this in one complete go.

Hi, just a vent of what I’m feeling right now.

Well, I do not know how to start this, but I feel currently I am overwhelmed with emotions. Nothing I do feels real, no one I talk to feels good. No matter how much I try to be all happy and optimistic, everything falls apart.

**1. Bittersweet memories and nostalgia of the past** – For a very long period of my life, I’ve been having some pretty strong and vivid memories of the past. Old days in school, playing on the ground with my friends, my old classrooms, the days at tuition, etc. And every time they show up, I feel like I have no control over them. It’s a choking sensation honestly, and I try to suppress it but I fail. And what’s worse is that they almost attack me with guilt and regret—and where that stems from, I don’t know. I really want to go back in the past and relive those golden times, man, and feel a little carefree again.

**2. Hopelessness** – I do not know why, but I feel life has lost its spark. I used to be a very optimistic kid, but life does not feel like that anymore. The “hope” is non-existent in my life right now. Every step that I take is just another step towards disappointment.

Well, my emotions change with time. I have very few sudden bursts of joy and inspiration, and then again, a patch of dark and gloomy periods of despair.

**3. Feeling empty** – Nothing I do is fun anymore. Talking to friends, gym, programming, and even gaming—whatever I do seems like a distraction from an eternal void. Even writing this feels pointless. Sometimes I question whether the sole purpose of existence is just to deviate our minds from the eternal truth—death.

I had many hobbies—football, music (rap and classical), gaming, and coding—but since last year I haven’t touched them even once. They all seem hollow and worthless now. I wish I had the same fun playing Minecraft with my brothers and hanging out with my friends on the streets, or just chilling and cycling.

**4. One girl** – Yes, there is a girl I adore. Someone for whom I am ready to die, and someone with whom even an entire day seems like a minute. I just adore her. She is the sweetest, kindest, and most beautiful person I know. But there’s a catch—we are just good friends, nothing more, and I am shit scared to confess. I want to date her, but hey, she’s older than me and she’s got way better options than me. Honestly, the thought that I won’t ever date her makes me somewhat insane at times.

Lately, we are not talking as much as we used to. She replies to my texts after 3–4 days, and honestly, I think she finds me boring right now.

While she is an absolute gem of a person, it’s honestly very wild to imagine how much control she has over me—unknowingly. Like she’s in my head rent-free all the time, lol. I cannot confess to her as I have a very beautiful friendship with her, and maybe, after all, I might lose it.

She is the purest soul I’ve ever met :)

**5. No real companions** – I’ve stopped talking to my friends now. I rarely talk to them. I find it self-amusing. They are good people—some very good people—but I do not find the same energy anymore. I don’t want any social connection anymore, as if I hate being around people. I constantly feel everyone is trying to hurt me, and this sense of paranoia just numbs me sometimes.

I guess that’s it for now. I feel I did not completely touch all the points in my life, but it’s a fair share, I guess. I have been a good person and never thought ill of others, so I cannot share this with my friends nor my parents, since I do not want to trouble them with my misery. I hope someday I find an antidote to all this.

Your advice is appreciated :)"
212,2,"[vent/advice post]

Hey guys, I guess I just didn't wanna feel alone in all this.

It's been a while since I've worked, so staying at home has been really making it much easier to stay in my head and catastrophize. 

I keep thinking of worst case scenarios with the war, and I'm gonna leave from the middle east to north America for at least the summer soon (if things go as planned). It just sucks cause my boyfriend lives in the area as well, and we're long distance but at least it's shorter now than it would be otherwise."
213,2,Was there a time when you were not in a good mental state or maybe you were not feeling like yourself and that one thing or activity which made you feel better or overcome whatever thoughts or thing might have caused you to feel this way?
214,2,"Summarised... Cold chest flushes, weird hot head 'ache', heavy feeling inside chest, doesn't hurt (uncomfortable) feels like somethings inside my chest holding me down! (all symptoms come and go) 

So recently I had a panic attack, had anxiety for a while but it hasnt affected me over the past couple years. After this panic attack about a month back I feel like there HAS to be something wrong with me. It was long and intense consistent trembling going on for half an hour.

I've been experiencing a reoccurring feeling on my chest that comes and goes, its heavy, and somewhat feels like something is inside my chest weighing it down or closing it up. This is accompanied by a weird head sensation that I don't know how to describe beside feeling like my head is hot, with a sense of something bad happening. The feeling makes my body freak out EVEN when im not anxious at all. Has anyone else gone through this? 

Another thing I can't shake or figure out: This constant cold feeling INSIDE my chest. It feels like a cold temperature rush coming through the middle of my chest and stays for about 30 seconds-1 minute while I breathe. The doctor can't figure out what it is and I'd like to know if anyone else has experienced this!! Its uncomfortable but not painful at all. 

PLEASE tell me someone has experienced these symptoms im getting really anxious. I'm worried its something bad health related but everyone says its fine."
215,2,"The event I want to talk about today proves how incapable I am in social situations due to social phobia. I urgently needed to use the bathroom while I was in the middle of the city, and for some reason, I couldn’t find any public restrooms. I was also under time pressure because I had an appointment, and I just wanted to quickly use a bathroom somewhere. So I went into a restaurant to use theirs. I know very well that you’re not supposed to just use the bathroom in a restaurant without ordering something, but I was too scared to ask the waitress at the door if I could use it. I get extremely anxious in situations like that, to the point where I can’t even greet someone properly.

While I was upstairs using the toilet, I already heard the waitress downstairs complaining loudly about me because I hadn’t asked for permission to use it. I started getting anxious in the bathroom, afraid that I’d get in trouble once I went back down, so I stayed in there for a long time, too scared to come out. I would have liked to apologize when I left the restaurant, but I was too ashamed and couldn’t bring myself to do it. So I just left without saying anything. As I walked out, the waitress called after me loudly and annoyed, “How about asking before you use the bathroom next time?” I panicked and walked out without looking at her. She even followed me outside and yelled “Asshole!” after me.

At that point, I stopped and apologized for not asking first. I told her that I would be happy to pay and that I would gladly come back in and order a drink. She said it wasn’t about the money, but about the fact that I didn’t greet anyone or ask for permission to use the toilet. She said it’s rude to use a bathroom without paying for the service. I apologized again, and she said it was a lesson for the future. I agreed and said goodbye. I really did feel sorry.

I feel like I should write the restaurant an email to apologize again. After the whole thing, I cried for half an hour and felt completely overwhelmed.

I totally understand it was my fault, and I know that I’m the problem. I already felt bad when I entered the restaurant, but somehow I can’t control my behavior in these situations. It’s incredibly hard for me to greet people or ask if I can use the bathroom. At the same time, I don’t understand why I can’t just bring myself to politely ask and greet someone. I’m actually a very understanding person, but I often can’t show it — and that destroys me. I knew from the start that if I didn’t ask, there would be consequences, and still I was too afraid to ask. It would’ve been so much easier to just politely ask, but something inside me holds me back. Has anyone else experienced something like this? Can anyone explain why I behave this way, even though I know there will be consequences?"
216,2,"So I’ve smoked weed for years, taken breaks and smoked again, this last stint was for about 8 months, everyday, smoking cartridges, I’ve been clean for about 3 weeks now and my driving anxiety peaking, I feel lightheaded all the time and out of it. I’m scared, I don’t feel real half the time, I don’t know what to do. It wasn’t like this before."
217,2,it’s literally 3 in the morning i can’t sleep bc i have this awful pit of anxiety in my stomach so of course my mind is trying to find reasons and the reasons my brain can only find is that im gonna die if i sleep so now i have another night were i stay up bc of my anxiety i hate this shit so much it’s debilitating 
218,2,"I’m a 25yr old male, who recently suffered an anxiety attack 06/09/25 ever since then my life has changed. I went to a clinic that following day and was prescribed Valium 5mg to take twice as needed. Where I’m trying to get at is I’ve been having these consistent headaches that go from the side of my head (right side) and goes to both side then to the front of my head and my scalp feels like it burns. I’ve been to the ER twice on past Friday and past Sunday. I’ve been dismissed from both different hospitals showing no signs of infection or inflammation on my brain. It’s starting to affect my everyday life now and I truly hope I can overcome. I’m supposed to be seeing a psychiatrist soon but I don’t want to at the same time where I feel as all they will do is jack me up with pills and worsen my conditions. I guess the whole point of my typing this is reflecting how I took for granted who I once was and wondering is there anyone else going through the same thing as I? "
219,2,"This has been a lifelong sorrow for me, and I'm sick of it. I am usually the one who puts in the effort as a friend.

I'm the one who checks in, keeps in touch, organizes the get-togethers, firms up the plans, keeps things going. Sometimes, I wonder if anyone would even remember me if I didn't initiate (and I am too scared to find out).

My spouse is naturally introverted and cannot relate to my frustration in this realm at all. 

Problem is, I don't even know how I would begin to pull back and rebalance without feeling incredibly lonely or getting a horribly rude awakening that I actually am plain old forgettable. I'd almost rather not know the truth.

Just putting this here in the hopes that maybe someone else has experienced this feeling and knows how to navigate through it. "

221,2,"I was just looking through my medical records, and there's a section that says ""planned events"" I never knew this existed. And under that it says ""Planned elderly health assessment in 2078"" (im currently 21). Idk why i find that so scary. My anxiety has been already at an all time high this past month and I get extremely on the edge and nervous over anything. And to  find out that my age ""will"" be around 75 then just sounds insane to me. It doesn't even sound like a real year😭😫

 also I'm just very scared of the thought of death. like i will die one day. i really have no clue what im doing right now, its 01:54am im supposed to be asleep. my sleeping pattern has also been ruined for so long"
222,2,"I dont generally ever feel that gnawing hunger pang in my stomach because I eat regularly enough that it never occurs, I feel generally hungry before that gnawing feeling arises in my stomach. Just recently while I've been having high anxiety, ive been getting that gnawing, empty stomach feeling right AFTER eating. Not after eating a snack but after eating a full meal. Doesn't hurt its just unsettling. I was taking famotidine for a bit because the doctor though my recent breathing issues were caused by GERD. After a few weeks I am fairly sure the issue is costo (sore spine/ribs and sternum) combined with anxiety air hunger. I am working on both and im about to start an anti-anxiety med for the first time (Lexapro with Propanalol as needed). So ill see if the stomach pangs go away with the anxiety meds but anyone else experience that?"
223,2,"In the past when I was terrified of having a heart disease I would become obsessed with it and start to google symptoms about to try and find if I had heart issues or just something else like anxiety I would also start to become hyper aware of breathing, heart palpitations, anything strange that would prove I had a heart disease. It’s the same pattern now but with social anxiety after getting bad social anxiety I couldn’t just suffer with it and be done instead I’m now obsessing over it and researching to see if I really have social anxiety or something else I also become extremely hyper aware of every word that comes out of my mouth and how I say stuff when I’m not speaking when I start to disassociate. I genuinely can never not be in my thought or being hyper aware unless I’m very distracted or focused. I can’t stop being obsessed over any little thing that causes anxiety it makes it a much bigger problem I have a fear of my own awareness now everytime the hyperawareness hits me I get hit with a wave of anxiety and I start to believe everything I do naturally like breathing, blinking, or talking (sensorimotor) will be done improperly because I’m now aware of it and doing it manually. It goes down this big rabbit hole of obsessing I even obsess over obsessing I don’t know how to let it go it’s like it’s out of my control is this some sort of ocd because I don’t think I do any compulsions."
224,2,I am on 10mg of prozac on day 7 today. I feel like everything has gotten worse. My husband doesnt understand and hates that I am on meds. I feel alone and hopeless. I just want the meds to work and be happy again. Can anyone give me some insight?? Please tell me it will get better…
225,2,"Whenever I talk to people I don’t know very well – especially strangers or people I feel slightly intimidated by – I tend to whisper, mumble, and speak way too fast. It’s like my voice becomes weak and unclear. I don’t really feel like there’s a solid “mouth-mind” connection in those moments. My thoughts feel scattered, and my speech ends up sounding slurred, soft, and unsure.

I never feel like I’m speaking clearly, sharply, or confidently. Instead, it feels foggy – like my words are slipping out without any structure or strength behind them. And the worst part is, I *know* I’m doing it while it’s happening, but I don’t know how to stop.

Oddly, when I talk to close friends or family, I can speak normally and confidently. But in social situations where I feel judged or anxious, this “foggy voice” always comes back. I’ve also noticed that I often don’t breathe properly before speaking, or I start talking before fully forming my thoughts.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is this social anxiety, low confidence, or just a habit I’ve built over time? And how do I break this cycle and speak with more clarity and presence?

Any tips, exercises, or personal experiences would be hugely appreciated."
226,2,First I feel like I’m disconnected from my thoughts my head feels numb and just in general weird. I’ve went to a few different doctors they’ve done exams and say nothing indicates anything serious and that it’s just anxiety my vision is weird staticky see shadows that go away when I look at them all around I feel off. Need advice man!
227,2,"Sometimes anxiety creeps in quietly. For me, it started with what I thought were random nerves and just regular stress. Nothing I couldn’t handle. Then I noticed it was happening all the time, and it was affecting my day-to-day life. Eventually, it faded for a while.

But a few years later, I started getting unexplained stomach aches and just feeling awful all the time.
Mentally, I felt “fine.” Physically, I felt like I was on the verge of collapse. Blood work was perfect. I was at my physical best…but felt my absolute worst.

When my doctor suggested it might be anxiety, I honestly thought, ‘No way’. 
I knew what anxiety felt like. This wasn’t it.

But sure enough, it was. I was having panic attacks and had no idea.
The migraines, the vomiting, the constant unease…it was all mental.

That moment led me to CBT, therapy and medication. I remember how alone and misunderstood I felt in that time.

I’d love to hear from others:
🌀 When did you realize something deeper was going on?
🧷 What helped you in that moment, even if it was something small?

Your story might help someone else feel less alone today 💙

Btw I’m from the Rootd team. We make tools to help with anxiety and panic attacks.

I wish I had something like Rootd back then. Especially to understand that anxiety isn’t just mental. It’s often physical too."

232,2,"Hoping someone might be able to help me. I’m a young adult and have been struggling with anxiety, depression and adhd for years. The past year or two I have noticed that my anxiety gets a lot worse at night. I get tearful, overwhelmed, and feel hopeless. It’s almost like I feel a heaviness come over me and I don’t know why. It seems to be as soon as it gets dark out. I recently was on a camping trip sitting around a campfire with friends and it randomly hit. Sometimes I’m able to cry myself to sleep, other times I have to call a crisis line because I spiral too much. I journal which helps sometimes, I deep breathe (which works for the moments I’m actually counting my breaths but the thoughts and heavy, overwhelming feeling comes back when I’m done), do progressive muscle relaxation, focus on 5 things I can feel, hear, etc. I just don’t know what triggers it.

234,2,"Hello

I was dating someone for approx 3-months. She is a virgin and we never had sex or did oral. I did however touch her intimate area with my hand on a few occasions (only over her pants)

I was diagnosed with HPV (genital warts) approx 19-20 months ago. Have not had symptoms ever since. Didn’t disclose because we didn’t agree to having sex, and as a result, it was in the back of my mind (the relationship challenges were taking up all of my attention). A couple weeks ago it popped into my mind. I spoke to my doctor at sexual health and they confirmed that there is no way I could have passed it on, and that I have nothing to worry about.

I have been blocked by my ex partner to move on but despite that, I feel the very very strong urge to reach out to tell her about hpv despite the doctor re-assuring me I have nothing to worry about. But if I do I’m worried how she’ll react

It’s giving me intense anxiety! And I’m not sleeping well. Please help"

i’ve only started last month and idk if i should just stop or suck it up. "
236,2,"Hi all,

I have pretty severe episodic health anxiety. It can be very detrimental for my home life and productivity, and will either manifest or exacerbate symptoms to the point where I don't know what's actually real anymore. 

I am planning on seeing a professional about this in the near future, but would like some general guidance on medications, acknowledging that you are (likely) not medical professionals. 

I have a strong aversion to medication where possible, but I would like something that might help me calm down in a pinch in particular moments of intense anxiety. Would of course prefer medication which have low risk of addiction and other adverse side effects. 

The longer term goal is of course to help this long term by seeing a professional. 

Thank you in advance. "
237,2,"Is there a word for when fully well know the things that amplify your anxiety but you still do them anyway

4 months ago since having at what seems to be now was a panic I have suffered from anxiety since.

I have had to learn so much about anxiety since then and now am quite aware what my triggers are. Am currently having an episode even while I type this as can’t sleep

Porn, snacking before bed, excess sugar, too much screen time. I’ve literally done all this today and now am feeling the wrath.

Now am wondering if am depressed and that’s the reason? "
238,2,"I’ve had pretty bad health anxiety for the past 5ish years but lately the thought spirals have gotten worse in the past 6 months about what if my heart starts racing or what if I have a heart attack etc when I’m alone. When someone is home I don’t worry about this much because I can easily distract myself by talking to them, which is also comforting because it’s human contract. I don’t find distracting myself with a podcast or reading a book or taking a walk really help when I’m alone. Meditation just makes me think about more because I know I am doing the meditation to call my anxiety so I think about it even more so I am kind of at a loss and wondering what everyone else does to stop the health anxiety what if thought spirals?"
239,2,"It's my first time here and i just wanted to ask  whether the experience i had during my one of my papers in exam was an anxiety attack.... So I am a teen... And it was my math paper. I spent like 3 days preparing for it and was pretty confident in myself as I had done everything possible.. though there were still fears and what ifs.. anyways the exam starting fine but I don't know how it happened but i suddenly started feeling scared and nervous.. my heart rate increased, i felt dizzy, my stomach felt weird and i kept making mistakes. Even though I had more than enough time and tried to reassure myself nothing worked... I tried taking deep breaths but it wasn't working... My mind felt all foggy and i messed up the exam.. I do usually feel nervous or stressed during exams but this was my first time feeling this way and it felt like I was losing all control...how can I prevent this from happening again? "
240,2,"So this is partially my own fault but I kind of need advice on how to calm myself back down. I normally get palpitations from coffee so I really avoid it and honestly don't even like the taste but I seem to be fine with tea/chai. I do not drink that regularly either though. 

Anyway my period started and I tend to get mood swings which resulted in me being very stressed about something and not being able to sleep at all and waking in nervous sweats. Now today I was generally fine but started getting stressed again and fidgety by night. I drank some tea just as a treat because it actually usually helps me settle down but it had the opposite effect and right now the heart palpitations are insane. 

I can't sleep again. I think the combo of periods+ crashing vitamin D, iron and B12 levels + caffeine + no sleep conjured a perfect storm and yes I should've known better but it kind of just stacked up without me realizing.

 Anyways my hands are shaky, I'm very restless. Can't sleep. Heart beating crazy. Not sure what to do? Any advice? Also yes I know I was a stoop, pls forgive me :,)"
241,2,"I cannot sleep, whenever I try to sleep I get so anxious I feel like I'm dying, my heart rate increases, hands shake, I feel dizzy, and my body starts tingling.

Usually I only get nightmares— either I'm dying, someone is hurting me, a close person is being hurt, or its me hurting others. I once woke up choking myself and once I felt someone suffocating me with a pillow but that was me too when I woke up, sometimes I feel like someone is on me and I wake my gasping and looking around to find the person.

I hear knocking, people talking, singing ot crying too but when I record it and listen to it tomorrow, there's nothing, and it's only at night, what do I do? "
242,2,"Tw: suicide/world events/health anxiety 

27F (I am currently awaiting a doctors appointment) 

For over a year I was doing really good. I wasn’t googling symptoms and I felt much better overall. My anxiety was at a standstill it was sometimes there but it wasn’t bad at all and I could work through it. 

Then around mid April I started getting anxious about the state of the world, it really stressed me out. My home life has been unstable recently due to financial reasons and I had a roommate who made my life a living hell. 
My leg started hurting and I couldn’t stop hyperfocusing on it. The pain moved around and wasn’t constant. 

Then may 6th my close friend committed suicide. I felt so stressed and upset and I had  graphic night terrors. I stopped sleeping, I’m lucky if I get a few hours. 
The pain is now head to toe. It moves around and sometimes it’s nerve pain sometimes it feels like it’s muscle pain, sometimes a quick stabbing pain, Sometimes it’s not there at all. 
My head hurts and I just feel so off. 
I have back pain, chest pain, etc. it all just comes and goes and every other day I’m worried I’m dying of something different. 

I’m constantly anxious and I’m scared I’m going to die, I have moments of clarity and I feel okay. I just want to be okay again. 

Has anyone else felt like this? I’m just stuck. 
I have hydroxyzine but it doesn’t seem to be doing much.

243,2,"Hello I am a 21 year old male , I have anxiety since 3rd grade, and about a year ago my depression started , and my parents took me to a doctor, an and prescribed medications, I am still on trial and error, 
I feel ashamed for taking antidepressants,
Sometimes I wonder , 
If anxiety and depression are my characteristic flaws , it makes me think taking meds like drinking for being miserable, 
And it makes me even worse…"
244,2,"2 car accidents in Jan(not at fault) new car motor blows up, scammed on next motor no good, tried to swallow pain and head meds last week & just got out Thursday. Saturday night got into a fight when sister dragged me out, held my own again 3 attackers still got hit a few don’t look too bad. Anxiety won’t stop making me sick and my moods up and down non stop. Normal? "
245,2,"So sometimes when I get really overwhelmed I just fall to the floor/all my limbs go limp until I have the slightest amount of energy to stand up. I had an assignment today to do and it was quiet. Like really quiet. I don't know what happened but I got scared. I was sitting down, crying a bit, and hyperventilating a bit, and the thing happened. My arm fell down off my desk and my head also went on the desk. It was a safer position than others I've fallen on. A few minutes later I put my head up and could not bring myself to do the work; so I just fidgeted with my necklace instead. Anyone else have this happen to them?"
246,2,"Hey everyone,

I’m sharing this in case it lands with even one person stuck in the doom-scroll/doctor-visit loop I lived in for years.

# Quick back-story

Last winter I was convinced I had a heart problem, then a lung clot, then a brain tumor—sometimes all in the same day. Google at 2 a.m. was my toxic best friend, and I burned through more co-pays than I want to admit.

A therapist finally pointed out something I’d missed: *I never stop to ask what the anxiety is trying to tell me, and straight up chased the symptom.* That was an eye-opener.

# Three things that finally helped

1. **Daily micro-check-ins.** Every morning I write (or talk) for two minutes about whatever’s spinning in my head. It’s like taking my own emotional temperature before the day decides for me.
2. **A “pause button” conversation.** When symptoms flare—chest squeeze, random numbness, I ve recently been using Haven Self-care app and just straight ranting at it for five minutes and getting a very accurate analysis on my emotinos. Seeing the words on-screen (and reading its little summary back to me) is weirdly grounding.
3. **Sunday pattern review.** Once a week I scroll through the notes and can usually spot a common thread: lousy sleep, skipped meals, or a fight I thought I’d brushed off. The patterns make the fear feel less random.

# Why I’m posting

If you’re stuck in the googling-symptoms hamster wheel, try swapping one search session for a five-minute check-in—pen and paper, voice note, Haven, whatever works. The point is to let the anxiety *speak* before it drags you to worst-case webpages.

I still have bad spikes (two ER trips this year), but I catch the spiral sooner and I’m kinder to myself when it happens. And that’s honestly huge progress.

You’re not broken, you’re not alone, and you’re definitely not the first person who’s convinced themselves they have every disease the internet lists. DM or comment if you need to vent; happy to listen.

Stay safe out there. 🤍"
247,2,Hi everyone I was just seeing if anyone has found like a form of alcohol that doesn’t cause the hangxiety? If I drink two beers it affects me not being able to go to sleep so I was just seeing if anyone had any suggestions. Thank you! 
248,2,"Hey everyone I’m a 24m and I recently got some blood work done as a yearly routine checkup and for some reason all of my test results came out really elevated my WBC, RBC, hematocrit and hemoglobin were all very high an they have been like this for the past 3 weeks not sure why my blood work came out like this it was completely normal last year so I’m just really concerned what this could indicate if I might have some sort of blood cancer or something my doctor ended up referring me to a hematologist/oncologist to find out what’s causing all these elevated blood levels I’m sacred that they will find something bad once they do a little more research on my blood it has me worried sick and I can’t get rid of my anxiety ? These were my lab results ⬇️

WBC - 11.1 
RBC - 6.13 
Hemoglobin- 17.5 
Hematocrit - 54."
249,2,"Since having a major panic attack a little over a month ago, I have noticed a decrease in sensation in my legs as well as decrease in pain sensation. I’ve also noticed a decrease in sensation to use the washroom but it seems like my body always knows when to go if that makes sense.  Just wondering if anyone has gone through anything similar to this? This seems to be contributing to an increase in stress for me. Thanks! "
250,2,I'm 13 I suffer from anxiety. I feel like there's something seriously wrong with me every time I feel the symptom like right now in the past few days I've been experiencing weak legs and arms and headaches. I don't know if this is something serious.
251,2,"Scientists have found links between our gut microbiomes and anxiety disorders/mental health. 

To those of you who have effectively reduced anxiety through diet, what are you eating? Would love any suggestions. "
252,2,"As a bio and chem dual major, I've studied the effects of ashwagandha and read countless of studies on PubMed on the effects it truly has on anxiety and dealing with it, and it seems to always result in the same conclusion that taking too little has no effect, and too much has negative effects.  And it seems if I ever try to take in the middle consistently, I start to drift towards the negative side effects the longer it goes, just causing me to feel worse. I know exceptions do exist in the probiotic world or more importantly for this case, the herb world, and was wondering if any of you have had this exception of feeling better after taking it. I want to avoid taking actual medication because, like most medication, it is expensive, and it leads you down the rabbit hole. In summary, is it worth it to keep trying to find that sweet spot? Or is this just a lost cause because I'm not an ""exception"". "
253,2,"Ugh. I've struggled with anxiety my whole life. Panic attacks and all. I've come a long way and now know how to manage it. However, I started zepbound for weight loss and tretinoin for my skin issues. I can't tell if one of these medications is setting off my anxiety but my body has been in fight or flight for the past week now. Constantly. Only in my sleep am I feeling rest. The second I wake up I feel a radiating anxious feeling. Does anyone have any thoughts into this? Can it be one of the two meds I just started? Or do I need to focus more on my mental and maybe some things that could be weighing on me more than I think? "
254,2,"I've not slept all night I'm so scared. I don't even know why. It's a volunteer job and literally only my second shift, but I'm crying uncontrollably and shaking. I feel ill. I'm honestly tempted to just call in sick or even tell the truth. I volunteer at a hospice so I really don't want to appear ill or be in this sort of state in front of the patients. But I feel so much anxiety not going because I'm scared I'll be punished in some way or looked down upon, and I'll feel guilty for not pushing myself to go. But I'm so tired, I need to sleep. I'm really conflicted.

Update: Welp I called in sick. I hope this doesn't come back to bite me in the ass. I need a cigarette."
255,2,"Every spring, my allergies make my anxiety worse. I'm taking Lexepro. Taking one .25 xanax twice daily and yet I'm shaking like a chihuahua. I read, I meditate, I try to clean. I feel frozen in fear. I am just under having type 2 diabetes but every meal makes me sure I'm going to get sick from high glucose. Yes, I'm a horrible hypochondriac when my anxiety is bad. I've tried grounding. It's been three weeks. It doesn't help that both my parents have dementia and I have had to sell their home to place them I memory care. It doesn't help that I've been diagnosed with stage zero breast cancer (lumpectomy July 1). I have a psychiatrist for meds, a psychologist for therapy. Fifteen fucking years of this shit. When does it end? Yes, I'm grateful it's stage zero. Yes, I have an amazing husband and daughter. Yes, I'm blessed to be able to afford care for my family. Yet, the anxiety doesn't ease. I can deal with feeling a bit nervous but this full on anxiety every day of spring, year after year is soul crushing. "
256,2,"I’m generally a happy, friendly and outgoing person. I work a tough stressful job, that has me making presentations, running meetings, and making tough decisions. I take care of myself, I do everything I can to be healthy. I walk and bike daily, I don’t drink or smoke, and try my best to eat healthy. 

My anxiety and OCD and maybe AuDHD tendencies (all “diagnosed” with a therapist, not a real diagnosis) just won’t go away though.

My big issue is 

-agoraphobia, it’s gotten to a point where I won’t drive with anyone, won’t go on planes, and won’t ride in elevators. It’s negatively impacting me being social and brings me a lot of stress.

-OCD about saying the wrong thing, saying a bad word. I literally have this in the back of my mind at all times. I’m petrified that I’ll say something that will cost me my job. It has consumed my thinking.

-Health anxiety/fear of spoiled food: I will only eat food I have prepared, and I won’t eat most meats etc. I’m afraid of being sick and afraid of rare diseases.

-Ruminating / fear of world events / news

I just don’t know what to do next, I see other people living life and things just seem so easy to them, they are just able to function as basic humans with no anxiety. I feel such a level of baseline stress and anxiety that I’m just always worried, always obsessing over something, always ruminating.

So what would you do? Like I said, I’m trying to do everything right, I’m exercising, I’m eating healthy, I’m being as social as I can, but the anxiety still persists. I’m in therapy but it’s mostly talk therapy and I’m not sure if my therapist thinks this is as serious as it is.

Is medicine my only hope? I’m scared of taking anything like an SSRI due to side effects. It’s tough because I’m generally really happy and am able to perform well at work, it’s just certain things that cause me anxiety.
"
257,2,How much time we have let just fly away.. I can’t help but to feel I’ve wasted so much time. How to move on ? Obviously I need to heal from the anxiety and fear first but how to quit getting upset about how much it has consumed… 
258,2,"I have had this fear since I was a child and the best way to describe it is not being alone or not knowing I can’t think how to describe it, like I’m scared of the dark not because it’s dark but because I don’t know if something is watching me or if something is hiding, another example is if I’m home alone I’ll be terrified that there could be something or someone in the house with me even tho I know 100% that nothing/no one is there "
259,2,"So just lately I have been dealing with this awful symptoms. To give some context I have suffered from anxiety since I was 14 years old (I had a restrictive eating disorder) and I got very severe panic attacks that seemed like I was about to have a heart attack. Over the last few years things had gotten better and I got really into fitness (weight lifting, running, amy kind of sport). The last time I had had a panic attack was like 6 years ago until march this year. 

I had gone running with my boyfriend and he made me try some cannabis edibles (I had never tried that before) and long story short I ended up in the ER shaking, yelling, struggling to breath and according to him I was looking for sugar in the kitchen (anyways a very traumatic experience). 

Ever since then I have had two episodes pretty similar (I got some bloodwork done as well and everything seems ok, just my ferritin was kind of low). That was the only time I had cannabis edibles (first and last) but the episodes I have gotten afterwards are pretty similar (shaking, panic, pale face and lips, cold, sinking sensation in the chest, fast heart rate).  Anyways, today I was deadlifting in the gym and I got the same spinning sensation, shakiness, sinking sensation in the chest, fast heart rate, and the gym instructor said my face went completely white. I was brought a Gatorade and the sensation slowly went away as I was sipping and I got better enough to leave. Is this just anxiety? Could it be PSTD due to the cannabis intoxication? Am I just overreacting? Not even my teenager anxiety attacks compare to how awful these ones have felt. "
260,2,I've just started on propranalol this week and have noticed a bunch of people say it killed their motivation for exercise and the like. I know beggers can't be choosers but it would really influence my decision to continue with propranalol. Anyone have any experience with this?
261,2,"Soooo long story short I work for a bathroom remodel company tore customers bathroom shower up and there was a shit load of mice poop and probably urine, my other coworker goes sweeping the debris up like crazy and there was dust everywhere no I'm scared I got this stupid virus 🙃 anyone got anything to ease my mind "
262,2,"I KNOW everything is going to be okay. I KNOW my family will always be here for me. But I don’t believe it. Like I don’t really believe it’s going to be okay. I feel like I’m going to drown in medical debt. I feel like my anxiety is going to rule my fucking life and I’ll never be free. I don’t know what I need. I won’t tell my family or husband but I really just want to die. There are so many things I need to just accept but I CANT. I can’t drive for the next 6 months and dont know how to process that, even though I’ve come up with a few solutions. "
263,2,"Did anyone ever experience this? Yesterday i went to physical therapy because my muscles were so tight from anxiety and now my anxiety is worse. I woke up in the middle of the night with face numbness and nausea, and ever since then I haven't been able to go back to sleep because I feel so dizzy, nauseous, confused and anxious. I took a benzo, but it didin't help."
264,2,"I’ve never had an anxiety attack, or ever sought/received a diagnosis. But, recently when I’m talking, or when someone is saying something to me, my eyes get the sudden urge to close and I almost have to squeeze my eyes closed for the feeling to go away. 

Sometimes it’s when there’s a lot of attention on me , sometimes it’s just when I’m talking to one person (who I’m comfortable with), sometimes the conversation is regarding something sad (but also doesn’t happen with all sad conversations) but will also happen with random topics. 

This started a couple years ago but it has gotten way too frequent this year, I’m 30 now, and there is more stress in my life now which may also be a factor? 

I never liked too much attention , I get nervous in front of crowds , but this has never happened. It’s annoying, I pretend something has gotten in my eyes to play it off but I have no idea what’s happening.

Google is saying it’s anxiety / a sensory overload response . Im not looking for a diagnosis here, I’m just wondering if this is common with anyone? 

Thank you! 
"
265,2,I have been experiencing multiple anxiety attacks a day from past couple of days. I dont know what should I do. My heart starts racing my limbs go cold. I've not been eating anything at all. Just went through one around half an hour ago
266,2,"I haven’t had a panic attack since early April until today. I felt some worsening baseline anxiety this morning and decided to ignore it because I literally have nothing in my life to cause anxiety. I have a good husband, a good job, I live in a cute beach house just a walk from the ocean, and I have a fluffy ragdoll cat that gives me so much love. My life is amazing, yet this hits me out of nowhere. I feel guilty over these panic attacks. 

My physical symptoms set in, and next thing I know I’m crouching onto the ground trying to breathe. I start hyperventilating, crying, and feeling like I’m going to die. My husband comes over and holds me from behind. This panic attack only lasted 7 minutes but I broke out in hives. 

I took clonazepam for the first time since early April and I feel like I’m broken. I don’t know what’s wrong and causing this. I have a therapy appointment tomorrow and I’d like some good vibes or prayers or whatever good energy you can send my way. I just want to feel like myself again. "
267,2,"Hey everyone, about month ago I had my first PA May 16th, went to ER. (30M) Never experienced one before besides normal life stress from military. 

My first week was hell of headaches/tiredness/lightheadedness/fatigued/brain fog/unwell feeling/beating heart/insomnia/nausea and just stuck on my couch all while having a pregnant wife and 2 year old. Took 2 days off work during memorial break so had 5 days off total to rest. Things slowly got “better” but it was still lingering. 

As of now 30 days later I haven’t had any other attacks and just slight head pressure, dizzy sensation that comes and goes and feels like I’m walking on one of those airport floor escalators(lol) only way to describe it. 

I do live in a new city with high pollen so my Doc thinks it could also be affecting me, taking Zrytec helped a bit with dizziness but made me super drowsy. 

Anyways, if you’re experiencing anything similar it’ll get better as time goes on.  I stopped worrying about a few things and noticed it doesn’t happen. I have good days and some I feel tired with slight head pressure/dizziness. Keep your head up and we will all get through this together. "
268,2,"I’m going to start this off with I’ve never had health anxiety/depression before. 

I have been feeling sick for the last few days. Today I went to work and for the first half couldn’t control my emotions and just felt like crying. My anxiety and depression have been under control for awhile  now after having an issue months ago. Does this happen to anyone else?  Im worried of a relapse into my depression and it’s scaring the crap out of me.  "
269,2,"I wanted to share a medication that I found that works wonders for me. It’s called calmaid and it’s a silexan lavender pill that has been studied and tested to help relieve anxiety. Im in the US and it’s available to buy otc but I’ve read that a prescription may be required for it in other countries. I have struggled with anxiety most of my adult life and I have tried everything my doctor has thrown at me, clonidine, propranolol, hydroxyzine, ssri, antipsychotics, Ativan, Xanax. Nothing has worked for my physical anxiety symptoms except for the Xanax. A few months ago I tried the calmaid for a month and barely had to take my Xanax that month. I didn’t buy more because I thought it was just a good month and a coincidence. The next few months were up and down until this month when my anxiety got to be unmanageable and I was having to take double my Xanax dose just to get relief. I ordered another box of calmaid and am on day 2 of no anxiety and no Xanax use. I’m not going to claim it’s life changing or that it works better than the other medications but I did want to share my experience with the hopes that this might help someone else who is struggling."
270,2,"It is coming upon a year since I had a massive blood clot on my lung causing my lung to collapse. Health is doing well but I can’t get the worry of it happening again or my body secretly failing out of my head. Made only worse by the fact I tend to get muscle knots very easily due to stress and anxiety, right now on my sides, leading to spiraling. If anyone has any advice on what health anxiety they experienced to help get it under control that would be so helpful. I am in therapy and stretch/meditate regularly it just isn’t enough. I try to keep up with stretching, massage from partner, hot bathes, etc. but it’s the head aspect I struggle with."
271,2,"I know there are a lot of posts regarding side effects here but thought I’d share my own. 

I have borderline debilitating anxiety which has prevented me from having a normal quality of life. I’m 40 and don’t have a license… too much anxiety to even try… that’s how bad it is. 
I believe it started in high school. I could never stand up in front of class or participate in anything in school without anxiety non stop. 

I have been on 4 different ssri’s trying to find the right one. I stopped trying for a few years during Covid as it was hard to see my doc etc a so I gave up and am now back on trying to find the right ssri. 

I finally actually have a psychiatrist and she recommended me a couple but I chose to try Prozac. 10mg for 2 weeks now on 20 for a few days. 

I also get 1mg Xanax 3 times a day that helps with the immediate anxiety I get from normal everyday bullshit that shouldn’t even bother a normal person. 

Anyway my experience so far has been….. worse anxiety to the point Xanax barely even works now. Never had that problem while I was going through the other ssri’s looking for the proper one. 

I also seem to get changes in mood pretty quickly and easily agitated. That’s even with using Xanax. Never happened before. 

Anyone have any experiences similar to this? I went through a lot of posts but haven’t seen any where even taking Xanax seems to not remove your anxiety as it used too( I haven’t taken any benzos in around 4-5 years till now as well). 

Should I stick this out or try another one? I have my psychiatrist appointment in about a weeks time to discuss. "
272,2,"I have been having bad anxiety so got a prescription for lexapro online from Hers but the dosage amount is 11.1mg of escitalopram and when I did other research on lexapro is says it only comes in 5mg or 10mg dosage. I'm confused why it's a random dosage and my anxiety is making me not want to take it because of this lol.
Has anyone taken Lexapro from Hers with this same dosage?"
273,2,"Hello, I am a 27m and the last couple of weeks has been draining for my health anxiety. So a little back story, beginning of June I started to have some stomach, digestive, and ultimately bowel movement issues. I went to my PCP and she did a little exam and talked it out with me and indicated that she felt it’s a mix of GERD and some IBS/constipation. The following week my symptoms didn’t get better with her treatment plan, and she then referred me out to a gastroenterologist. I have an appointment July 2nd. I know it’s just over 2 weeks away but it’s been tough the past 12ish days as my health anxiety has been through the roof. Mainly, I have essentially convinced myself that I have colon cancer and can’t get it out of my head. Daily I have been checking online for my symptoms and have been obsessing over it. Any help on things I can do to help alleviate the anxiety for the next two weeks? I know it’s very unlikely that someone my age would have that, but everything I read says more and more younger people are getting it and it has freaked me out."
274,2,"Hi everyone,  
I just started a new job as a cashier in retail, and I already feel anxious just thinking about it. It's not only the usual nervousness — it feels heavy, like the environment, the people, and the overall tempo of the job might be too overwhelming for me in the long run.

I keep wondering: is this just the typical fear of change, or is this job actually not a good fit for me? How do you tell the difference between starting anxiety and something deeper telling you “this isn’t the place for you”?

I don't want to give up too early, but I also don't want to force myself into something that will drain me completely.

If you've been in a similar situation, I’d really appreciate your thoughts."
275,2,"Hoping this helps someone out there with constant anxiety. I’ve had anxiety for 14 years. It had gotten to the point where I was afraid to drive in the left lane because there was no “escape”. I was listening to meditation on repeat at work to help stop panic attacks. I had stopped driving when I didn’t have to go to work even though cars are my passion. I couldn’t even go out to eat with my family.

I had been prescribed antidepressants, propranolol, xanax, and had tried countless supplements. If you are like me, you are scared of becoming dependent on meds, side effects, withdrawals from stopping. While some of these helped, I was not ready to make that lifelong commitment. In comes magnesium threonate. My brother suggested it to me after listening to a podcast. I said what the hell, I’ll try it. I added it to my nightly regimen of aged garlic extract (high blood pressure), l theanine, and vitamin d. All I have to say is WOW.  After a couple weeks of taking it before bed, I am 95% better. No more attacks at work, no more blurry vision and heart racing at left turns, no more worrying about going out to eat. Just completely game changing. Give it a try if you haven’t. For me it’s a miracle, and hopefully it helps one other person. 
"
276,2,Hi everyone! I’m leaving for a big trip on Saturday and I’m pretty nervous about it. It’s a big plane ride plus a cruise so I’ll be gone for 9 days. Any tips for staying calm? I’m currently not medicated or anything so I’ll have to do this naturally. Any supplements that actually help? Any advice is super appreciated! 
277,2,Hi I need some help. I am 30 years old and healthy but I do have asthma since 7 years old which is basically under control unless I’m sick. But lately I cannot get a deep enough satisfying breath. It’s like my chest won’t physically expand for it. It’s causing so much anxiety. I actually feel like I’m forcing every breath and I feel breathless. My pulse ox has been consistently normal but my chest feels tight it is worse when I do lay down. My inhaler takes the edge off but it’s still not helping. Anybody else experience this before it’s really stressing me out 
278,2,"Hi all,

I’m 33 years old, and have dealt with worsening anxiety starting back in my early 20s. I come from a culture where mental health is not really talked about, unfortunately. For context, no one in my entire family has ever been to a therapist. Being surrounded by this mentality my whole life has made me extremely stubborn. My wife has been pushing me to seek out therapy for years now, and I always push it off. I tell myself I’ll figure it out on my own, that I don’t need therapy. I don’t need medication. But I’m finally at the point where I’m acknowledging I need help.

Much of my anxiety revolves around controlling the future and preventing bad things from happening. In my mid 20s, the anxiety started to lead to signs of OCD, which has now completely spiraled. The craziest part about all of this is that I’ve basically hidden it from everyone in my life, but my wife. My friends all look at me as the person who has their life together, but on the inside, I feel like I’m falling apart.

I’ll give some examples of how my anxiety/OCD manifests:
- checking things around the house. In my early 20s, it started with checking whether I locked the door one or two times. Now? I will often check the sink, stove, and other appliances around the house 50+ times before sleeping. Yes, 50 times. As I’m doing it, I know how ridiculous it is. I try to tell myself what I’m doing is not necessary, but it’s like my brain can’t stop. I come up with odd routines that I follow.

- difficulty swallowing. For the past 8 years, I’ve struggled with swallowing food. I’ve had every test under the sun. There is nothing medically wrong with me. I’ve convinced myself I am going to choke and die. I do not eat food when I am by myself, ever.

- anxiety around getting my blood drawn. This was the most recent one that really made me realize I need help. Every time I get my blood drawn, I go into a full blown panic for a week or two after. I try to watch exactly what the phlebotomist is doing, looking for any signs of things that could put me at risk. If I leave and feel like I missed watching a certain step of the process, I convince myself of the most absurd things, scenarios that result in me getting stuck with a dirty needle. Most recently, I had my blood drawn. The nurse had prepared all the supplies and opened the packaging that the butterfly needle is in. Average person probably wouldn’t think much of this. The nurse does it to make it more efficient for the phlebotomist. Me? I convince myself it’s a dirty needle. I actually politely asked the nurse if she could open a new needle in front of me. Unfortunately, this nurse was not that understating. While she did it, she clearly thought I was crazy. Her negative reaction to my request made the situation even worse — I felt so embarrassed by the situation, I completely got distracted and didn’t watch them grab the new needle and do the blood draw. So the end result? I still left in a panic and feeling sick to my stomach. All due to a scenario that is so irrational.

- I wash my hands obsessively. Probably 100+ times a day. Making a salad? I opened the lettuce packaging, which could be dirty. Wash my hands. Now I touched the yogurt container that the cashier touched when checking me out at the grocery store. Hands are dirty, need to wash them again.

- constantly convincing myself I have health issues.  Slight pain in my chest? Heart attack. This compounds and the symptoms and level of panic just continue to increase.

I’ll spare you all a novel. I could list so many more things I’m struggling with. All I know is that I need help. I just have no idea where to start. I have good insurance, and live in a major metropolitan city. Should I begin by seeing a psychotherapist? I know there are a lot of virtual services now. Is it difficult to find a provider that would see me in person? I’d prefer that. I’d appreciate any other advice and guidance as I navigate this. Thank you, and wishing everyone here the best"

I'm honestly terrified I'm slowly dying or going insane or something. Trying to fight the urge to go to hospital rn. Telling myself it's health anxiety flare up. 


Googling symptoms doesn't help whatsoever either. "
280,2,"Today was a Xanax day. Most days nowadays aren't, but the reminder that you will have good and bad days was front and center today. 

Today I let the chaos suck me in and take me for a ride. I let it create doubt in my mind about myself and my capabilities. I let my mind wander and create hypotheticals that almost certainly have no chance of becoming real. Today, I let my mind get me out of control. 

Today I recognized that I was out of control and needed a little help. I understood that I can't win them all and that I'm winning more days than I'm losing now. I recognized my intrusive thoughts. I recognized I was dwelling on things that just didn't matter. Today, I wasn't myself, but I was mentally strong. With a little help I pushed out my irrational fears and focused on the real. I focused on the path that gets me to my happy place. I focused on my passions and things I love and the people and things that love me. Yes, things too. I like to think that the tool I use to create has all of this beautiful art in it and I'm helping to get it out. Together. Like a partnership. My guitar isn't the prettiest, but it can envoke some emotion if you touch it just right. And yes, sometimes those emotions are laughs. 

Today, I remembered that I wasn't my best self, but I gave it my best. Today, I read 2 great stories to my kids at bedtime enthusiastically and made their day. And today, I shared this with you. 

You won't win everyday. You may lose more than you win right now. But your mind is strong. You can be strong. It won't happen in a day, or a month, but keep building up everyday. Focus on what really matters and what's real. Focus on the things that truly make you happy. That may mean starting with finding the things that make you happy. You can do it with me, today. I hope you're ok and I hope this helps. "
281,2,"I've always been a procrastinator and I'd be on social media, scrolling for long hours. Lately I feel like this has been intensified. I somehow physically can't motivate myself into trying in school. Even thought I DO care about my grades and education and understand the stakes they hold. Even with that, I ditch studying for my already procrastinated test for reels. I don't feel like doing anything whatsover and feel hopeless and useless all the time and I just really hate myself. I hate how I'm not trying, how everything can be better if I just put more effort, if I showed I cared instead of just caring. I hate my personality, my face, my body, my actions, my school, my effort, my grades, how I don't try as much as I should and go behind my parents back to just *scroll on reels* while lying and saying I'm working.

When I come back home I often just sit on my couch without showering or changing my clothes and scroll on reels mindlessly even when I have something I really need to do. I used to get really good grades, even in the beginning of the year, but now I can't even make myself TRY to do that. I always feel drained and tired and empty. I feel like a burden on my parents, they work so hard and always encourage me to try hard in school and I can't even give them that.

I'm straight up average or below average in everything I do and I don't even have some sort of talent or fun personality to compensate. I feel like my flaws overpower, such as how I get annoyed and angry easily and how I can be stubborn, hates being wrong, being argumentative, and how I find it hard to apologize even when I really want to, or even show affection. I always feel worried that everyone will turn on me, or that they secretly hate me. I also never feel like anyone's first option and the thought of it makes me feel lonely.

All my friends have other people that there just more closer too, and I feel clingy a lot. The only times I go away from my doomscrollling is to check if anyone texted me back or initiated a conversation. I do this manyyyy times too and I feel pathetic. This lasts up till around 3-4 am, sometimes even all-nighters. I don't even enjoy reels that much but it's the only thing I can make myself do.

My room is a mess, I sometimes go a few days without showering, I sleep in my bed while theres books and clothes piled upon it. I feel like barely anything makes me happy now days. I don't think I have depression as I still try biking/cleaning my room somedays as an attempt to ""claim back my life"" or ""start afresh"" or something.

My doctor said I might be developing anxiety but that was a few years ago and I think it was because of my lack of motivation to do anything despite the amount of long term goals I had and my lack of energy/being tired very often (that was anemia tho). I also don't really sleep much now days (typing this at 4 am...), and pull all nighters for no reason, like reels and yt.

I don't think I'm burnt out either as I never really overworked myself and even when my grades were good, I usually just did how much I needed to do good.

This honestly turned into a bit of a rant, but does anyone have any advice? Do I acc have anxiety like my doctor initially thought? she never straight up said I didnt have it either, it just never came up again? How can I fix this? Or is it just insecurities and laziness?"
282,2,"Sunday my husband and mother took me to the ER, because when I woke up I remember my stomach hurting like a nausea feeling. Then followed by extreme chest pain and shortness of breath, my chest felt like it was on fire and I could not sit down I was pacing in my room saying I couldn’t breathe, feeling hot and sweaty and shaky, I then committed shorty after. My poor husband was freaking out. For info, yeah I’ve been pretty stressed lately..career changes to be more specific.I had been feeling off for about ten days. I saw an urgent care because of very bad stomach problems and she thought it could be stress. My ER doctor couldn’t pin point what was medically wrong with me and asked if I had history of anxiety. And I said no which I didn’t  really. I’m 26 yo healthy female, I gym 5 days out the week and am not overweight at all or anything so, I’m wondering if I experienced that maybe?"

284,2,"Made the mistake of reading someone’s post late night and I couldn’t go to sleep because my brain absorbed the bad info from a post from this subreddit and how it’ll happen to me too. I was anxious all night and almost had the anxiety attack had to calm down many times. Palpitations. Took my hydroxyzine only so it forced me to sleep I had to call out of work so today is just gonna be self care. I felt uneasy bad night mares and brain stuck in bad thoughts.

285,2,"28M. In two years I've gone from an extremely well spoken, top of my org with several promotions under my belt engineer to a stuttering, sick, mentally slow person. I haven't dated in almost a year. I don't know what to do anymore. I get extremely sick as soon as I'm home, in neighborhood, or at my office (an hour away from home). The feeling is almost instant, and goes away within hours of exiting from my environment. I live in San Francisco. I also get these symptoms when I'm in my car with the roof up

Main symptoms: 
- brain fog
- sore/itchy throat that tightens up. My vocal cord gets strained and voice changes
- memory loss, frequently enter a room and don't know why I did
- feels like a chore to breath
- Feels like I can feel my heartbeat
- Eyes feel heavy to move
- Insomnia, can never sleep a full 8 hours and always wake up fatigued even I do
- No sex drive. Always wake up without an erection

The symptoms exist primarily in my home, especially when I sit down (I feel better when standing at my desk), my car when the windows are up, and sometimes at work; my office is an hour drive away and I get sick indoors there sometimes too.


I've been to over 10 different doctors and run a multitude of tests: allergy, rheumatoid blood markers, STI panels, ENT, etc Spend over $10k changing apartments, I woke up significantly sicker in my new apartment. Everything has come back normal except for mild allergies to dust and walnut; I've been on a rigorous cleaning + shot regimine for months now with no improvement. Been on esomeprazole 40mg daily for months now for potential silent acid reflux as well.

It's gotten so bad I haven't been able to work properly for over 2 years; I'm a software engineer and the only place I can sit down and think/concentrate is if I go to a cafe, which isn't sustainable 5 days a week for the rest of my life. I can't think otherwise

When I feel normal:

- Out the house in fresh air like on my roof. I do most of my work there now, even when it's freezing I down winter clothes and work on my laptop like a maniac
- When I leave the area entirely. E.g. I went backpacking in the wild friday-sunday this weekend, by Saturday morning I felt completely normal. The minute I drove home and park my car, my throat feels itchy, I feel my heart pounding a bit. Get into my apartment, the symptoms significantly worsen
- When I sit down at a cafe to do some work. Don't know why, but I feel pretty much normal as soon as I do this
- On vacation or away from home. I can actually think and function when I'm in my friends' apartments on the east coast

I have some general normal stresses about life but I've generally been a pretty gung ho and forward looking person. The only thing I can think of causing this is something mental at this point. Anybody experience this?
"
286,2,"I’m gonna start this off by saying I do not like when friends, partners, or family drop by unannounced. Unless it’s my immediate family members. I’m not a dirtbag on any level, but I live alone and am at peace with a certain level of cleanliness standards for myself. But when someone wants to come over I like it to be absolutely spotless, like eat off the floors spotless. I come from a childhood home that was a mess most of the time, and the thought of people judging me for how I keep my home is really nerve wracking for me. 
Lately friends and coworkers have been wanting to come over more often and certain days I flat out refuse to make plans because I don’t have the energy to clean to my level of hosting. 
Am I alone in this? 
I’m feeling really guilty about it lately. But I work 13 hour shifts so sometimes I feel like a zombie just doing activities of daily living. "

289,2,"I am at wits end. I cannot stand the way I feel. I have new symptoms everyday of scary diseases I read about. It is affecting my life in a horrible way. I’ve been feeling horrible for 2 months. Damaging my mind and body self testing. I’m so tense and anxious. Somedays I’m fine and then a new thing happens and I’m not good again. Somedays I can be rational but now my arms and legs are jerking, Ive had body wide twitching for 2 months now and the other day I started having jerks in my legs and arms. I am terrified of something bad happening to me but I’m also so tired of living like this. I don’t know what to do anymore. My family is horrible to me, my boyfriend is just sick of me & my kids don’t even get a good version of me. I’m in therapy and everything else but I really just feel like I can’t do this anymore. I’m exhausted & frustrated 24/7 my mind will not let me live. I sit inside afraid of what ifs. "
290,2,"This is just a personal list, and doesnt replace medication and therapy. Things that work for you can be very personal.

1. Calling up a friend or family member and just talking nonsense for a while

2. Putting on a stream from YouTube, twitch, etc and lying under a heavy or weighted blanket

3. Long walk in nature. Sometimes multiple walks around a city park. Only helps me if I dont have music running

4.  Something small but measurable and achievable. Might be following through on a recipe to make cookies, measurable progress in a video game that isn't too difficult, deep cleaning a room. If i can say I accomplished something measurable that day, it staves off the feeling of ""you arent useful"", which is a big anxiety thing for me...especially when I have job anxiety. 

5. Heavy exercise. Weights, or running until im very tired.  

6. Lying down somewhere im not supposed to lie down. Like on the floor, or grass outside. Or sitting somewhere i dont normally sit, like a park bench

7. I cut back on coffee, weed, alcohol. All three Contributed to my anxiety. 

8. Anything creative, and its ok if im bad. I've written grotesquely poor poetry, I cant sing well usually. But sometimes its fun being bad at something. Life isn't about min/maxing , and I think thats where my anxiety comes from. Ill try a hobby and im bad at it, and I get frustrated.

291,2,"i(25/F) have been dealing with anxiety attacks for 3 years now, i turned off the light last night for a change since i started sleeping with the light on after experiencing the worst anxiety attack ever last 2023. now at 4am, i suddenly woke up feeling like i was going to die and theres something heavy in my chest, my eyes are heavy, i’m here on reddit because i dont want to sleep i’m scared."
292,2,"I 16F have been diagnosed with Illness/Health Anxiety and yesterday was my first time taking it. I was prescribed 50mg but I was prescribed to only take half of it every night so basically 25mg. 

After taking it I had lots of trouble sleeping and was sweating all night. I am also feeling some shakiness or tremors on my hands and legs. My heart rate also occasionally increased last night and I'm scared.. 

Is this normal? How long will it take till the side effects go away?  "
293,2,"Im just curious. I've struggled with anxiety my whole life. It's turned into anxiety/ocd. It's mostly health anxiety. So I have a lot of ""checks"" I need to do to feel comfortable, on top of checking my HR a thousand times a day on my watch. The older my kids get the worse I feel because they want to go on vacation. I dont even leave the town I live in. My husband has asked ""why can't you just have a panic attack in Florida instead of here"" and I tell him that's not the issue. I mean it kind of is. I always want to be home where I'm comfortable especially when I start to panic. 
What does everyone else do that travels with anxiety???
Im on meds but they dont help that much. They help for like day to day things."
294,2,"*Potentially Triggering* for some if also have severe health anxiety, but I tried to stay positive! 

I have been dealing with extreme health anxiety for as long as I can remember. Back when I was 5 years old my parents had to call the ambulance on me because I believed that I was cramping all over my body. 3 hours later I was discharged and was told I was perfectly healthy by the ER. Since that point I have had the ambulance called on me three times and all of those times I was perfectly healthy. Over the years my anxiety has morphed from one form to another, heart palpitations, nausea (throwing up) and the most recent one unable to breath (light headed). In the middle of 2023 I started feeling like I couldn't breath properly, sometimes it was not a big deal and other times I felt like I could not get up from the bed. So in late 2023 I went to the urgent clinic, from what I found online, what I was feeling was called, ""air hunger"". They took my blood test, did a blood oxygen level read and also did a chest x-ray. However, shortly after all those tests they sent me home. What freaked me out was they really did not tell me anything (or say I am fine). I assume sending me home meant nothing was wrong but ever since that point I have been fixated on this problem. Fast forward to the last week, I have been feeling extra light headed and feeling like i can't breath. It is now getting so bad that it is affecting my entire life. I understand that more then likely it is nothing, but no matter how much I tell myself it is nothing, I still believe it is there and real.

To note, I am a very healthy individual, I go rock climbing at least 3 times a week and am very physically fit. I have a doctors appointment set up for September (Northeast primary care is crazy), so really I have no choice but to wait or I have to go to the urgent clinic/ER, which I would prefer not to do given my history....

I would love to get some advice on how others have dealt with crippling health anxiety, or maybe books to read that could help me through it. "
295,2,"I started taking ozempic back in November. Since then I’ve lost 40 pounds (196 lbs to 156). I look much better and my HbA1c is lower than ever (diabetes in remission). But it has affected my anxiety for the worse. It’s started making me worry about my wife cheating on me. She has never done anything that could cause me to suspect her. But there is the wicked little voice in my head suggesting that she’s just really good at hiding it. Saw the doc last week and they adjusted my meds, but honestly only propanol seems to do anything and it only seems to stop the physical issues with anxiety, not the mental ones. Not that my anxiety is limited to worrying about my wife. There’s *gestures to the US at large* all this. Plus work worries. I’m in a field rapidly being replaced with AI. Worries about leaving my non-neurotypical kids when I die. Has anyone taking ozempic found anything that seems to help? I’ve also cut back on the ozempic. But I’d hate to completely stop, given the success. "
296,2,"[This is long I know, sorry]

So I’ve been on and off anxiety meds since probably mid 2019 (usually try one, take it for a year or two, quit because I feel like it’s not doing much or just numbing me, then feel unwell enough in 6 months to a year to try a new med). So far I’ve tried Zoloft, Lexapro, and most recently Prozac until 3-4 months ago.

Well unfortunately, I’m at the point again where I really really need to try meds again. Been facing probably the worst anxiety in my life, where all day everyday I have a huge pit in my stomach and feel like I can break down at any second. I can hardly eat anything, I’m always on the verge of tears, I’m so insecure about everything, existing is literal torture. It SUCKS.

Can anyone recommend me a good psychiatrist, one that will also have a proper conversation with me and not just do a 5 minute call where they prescribe me something and call it a day? The thing is, I really would get a therapist along with meds but I just cannot afford it (psychiatrist is already going to really hurt the bank). I really want to get myself the help I need, I just keep finding the wrong doctors and can’t afford the right ones…

So if anyone has had a good experience with a psychiatrist who actually has a proper conversation and doesn’t use every opportunity possible to take your money, I would really appreciate it.

297,2,"I feel so good right now, I took 0.5 mg of xanax and I feel like I wish I could feel all day everyday. But I know this is highly addictive and that my anxiety is getting worse when I don't take it or when I take less. 

I'm scared, I don't want to turn into an addict. What good alternatives could I take or do instead of xanax?"
298,2,"I’ve been stuck in the same place for what feels like forever, and I’m starting to realize why. I avoid opportunities. Not because I don’t want to grow, but because I’m afraid. I don’t take initiative. I stay quiet. I let chances pass me by — and afterward, I hate myself for it.

Whenever something comes up — like a job interview, a chance to meet new people, speak in public, try something new — I feel this heavy fear. My mind instantly fills with doubt. What if I embarrass myself? What if I’m not good enough? What if people laugh at me or judge me? So I stay in my comfort zone, even though it doesn’t feel comfortable anymore. It feels like a trap.

Meanwhile, I see other people around me using their chances. They apply for things, speak up, start new paths, and grow. I keep telling myself I’ll do it “next time,” but when next time comes, I freeze again. It’s frustrating, and honestly heartbreaking.

I think a big part of this is that I feel inferior to others. Like I’m always a step behind. I doubt myself constantly. I assume I’ll fail or won’t be taken seriously. And that mindset stops me before I even start.

I don’t want to live like this anymore. I want to take action, build confidence, and stop letting fear control my decisions. But right now, I don’t know how. It feels like I’m stuck in a loop I can’t break."

300,2,"Hello , 32/b/f here. In the past 2-3 months  anxiety with has spiked.. its always been there, but  comes and goes  off and on . the last wave  was pretty rough. In a desperate attempt to find something natural, I  see people in an anxiety support group saying magnesium glycinate was a good option.
  So I went ahead and purchase some at Walmart,  willing to give it a try. on it 2 weeks now as of today..The first few days were smooth, anxiety virtually went away! Then about a week later I noticed symptoms like being sluggish and brain fog, feeling loopy and a bit down. However  I didn't relate it to the magnesium, I  chalked it  to anxiety(even though this is not one of my normal symptoms)
   
   Going into 2nd week,  I noticed moments  of feeling down and depressed and and it's gets worse as the days pass. Still thinking it was caused by anxiety,  I begin to take more magnesium, hoping it will help clear it.. wasn't till after taking a dose this morning I realized that it could actually been magnesium the whole causing  the depression like feelings, and I've just been making it worse by continuing to take more. I got a few people on Reddit  to say  they got these symptoms dealing with magnesium glycinate. 
  just looking for personal experiences and maybe the science behind why this is happening. definitely my last dose  this morning. "

304,2,"I’ve been on sertraline for anxiety for over a decade and have been on varying doses depending on the time in my life. I’ve never had any lasting side effects but recently had a span of several months where I was on 150mg then went to 100mg for about a month and then increased to 200mg.

305,2,"I had just had my second experience with a therapist (same one for both sessions) and to say the least, I feel like a bit of an ass. I had always had issues with anxiety, and my mother suggested I go to see a therapist to help with it.

So, here I was on my cell phone talking to my therapist and there were distinct long moments of silence. I would tell her different events that had transpired the past few weeks and she would say like one vague sentence in response and neither of us would say anything in uncomfortable silence. 

The session was cut short by 15 minutes, despite the appointments being set for 45 minutes. At the end, she suggested I take notes about how I feel every day or so, and make notes on triggers and stressors and whatnot.

The problem is is that I have trouble identifying how I feel at times or realize I feel a certain way until way later.

I don't really even feel that motivated to go back. It just feels like another thing to be anxious about, and I don't want to feel like I'm wasting their time.

I guess in other words I'm asking how do you get therapy to best help you?

Edit: Also would like some advice on how yall take notes in preparation for therapy."

Along with no motivation I start to focus in on my bad qualitys and make up reasons for my friends secretly hating me, normally ending with me crying for a bit, taking a nap then eating food which a majorify of the time my mood will have improved by then. Is there some type foods that can improve my mood in specific or does it just depend on the amount I eat? Whenever this happens and I eat food, there is always a varying result.

308,2,"Hello,

For context: I start a new job tomorrow. I left my previous role after nearly 4 years as a change in management made it an incredibly toxic and awful place to work, to the point I had time off due to work related stress. 

It took a while but I managed to get this new job. It’s in a field that is related but very different to what I’m used to and the people who hired me are aware of this.

It’s the evening before now, and my chest is tight, I feel sick, my stomach hurts and I’m seriously on edge. I’m worried about everything- the commute, the new building , whether I’ll get on with my colleagues (it’s a very small team which adds), whether I can develop the skills needed (I’m a naturally slow learner and I guess I’m worried they won’t have the patience for that!) etc

I have an intense fear of feeling dizzy and out of control and I’m nervous that when I get the meds it’s going to cause me to freak out or something.

310,2,"About 2 years ago I did a couple months of CBT therapy and found it made my anxiety worse. I have heard lots of other’s experiences in therapy and what I was doing didn’t sound like everyone else. 

From CBT I remember the triangle and ladder, pretty much it. For me I experience physical symptoms, not anxious thoughts, which in turn made me feel worse because it wasn’t helping. My therapist only talked about one specific topic over and over and I didn’t feel like I was making any improvements (I was actively putting in the work).

I was just wondering what other’s had experienced in therapy (CBT or otherwise) as I want to get better, I am unsure of what to expect. 

Thanks :)"
311,2,"So, around 2021 my meds I was on at the time stopped working, and I went through the most awful 2 years of my life. I had to stop the medication, and the withdrawal was awful. Then, all of my anxiety came back, and I wasn’t able to control it like I used to. I was sick all the time, I couldn’t make the lingering anxiety go away, every night I convinced myself something terrible would happen. I had no friends, I couldn’t eat, i developed IBS and POTS, it was awful. I went through numerous medications until I tried Clomipramine after being in the hospital. It’s the only thing that targeted my ocd, and made the thoughts more manageable. Since then, I have done so many things I never could’ve done before and went out of my comfort zone. I feel like a person again. It’s being going well, but about a year ago my heart has begun to give me issues. It’s constantly racing, drops when I sit down, I get hypotension, and palpitations, along with chest pain. I got an EKG and it shows one part of my heart is working much harder than the other. It makes me profusely sweat and I can barely do any physical activity. I also have no sex drive, and contact dermatitis which is awful. My psychiatrist really thinks it’s the Clomipramine. And she is making me ween off and eventually stop taking it. I haven’t been able to leave my bed all day, I am so afraid. I can’t live like I did again, I can’t go through that again. I was 90 pounds and non stop anxious. This summer I had so much to look forward to, and it’s all gone. I have to start over. I can’t do this again."
312,2,"I have dealt with anxiety for quite some time now, and my typical anxiety related symptoms are lightheadedness, shaking, sweating, heart palpitations as physical symptoms and typical constant worry and racing thoughts as emotional symptoms. I am taking 12.5mg of Lexapro to combat it and has been working wonders. Although, I messed up a couple days ago by taking my medication at 3PM and then the next day at 10:30AM, followed by having a Vietnamese coffee and that made me incredibly nauseated. It’s gotten a lot better but I still feel nauseous here and there. 
I’m worried now that I’ve developed this as a symptom of anxiety and not a symptom of taking my dose at the wrong time/ drinking a high caffeine coffee without much food. "
313,2,"Basically the title, i am someone that worries EVERYDAY. whenever something good happens, my mind can always conjure up something to be worried about which sends me in a spiral. however everything i have worried about so far has never come true. however in the moment it feels so real. how do i distinguish this. "
314,2,"I feel like I’m losing my mind. It started three weeks ago when I was at work and suddenly found myself unable to catch my yawn, which then turned into this feeling of being unable to fully catch my breath. I’ll take tons of breaths and feel as if I can’t satisfy that breath until I’m finally able to miraculously get a satisfying breath out of nowhere (like it hit the G spot of my lungs). I’ve dealt with constant ear popping and now just found out silent reflux for a big portion of my life, which I’m sure is attributing to these issues but I don’t find them to be the main cause of them. I went to urgent care and got prescribed prednisone which I had an allergic reaction to which sent me to the ER. When at the ER, I had an EKG, X-rays on both my lungs and chest, all of which came back crystal clear. The doctors told me that it was anxiety related, and then prescribed me hydroxyzine and pantoprazole. Since then my acid reflux has noticeably reduced, but this breathing has not, which brings me here. I went to my ENF, got an endoscopy and was just told to take nasacort for my ears and that this breathing is anxiety related. If it is anxiety related I’m at a loss as for what I’m to do, as I feel like I’m out of options and recovery seems further and further away with each coming day. I’m a college athlete, an avid gym goer, and a good student who has had his life stripped away by this condition and just doesn’t know what to do. I’ve always had anxiety and fell back on vaping and smoking copious amounts of weed as a means by which to handle that anxiety, which again is not a healthy outlet by any means, but since this has happened I’ve dropped both vaping and smoking weed and still feel as if I’ve seen very very minuscule improvement. I’m posting on here to see if anyone else has dealt with this same condition and seen any kind of improvements or progress with time. I have so much in life currently to look forward to and enjoy and this mystery condition has made me a shell of the person I once was both physically and mentally, unable to work out without hyperventilating, and just destroyed my self confidence, which in turn has made me noticeably more depressed to those who care for me. I don’t expect sympathy in any capacity, I just want to understand what’s happening to me and know the steps to take to fix it so that I can stop bringing down the people that love and care for me, and truly become better and enjoy my life and the experiences coming my way, rather than keeping myself in a hole. "
315,2,"I've dealt with work anxiety (and anxiety in general) for years at this point. I feel like I have made progress with my therapist on it, and I have moments where I feel like I've got it under control, til I don't, and it starts latching onto random things and other lesser anxieties like social anxiety, which makes it spiral more.

A lot of it from a deeper sense seems to be, the fear of the unknown (for example, it being a terrible environment where my work/life balance is really shitty, something that's important to me) or the fear of messing up something as well. It also seems like I overblow the size of the chunk that work takes of my life, as I'm in college working 20 hours a week, which isn't a big chunk at all, but since work anxiety is such a big part of my life, it feels like the work is too.

Is there anything that helped all of you keep your work anxiety (or just anxiety in general) at bay long term? I always feel like I get moments where I have a great plan with finances, and paying off all my debt before I graduate, or something else and I feel like I'm turning a new leaf, just for it to creep back in and provide a big hurdle to what I want to do in life."
316,2,"Hey everyone,

I’m writing this to process what happened, and maybe help someone else feel less alone if they ever go through it.

Last night I took an edible. This was the second time, I’ve taken one before but it was like 2mg. Last night I took 20mg. This time… something went very, very wrong. I did not realize it was so much until after I took it. 

About an hour or so after taking it, things started to shift, in a heady, disorienting, way. Moving my head made me dizzy. Moving any part of my body made me feel like I was stuck in my body. Like I wasn’t in control. But that wasn’t the worst part.

The worst part was the mental and emotional spiral.

It felt like all my internal dialogue turned against me. I suddenly felt disgusted with myself, like I was the ugliest person in the world. Not just me, everyone around me looked hideous. It was like my brain was painting reality with this deeply judgmental, horrifying lens. I cried five different times, because I couldn’t believe how awful it felt to be in my own skin.

Every time I blinked, I saw three different movies playing behind my eyelids, random, vivid, surreal scenes, like Pokémon and anime mixed with distorted memories. I think this is bc I was playing with ChatGPT to turn pictures into anime sketches. 

I lost touch with where I was. I felt unsafe, detached, and not real. It was like reality had warped and I was stuck in it. We were sitting in a kitchen table and it felt like the scenes kept shifting. I was thinking horrible things, I felt vulnerable, I cried bc I felt so horrible. Thankfully I was with my husband. I thought he was going to divorce me for seeing me like this. I felt like everyone could see my insecurity. I felt so uncomfortable bc I did not have control of my body. I was trapped. I kept thinking is this how it feels to be drugged. I felt like anyone could do anything to me if they wanted to. Horrible things. And I would not be able to defend myself. 

I threw up in the car on the way home.   My looked like a little goblin driving.  I barely spoke. I was terrified to close my eyes but also too overwhelmed to keep them open.

today, I’ve felt emotionally raw. Like the high cracked something open in me I wasn’t ready to face. I’ve cried a few more times. I’ve felt lingering shame, guilt, and sadness, even though I know it was just a drug-induced experience.

I’ve never felt so vulnerable or scared. I’m never ever doing any type of weed ever again. Never. Worst night of my life. 

If you’ve gone through something similar… I’d really appreciate hearing about it. I don’t want to carry this feeling alone.

Thanks for reading .

317,2,"Does anyone ever get lingering headaches everyday which last 1-2 seconds and could be anywhere ln the head.

Just looking for some advice please and thank you."
318,2,"Hey guys,

I have an immense fear of death — to the point that it’s honestly debilitating. (Tips welcome too!)
It really spiraled after a terrifying flight I had back in January.

Watching the news has never been helpful, since so much of it revolves around tragic events and deaths. And now I have a flight coming up (Spain to Switzerland), and I’m absolutely terrified — especially after hearing about the Air India crash.
Just to be clear: I’m not trying to make that tragedy about me — not at all. But it really spooked me.

I AM TERRIFIED.

I’m flying with Iberia, which is a very safe airline, and I know my fear is irrational… but I just can’t shake it.

People always say, “Why me?”
But honestly — why not me?
We tend to get desensitized to these things because we think, “That’s never going to happen to me.” But I bet the people boarding that flight thought the same thing.

I really don’t want to cancel the trip 😔

Any tips on how to deal with this kind of fear?

TIA"
319,2,"So I've been trying to interact with people online, I started playing a little bit of garry's mod, but I panic when trying to speak or chat. The same happens with discord servers, or any other platform for that matter. It's been years since I've made any effort to interact with others, so I guess I can't really help it, does anyone have conversations online? How do you manage the fear and not quit?"
320,2,"I have been having these symptoms for the past few days and it is more tiring than my actual job.
*Heavy shoulder/chest area
*Tight muscles (mostly shoulders/back)
*Irregular heartbeats (slow or fast) - and I always convinced myself I am having a heart attack
*Deep breathing difficulty (feels like something if blocking my airway)
*Insomnia (sometimes 3 to 4 hrs. of sleep only)
*Hyperacidity
*Sweating

I know this is typical symptoms for panic attacks but I can't seem to stop myself from being scared and feeling like I would die early. I've been experiencing these on and off for about 5 years now and facing it hasn't been that easy for me. Hopefully people who will read this that are experiencing these as well will find the distraction we need and the healing we all deserve."
321,2,"I am on medication for my anxiety and OCD. It works, and my counselor and I are pleased with the results and progress I’ve made. I feel stable when I take my medicine as directed and I’ve learned coping mechanisms that bring me back if I’m having a really bad episode. 

Past 2.5 days were rough. Saturday night I had trouble sleeping. I jolted awake and started yelling and swearing, thinking someone was in my bedroom. First time in months I’ve had a hypnagogic hallucination. I fell asleep shortly afterwards. 

Sunday, I felt on edge all day. I was tired from not sleeping well the night before. I had a weird tingling in my feet and hands, as if I was standing on a cliff with no rails. I couldn’t wait to get home to my own house by myself in the evening, to my “safe place.” I felt the need to begin writing work to-do lists and think about work stuff late Sunday night into Monday morning. 

Monday morning, I felt physically sick from the anxiety. My whole body was tingling and I felt nauseous. I had what I think was a panic attack and threw up in the bathroom. My mind was racing and I had 100 thoughts at once, while being terrified of forgetting or neglecting one of the “important” thoughts. 

I go into work, crying in the car. My boss is a tyrannical, fault-finding jerk to my team and me and I’m trying to keep a stiff upper lip. Work is a major source of my anxiety and a lot of it is brought on by my boss. 

I’m searching for jobs now, but the market is slow. I’ve sent in a few applications to no avail and even got a certification in a software relevant to my new opportunities of interest. I feel trapped right now. I feel stuck with a bully boss and unable to easily find a new opportunity. I want to avoid being unemployed/having a gap in my resume if possible. 

Also my grandparents are slowing down and struggling with their health. They are immunocompromised and very unsteady. I worry about them a lot suddenly getting sick, or falling and getting hurt in their house. 

Sorry for the long post. Just need to hash some stuff out and feel heard. 

TL;DR - I’m struggling with physical symptoms of anxiety brought on my tyrant boss, and elderly grandparents. "
322,2,"Anyone here have experience with all three of these? I'd love some advice on this! But first, some background:

Traditionally, I have really intense general anxiety - racing thoughts, crawling tingly skin, mild paranoia, rushing brain and mouth, but also a nearly insatiable sex drive. We'll come back to that last bit. 

For three years now, I have been on the trio you see in the title - Gabapentin (100mg x 4 daily), Clonodine (0.1mg x 2 daily), and Prozac (10mg x 1 daily). 

I was put on all three at once this time, but I have two past experiences with SSRIs in isolation - Celexa and another time with Prozac (but at 50mg).

On an SSRI alone, I haaaaated it. Completely stunted my personality, and the lens through which I see the world, once very colorful, became so dull and gray. I felt so lethargic and unmotivated. My sex drive vanished. And I felt an emotion that's usually foreign to me a lot more - irritation and anger. And it didn't even help with all of my anxiety-induced body discomfort. 

But this new trio of meds have been fantastic! Especially the newcomers, gabapentin and clonodine. I finally felt soothing calm inside of me. My muscles unclenched, my skin stopped tingling, I've been able to calmly sit still without squirming, my racing thoughts and hyper-speed talking have mostly subsided. It's like I've finally found peace. And I sense almost no negative side effects at all. Almost...

Buuuuut I unfortunately still feel that emotional flatness that cake with SSRIs the past two times. A traumatic experience might not shake me nearly as much, but beautiful positive experiences lack the glow they once had. I'm traditionally a huge romantic and LOVE sexual intimacy, but my interest in both is almost completely absent now. Everything just feels flat and dull. The stakes feel lower in every aspect, so to speak. 

And I'm no longer okay with feeling this way. After a lot of self-reflection, working on other aspects of myself that can increase energy and libido (exercise, for instance), and even introducing Cialis to the mix, it still feels like there's something in the way that's blocking me from feeling my full range of emotions, feelings that once came to me naturally and easily. It dawned on me the other day that I haven't actually cried in over a year. When I try, I just dry sob, and it's like the catharsis that comes from the emotional release just never comes. It's like emotional constipation. 

So ANYWAY - that all leads me to now, and my consideration of rolling back Prozac slowly over the next two months. From 10mg to 5, from 5 to 2.5, and the down to 0.

I feel like this should resolve my issue, right? Get the SSRI out of the way so I can set my heart, my enthusiasm, and my sex drive free again. 

I know Clonodine and Gabapentin csn also dampen these things down a bit too, but like, it's less-so, right? Gaba and Clono both made an immediate positive impact on my life, and I want to keep those. But will removing Prozac alone, even while still on the other two, bring back a bunch of the negative side effects from when my anxiety was unmedicated? Would raising the dose on these two help make up for it? I am on a low dose of both. 


TLDR, can Gabapentin and Clonodine alone manage anxiety very effectively, even without an SSRI helping out? Beyond the withdrawal period, do I have anything to worry about? Or am I setting myself up for a lot of hurt? Should I just stay put and accept that feeling a little dead inside is worth it?"
323,2,"I literally cannot pee in a public bathroom when there are other people  (I'm female btw). I've talked to my therapist about it, and I've come to the conclusion that it's because I have a fear of being perceived, and so my bladder just stops working whenever I hear footsteps, talking, or even someone breathing. This issue has caused me to have to run around buildings to try to find an empty bathroom, which would cause me to get recurring UTI's. Update: My pelvic floor is deteriorating by the day. I've done breathing exercises, listened to music, texted on the toilet, to try to drift my mind off, but nothing works. I could literally feel as if I'm about to burst out 20 gallons of pee out of my body, but then somebody walks in and it's like I've been clogged up. If anybody else has experienced having a shy bladder like mine, and has overcame this fear, please give me tips. Thanks. "

325,2,"So with everything going on in the work right now in the world, I think I can confidently say that I’m fucking terrified of everything that’s going on. I genuinely can’t think straight with everything on the news and on social media and I don’t think I’m gonna be able to sleep tonight because of how scared I am. I’ve been verging a panic attack all day and I don’t want to not wake up tomorrow due to what is supposedly happening tomorrow I’m scared and I just want everything to stop. "

328,2,"I voluntarily left a job because I couldn't manage my anxiety and hold out until I got ""used to it"". This isn't the first time I've done it. The roles I've been in were very reactive if that makes sense - very people-facing, so I'm always anticipating when the next email or phone call about an issue will come up. 

With the current job market and my attempts to find mentally ""easier"" work, it's been taking a toll on me. I recently learned you can be burnt out from job searching itself - how lovely... I've been cycling between anxiety and depression, sad that I'm well into adulthood  and feel like I can't move on with the rest of my life without a job i.e. move out, start dating, or just be a normal functioning adult. But then when I do have a job, I am crippled with so much work anxiety that I can't even function normally either. 

I even went so far in putting an application at the library - I'm not throwing shade at library positions at all. I don't have any experience in libraries and just thought the type of work (shelving books for the position I applied for) would help me reset if I got the job. Despite potentially being perceived on the outside to family and friends that I've dumb downed or, as the title says, hit rock bottom. But I do feel that I have - I can barely think properly on some days, can't really concentration, haven't done things I've enjoyed. 

I lost myself and feel like I keep losing in the battle with anxiety despite trying to manage it, going to therapy, etc. I actually think I won't land the next job. How do I get out of the tight grip that anxiety has on me? 

Thanks for reading."
329,2,So a couple of months ago (3-4) one night i started having chest pain when i layed down to sleep. It was getting worse and it literally felt like my heart was going to stop. And i suddenly started to feel dizzy and my body started shaking as if im having a shock. I called the er and well they very simply told me its anxiety or stress and that its normal etc etc. Its been 4 months now and every night when i lay down to sleep it starts. I cant even watch videos of people talking about heart problems cuz my anxiety just BLASTS to the roof. I need some advice or any help please to what i can do to make it better. (Btw ive done every check up ok my heart and blood and everything is alright i only had my iron a bit low which ive been taking medication) some other symptoms would be that i feel very dizzy at times and honestly it feels exactly like a heart attack. Its super scary. I would appreciate any help.

What can I do before bed to lessen these panic attacks?
334,2,"For the past couple of months, I’ve been having a really hard time managing anxious thoughts. These thoughts kind of hijack my brain — like they take over and mess with how I think or function or even how often I want to go out, especially in public.

Sometimes before, I used to try to manage it by consciously shifting my attention — music, journaling the thought for later, or thinking about something else (even if it was weird or random) just to break the loop, even though it was tough. That used to help a bit.

But lately, I haven’t even been able to *do* that. It has been hard for me and for some reason, I have started to hate it and become lazy for it. I just feel mentally stuck. Too lazy or too overwhelmed to redirect my mind or write anything down. I know the tools, I just can’t really seem to *use* them anymore. And it’s starting to affect my mental sharpness and confidence when I’m around people, which I hate.

Just wondering if anyone else has hit this kind of wall — where the coping tools stop working, and the anxiety loops keep running. What helped you climb out of that?

Any input or shared experiences are appreciated."
335,2,"I (32f) wake up in the morning and it's right off to the races. All day I get palpitations and shaking, drained. just feel very off. I don't know how to describe the feeling other than I don't have the energy to try and my insides feel like they were left in the oven for to long. I take my med. I don't drink anymore caffeine. I won't touch drugs. I'm doing everything I'm supposed to, yet it feels like a losing battle. ""Your bloodwork and ekg are just fine."" Then why is my heart actively running like an unsupervised 4 year old? And what am I to do about the burnt crust that has become my insides?"
336,2,"Hi, 

Sometimes it feels like I'm running in circles in my head. Usually it's because I don't know how to do something or I'm uncertain about things. It feels like I'm always thinking about 'what the best way to do X is' or ' should I say Y or Z' or 'what if this affects A' and 'I'm not sure how B would do this', etc. 

This often occurs at work and considering the fact that my work is measured by productivity, this kind of overthinking does not really work well in my favour. I could easily spend 10 minutes typing a, what ends up to be, 1 sentence email for example. 

Sometimes it feels as if I really have a headache from (over)thinking that much, but that may or may not be my imagination. 

Not really sure if this fits here, but I'm just trying to see what kind of behaviour this is.

  
Thanks in advance.

337,2,"I recently went to my doctor to ask about an event I had that I thought was high blood pressure. Everythign came back normal and I said that it might've been a panic attack, but instead of evaluating me or providing over resources she prescribed me Sertraline. I've been holding off on taking them because everytime I would go to her with a problem she would immediately prescribe me medications. I'm not sure if I should take the Sertraline, and I'm trying to find therapy that takes my insurance. When my panic attack and my anxiety was through the roof, I was in school, but now I'm on breaka and feel better. Should I still try the meds even though I feel okay?"
338,2,"Hey all, sorry if im posting this at the wrong place, but heres a little something i wrote: a few perspectives, facts and insights into death for those afraid of death or having death anxiety

-

The worst thing about death anxiety is how its just a way to misunderstand death. It is completely understandable for an intelligent being like a human to feel trapped within the thought of inevitable death, which will ""one day meet us all"". 

Think about your age for a second.

You’ve most likely seen those videos of people holding a small calendar, showing how short human life appears to be, trying to create motivation through fear and panic. This paradox is deeply false.
Try this: stare at a wall for 10 minutes. Whether you completed it or not, you may have noticed that it’s really long time. Long enough to make you bored, multiplie times.
And if you didn’t try at all caught you there.
Out of those 10 minutes, we tend to have over 4,200,000 of those in the span of 80 years.

Another thing:

there’s already an illusion happening, seen in people far older than us.
Lets say your grandma is 60 years old.
If we’re for example 15 Years old, it means that in our reality we’ve only existed for 15 years (obviously ik).
That creates the illusion that life goes by in a blink, since they seem to age rapidly fast in our reality. The truth is they've the amount that our life is, multiplie times already.

The thing itself

Which is death. Is often imagined wrong too.
It’s actually the most natural event in all of existence.
A pathway - to most likely continue our being with those we’ve loved after its time to go.
Just like birth, its a doorway to existance.

Life is extremely long, filled with millions of emotions, activities, chances, U-turns, and countless unexpected events.

It is, at its core, so beautiful and unpredictable that no one knows what will happen next - even though all roads still lead to love and peace."

342,2,"Which is better for anxiety, I’ve taken Ativan for over a year but it’s no longer effective. I switched to Clonazepam because it lasts longer and I want to taper"
343,2,"Had my first panic attack in months last night and it really threw me. I’ve been dealing with panic disorder for about three years, but I’ve actually been doing pretty great lately, no big attacks, just the usual little anxious moments here and there. I haven’t taken a rescue med in like half a year.

This one came out of nowhere. One minute I was fine, the next I was spiraling. Heart racing, totally convinced something was seriously wrong. I had a bad headache and I was nauseous and throwing up. Even though I knew what it was, it still hit so hard. My brain kept convincing me something was really wrong, even though I logically knew exactly what it was. And now today I’ve got that weird post-panic embarrassment. Even though I know it’s not something to be ashamed of, it’s still a thing.

I couldn’t pinpoint a specific trigger, but honestly, there’s been a lot going on lately, big life changes, stress, general chaos. So I guess it was just kind of waiting to bubble over. I was also on the last day of my vacation, and I was supposed to go back into the office today. It’s just been a lot of everything. And I did end up working from home today, I am grateful for a good boss.  

The upside is, I got through it. Took my rescue med, went to sleep at my parents house because it makes me feel safe, and have a really good night sleep once I was able to relax. I feel 100% better this morning and no major side effects.

Panic attacks are so wild, the way they hijack your whole system and then leave like nothing happened. Just wanted to share in case someone else needed to hear that it really does pass, and you’re not alone in how weird and intense it feels. I always remind myself when it’s happening and it never really clicks, but the day after always reminds me that it really is temporary, it can actually hurt you, and you’re so strong for getting through it. ♥️"

346,2,"Hi, i've suffered from what i've always thought was anxiety for over 20 years. recently a doctor asked me if i had been assessed for ADHD, i said i hadn't and after a few questions she referred me to be assessed.

From this topic https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/uk0du9/constantly_having_conversations_in_my_head_it/

[code]My mind never shuts up. I constantly have conversations with myself or imaginary conversations with people in my life (therapist, friends, doctor, etc.) Generally I’m explaining things to them in these conversations, like rationales for why I did a certain action or have a certain opinion. I almost never even have these converations in reality[/code]

I've been on citalopram for 18 years and along with reading many books and watching a billion youtube video on anxiety i've managed to reduce my fears and constant feeling of being anxious quite a lot but the thoughts in the head and not being able to relax are still bad.

How did you know it was anxiety and not ADHD?"
347,2,"Hi, I am a 21 F, i’m currently laying in my bed with my heart racing. I am 99% sure it is just anxiety, and i am just on the verge of having a panic attack. I even checked my heart rate (I wear an apple watch) and it is completely within the range of normal so i know deep down that my heart isn’t actually “racing” or going faster than normal. But it makes me so nervous that I’m going to ignore something and not get help in time, what if there is one day something significantly wrong with me and I dismiss it as anxiety until it is far too late? I have a tendiency to focus on health conditions ( like stroke, meningitis, brain tumor etc) and it doesn’t help that my anxiety causes physical symptoms as well, Any advice would be appreciated "
348,2,I think warehouse jobs would be perfect for me while I deal with my anxiety relating to being around people and customer facing but it’s so difficult. I think offices are fine because it’s very limited and in a smaller capacity but that is too difficult to get too
349,2,"I've dealt with social and generalized anxiety for over 10 years. As well as depression & PTSD. It really affects my life. What's your experience with Effexor? Has it helped you? I just got prescribed it today

350,2,So to start this off I really am not a big fan of drinking. I rarely do it at all. I’ve recently got this panic feeling when being in places i can’t escape kind of. I know it’s not the best vice and again i really live a pretty chill life and do not drink when im not in an extra anxious environment. Is it bad to have a couple drinks to chill out if youre going to be doing something you know is going to make you extremely anxious?
351,2,"Hi everyone,

I was recently diagnosed with a somatoform disorder, but I’m not sure if that fully explains what’s happening.

About 7 months ago, I started having symptoms like hyperventilation, tingling and numbness, and heart palpitations. At first, I could manage these and tried to keep going with my life. But after a while, I said “fuck it” and tried to live normally again.

Shortly after that, my ear problems got much worse — severe tinnitus, TTTS (ear spasms), and hyperacusis (sound sensitivity) started. This triggered a huge increase in anxiety and stress, making everything feel overwhelming.

My first symptoms began right after a long, stressful home situation finally ended. It felt like my body crashed once there was calm, and since then, symptoms have just gotten worse.

Other symptoms I deal with now:
•	Constant shaking, especially my lower jaw
•	Neck pain and pounding in the back of my head
•	Numbness in face, arms, and legs
•	Heart palpitations and deep exhaustion

Because of the constant tension and pounding, I can never fully relax.

Some things have improved a bit, but overall the last 7 months have been really debilitating.I’m not sure if my ear symptoms are mostly physical, mostly stress-related, or a mix they seem to feed into each other.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Would love to hear your thoughts or advice.

Thanks for reading,

I know that most of it is because of my anxiety, especially about food and that something could go wrong and give me acne. My diet is very restrictive and I add things little by little. I had studies done and I am perfectly healthy. I have a question, for example, if I eat canned tuna every day, the next day I have a little diarrhea or the same day my stomach grumbles and gas. My question is, to verify that I have anxiety, if the day I eat tuna I take an anti-anxiety medication and nothing happens that day and the next day nothing should happen to me?

When the doctor walked in my heart was racing and my dpdr felt really intense, then he started asking me questions about my throat and i suddenly started feeling really confused by his questions and was hard to answer his questions cuz i felt so confused and couldnt think straight. I then started just panicking thinking i was losing my mind, i felt confused about everything that was going on, my mom and the doctor started talking and all their voices were just distorted and then i layed back with my heart racing and shortness of breath and still confused and my mom was looking worried so i was like i have to be dying or losing my mind theres no other explanation i started feeling like i was stuck and couldnt move and i quite literally felt like i was dying. I thought my time had come and i was terrified, the doctor then left the room to give me space and my mom reasured me that i was okay and wasnt dying, i was calming down cuz my mom was helping me. When the panic was over i felt like i was dead and this is the afterlife and my dpdr was really intense. I got through it though but i cant accept that this was just a panic attack, it was more intense than any other panic attack ive had. Like what if that was a siezure or something idk. Maybe i was just overwhelmed by finally leaving the house cuz i chronically isolate myself from the world.

Am I weak for saying I can't take another depressive episode again? "
363,2,What works for you. Past few days have been really bad. 
364,2,"Hi everyone,

I’ve never really posted something like this before, but I’m hoping that sharing my story might help someone else feel less alone — and maybe give me some relief too.

Around August 2024, my life flipped upside down.

It started when I went to get a routine checkup and got a *false* diagnosis of high blood pressure. That one moment sent me into a spiral. I became hyper-aware of my body. Every heartbeat, every twitch, every sensation turned into a potential sign of something seriously wrong. I developed this intense, almost obsessive fear of dying or having some undiagnosed condition. What followed was a full-blown descent into health anxiety and panic disorder.

Since then, I’ve had an overwhelming list of symptoms — some real, some (I now know) driven by anxiety:

* Constant dizziness, tinnitus, and ear pressure
* Chest pain, palpitations, and numbness in my arm
* Muscle spasms, burning sensations, twitching, and ""electric"" feelings in my body
* Shortness of breath, tension in my neck and jaw
* Sudden heat waves, cold sweats, pins and needles
* Visual disturbances, like dark spots or blurry vision
* Digestive issues, fatigue, joint pain, even facial numbness

And worst of all — **the fear**. That constant, gnawing dread that *this time*, it might not be anxiety. That maybe something *is* really wrong. That I’m just one moment away from collapsing.

Every time I tried to check my blood pressure, I'd trigger a panic attack. My brain linked the cuff itself to danger. I avoided doctors because of the fear they’d confirm my worst nightmare. Ironically, this fear of being sick has probably made me feel *sicker* than anything ever has.

I’ve seen a psychologist who diagnosed me with generalized anxiety disorder. I’ve done tests like ECGs and everything came back fine. But my body doesn’t believe it. It feels like I’m stuck in fight-or-flight mode 24/7. I’ve gone through months where every day felt like survival.

I'm now trying to recover. I’ve reduced smoking (which I used to rely on for stress), I’m reading more about the mind-body connection, and I’m trying to trust the process — but some days are harder than others. It’s lonely. People around me often don’t understand how *real* this feels.

If you’ve read this far, thank you. I just needed to let this out. If you’ve gone through something similar, I’d love to hear how you cope or what helped you the most. I know I’m not alone — but it still feels like it sometimes.

Sending love to anyone else battling with health anxiety right now. You're not broken. You're not crazy. You're just scared — and that’s okay."
365,2,"Hello i just saw my doc today. I talked about lexapro and that i wanted to be prescribed to me. She said that paxil will be better for me as i have generalized anxiety but she wasn't against prescribing me lexapro she said ""we can try if you want to"" i replied ""you're my doctor  you know better i trust you."" she said ""okay then we'll try paxil"" and i talked about coming off that drug she said that it won't be a problem, and i've talked about how you can gain weight on this she said that a lot of people are on it and don't take 1pound and she said that if i dont tolerate it well we could always switch to another one. And ofc she said that i should combine this with therapy."
366,2,"Im experiencing daily anxiety and low mood literally from waking up, my lifestyle has changed a lot, cannot wait for this to end, I run every other day and go on walks inbetween. Will this eventually stop ? 38 days is a long time, it’s draining the life out of me. Would love to hear your stories for hope"
367,2,"27M here. A little over two months since I was promoted to be in charge of a massive project and it’s been the worst two months ever. I dealt with the passing of my grandfather in April, and for the project I’m completely alone. If I take a day off, nobody else knows enough to keep it moving. My chest is killing me as I get ready to leave. I’m the middle man on everything and I’m always the one getting berated for stuff not going to plan. It just makes me so sad and defeated that my best isn’t good enough. We recently hired an office person to help me, but I was never trained properly and now I have to train this person on stuff I don’t have a full understanding of. 

I just want to cry. This disorder has me fully in its grasp and I don’t know what to do. I want to tell my work im struggling but Im worried they’ll use it against me. I don’t have any vacations planned for the summer to look forward to, no big plans. Im just a cog in the wheel that never stops. I’m spiraling and burnt out already. Weekends rarely provide relief. I don’t sleep and I barely eat. 

If anyone has any advice or has dealt with anything similar I’d love to hear. "
368,2,Hey y'all I just wanted to ask how long did Paxil take to work for you. I stopped Zoloft in favor of Paxil because I couldn't handle the increased anxiety but it's been a week and I'm not really feeling any better. How long did it take to work for you? Should I go back to Zoloft and just white knuckle the initial anxiety? I'm also afraid if I go back to Zoloft it won't work but it might just be my own anxiety talking.
369,2,I’m not someone who has ever really had anxiety before. But for some reason as of recently i start having bad anxiety during the nighttime and i’m not sure what has triggered it. I feel like something or someone is waiting for me in dark corner or get scared from the smallest creak sounds or any sound thinking it someone trying to break in or something else. I’ve never been scared like this before and it’s mainly during the nighttime or whenever i’m alone in the house. During the night sometimes i feel like there’s someone upstairs already or walking up the stairs when everyone’s asleep just things like that. I’m not sure how to get myself back to normal. I also just have the urge to get out of the house where there’s sunlight or with people cause i don’t want to be alone.
370,2,"I figured out recently why I get so anxious after something good.

I know my anxiety will come back, so I get anxious to prepare for it. But surprise, I'm never prepared and I'm always just as shocked and scared and feeling unable to handle it regardless. But knowing it'll come again stresses me more.

Does anyone have advice/tips? I've been recommended some form of exposure therapy - to discomfort and stress but not sure how."
371,2,"I have made music off and on for about 15 years now. I always had trouble sticking with composing once I started due to ADHD most of the time, so I would go years between making anything significant because that energy would kinda fizzle out.

Long story short, this past September, I was able to get the programs and plugins I needed to create the music I have always wanted to create. Then I was able to set things up in templates in order to cut down on a large majority of the repetitive things that would drain my attention span. This started a hyperfocused creative boom for me and I finished a full album from scratch in about 6 weeks. I released it this past February and decided I would take a break for awhile. The past couple months I've started work on my next album, not much to show for it as of right now.

So now that I don't have an ""excuse"" as to why I am not making something, on my more depressive or bad days, I feel this urgency to work on music. Not in any kind of fun or inspirational way. It's almost like guilt, I feel guilty for doing anything else other than working on music, even necessary things like my job or household chores. I believe part of me might be trying to make up for lost time, and I think another part of me thinks that I'm going to lose my ability to make things or it's going to escape me in some way. 

I don't make any money of off it, I do it for my own enjoyment and to share with friends. So I don't really understand why I feel so much anxiety around this. For me, anything I've ever made that I have been happy with are from ideas that just come to me on my good days when I don't try to force it. There isn't much of a decision to make something, it just kind of happens in my head and then I try to bring it out. On my bad days, nothing really comes to me, and if it does, I tend to be overly critical of it and shoot it down, feel bad about myself, then I start trying to force more ideas and the cycle continues.  In my head, I know that ideas will come when they come, but it doesn't stop that visceral feeling of something breathing down my neck to create.

  
I'm going to bring this up at my next therapy appointment, but I wanted to see if anyone else hear deals with that, and if so what has helped you? "
372,2,"I used to get a lot of panic attacks and I was sent to the doctor, he said it's an anxiety attack and told me to get an MRI and eECG lol "
373,2,So I was just scrolling through videos on my phone and came across a video talking about the doomsday clock. I am now absolutely terrified. After a quick google search it is apparently a metaphor but I still can't stop freaking out. It's currently 89 seconds till midnight on the clock and I'm on the edge of a panic attack. I really don't know whether I should actually be worried about this or not?
374,2,"Been all all different meds the last 18 months. Currently on Vyvanse for my ADHD & binge eating, propranolol for anxiety, lexapro for depression and a mood stabilizer. I also go to therapy. I feel a bit better than I did months ago when I couldn’t function. I don’t feel good though. Still have anxiety, irritable, sad , crying for no reason, overwhelmed & exhausted. I don’t know what else there is I’ve tried everything. I have motivation to get my work done & sometimes housework. My self care isn’t the greatest but I try hard with it.

376,2,"Hi, I'm a 20 year old girl. I think I'm dealing with anixety ever since 17, I haven't been diagnosed or anything. But i constantly worry sometimes. I worry a lot abt things I don't have control over. If anything bad at all happens, even a minor thing, my mind gets stuck over that and imagine what are all the negative consequences that will follow through that event. I have recently had some health issues, nothing major though. But it made my anxiety very bad, i keep on focusing abt the future medical emergencies I have and my family will have. Like I'm gonna lose them even though they are healthy now. but I worry about the day someday in the future where I will lose them. I know living in the moment is the answer but its hard. Please give me some advice."
377,2,"I've been taking 20mg twice a day of propranolol for about 6 months now and it has honestly done absolute wonders on my anxiety. My doctor and I suspected POTS prior to him prescribing it for me because I'd have random panic attacks episodes brought on by my heart randomly flying through the roof so my journey has definitely been tough. 

The only set back/concern of mine is since starting it, I have had such an insanely hard time getting out of bed in the morning. For the first few hours of the day, I almost feel drunk with tiredness and even doze off while sitting upright at my work desk. I wonder if anyone else has experienced this at all? I’m also pretty low on vitamin d and ferritin which I know from the past (chronic for both) has contributed to my fatigue, but never to the point where I'd not even stir with my alarms. It used to be that when my alarm rang, I'd be straight up in seconds so this is definitely a huge change for me. I also for the first few weeks thought that it might just be my body adjusting to the med keeping my heart rate low and steady, but as I mentioned we are at the 6 month mark and nothing has changed ;/

Any suggestions for this? I will absolutely not consider stopping it because it has been many years since I've got a week, let alone a month without multiple panic attacks!"
378,2,"Hello everyone, this is kind of hard for me to talk about, lately been having an increase in being able to swallow foods. I don’t remember what happened for me to get to this point, I’ve never had anxiety like this before. Whenever I eat, I have this thing where I feel like I’m going to choke and I get panicked to the point where I feel like the food is expanding and my throat isn’t relaxed enough to be able to handle the food going down. I usually try to eat softer foods now and can’t enjoy any of the foods I love. Some meals are fine, other meals are horrible. Does anyone have any tips, tricks or recommendations to combat this?

380,2,"Hey, has anyone else weened off of quetiapine and gotten past the brainfog ? I’ve been on and off it for years, I was on 50mg instant release for 2-3 years and almost a month ago and a half ago I went down to 25mg. 

I’m still having such severe brain fog, I feel like I can’t think and there’s a mind body disconnect. I’m really struggling, waiting to see psychiatrist, I’m possibly meant to start fluoxetine again after a few years for my anxiety, we think adhd exacerbates my anxiety, but I’m also worried adding more meds to the mix when I feel I still haven’t adjusted after the quetiapine. Like more mess on top of mess. We are also wondering to trial non stimulants for adhd but same thing. I also have OCD and extreme anxiety. I was originally put on seroquel for bipolar symptoms but we believe it was more likely drug induced psychosis, as I was using at the time and haven’t had any symptoms like that since. We are exploring ASD diagnosis. 

I’m just looking for hope about weening off quetiapine cos I really don’t like how it makes me feel physically and mentally, and really struggling with this withdrawal. I can’t tell if I should go back up and struggle with how much I hate that or risk going to a lower dose or fully off. I also have ME/CFS. And a bunch of other investigating health issues that I wonder quetiapine has been adding to. Just struggling hella right now, hopeless vibe. Any hope for weening off seroquel and helping brainfog will be really really appreciated. I won’t make any changes to medication without consulting psychiatrist just looking for advice and hope. I’m posting this in a few groups if you see it a few times, apologies. Thanks

TLDR I weened from 50mg instant release to 25mg instant release a month and a half ago, after 2-3 years being on 50mg instant release consistently, still have very severe brainfog after a month and a half. Anyone else had this ? When does it end ?

381,2,"I'm 22F  5'3, 99 pounds. I was getting sudden palpitation last week where my heart feel like it's racing. Not only pounding fast but also turbo racing and I'd sweat and panick and wait it out. Today this episode happened 3 TIMES in one day. I thought i was literally dying so I went to the ER where they did EKG, blood tests (heart enzymes) and clotting test. They said they found nothing wrong, in fact my results show that I'm great and said It could just be dehydration.

The problem is. (Which i explained it to them) is that when I get this palpitation episode. It happens suddenly while im chilling and it takes a long time to calm down, and even after it calms down IF I WALK JUST A COUPLE STEPS or do the minimalistic move the palpitation comes back even after resting. And im just stuck of endless loop of not being able to walk or do anything cuz then my heart will start pounding and be in pain.

What do I do? What could this be? Also I like coffee but I dont drink it too much. It never gave me any issues.

Idk if this info helps or not but I work as a fast food cook where in weekends it gets so hectic and exhausting. And during work I never get the episode. Weird right? But when I'm home chilling with no exercise it hits me suddenly. 

My wife suggested it could be PTSD and anxiety.  Anyone here relate to my story?"
382,2,Stimulant use and am now really panicky and scared
383,2,Im desesperated not other SSRI worked for me 
384,2,"My psychiatrist prescribed my guanfacine but I'm worried about its effect on blood pressure. Apparently it lowers blood pressure. There was one time my blood pressure was low at a doctor visit, but that was only once. 

I'm wondering, since you're not supposed to stop the medicine all at once, what happens if it lowers my BP too much? Is it still safe to stop completely if I'm fainting? 

I always think of worst case scenarios, so for this one, I'm thinking what if my BP gets so low that I faint and then I have to stop the medicine and then I get bad side effects from doing that and so on... this is why I haven't started anxiety medicine yet, because I get too anxious about side effects, lol"
385,2,"Alright, I’m going to be real. Anxiety has been my constant companion for as long as I can remember. It’s like that annoying friend who shows up uninvited, talks way too much, and doesn’t know when to leave. At first, I thought I had to kick it to the curb, fight it off, do whatever I could to make it disappear. But here’s the plot twist: I learned to live with it. And trust me, it’s a lot less exhausting.

I stopped trying to “fix” my anxiety and started to accept it as part of my life like, okay, you're here again, fine. You’re loud, you’re relentless, but you’re not the boss of me. Anxiety can still pop up at the worst times like when I’m getting ready to speak in front of a group or when I'm doing something that requires focus... but here’s the thing: I keep going anyway. Sure, it’s uncomfortable, but I’ve realized it doesn’t have to stop me.

Here’s what I’ve discovered anxiety doesn’t control me. It’s there, like a pesky roommate who never does the dishes, but that doesn’t mean I let it dictate my whole day. I’ve learned to coexist with it. I’ve found my rhythm, my own little toolbox of tricks to take the edge off breathing exercises, quick walks, or even just jamming out to some tunes to give myself a breather.

And you know what? I still do the things that scare me. Yeah, anxiety’s tagging along for the ride, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to stop living my life. I’ve stopped waiting for it to magically disappear because spoiler alert: it won’t. But I’ve figured out that I don’t need to wait for it to leave to take action, to thrive, to do anything.

If you're stuck in that constant cycle of trying to push your anxiety away try something different. Give it a nod, tell it “I see you,” and then keep moving. Anxiety might be a loud, annoying passenger, but it's not the driver. You are. 💪💙"
386,2,"So I (26F) recently started buspirone and I’m noticing symptoms in first few days. Is this normal? Have you experienced this and does it go away?
-I’ve got the shakes, like twitching, more like shivering, but larger more obvious movements. Mainly upper body (shame because of shoulder pain) and minor in legs. 
- My heart is pounding and my watch has noticed an uptick (130’s compared to typical 60-90) in HR since starting dose and within the hour of taking it. I only feel my heart pounding within the first 2-3 hrs but dies down alongside the hot flashes. 
-Headaches 
-Some chest pain too, nothing crazy but it feels tight. 
-I’m also craving salt, insatiably, not even thirsty just craving salt-historically, I’ve hated salty things so it’s weird. 
-There’s more like nightmares and brain fog, but I’m not too worried about those.. 

I take adderall XR, lamotrigine, and Trintellix daily and for years -17, 8, & 1.5 respectively. I’m VERY sensitive to medications. Within the first few days to first week I always experience symptoms. The only anxiety medication that has worked was clonazepam but I stopped cold turkey after moving with no adverse effects. It’s impossible to get benzodiazepines nowadays even if they were successful.. I digress. I’ve tried every anxiety medication under the sun but they have all led to either psychosis, serotonin syndrome, increased anxiety, or extreme lethargy (in the case of a barbiturate prescription).

Are the symptoms I’m experiencing typical with others that take it?

387,2,"Maybe it's not anxiety at all!!! I'm not sure anymore, but I'm hoping it may shed some light on it!!!! 

This really isn't the first time I've experienced it, but it seems like every time I get up early enough to start doing housework, I kinda start my morning usually with a cup of coffee (if I have coffee sugar and creamer) and a cigarette, or maybe some type of energy drink, or whatever to drink to start my morning. I will usually have the radio on and sometimes I usually start making a to do list (and to put the ones I want to either get out of the way, or the easiest first) depends on my mood about certain things. Idk but sometimes it triggers something almost drastic that I don't want to have to hear or deal with later..... And for most of the day Im (I guess arguing with myself) going back n forth, to the point I'm almost curled up in the fetal position; bedroom or living room mostly...,. I have no idea how to get passed it and just jump in head on! This also includes if I have to make phone calls or to the store or whatever...  Help! "

Wasp or a Tick bite

I’m scared of something I might not have

Suddenly I am scared that I have Alpha Gal syndrome even though I think a wasp not a lice got me

And even though this happened to me several days ago I started worrying only like 3 to 4 days ago 

I like in an area that has a ton of Lone Star Ticks especially in the Summer and I have read about this Alpha Gal Syndrome thing 

Something got my leg and gave me a rash on it and it hurt until I took some Tylenol and shortly after it stop hurting and it went away 

I’m scared to eat red meat or dairy for awhile 

Or is it just my anxiety over this? 

I wanna go to a doctor and have tests but I am scared of a false positive test "
389,2,"Sometimes when I have severe anxiety or a panic attack I get this weird feeling that I think (?) might be derealization/depersonalization. 

The best way I can describe it is that my soul (for lack of a better word) feels like it’s going to leave my body. 

If you’ve ever been about to fall asleep and your body feels like it starts to float upwards, that’s the best way I can describe it. 

Is this what depersonalization is?

It’s an extremely uncomfortable feeling like you’re about to die or involuntarily pass out. "
390,2,the only way i can get to school is by taking the bus but it always makes me extremely anxious to the point i feel nauseous so i haven’t been in school for the past month. i explained that to my teacher but i still have to keep coming in until july even though it’s impossible for me right now because of how the bus makes me feel. there isn’t any other way for me to get to school. i tried exploring other alternatives with my teacher like working from home but she said i needed to be in. what should i do?
391,2,"Trigger Warning: Discussion of DPDR thoughts and feelings.

I (28M) feel like I can’t take it anymore. I’ve been dealing with these DPDR symptoms for the past 3 weeks and I feel like everyday it’s getting worse or I develop a new symptom. It honestly feels like there is no coming back from this and that I’ve changed my perception of life and existence too much. It’s like the veil over life has been pulled and now I can’t unsee the “truth”. The following are some of the symptoms I’ve been battling:

- being human feels weird and other humans look alien to me.
- afraid to look at my own reflection
- afraid of my own consciousness
- doing ANYTHING that a normal person would do feels strange and foreign
- I feel as if whenever I do any normal human things it’s as if I am conforming to a false way of life or reality
- the idea of going back to being a normal person and being ignorant to these thoughts makes me feel uncomfortable and as if I’m letting a false reality win by tricking me
- even talking and words feel weird. The fact that I can understand and respond to these sounds frightens me.
- constant looping thoughts and hyper awareness of the above

I am working with a therapist and psychiatrist and both have told me this is likely due to my body responding to extreme stress and anxiety. I was diagnosed with GAD and OCD 3 years ago. Recently, I started Zoloft and just had a dose increase from 50 mg to 75 mg a few weeks ago. 

It honestly feels like there is no escape from this and that it’s going to push me towards something I’m going to regret doing. I just want to enjoy life again and experience it how I used to, but in my head I cannot fathom ever returning to it. Idk what to do."

393,2,Been dealing with this for years now. Every time I eat my heart will pound and race for hours sometimes to the point I can’t move and have to lie down even when I’m on 80mg propranolol already. Also have bloating chest pains shortness of breath etc. Had tests done on my heart paid thousands at cardiologists. All tests came back normal and nothing wrong with my heart and they say it’s just “anxiety”. My heart races a lot in general but is always at its worst after I eat. I suspect it may be “roemheld syndrome/gastro cardiac syndrome” but I can’t find any good advice on how to cope with it. I take beta blockers I’m on antidepressants and I take magnesium supplements I don’t drink or smoke or take any recreational drugs. I’m scared to exercise I have cardiophobia aswell I just don’t know what to do anymore doctors don’t seem to know what to do and I’m in therapy. Has anyone else dealt with this and have any advice?

400,2,"Ever since my first panic attack years and years ago I haven't been the same. I used to smoke a lot of weed. One day I (according to the paramedic) was hyperventilating without realizing it and caused pins and needles in both arms and my chest. This caused me to think I was about to experience a major health episode. 

Fast forward to now. I'm weed free, straight edge and in a much better place yet I still struggle with thinking I'm going to have some sort of health episode any day now. My diet isn't great. Not obese but a bit over my healthy weight. If I go to long without sleep I start to freak out. If my heart has a palpitation, freak out a little. Become self aware of my breathing, freak out a little. Weird cold sensation somewhere, you get the idea. 

I'm dealing with this all the time. An overwhelming sense of imanent dread. Some days not at all, some days a handful of times. To the point where I struggle driving even though it has nothing to do with the road or driving safety. I have to keep a water bottle on me at all times as a way of calming down and I'm just feeling so trapped in my head. Does anybody else experience things like this? Is this what anxiety is or is this something else? I've had people describe anxiety so many ways at this point that I don't know what I'm going through anymore. Sorry this is so long to read. Any words of advice or insight are so greatly appreciated. Thank you. "

I have anxiety and especially health anxiety so that always makes things like this worse. For the last three days I’ve had on and off itchiness in both my ears but haven’t been swimming or anything except I went to the lake like over a week ago. No pain no drainage coming from my ears, just the itchiness. But last night which mind you is 4 days out from my trip which is a new experience for me with anxiety all my symptoms are ramping up, I was up all night peeing and my itchy ears are driving me crazy. I have an appointment with my GP next Monday when I get back, he told me basically he thinks it’s anxiety. That my urine culture showed a small UTI that the macrobid should have gotten rid of and it’s not a coincidence it started up so close to my trip.

Like, even the idea of getting a job or doing driving lessons freaks me out. I struggle with even basic stuff sometimes.

It’s not that I don’t want to do things — I do. I just feel like I can’t. And the more time that passes, the worse I feel about it, like I’m falling further behind and disappointing everyone around me. It’s even harder because I mask it so well that people probably just think I’m being lazy.

421,2,"(20f) i've had these cysts for 2 years now in the breasts. already done with ultrasound and biopsy on the biggest lump. core needle biopsy results said it was fibroadenoma.

after two months, i finally had my right breast undergo lumpectomy. they had to put me to sleep, and my stitch was around the nipple instead of under the breast. **although the stitch is smaller than expected, they had to go deeper.**

my recently biopsied cyst (which was diagnosed as fibroadenoma) is bigger than the size of an XL egg, and there are a few small cysts with it kept in a jar the night after the surgery. 

currently, i'm already done on my medications. i sometimes get aches and discomforts, i struggle with my pillows and positions on the bed a lot of times. 

my thoughts? i'm scared that at least one of them is actually cancer. despite lack of family history and my young age, i can't help but cry sometimes. i sometimes imagine myself receiving the news that it's cancer, and that i'm hopeless. we're financially struggling, and i won't be able to deal with the cost of therapies, let alone their side effects. i was already weakening from the lumpectomy itself. 

i just saw some reddit posts of my age (19-20) who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, and i can't help but think that i'll be one of them soon. i'm honestly so scared.

**what if my initial diagnosis from CNB (fibroadenoma) is actually wrong? what if those other cyst could be actually cancer?** i've been dealing with depression and anxiety for months from other life events, and i can't bear to hear bad news. i even stopped from college for now. i honestly don't know what to do with my life.

425,2,"Hi everyone, I hope this post isn’t too long, as I would really like some advice from anyone who can help or at least relate, but I do want to try and give a comprehensive look at my situation. My name is Dan, I’m a 20 year old male and recently panic attacks are starting to mess with my life more and more.

I don’t have panic attacks too often, it’s every few months I think, but they seriously mess me up whenever I have them. It’s very gut-based. I get the most horrible and indescribably dreadful feeling in my gut, and I go lightheaded and every position feels uncomfortable and almost painful. My breath goes rank, and not to be crude but I feel like I’m going to shit my pants (in fact, the need to go to the bathroom seems to bring it on sometimes. Again, I know it’s crude, but it’s what it is) If it gets bad enough, I get pins and needles in my hands and abdomen, and can start to gag or feel like I’m going to throw up. The main problem is where I have panic attacks. I never have them at home, because home is my place of safety I think. I only seem to have panic attacks when I’m on public transport of some kind. My first real experience was on a train that took about an hour, this was a year ago and it changed my life forever it feels. The entire journey was a panic attack. And then about half a year ago, I had a similar experience on the bus on the way to a gig I was playing. I had an extremely intense attack the entire way to the gig (just over an hour in total) and eventually managed to calm down and have a decent night and felt like it was all over. Then, the next day I went to get the train down to the city where I live at and attend university, I did not make it on the train. It was the single most intense experience of my life. All of the symptoms were cranked to 1000. It was unexplainable. My dad thankfully was able pick me up from the station, and I felt immediate relief when I got on the way home. However, I spent the next week practically bed bound in what felt like a depression. I felt like I could never live normally again. I could never get a train or a bus or play a gig or travel anywhere because feeling that experience again was just something I couldn’t handle. Eventually I managed to get through this depressive and anxious state and started living life somewhat normally again.

I should add, I have a huge list in my notes of things to do when feeling an attack. I mainly have a few songs that help me calm down, and I have researched countless breathing techniques and grounding methods and what not. Usually these things can help stop an attack when I’m feeling one coming on, but they have also failed before. Sometimes nothing can stop the attack whatsoever, and I just have to wait until it’s over. Usually it would last about 30 minutes but it has gone on for longer sometimes too.

The thing is, it’s not just about the attacks themselves, it’s about the fear of the attacks themselves as I’m sure you all are familiar with. Even if I don’t have an attack, I feel anxious before doing something significant. I go to a lot of gigs and play in a band, and I almost always feel anxious about having an attack surrounding these gigs. I can no longer even be excited about the idea of playing a new city or something. Any longer than an hour on the train? I just feel like I couldn’t. Recently my band was in talks of playing Northern Ireland (I live in Northern England) and this should’ve been exciting, but all I could think of was “anything but this, I can’t do it” because I know I’d have a horrific attack. I just don’t know what to do anymore, I am young and I want to do things in life and I want to travel to places, but god knows I could never even get near a plane. It feels like I can barely be on a train for an hour, and even then I usually get very anxious especially if I’m not headed to what my body feels is a ‘safe place’ such as my bed back home or something.

I don’t know what’s bringing it on anymore. I don’t get nervous about actually playing gigs and I’m not afraid of accidents on public transport or anything. I just seem to be prone to panic attacks when I’m travelling somewhere, and when I have those attacks I have the absolute need to be back home where I feel safe. I had an attack on the train back to my university the other day. I had no commitment later that day or anything, but I had a horrific panic attack. After about half the journey, I started to feel fine, but I’d had two panic attacks that day as I had attempted to get on the train earlier that day but simply couldn’t. I just don’t know what to do anymore, it’s starting to seriously affect how I’m living my life and what I plan to do in the future. It’s to the point where I’ve considered leaving my band because it’s so bad, but of course that would just send me into a terrible state of depression if I let the anxiety ‘win’ in that way.

I’m sorry if this was too long, I seriously appreciate if anyone has read this far. I just needed to get this out, as I hope some people can relate. Feel free to ask me anything as I didn’t want this post to go on much longer. I just want to know if I can deal with this. Thank you"
426,2,"Hi, I'm 26 years old. Since I was 17, I've been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks, mostly with fears about my heart. I've had EKGs, echocardiograms, blood and urine tests, and everything came back normal. But what worries me the most is something that's been happening every summer for the past 3 years: I get this strange feeling like I’m about to get really sick — muscle pain in my arms and legs, low energy, like a bad flu is coming — but I never actually get sick. Sometimes I feel internal chills while my skin feels normal, and my breath feels hot like I have a fever, but I don’t. Just to be clear — I never had a runny nose or an actual fever during any of this. Also, when I stand for a while, I get an unbearable pain in my legs, like my muscles can’t handle it, even though it doesn’t happen when I walk or run. I also get muscle spasms and tension, especially during anxious periods. I don’t check my blood pressure as much now, but it was usually normal at home, though it would spike at the doctor’s from nerves. I try to distract myself by playing video games or going for runs, but whenever a physical symptom appears, my mind goes straight to fear, thinking it’s something serious. Has anyone else experienced something like this??"

428,2,"This is so silly because usually i comment here for other peoples dental anxiety but now i’m having it

I have to make an emergency appointment today for my tooth - the problem? my dentist is extremely popular for all anxiety patients, she literally has 0 openings until my next appointment 

She knows all my dental problems, never judges, has lovely dental nurses etc and now i’m going to have to see a stranger

I’m so scared, my sister has reassured me they dont judge (she’s a dental nurse) but i feel like they will - my teeth are fucked from never brushing them as a kid or early teen (probably up until 15 tbh) My parents never forced me, i had most baby teeth removed because of decay etc

Istg if my dentist isnt nice !"
429,2,"I have an upcoming flight soon & am so scared and worried. This flight is going to be 12 hours. I hate travelling. Because I fear getting a panic attack in a claustrophobic environment. I have flown many times before, but the past years, my anxiety for traveling gotten a bit worse which has really exhausted me mentally. This year I have a new problem and that is worrying so much that I have a hard time sleeping. Am pacing back and forth. My doctor gave me Propranolol after my last I travelled. I just want to know how much it helps with the anxiety?"
430,2,How to break out of fight or flight? It has been nonstop for days I fear I am losing my mind since I can not calm down. 
431,2,"I have gradually developed severe health anxiety over the last 6ish years. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t feel like myself anymore. I never use to feel stupid, like literally dumb, or worry about sounding like a moron when talking to people. And I’ve never had issues like walking through Walmart and going all derealization on myself. Who is this person? Where’s the strong, independent, capable woman I use to be? Why is this person I am now so convinced that there’s some looming disease just waiting to be discovered at the next doctor appointment?

I just want my life back. "
432,2,"I’m 32, and around 10 months pp I developed these intrusive thoughts that occupied easily 75% of my waking thoughts (that I was going to die, my husband would remarry and my baby would forget me.) I also had horrendous fatigue, heart palpitations, some stiffness, random bouts of crying, and the inability to eat much.

I read that an “impending sense of doom” is a sign of a heart attack in women, so I got checked out. It took a few weeks of some wrong answers (hypoglycemia, heart issues etc), me taking several trips to my doctor and overthinking every little symptom, and feeling steadily worse. Eventually my doctor said he thinks I’ve been having panic attacks. All this time I was fully convinced something was horribly wrong…and it was anxiety?

It’s been 6-7 weeks of lexapro but I am starting to feel somewhat back to normal now. I guess I have a few questions:

1) Is there a way I can tell if it’s post partum anxiety or just general anxiety? I was never diagnosed with anything mental health related prior to this.
2) does it go away eventually or will I need lexapro forever?
3) it feels like the medication isn’t lasting all day (like I have more anxiety at night time?) is that a normal thing? 
4) Would therapy help? The anxiety seems to be mostly focused on my health and me dying.

Edited to add: If my issues weren’t from anxiety (the fatigue and such) would lexapro have made them better? "
433,2,"I tried the breathing techniques and I tried distracting myself and nothing works. I keep trying to find a solution, but I'm starting to think that there isn't one. My anxiety comes from trauma and other mental health stuff. I don't know what to do because it can get pretty intense for me and it's to the point where I will literally start crying because I don't know how to deal with it. 

"
434,2,"Ever since I got bronchitis where my face started feeling like it has hot coal in it, the anxiety started. It’s hard to breathe, and I have intrusive stupid thoughts. When the face pain calms, the anxiety isn’t bad but once it flares again, it starts up. I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this? I feel alone, like I’m the only person who is experiencing this "
435,2,"Hey everyone,

I want to share my full story in case anyone out there has experienced something similar and maybe found a way forward. I’d appreciate any advice or support, even just hearing I’m not alone would mean a lot.

So I’ve been smoking weed on and off for years. I was never a heavy smoker at first, just occasionally with friends or every now and then to chill. I always thought I had strong discipline, that I could never get addicted to anything. I used to be super against regular smoking. But then life got hard.

I lost track of my goals, my routine, and just started feeling… lost. I didn’t know how to face what I was going through, so I started smoking every day. For about 3–4 months straight, I was hitting 95–98% THC pens almost daily. I kind of knew it was a form of escaping and self-medicating, but I accepted it because I didn’t care enough at the time. I figured I’d deal with the consequences later.

Then “later” came fast.

One night, I was home alone, I think I was either really excited about something or just had a bad day, I honestly can’t remember clearly, and I smoked a lot. Way more than usual.

That’s when it hit. I had the worst panic attack of my entire life.

My heart rate shot up to 210 bpm, I had my Apple Watch on, and every time I looked at it, I freaked out more, which made it go even higher. I thought I was actually going to die. The first thought in my head was about my mom, how she’d be without me, how I’d never get to say goodbye. Then I thought of how young I am and how much I haven’t done in life yet. It all came crashing down at once.

For two hours, I was in hell. I felt disconnected, terrified, and totally alone. That night changed me.

Since then, I haven’t touched weed. It’s been about 4 months clean now. I decided I wasn’t going to risk my life, my sanity, or my mental health like that again. I became hyper-cautious about everything. It even made me a better driver. But here’s the thing, the panic didn’t end that night. It just… shifted.

Now almost every night, especially when I try to relax or fall asleep, I get weird symptoms:
My chest feels heavy, Sometimes I feel numb or short of breath, I randomly jolt awake with a shock like I’m dying, I obsessively check my pulse or heart rate, I avoid any content related to death, horror, or even intense emotional stuff because it immediately triggers the anxiety, Even caffeine or melatonin affect me differently now. I used to down 500mg of caffeine before the gym with no issue, now just 200mg makes me feel like I’m dying.
I even had to leave the gym once because I felt like I was going to collapse mid-set.
I talked to my family doctor. He ruled out anything physical and basically said it’s anxiety-related. But honestly, no one around me gets it. I’ve tried explaining to people and it just gets brushed off. Even my dad just kinda looked at me like I was being weird or dramatic. I never believed in therapy and its really expensive where i live, so I’ve just been dealing with it alone, trying to research, learn, and manage it day by day.

I now realize that night on weed triggered a deeper fear that was already there: a fear of death, of losing control, of wasting my life. I don’t feel like the same person anymore,more alert, more fearful, but also more aware of what matters. I guess what I’m asking is…
Has anyone else gone through something similar after quitting weed or after a traumatic panic attack? Does it get better?
How did you start feeling normal again?

Thanks for reading. I’m just trying to find a way back to peace or at least stop living in constant fear of dying.

436,2,"Hi everybody, so I have been off of my anxiety medication for about two weeks now (long story, waiting for it to come back in) and lately I’ve been getting this random feeling where it feels like my body gets “shocked” and I feel like I’ve lost my breath and the wind gets knocked out of me. Not sure if I explained that well, I’ve been also referring to it as how I imagine it would feel if you were a bell that got rung and the feeling is almost like the reverberation?? It only lasts for a second, but it happens fairly often. I’m wondering if this is an anxiety symptom or if anyone has ever had any general experience with something like this."
437,2,"I’m on holiday for the next 10 days and I live with my family & my partner. Recently we had a run in with mice, and it was kind of traumatic for me. 

Everything that was on the bottom floor of my closet was just going to be tossed, but this all happened right before my planned trip so we were able to treat the house & sanitize the area. But all my stuff that was in the bottom was in my opinion contaminated, and was going to the thrown out.

Well I began also putting my belongings in bins to avoid this from ever happening again and my stuff possibly becoming contaminated again. It was all a replacement basically. Well I left for the vacation and my partner just organized everything the way he wanted it moving all my belongings together and mixing them. He never told me he did this and I really had no idea I’ve only been gone for one night. 

It really upsets me because I spent so much money trying to avoid this, I had everything stored away since I was trying to make sure it didn’t get in his way and he still moved everything I own. Idk what to do I’m just so anxious about it now and I feel like it’s ruined the trip for me. "
438,2,"Just that really. SSRIs have really messed up my sex drive and libido when I took them once in the past, and it's not a side effect I'm willing to tolerate. I have pretty bad health anxiety, linked to a health condition I have which comes with a slightly increased cancer risk. Ruminating constantly about worst case health scenarios, obsessively checking skin, seeking constant reassurance, panicking at every small niggle in my body etc. I've read reviews of Buspirone having minimal side effects, and rarely causing sexual side effects. 

  
Any experiences taking it for this?"
439,2,"I have a presentation in religion that I already submitted but I have to present on wednesday or thursday, and i only have until the end of the week, Im scared since the teachers marking on the presentation skills n stuff, I know like i presented okay during our last religion presentation but that was because there wasn’t a lot of students in the class and I was less anxious, any advice? "
440,2,"How do you stop obsessive thoughts? I literally can not stop thinking about my health and the worse case scenario. It's negatively affecting my life to the point where I don't really get out of bed and Google everything I feel, read the worst things and obsess over it. Any advice? "
441,2,"So I am doing some traveling in Africa I’m staying at a hostel. I’ve been here only a couple nights. This morning I woke up with blood smears on the sheets. There was a single blood stain on the pillow where I’d been sleeping, and longer smears under the blanket at the end where my legs lay. I’d been getting bit by mosquitoes a lot, and as most people know, when mosquitoes get full they are big and slow, so there's a chance I just rolled over and killed them in my sleep, then smearing them. The other possibility is bed bugs, which is another conversation entirely. It’s possible these stains were already there before I slept, even the first night, I didn’t thoroughly check the bed, but I do feel like I wouldn’t have missed the blood stain on the pillow. 

However I’ve had a small cut on my leg that is almost fully healed now, but when I first checked in, it was open for sure. my question is, if this isn’t blood from mosquitos bed bugs or insects, is it possible to get a blood infection like HIV or HEP C because I was laying on dried blood, and the cut on my leg potentially could have been exposed? Also, since I was laying on a pillow with a small blood stain, could that of transferred some how on my face? Should I go to the hospital for this? Please let me know, I’m really anxious about it…"
442,2,"Hi guys, 

I have severe muscle tension throughout my body, chest pressure, can't take a full breath. I've been hiding it from my family and ex girlfriend ( we just split up on Saturday) now I need to open up about it as it's getting out of control. I can't think straight I can hardly work. My mind is racing constantly, my muscles have locked up to the point I feel like I can't breath. I've tried diaphragm breathing I've tried yoga. My whome body has gone weak and can feel my heart jumping out of my chest. I've recently started a new job and everything is getting on top of me. I train in the gym but find I'm getting weaker and weaker. I'm currently working with a PT but I feel like I'm dying. Does this seem like normal anxiety? The only reason I feel anxious is because of the physical symptoms. Does this seem like normal anxiety/ panic attacks? 

Thanks to anyone who takes the time out of their day to reply..

443,2,"I feel like I spend every day with a crowd of people screaming in my ear.

Why aren’t you out fixing it?” “One day you won’t exist anymore” “you’re wasting time you don’t have enough time” just constant constant CONSTANT noise and nonsense I have to fight through to have a coherent, non-painful thought.

444,2,"37 y/o female

For the last week I've felt this pain at times in my neck, but couldn't tell where it was coming from.  This morning I realized it's right near my carotid pulse. It feels bruised to touch. I don't recall any injury.  I do have neck/headache issues though, but I've had those my entire life. 

I lay on a shiatsu massager often for my neck.  At first I thought maybe it was from that, but now I realize the location is definitely more in my throat/carotid area.

Is it possible that it's sore from looking down all day at my job or from constantly checking my pulse? I check it all the time because I have anxiety and it races often."
445,2,"I have a week long trip coming up in 2 weeks to visit my family. I want to see them, but I’m unsure if I should go. I’m afraid my anxiety may be too bad for me to handle that atm. I got off anxiety medication 4 months ago, and I’m still rebuilding confidence.

The first issue is the airplane. Even at my best, traveling has been hard. And if my best was a 10/10, atm I’m at a 4/10.

The other issue is a week is just too long. A full week with a bunch of little kids, a lot of family I don’t know, in an unfamiliar place. I think it’s just too much.

I’m a bit worried about reinforcing the fear if I cancel. I’m thinking I should just cancel, and reschedule for a 4 day trip though in a few months. This way it’s not such a long trip, and I don’t feel like I’ve completely chickened out. I just have to make sure I commit to those future plans.

Thoughts?"
446,2,"For context, I am a 29F 116 lbs, I took one pill on Friday night (9pm) because I was feel like my throat was starting to hurt and had some congestion. Woke up at 12:30 in full panic attack mode (my blood pressure spiked, cold/hot chills, heart racing, etc) I got so freaked out I thought I was having a heart attack. Called my MIL who is a nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was slightly elevated plus my heart rate was up and she said it is definitely from the medicine. It is now Sunday 10pm and I still feel panicky / anxious. How long for these symptoms to fully disappear? I feel like I’m going through an out of body experience. Anyone feel like this before? Staying far away from this medicine in the future"

448,2,"Hello. I’ve been dealing with severe depression and anxiety for the last 17 years. In the past two years I’ve been on medication that helps with my symptoms, but obviously doesn’t completely cure them. I have been at my current job for the last 3 years but it is causing strain on my mental health and I am desperate to find something else. I have 9 years of experience in my career field, and more than half of that has been experience as a supervisory as well. I have done several interviews over the past year or so trying to free myself from my current situation, but every time I am given hope by being told what a great fit I would be based on my experience, only to be told later that they chose a different candidate. I had an interview last week that I prepared intensely for, and felt like it went really well. I could see some of the notes the interviewer wrote regarding my answers and it seems like I did well. But still, I didn’t get chosen for this role either. 

I am starting to feel like my anxiety is hindering me in interviews because I may seem unconfident or lack personality because I’m literally trying to keep myself from panicking. I don’t know what else I can do to improve this, and it’s honestly extremely discouraging to know that I have proven myself in this field and I am more than likely being passed on because of something out of my control. 

If anyone has advice on how to improve this or ways I can present myself better, I would greatly appreciate it. "
449,2,"Hi everyone.
So I have anxiety over the dumbest thing ever. Basically I was buying a new laptop but I was struck between two choices and I am really very bad at deciding for stuff
Anyways I finally chose one of those two and I feel horrible that I didn't choose the other one, and even if I did chose the other one I would still feel bad for not choosing the other one.
I know worrying over something like this is idiotic compared to what other people suffer with. But I just started feeling this like my chest is heavy and it's just super uncomfortable. I don't know how to make it stop, I have took walks and I have tried taking deep breaths but eventually it just comes back. I really just want to enjoy the summer and I have so many things to be happy about but I just can't focus on them because of my pain and anxiety.
If anyone has some advice on how to stop it I would be eternally grateful. Thank you for reading this, it means a lot.
"
450,2,"does anyone have that awful feeling when you just waste your whole day on your phone? 
i have a major problem with that, and it drains my energy and makes me depressed and anxious as hell.
i started my summer break a little more than two weeks ago, and i almost didn’t study at all, spending my days fully on my phone. this makes me really guilty for not doing anything, but i just can’t mentally get myself to study or do anything at all. is there a way to fix this feeling, or make it go away?"
451,2,"so when i try to go to sleep i get this overwhelming feeling of shame and guilt like ""hey, remember when you did this? remember when you did that? you can't go to sleep until you fix it."" ""you don't deserve to see tomorrow. you don't deserve to relax."" and i really want to go to sleep earlier because lately ive been going to sleep at 12 am which i dont want to do but my brain just tries to keep me awake until i eventually get so tired i give up and go to sleep. does anyone feel / has anyone felt this way? is there a way to fix it?"
452,2,"I accidentally pricked myself on my right ring finger (I believe, I honestly forgot exactly which finger it was) with my name tag around two days ago at work. The metal pin on the back of it has no rust from what I can observe and the wound appeared to stop drawing blood as soon as I wiped it off. I don't even think I could see the wound, so I only worried about it a few minutes after it happened then proceeded to forget about it even happening for the rest of the day. This brings me to today where I noticed my jaw felt relatively stiff while I was chewing on a bar. I immediately remembered what had occurred two days ago, since I immediately associate jaw stiffness with the possibility of contracting tetanus. I also noticed it felt a little more difficult to swallow (I think I've been experiencing some acid reflux though, so it could be attributed to this) than usual. I checked a document which contained immunization history and my most recent vaccination against tetanus was a Tdap shot in December 2019. This somewhat makes me feel better about the current situation, but I'm unsure because I've heard it's ideal to get a tetanus booster shot after 5 years if a risk of exposure does occur. I'm really not sure what to do, my health anxiety has been absolutely terrible lately and I've begun medication to try helping it. I just feel so annoyed this had to come up and absolutely ruined the relative calmness I've felt today until now. "
453,2,"Hi! So I'm constant hearing a thumping sound in my left ear, automatically thinking I have a tumor or brain aneurysm.

Shifted to a pain in my kidney area, thinking I have 
kidney disease. 

Heavy feeling in chest and shoulders, thinking I'm having a heart attack. 

Also so scared I'm forget the meaning of words and just become confused in general. 

Oxygen level keeps staying around 95% and heart rate keeps staying 80-97 bpm while I'm laying down. 

Blood pressure is around 108/48. 

Is this all from anxiety? I'm trying not to go to hospital rn and keep telling myself it's my health anxiety flaring up. I'm just so scared and overwhelmed rn. Please comment back! "
454,2,"I just started taking Lexapro and am about to take my 3rd 5mg dose. I’m honestly wondering if it’s worth it. I’m about to have a baby and my anxiety has been through the roof about it, and I had terrible PPA with my last baby, but on just 5mg I’m unable to eat without extreme nausea, have lost almost a full day to sleep I couldn’t fight, feel like I’m dissociating, can’t orgasm, have a headache and dry mouth. Is this just the wrong med for me or is it a ‘stick it out’ thing? I’m extremely pregnant and am already miserable enough without having the whole book of ‘potential side effects’ thrown at me. "
455,2,"Does anyone else have this-- anxiety before a health appointment that makes it feel impossible to do anything before the appointment? I have to get a MRI in a week and it feels like I can't do anything until then except worry about it. This is miserable, and that's on top of the anxiety I'm sure to feel the day of. 

Any suggestions for how to cope with this? Anything that works for you?"
456,2,"I try my best to keep it under wraps and just sort of do what I can about it but it's so overwhelming. It became worse when I was diagnosed with a really serious illness. I don't understand why I always picture the absolute worst case scenario happening to me. I'm convinced it's going to go exactly like I think in my brain. I can picture the details of what will happen to me or what will happen in the given situation
Please is there anyone that knows the way around this? I have medicine for anxiety related to what I'm going through healthwise, but I'm very careful when I take it. I take it as needed, but I don't want to just take a pill. I want to find solutions on how to get around this because it is exhausting and overwhelming.  Has anyone ever gone to therapy for this? Has anyone ever found any real solutions on how to quit thinking this way? Honestly 99% of the time it never turns out the way I think it will, but that doesn't stop me from doing it. I don't even know when this all started, but it has followed me around practically half my life I couldn't even begin the list of things that this thought process has affected for me. I've never made it known to anyone not even my husband. He knows I have panic attacks sometimes, and he is the absolute most supportive person ever however, I've never ever shared the part where the catastrophize clicks in and what it does to me. 
I'm just using an example. Let's say that your blood pressure goes up and you have to go to the ER for it. In my case I start imagining the absolute worst is going to happen. The last time this happened to me which was just the other day I was convinced it was a cardiac issue and thought because I was feeling nauseous from it. Those are the symptoms in a woman having a heart attack so my mind just went off the charts however, when all the testing is done, it's nothing cardiac, which is something I fear horribly. I'm always convinced that. It'll be a massive heart attack or all these different scenarios start happening in my head.  That is just one small example, but others I have are far worse.

I do to have surgery in the fall and you cannot imagine what I've created in my head about this whole thing. I can't take anything at face Val anymore for some reason it just clicks something in my brain and it goes off the chart with the worst case scenario in vivid detail.

Where does this even come from for those of us that suffer this type of thinking I keep wondering what happened in my life that made this happen. Is this severe anxiety or where does this come from and has anyone ever been in these shoes and what have you done to try to deal with it? I feel like it's taking over my life.
I thank you for listening and reading this 💞"
457,2,"Two of mine that definitely seem to help are:

- The “physiological sigh”: (you take a breath in through your nose and then take an immediate sharp inhale, before exhaling through your mouth). From memory it *apparently* flips a switch in your nervous system. Either way it seems to help and is easy / free lol. 

- Diaphragmatic (had to google the spelling) breathing: Placing your hand on your chest, breathing in for around 4 seconds, holding it for another 4, then breathing out for around 6 seconds, repeating a few times. This *apparently* tells your nervous system to calm down too, and reduces cortisol which is basically anxiety’s food. 

I’d be curious to see if there’s any others you can recommend!

"
458,2,"I’ve (33m) had diagnosed anxiety/ depression for about 15 years now where I take Zoloft. For emergency’s I do have zofran and Xanax but those are only take once every few months.

Now my anxiety hits me usually from stomach pain from IBS where I’ll be stuck in the bathroom with my heart racing, stomach in pain, room spinning, and constant nausea where I’m basically dry heaving which makes my heart race more.

These attacks generally happen once every 4-6 months. I’ve been better at controlling them and seeing the signs.

Except this week. I had 3 panic attacks this week that had my head spinning and gagging over my toilet thinking I was going to pass out. One of which was today while with my dad for Father’s Day. He told me it’s ok to go home he just wants to me to be ok. 

This is so frustrating. I don’t want to let him down. Why is this happening 3 times this week? I hate feeling scared to be far away from my apartment where I can feel safe and address it in my bathroom.

459,2,"when i was like 13 i developed this irrational fear that I was going to die at 17 cause i'd do stuff like ask for specific ""signs"" that i'd die at 17 (don't ask me why i did dumb shit i don't remember) and then got freaked out they would actually all happen?

 i'm not saying like, ""if this lands on tails"" type signs i mean like ""if this specific person who i haven't texted all day texts me in the next 5 minutes"" type shit that came true and scared me. often. 

now i'm actually turning 17 next month and i'm really starting to feel kinda fucked up... i mean i don't wanna die. i'm not saying all that paranoia was justified, but still. anxiety is a bitch.

did anybody else ever convince themselves of something like this, only for it to not happen? cause that'd probably take some stress off my mind."

"
463,2,"Okay so this is something that has been going on for the past year. I thought I was having a heart attack as I couldn't calm down my heart rate, felt lightheaded and couldn't sleep. Went to the hospital with a BPM of 135. They took an x ray and did ecg and said I had tachycardia and to go to my family Dr. He recommended me to see a cardiologist. I wore a halter monitor for 3 days, had an ultrasound of my heart, and did more ecgs. He said my heart was fine and it's all in my head. I go back to my family dr and he prescribes me with anxiety meds. Theyre not helping. Every day I feel anxious and like my heart is beating extremely fast, like I'm gonna die. I don't sleep (that's when it's worse) I can't seem to ever calm down, my head always feels light, I feel dizzy a lot, and if I do manage to sleep immediately this feeling starts as soon as I wake up. I have to constantly be doing something in order to feel like it lessens the symptoms. I don't know what's wrong with me I just want help 😭"

465,2,"My anxiety has been surging lately and I took a look around my life at possible triggers. I have been following politics more than I ever have, I listen to true crime podcasts, heavy rock or rap, I watch drama TV like Love Island, and I am actively moving to a new house. I am skeptical that I have IBS and my stomach has been especially bad lately. I haven't made much of an effort to adjust my diet so I am in some level of discomfort most of the time. 

I am wondering how my fellow anxious people handle triggers in their lives? Do you avoid them or do you partake knowing it will cause more anxiety? I enjoy the content I consume but it is hurting me, mentally. Specially with politics, is there a way to stay informed but avoid the stress? I think it is very privileged to be able to ignore politics because it doesn't affect you and I am trying not to be that person. Ugh ignorance is bliss. "
466,2,"Hi there, just wondering Iif anyone's took gaba calm mind 750mgs for anxiety, my mind is racing. I'm also going to take it with magnesium glycinate. Has anyone tried this?"
467,2,Hi I have a fear to lose my bf because of my excessive anxiety and worrying. I’m afraid to even tell him about my mental health issues and burden him. Today I feel so stressed and alone. I also don’t have much friends 
468,2,"TW//Tickling


I’m not sure what to do. I have a deep fear of tickling. Have done since I was young. I have had a reoccurring nightmare since I was seven about tickling. The main dream I have is me being chased through the woods next to my house by a clone of my own family. I always end up getting caught and tickled by myself. Other dreams are me being caught by some random person dressed up as Mickey Mouse or in some other generic mascot costume, I literally feel myself getting tickled as well before I suddenly wake up. Either way the dreams always end the same way. Every time I wake up I’m either frozen with fear and too scared to even get up and go to the toilet or I turn the lights right on and can’t/wont go back to sleep. This has caused me a lot of anxiety and I’ve had issues with my sleep because I’ve been too scared to go to sleep. I was wondering if anyone had any advice on who to talk to about this? Thank you "
469,2,"I know nobody can give medical advice, but can anyone think of why this happened??? My doctor knows everything I am about to say but couldnt give me any answers to why this happened.

I am on 100mg pristiq, 54mg concerta, 12mg seroquel

Ive been on this combo for about a year and i went from a different form of methylphenidate to concerta about 2 months ago, and the second I got on concerta my blood pressure and HR SPIKED. No matter what I did or if i consumed caffeine or not they went up so high that I could constantly feel my heart beating very hard.

About 3 weeks ago I dropped my pristiq from 100mg to 50 because I wanted to see how I could manage (just so i could have less meds dumb mistake lol) and the withdrawal was so horrible i went back up to 100mg about 8 days of being on 50mg pristiq.

The second I dropped down to 50mg pristiq my BP and HR made the drop, and even after going back up on 100mg I still have a very low and normal blood pressure/heart rate

I know this is technically a good thing but I feel almost a little but off put because of such a drastic change. I am a caffeine addict and no matter how much coffee I drink it doesnt raise my vitals at all.

I know I need to stop drinking coffee and I really want to its just so hard… anyways if anyone has any ideas lmk"

Hi everyone — I just started Lexapro 5 mg last night for anxiety, and I’m feeling really unsure about these side effects.

I took my first dose at night (with hydroxyzine 25 mg about 2 hours before). Instead of feeling calmer, I felt even more anxious, jittery, and on edge. It was really uncomfortable and kind of scary.

I’ve read that Lexapro can cause an increase in anxiety during the first couple of weeks, but I’m wondering:
👉 Did anyone else feel worse anxiety right after starting Lexapro at night?
👉 If so, how long did it take before that side effect got better?
👉 Did switching the time of day you took it (e.g. from night to midday or morning) help at all?

I’m planning to ask my doctor, but I’d love to hear from people who’ve been through it. Any reassurance or tips would mean a lot — I’m feeling pretty nervous about continuing, but I want to give it a fair try.

Thanks so much 💛"
471,2,"I dunno at all, I've been feeling so anxious lately and feeling paranoid for some reason I really don't wanna get on meds I'm scared of the side effects, I've been considering them. I just have bad anxiety and overthinking "
472,2,"Hey. So my husband and I are finally in a position to move out in our mid 20’s. I’m very close with my parents and always knew that when this time came it would not be sunshine and rainbows.

The timing of this move already isn’t ideal. I’m struggling a lot with work and just health in general and have been very overwhelmed, and now I have to pack up my life and move in a couple of weeks and dealing with my parents not taking this news well at all.

I’m feeling sick and I can’t stop breaking down. I don’t know how to navigate this. I have never dealt with this much change at once, and I want to be happy and excited and I want my parents to be for me as well but instead they’re upset and making this way harder.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? I’m sure eventually it will blow over but I don’t think it will be for quite a while. I just want to be happy for this new chapter."
473,2,So i have been diagnosed with severe anxiety since 2023 and due to the fact that they believe i have also some else mental illness and now i had some type of test which lasts 2 hours where they test your problem solving skills and brain function? I have no idea but im like really scared of those results what if something is really wrong and i have no idea what will happened im so scared
474,2,What do you think about the use of duloxetine? Does it help you with anxiety? I mostly have generalized and social anxiety. 
475,2,"I've been taking very low doses (0.25mg) of lorazepam a few times a week for a couple weeks now. I consider myself to be pretty sensitive to medications and it's doing its job somewhat well.

Today I took a 0.5mg. It sort of helped my anxiety but mostly just knocked me out for an hour. When it wore off I got some really terrible anxiety again, much worse than it was from earlier in the day. 

Does anyone else get this rebound anxiety? It can't be possible that I'm already experiencing mild WDs, right? And lastly, just how dangerous are these benzos? I don't think my doctor did a good job explaining how they can negatively effect me."
476,2,"Every day, every minute, I feel anxiety and fear. I meditate, take medication, see specialists, but the anxiety doesn’t go away. Is there still anything that can be done, or will I feel like this for the rest of my life?"
477,2,"I've dealt with anxiety for the majority of my life since I was kid, it would always come up in spurs and sometimes we worse than others. Last March I ended up losing because it got so bad and I went to see my GP. She diagnosed me with GAD and put me on Lexapro. The first two weeks on Lexapro were the worst of my life (I thought), but eventually things seemed to get better. I was on them for about 6 months and things were going great, had a new job, got a gf, and could have a social life again. The anxiety could still get bad, but I dealt with it. My GP slowly took me off of them within the next three months. I lost that same job in January of this year and that really sucked but at first it didn't make me too anxious or spiraling out of control. I was worried about not being on Lexapro anymore. Couple months go on, over 100 applications, 2 interviews later. Still no job, broke and feeling hopeless. Then one Saturday I just completely spiraled out of control, nothing like I've ever done before. I was pacing 8-18 hours a day, drinking liters of water very frequently, like going through 24 packs in one day of water (lol I know), this continued til the next night when I decided to get some beer to help me calm down, and what a bad idea that was I'll tell ya. I ended up having a good night with my GF playing games, probably had 12 beers and everything was amazing that night. Ate for the first time in 24 hours, no anxious thoughts. The next morning is when I realized what kind of mistake I had made, everything was so much worse, my anxiety, my depression, everything, and to make everything worse I had seemed to develop a health anxiety about my heart because I had been having on/off chest pains and palpations for the last couple days. So not only is my anxiety crippling from the situation from trying to get a job and just not being worthless. I now am worrying about my heart giving out. I obviously did not have insurance at the time as well. So that cycle goes on for about week because I stopped drinking because I did not want it to keep getting worse in the long run. Pacing 12-18 hours a day, no eating, only drinking ridiculous amounts of water. I pretty much wouldn't sleep until my body was so tired it would give out of on me and I'd finally sleep. Then, wake up and repeat, then on one Thursday I couldn't take it anymore. I had two thoughts, my heart is going to give out on me soon anyway so I might as well end it anyway, and two, even if I get a job, my anxiety is going to be so crippling I'd probably just lose it and always be in a vicious cycle of dread and anxiety, it kind of made me think of Nick Swardson in The Benchwarmers, and it scared the hell out of me lol. Anyway, I ended up trying to take my life sometime around 3 that Thursday night, I failed thankfully and ended up calling the crisis line and had a sweet lady Edith get a crisis expert from my county with two cops to my house. It was some hard conversations, and I was so embarrassed I had two cops standing in my driveway. Ended up getting checked into a mental ward for 4 days. Probably had the worst panic attack of my life in the back of the cop car to the mental ward, my hands have never been that numb and tingly before, even was like that on my tongue, I was sure I was dying. Either way, I get there and the nurse I have in ther ER room is a guy who shares my name that I used to be friends with and graduated with, I thought that was a hell of a coincidence  and they do all their blood tests twice and do a ekg and take my blood pressure and pulse. Everything is perfect besides my blood pressure but that's a given considering I just had a panic attack. End up getting admitted to inpatient for 4 and a half days. Got to meet the psychiatrist on the first day and he was a really amazing guy, really talked to me about a lot of insightful stuff and reaffirmed me he was going to get me better. They took my vitals every day, hospital food is hospital food, blehhh, but had an amazing staff that was so supporting, I can't express how important that staff is to me. Such lovely people who really care and want to help. The doc ended up putting me on Ablify, Depakote-ER and low dose Ativan and these medications along with therapy has changed my life. I can't thank the doctor and the staff there enough. I truly thought I would never see be happy or see the light again. Countless hours and especially countless hours reading this thread pacing like a madman thanking I was never going to get out of my hell and my only way out was death. I am sorry for all my yapping but if you managed to get through my short story lol. ALWAYS get help, you can not do it alone like I tried for so long. You are important, this world is better with you in it. A light shines within all of us and the world will always be brighter with that light in it. We all have a purpose and you will find it and shine!!!!



(( Forgot to mention this, there was a team there that fast tracked me to get medicaid so I did not get hit with any heavy bills like I was scared of dealing with. Hopefully most states have something in place. ))"
478,2,"Yeah, I pretty much knew what everyone was gonna say to my last post. I know I’m not sick deep down and what happened was just a fluke or something. When you’re at this point of hypochondria like me, the internet becomes your worst ally that you can’t stop going to. 

You can never just let things happen because they do, and always try to find a reason. Always trying to prepare for a problem that’s not even there in the first place. 

I got this problem since Wednesday, if there really was something wrong with me, I’d be dead or showing obvious symptoms, but I’m not besides an kinda sensitive stomach that’s probably just my nerves anyway.

I never wish this kind of anxiety on anyone. Hypochondria is sometimes more mentally exhausting than being legitimately sick. "
479,2,"I’ve dealt with low blood sugar for the past few years. If I go for extended periods of time without eating I will get super lightheaded and come close to passing out. But the feeling is gone as soon as I eat something. 

Last week, I experienced a low blood sugar episode like this, and now I’ve been lightheaded and anxious basically for 7 days straight. The food no longer seems to be a factor because it’s happening regardless of if I’ve eaten or not. 

It feels like I just randomly developed GAD overnight as a 30 year old and I have no idea what to do… Just waves of dizziness, shortness of breath and panic throughout the day at random times. Has anyone else experienced these symptoms coming on randomly later in life? "
480,2,"I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I had a panic attack in the middle of dinner while I was out, and I don’t even understand how this started. I’ve tried so many ways to cope, but nothing really seems to help. I’ve been having panic attacks once or twice a week, and it’s getting hard to deal with. Sometimes I’m even scared to fall asleep because I’m afraid I won’t wake up. I don’t know what’s happening to me—I’ve never felt like this before. I just really need help."
481,2,"The recent flare up was triggered because my sleep been really bad and I've been stressing over it. And currently my overall mental health has been on decline. Also I find when I sleep early I get weirdly moody(?) so I think that didn't help me either.

I keep forgetting to mention it to my GP because it seems to only happen when I'm likely stressed or exhausted I think.

Not sure the best way to describe but a mix of hunger feel and stabbing almost too."
482,2,How can I stop focusing on my breathing i know we breathe automatically but every since I had a SVT i be feeling like im gonna stop breathing I actually have a oximeter to check my oxygen but im trying so hard to get rid of it  i had every test chest x ray blood work done 
483,2,"Help me. I'm charging myself to finish part of my dissertation and I can't stop to think in how I couldn't. There's nothing so wrong, I was going well. I just stopped in a difficult part. And today I woke up with anxiety, and I felt anxiety for the whole day. And I want to feel better. I want to hug someone, idk I'm feeling so bad about this, it's terrible."
484,2,"It’s been a week and I feel absolutely amazing. I had no idea how much impact the act of checking my HR had on my anxiety. I feel like everything is almost back to normal. I’m not even kidding, you can check my older posts about this recurrent problem. 

And I think it’s because I no longer feel monitored all the time by a device? (Cause I had that setting that always checks for your HR). And I also don’t feel the pressure to have a certain HR or fit inside some values. 

For anyone questioning if this really has any impact on your anxiety, yes it does. Quit the excessive monitoring! "
485,2,"Just started a new hobby and I have been going to a club that im really enjoying. It was ridiculously hard to convince myself to go alone and when I did I had an amazing time. 
The first time I go somewhere new or meet a new person im OK. Then the second time onwards goes to pot..
Im hardcore socially awkward and it's difficult to socialise anyway.

I have been going a few times now and all that goes though my head is the fact everyone definitely thinks im weird and doesn't want me there really. Or im annoying, ask stupid questions, look stupid, act stupid, I dont fit in and the fix is to stop going. Permanently.

Its ruining my ability to do anything! This happens with relationships and friendships (so I run away from them) and now its happening with my local club..

My stupid brain just wants me to sit in the house alone all day because thats all im good for but I want to go out and be a human being and do human things.
Its hard enough to get past the nausea and impending doom feeling just to go, have a good time and then my brain does this questioning about the above for DAYS afterwards. 

It's awful because everything enjoyable turns to this eventually. Urrrrrrggh."
486,2,"Hey everyone, for almost two months I’ve been dealing with back pain in my throacic region and lower left back. I have sciatica so I wasn’t putting much thought into it but it hasn’t gone away like usual. I went to the doctors and got recommended physical therapy, but that was a month ago and I still cant start until this Thursday. Throughout this time I’ve been losing my mind. I haven’t been able to workout which really helps me keep my wits about me, and I’ve spent a lot of time looking up cancer symptoms and freaking out when I have similarities. I know all I can do is go to PT, and then go back to the DR if nothing changes, but I was wondering if anyone had any advice on easing my mind in the interim. I haven’t been able to sleep because I’m obsessing at the thought of it and already accepting that my life may be over which is driving me absolutely insane. "
487,2,Anxiety and depression has me not wanting to get out of bed. I can stay in bed for days at a time. The moment I wake up I can't wait to fall back asleep and take a nap again. Anyone else like this?
488,2,I was just wondering if thats just me or if other people sometimes have days they just feel safer laying in bed all day because getting out or doing anything  other then that spikes anxiety.
489,2,"Had anxiety all my life, unfortunately I think it’s stemmed from my childhood. My workplace is score based and time based. You have to be quick with good scores (how many items you handle a night) well I’ve been back in work for 6 weeks now. The anxiety eats me before I even start my shift. 

I had my last shift yesterday and I made 2 major major mistakes on my shift. Before being called out on them I knew what i had done. I went to the toilet as an immediate escape and panicked for about 5 mins/paced. Went back to my work station and felt such a heavy pain in my chest, I couldn’t concentrate and felt like I almost couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t read the words on the screen anymore, I couldn’t tell the colours or sizes of items anymore. I walked out. 

I don’t drive so I walked out and sat outside in the bus shelter at 1am and just cried for 2 hours before collecting myself to go home. That’s over now. I’ve accepted that when I go back I’m going to be spoken to.. I have 3 days off but I can’t stop the overthinking and the physical symptoms. My brain keeps bringing the situation back up and I am crippled with that stomach churn feeling. I couldn’t get out of bed this morning and now that I have I’m cuddled up with a blanket watching documentaries but it’s just not helping. Really hate this anxiety. "
490,2,"Hey everyone,
I would like to have some opinions from fellows anxiolich people like me.

Let me explain, I have been taking meds (first paroxetine, then venlafaxine) my whole life basically, since I was 18 (now 34), because of severe social/general anxiety and OCDs. Recently I brilliantly decided that due to some annoying side effects and the pills not working as usual (having reduced the dose), I wanted to try something slightly lighter plus therapy. 

Ok so i went from 70mg daily of venlafaxine to 30mg, then cut it out for 30mg Buspirone twice a day. I don’t even need to explain the torture i have passed since stopping the SNRI meds, but I was hopeful, so I endured the pain; also i felt all the emotions i didn’t for years. Crying, laughters, love, I don’t want to loose these emotions again.

Now it has been a month without venlafaxine, and a month with Buspirone. I’ll be honest, I feel like proper shit. My anxiety is over the roof, I can’t barely get out of my house to have dinner out, i even feel anxious in my SAFE PLACE. I read some people had the same issue with this med and I am wondering if I should go back again with SSRIs or SSNRI, but i don’t want to get back to feel like an empty shell.

Maybe Citalopram? I don’t know. Has anyone been in my situation before?

Ps: I decided to cut the meds because of non-existing libido and absolutely no feelings at all, and i am in a relationship for years now…"
491,2,"so april 17 i started experiencing terrible acid reflux that hasnt gone away. blossomed into gerd/lpr symptoms. i have had tests done and they find nothing wrong with me, mind you no specialized tests for gerd of lpr... but my doctors are convinced its anxiety/stress/depression causing all of this... can i be? does that even make sense? i have had a little anxiety spurt in my mid 20's after a terrible panic attack leading to a while of social anxiety that i thought i got threw... i do overthink and worry a bit but never impacted me negatively really.. at first i dismissed the doctors thoughts of that being the cause... could i just be ignorant to how much anxiety i have could that cause such severe stomach digestion problems? i got prescribed lexapro but hate taking pills and apparently takes a while to work.. "
492,2,"Hey all. 
For some context, Im 22 and I’ve been using weed for 2/3 years starting with every so often and then leading up to being a chronic smoker (everyday and multiple times a day) - I’m aware this wasnt healthy. Although recently, it’s started having an adverse effect on me that hasn’t happened before. It used to make me feel calm, creative and dissociated. I enjoyed it and believed it helped with my depression over my mum passing away, which happened not long after I began smoking (2022). A month ago I had a very bad chest infection and found my breathing to be very laboured and I was ill for 2 weeks, it was very unpleasant and scary. I didn’t smoke during this time, but since getting better and going back to smoke as usual causes really intense anxiety I’ve never had with weed before. I’ll get a racing heartbeat, intrusive thoughts (of death, such as my heart giving up), muscle twitches and sometimes shaking. Nothing bad ever actually ends up happening, but I feel very locked in on these body sensations and it’s not enjoyable. 
I’ve read a lot on here about people experiencing a similar thing, and I guess I just want to understand it more, especially since I really miss it. It was a big social thing for me, and whilst I know I need to get professional help and not use weed as a crutch anymore, I do wonder if I’ll ever be able to participate in it again recreationally. Does anybody have any personal experiences with this where you’ve been anxious with it for a period of time but then eventually it began benefitting you again? 
I’ve considered ordering CBD oil to try to combat the anxious effects of THC, but want to get peoples opinions/stories first. 
Thanks for reading :) "

I just wish they find a way to regrow enamel cuz I'm spiraling again. I'm already looking into prp for gum recession becuase my father has severe recession and has 6 implants I don't want that faith



If they ever find a way to regrow that I will spend every thing on it"
494,2,"I have a history of GERD and acid reflux and occasionally get flare ups. For the past 3 weeks I’ve been dealing with a flareup with symptoms I’ve never seen before. I went to a gastroenterologist a few days ago who told me there’s nothing to worry about and he gave me advice and a diet to deal with it (Normal heartburn medication doesn’t work for me.)

Despite all this my health anxiety has been out of control. I had a couple incidents where I had food get stuck in my esophagus 2 weeks ago very briefly and now I’m hyper aware of every chew and swallow I make. One day I swallowed saliva and felt a bit of irritation in my esophagus and so now I’m often checking if that feeling has gone or not. I’ve also changed my diet which maybe adds to this since I’m not eating foods that I normally love. I’m overall just worried that it’s something more than reflux this time.

I have days where I feel fine but others where I feel like I’m spiraling. In just 3 weeks I’ve lost the excitement I normally have to do things and to see people because my brain is so preoccupied. I’ve had health anxiety in the past but never to this extreme and never for this long.

The rational side of me is telling me that my esophagus is just irritated and it takes time to heal. All this stress is making it worse. But the anxiety side often takes over and leads me to be obsessed.

On top of all this I have a 2 week cruise coming up in 2 weeks. It’s also the first time I’m traveling with my partner. I was originally really excited, but now I’m anxious about my symptoms getting worse while away from home, but even more so I’m anxious that I will be anxious on the trip and won’t even be able to enjoy myself.

Like I mentioned I do have days where I don’t feel anxious, but I’m still not where I was 3 weeks ago where I was just living essentially stress free and content with my life and my daily routine.

I just want to go back to how I was mentally before all this started but I don’t know how. I just hate how it’s taken over my life like this. Does anyone have any advice?"
495,2,"I’m 18, employed (21 base hours/pw) and just got out of school. I’m living with my mum and her partner with my two younger brothers. They got me a sleep out outside that I pay $75/pw for and that’s relatively cheap so I don’t mind paying that. 

I recently applied for a uni prep next year as I don’t have University Entrance needed to get accepted. I applied to take the course online to save money since I thought I would still be paying the $75 next year. My mum talked to me about increasing the rent to $150 next year recently. I doubt that they’re putting it into a seperate account for me later in life which I see is the case for most young adults paying rent while with their parents. 

I don’t want to come off as selfish but I think it’s ridiculous to be paying your child that much to live at your house. They barely make me dinner anymore either and when they order takeout most the time they never buy me any. I’m with my boyfriend most the time and we go out to eat majority of the week (which puts a hole in our budget quite a bit most times). I just don’t feel welcome in my own home anymore. I find myself holding in my pee for as long as possible just so I don’t have to see or talk to my mum out of humiliation. I forgot to buy her cheese after work and she’s very good at making me feel so bad. I’ve avoided going inside the house as much as possible. My laundry is piling up and I rarely have showers. 

In their perspective they’d argue that I barely do any chores throughout the house and that I should compensate for the work I don’t do. I fold and do the laundry as much as I can but I’m barely inside the house majority of the time anyways. I’ve recently just stopped doing it since we’re not talking at all at the moment. They don’t cook or feed me as much anymore because I didn’t eat all of the food they use to give me and buy me. In their defence I am pretty lazy and i’m guilty of that and very ashamed but I don’t know any better. They always use to bug me about it and once I had to pay a sum of money a week(I forgot how much it was a while ago) while still in school just because I didn’t do my chores.

I’ve already talked to my mum about moving in with my dad next year as he’s going to be buying a bigger house with his partner and her kids. I thought this would be the best idea since they live in the city where the university I want to study at is. My mum was well aware of this idea before telling me about the rent increase next year. She said if I didn’t choose to study at uni I could pay that here. It feels like she doesn’t think I can go anywhere else. It’s a 12-week programme for uni prep and my dad said they’re due for a house renewal in November so I don’t know how long till they’ll actually get the house? I’d most likely think about applying to start uni in the second semester(starting July). I might try flat with my friends and boyfriend next year but I’m definitely not educated about finances and even how to find the right house/apartment for myself. My boyfriend lives rent free at his house so I might live with him next year. I’m good with his parents so I’ll have no problem asking if they need any rent paid for the time that i’m there. 

I just feel lost and helpless. I’m either working or sitting at home bed rotting waiting for my next shift. I’m at my boyfriend’s house at the moment because we both don’t have work for a few days. I don’t have any idea how next year is going to look, life is unpredictable at this point. I don’t want to pay $150/pw to live at a house I don’t feel happy living at but I don’t know where to start when it comes to moving."
496,2,"I have avoided dealing with conflict a lot. My parents would argue. My older brother would beat me up growing up. I would be made the villain for taking a stand that I eventually started fearing conflict. It would make me panic, make my body and voice tremble and even tear up sometimes. I've gotten used to it enough that I can get through it but most of the time my first response is avoidance. 

What would you recommend are ways that you found to get through the anxiety of any upcoming conflicts whose consequences you feared? "

For example I keep worrying that somehow someone in my family is going to be shot and my brain keeps playing the imaginary 911 call like it’s already happened I can see everything in detail and it fills me with dread so severe it feels like it’s real and it makes me so sick. I think something bad will happen when my mom goes into a store alone for longer than a few seconds or when I’m in a building alone. Im never able to rest or be calm I constantly have a pit in my stomach I feel like I can sense something bad is going to happen and I keep having dreams about it, the same reoccurring dreams since I was little I want to vomit "

500,2,"I'm currently in the middle of a dissertation for my masters and I'm seriously considering deferring to next year. I've had mental health issues and anxiety for a very long time and have been seeing a therapist since 2022. 

Unfortunately, my therapist is very sick at the moment and I have not had an appointment since mid May. I've been struggling since then. 

I'm after having a conversation with my boyfriend (after a really bad day where I was crying and sad for most of it) and he asked me when was the last time I was truly happy. I realised that I haven't felt really happy since we went on a short weekend trip in 2023. He then asked: were you happy when you laughed with me yesterday? I told him I didn't know, but I really should have said no. 

I feel I have lost everything about myself since then, it's just been one stressful event after another. I don't know when they are going to stop. I just want to be happy again.  

Edit: I've asked my partner to think about my general reactions to things, especially over the past year. I've also emailed the counselling service in my university to try to arrange an appointment. "
501,2,I feel like nobody likes me. I feel like I’m not loved. I can’t survive. I cry nearly every single day. I get so many hate comments on Reddit for no reason. I miss my friends. I hate life. I’m only 15 years old with severe anxiety and this is how I feel. I simply need help. Anything to offer. Even if it’s the smallest gesture.
502,2,I have ocd and anxiety I have Ben world about rabies because my dog bit me and she has been vaccinated for rabies so I need help getting over that anxiety anything would help 
503,2,"Recently, I took a normal dose of excedrin and had some side effects. Any normal person would have dismissed it as a one time thing, but being a major hypochondriac and my history of using the drug due to migraines, I can’t help but think something is wrong with my liver. No other symptoms have appeared besides my stomach just being sensitive and sometimes reflux.

My mother doesn’t think I need to go anywhere and my father is over me going to the er after going for panic attacks a few months ago. I just can’t relax, and I don’t trust myself to say I think I’m okay. A blood test is the only thing that will kill my anxiety. So I just want to take an uber to the place.

My father said though, once this is solved, a new problem will come. That’s how much of a hypochondriac I am now."
504,2,"I’ve been chronically ill for the past 3 years. SIBO, Candida, Mold, Histamine Intolerance, Reflux etc etc etc 

One of the most frustrating issues is that I’m constantly trying to figure out treatments to specific issues. Or just overthinking every little bit. 

Like I’ll spend 30 mins researching Mold, and then think “actually my issues started before I was in Mold” and then spend 30 mins researching amitriptyline withdrawal and then spend 30 mins researching cfs and seeing if I think I have that. 

My symptoms are very real and I’m constantly exhausted and brain foggy (the type where it feels like a constant head pressure). But I know what I need to do.. in the sense of what to eat, to take life slow and not rush things. But I get so impatient and just want to order miracle supplements that don’t exist. 

Has anyone else dealt with this?"
505,2,"My story is I had a surgery (appendix) 5 weeks ago and ever since l've been almost unable to swallow foods, drinks, saliva I've been checked many times and all doctors say it's because of severe anxiety and stress. I was anxious and stressed before this happend but it's gotten a lot worse clearly. As u can imagine this is horrible for my mental and physical health and within these 5 weeks I have already lost nearly 7kg as I need alot of food/ fuel since im an athlete and either way I just am one of them who need alot of food so as you can imagine this is going to lead to an early death or severe problems so I really need help I've tried praying tons, I am 17M I'm always feeling faint and falling when I stand and I can feel myself fading."

My current obsession is red cars. I feel like, the more red cars I can see out my window, the better chance there is that my parents will be okay, and, conversely, if I can't see any red cars, that means that there's a good chance that something will go wrong with my parents. I know that sounds dumb, but I honestly worry quite a bit about it. I need as many red cars as I can get."

508,2,"So I’m getting married in 2 months, and while I’m very excited to lock it down with the love of my life (she’s amazing, I’m very lucky, 10/10 would recommend), my anxiety has decided to RSVP “yes” and show up early.

It’s not cold feet or second thoughts — it’s more like the fear of having a full-blown anxiety spiral while standing at the altar in front of everyone, locked into place with no clear escape route. Like…what if I feel trapped or dizzy or start sweating through my suit like I just ran a marathon? What if I need a breather but all eyes are on me and there’s no “pause wedding” button?

I’ve dealt with anxiety for a while, but this particular flavor — the “no way out” kind — is hitting different. I want to be present and actually enjoy the moment, not dissociating while saying yes. 

So for those of you who’ve gotten married, performed on stage, or survived any high-stakes, all-eyes-on-you event —
How did you manage your anxiety leading up to it?
Any tips, breathing tricks, rituals, mindset shifts, beta blockers?? I’ll take anything short of faking my own disappearance.

Appreciate you all — this subreddit makes me feel less alone in my spiral. Let’s ride the wave together "
509,2,"This is not just a post about anxiety, but also a symptom of the structure of the internet and how an unknown, invisible audience of judges replaces love. 

As I write this, there is no peace at all, but I’m caught in my life-or-death focus on the topic and its weight, as the world acts like a vampire feeding from my high brain activity until the brain is broken.

People wonder why the population has become so sensitive to criticism, and stress has no purpose anymore. There is no real warmth anymore, no thick skin to diffuse stress, and mostly just information overload, “look at me,” and monkeys throwing non-constructive scat at whatever they don’t approve of, without feedback. The sea watches in judgement, and the good is barely felt, the humanity hardly real.

This is the only social outlet I have— face-to-face meat talking is not an option. I wanted to find a home among humans somehow, like how I would get support in older civilizations, with a tribe or family-community that knows me well. I could feel emotionally safe to express myself no matter my mood, or my non-conformity, and not be plagued by near-constant dread. 

I’d not be deeply disturbed across all platforms and accounts, after over a decade of near-constant solitude since childhood, maladaptive daydreaming obsessions, and not having any online presence until very late on average.

Friends? What even is that? So-called “friends” seem to selfishly want to be liked, or seen as nice, and reap your energy just for this, then leave.

My fantasies, years in the making, mean more than the universe to me, but the contrast that comes with being bound to the physical, amidst all the ideas I have written, causes a loneliness pit that pushes me like a pitchfork into this trap of more pain. 

A creative with social anxiety gets constant alarms: “Conform, citizen! Silence! On your knees!” But why? Why? How can I be anything else?

I no longer believe that the social instinct is worth it. This is grasping at nothing, just to be punished for it. What has it accomplished?

I no longer believe that the pain of finding “your people” in the sea of similarly-broken drones trying to get approval, is worth it. Either I turn off this instinct with meditation and become a psychopath, who doesn’t serve some make-believe “validation,” or I lay low like I have been for years and live in my mind and lucid dream worlds obsessively. I cant decide, I can’t rest, and I cry."
510,2,"All of this really started at the beginning of April for me when I was put on 2 weeks with of antibiotics I never needed…
Anxiety sky rocketed and Dr decided to change my meds.. 3 years on Lexapro Dr stopped me cold turkey and started me on Wellbutrin.. 
between the withdrawals of one and side affects of the other I made it 12 days in Wellbutrin and then weaned and was off all anxiety meds for a month and a half… 
Started HRT, for a condition I have that’s rare, and Dr decided I needed back on anxiety meds so I’m 8 days in on 25mg Zoloft.. 
I’m so tired of the constant anxiety, nausea, headaches… "
511,2,"I absolutely hate job interviews. I hate them more than anything else in life. I’ve been trying to expose myself to more of them lately, hoping that repeated experience might help me get over the fear, but so far it’s still a nightmare every time.

The anxiety starts at least two days before the interview. I get extremely tense, my sleep is wrecked, and I start sweating a lot — especially at night. I often wake up multiple times during the night before the interview, completely on edge. My hair gets greasy, I feel unwell, and sometimes I even get hemorrhoids from the stress (yeah, that’s how bad it is).

I also find myself avoiding the preparation. I *want* to prepare, and I *know* it would help, but something in me just shuts down. It’s like the more I try to face it, the more overwhelmed I get. My brain goes into panic-avoidance mode, and then I feel even more guilty and unprepared.

The day of the interview, I usually manage to push through and do okay-ish on the outside, but inside I’m a wreck. And afterward I just feel drained, exhausted, and angry — not just at the process, but at myself for reacting this way every single time.

Has anyone else experienced this level of stress from job interviews? Does it *ever* get better with practice? I’ve always been anxious in social or performance situations, but job interviews feel like a special kind of torture for me.

Any tips, coping strategies, or just shared experiences would be really appreciated."
512,2,"I am 23 years old, I started having major panic attacks last November and have struggled to even leave my bedroom since. I am married and have two sons that I feel like I am disappointing because I haven’t figured myself out yet. I have been fighting my anxiety for so long and I just don’t know what to do anymore. I was at first on different ssri’s and they made everything a lot worse. I got prescribed Effexor ER 37.5mg, Clonazepam .5mg (only 15/month as a rescue), and propranolol 10mg 3 per day. I am scared to start taking them because I am scared they aren’t going to mix well and I’m scared I’ll have worse anxiety. It’s like my anxiety is keeping me from taking them. I’ve taken one of the clonazepam for a panic attack I was having and it helped but I’m worried about taking them together. Has anyone been on these three meds before?


Side note: The reason I have been stuck at home and or in my room is anytime there is too much noise or light I feel it overstimulates me and is one of the causes to my panic attacks, also when I am walking around and my anxiety gets high my heart starts racing and I get dizzy, I get pain in my chest and down my left arm (I know now that’s just physical symptoms of anxiety) but I always thought I was having a heart attack. The panic attacks and anxiety didn’t start until after I broke two vertebrae in my thoracic spine which I didn’t find out were broken until I went to the er for one of my panic attacks but that’s the only thing I could think of that possibly started all of this. 

Edit: Before this, I worked full time and was always out and about. Like hardly ever home, my family and I were always doing something so this has been really difficult."
513,2,"Does anyone else experience severe anxiety when anyone’s confessing to your face? I end up running away and avoiding them for a long time afterwards. I think it’s so strong and overwhelming because it’s a mix of anxiety and the fact that I’m autistic. I don’t even know if I’m able to return anyone’s feelings, so the pressure of a definitive answer is so bad it makes me freeze up. I think this may be a result of childhood trauma, because I’ve once run away from a boy who confessed to me in grade school and never got to explain myself because we moved away shortly after, and I still feel very guilty about it to this day. Is it normal that something this small is making me so deathly afraid of any relationship now? Please tell me I’m not the only one who’s this sensitive."
514,2,"I 25F have started dreaming so so much more recently like 5 or 6 days a week previously only like twice a month. Sometimes that's okay but more often then not these dreams have been extremely negative. I have a long history of diagnosed mental health issues including BPD, Bipolar, ADHD, GAD, suspected CPTSD and others. But I have started even having panic attacks in my dreams often waking up in an extremely heighten fight or flight response probably 3 times a week the last 2-3 weeks. It has started to give me anxiety around sleeping, to the point my sleep has suffered, I get anxiety around taking my prescribed sleep medication. The decrease in sleep I worry will trigger other issues and just keep snowballing. I feel damned if I do and damned if I don't. "
515,2,"I've been managing my anxiety so well, it's usually related to a fear/worry of potential mistakes I feel I may have made though wouldn't know exactly which ones or when or where. 

However, on Friday it came to light that I have made a huge mistake at work which will have major consequences within the company and cause a lot of extra work and lot of time to fix it....

I'm so worried about it. I did so well until this morning and then I spiralled massively and then had a few hours doing OK and now I'm slowly feeling another negative spiral coming on......

I'm lonely as fuck. Yet, I can't even open up freely to my sister. She Calms me down, helps me but, I feel like a burden to her too now. 

Life isn't as good as I want it to be. My father is 50, he's trying but can't find a job. He says we're really fucked if he doesnt find work soon. 

My family hates each other. We're constantly rude to each other. My parents keep saying they're going to separate but, When?????


I miss having a friend. I'm so fucking lonely rn. 

Never felt like this for a long while but, suddenly, I want to sleep between my parents again. I want to cry for my parents again. I want to throw tantrums about not getting an ice cream again. I want fight my sister again. I never wanted to grow up like others did anyway.


I hate myself. I hate how lonely, drained, anxious I've become, I hate how much I hate myself. I hate how rude and arrogant i am to my family. I hate how I love my family and i hate how I hate my family. I hate how shit life is. I hate how my very own brain does this to me.

I'm so fucking tired. So fucking lonely. I hate growing up. I want to scream, I want to cry, I want to cause a scene. I feel like breaking something, I feel like hurting someone. 


I hate this. I hate everything. Initially, I was very scared of posting this. Scared of judgement. Scared of people thinking of me as insane or disgusting.

Tbh? I just really hope this post blows up and i get attention. I'm so fucking desperate for attention. 

I want to be loved so bad. By my friends, my family. But, why do i feel like a burden just for speaking, for being excited, for being me? Why do I want nobody but I crave everything? 

I feel so pathetic, so disgusting. I miss my bloody friend but he won't talk to me. And, I feel so obsessive and disgusting about that! We barely knew each other for a month but, i want to share my everyday with him. I feel so disgusting for wanting to talk to him everyday. He ignores me but I want to talk to him and those who talk to me, Ignore them.


I'm 16 for fucks sake! If life is just going to be bad, then I don't want it. I don't remember a time when I was truly happy or not anxious even as a child."

I just got the prescription today but I don’t want to take it at night incase I have a reaction and nothing around me is open to help.

I’ve told her she should start writing down her thoughts and feelings when she’s spiraling that way she can explain to her therapist once it starts again. Any other parents or teens on here have any advice about what else I can do? She’s doing alot of comparing herself to everyone around her and it’s causing her to panic. Everyone is smarter, everyone knows what they will do after highschool, everyone else gets to take vacations far away etc. it just spirals.

I just find it interesting that an entire group of meds that used to be popular for quite some time seems to of faded out overtime.

Hello everyone. So I figured I'd ask here as I've seen some posts on here referring to anxiety causing physical pain. 


So to best describe how it feels. If I get anxious, Let's say I'm watching a scary movie or I'm watching a sport and I'm anxious about my team winning as they are running for the touchdown or if I'm watching a movie and I'm very eager to see my friends reaction to an upcoming scene, I experience this dull stabby ache in my left side of my chest. It feels like a throbbing pulsing pain. I noticed this pain or a similar pain upon exercise but again I'm not sure if it's a muscle issue from bad form. The pain happens almost instantly. If I get startled I feel the pain as well very quickly. It goes away within a second. If I get a text message from someone who says something cryptic that makes me think they're mad at me I get the feeling as well. It's just a dull Stabbing pain. Sometimes if I get PVCs the pain will happen during the thud of the skipped beat. I noticed it when I ran up the stairs or when I got out of the shower however sometimes when I run up the stairs or when I get out of the shower it doesn't happen so it seems completely random. 

It could sometimes be immediate when I stand up and start walking but I'm not noticing it anymore when I walk or it happens very infrequently.

pls help"
540,2,"The cough, dry mouth, constant stomach ache, the exhaustion, nausea, headaches, the shakes, sweating, hyperventilating. The build up to a panic attack, the panic attack and the comedown of a panic attack that feels like a hangover. It’s so hard and we are all so strong. If you deal with this just know I love you and you’re amazing, you’re not broken, your body thinks you’re in danger and is just trying to keep you alive in an extremely uncomfortable way. You’re a warrior and you can do this, it will get better ❤️‍🩹 

Some insight into my experience: I’ve been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks since I was 16 (I’m 23 now), I’ve been on and off of countless medications to try and suppress the symptoms and to try and live a “normal” life. They worked for me for a short while until they made me feel numb inside. I lost my personality and I didn’t want to have to be on medication for the rest of my life. Even while I was on medication the anxiety never went away completely. I believe medication works for some people and if you’re struggling to stay afloat I’d 100% say it’s worth trying because it may very well work for you. I stopped taking medication when I was 21 after stopping and starting different ones since I was 17. It was extremely difficult to adjust to just being me again.
There was a point in 2022 when I couldn’t get myself out the house and to social events, or even to the shop down the road. And there was no way in hell I believed I could ever have a job. My life was on standstill and I had practically given up trying, letting anxiety completely take over and control everything in my life. 
One very random day, while I was in bed like I always was in that period of my life, I decided I didn’t want anxiety to control my life anymore and I was willing to fight it, or should I say do it anyway even with the anxiety. I started slowly just texting a close friend who I’d practically left in the dust because of my anxiety and depression. He replied and has supported me ever since. 
I began going outside for walks, then to the shops. And I’d do it anxious, I’d be panicking and hyperventilating the whole time but I did it anyway. And now I can go out for walks or to the shops and I’m okay, I’m not in a constant panic about it and I took that control back from anxiety. I still get sweaty hands and shake a little when I get to the counter or self service. But I can do it and so can you. 
After this I applied for some jobs, I managed to get a job in a Greggs (it’s a bakery/fast food place in the UK). The interviews for these jobs were so stressful for me and I did have panic attacks and anxiety before them but after I threw myself in and did them I felt relieved and proud of myself for doing it. 
I got rejected 3 times from different places before I got accepted at the Greggs, and that was okay it didn’t make me any less worthy. I’ve been at Greggs for 3 years now and my confidence and anxiety have improved so much. I have a lovely team who support me and understand me. They’ve seen me have panic attacks, especially when i first started working there I would panic outside every shift before I was meant to be on the shop floor, sometimes it caused me to be late but they understood why and didn’t punish me for it. I still have panic attacks now, sometimes they’re triggered by new things or appointments and I still occasionally have them before leaving the house, but I know now that they can’t hurt me and that I’m okay and I’m strong and can always get through it. 

I’m now learning to drive after giving up 5 years ago, and I’ve got a plan for the first time in my life. If and when I pass my driving test I want to change my job and work with animals. I’ve always loved animals and I’ve volunteered at different shelters before and I feel like I’m ready to make a change and do something I love. 

I guess the reason I’ve decided to post this is because I want you all to know how amazing and strong you all are and that it can and will get easier. You might be stuck right now but it won’t be for forever, you can get your life back and I believe you will. And I don’t want anyone to think I’m completely healed because I’m not, I’m still working on myself and things still make me anxious, but I’ve learnt to sit with the feeling even if it’s difficult and you just want to run and hide and try and get rid of it, what does it feel like? Where is the most pain or discomfort?, I breathe and sit and that’s how I get through it without it becoming such a big scary thing that makes me shut down. 
It will pass and you will be okay. 

I love you all so much and if you need any support or just someone to talk to don’t be afraid to message me or comment.

You’re a warrior and you can do this, it will get better ❤️‍🩹

541,2,"I don’t know if it’s my autism or what, but therapy simply does not work for me. I’ve tried both CBT and DBT, and neither of them helped me. I especially disliked all of the confusing acronyms in DBT, and the exposure therapy part of CBT. I just want to give up on therapy at this point and let my anxiety turn me into a hollow shell of a human being."

544,2,"I’m reaching out because i need help, i’ve constantly for the past few months i’ve been constantly having anxiety attacks every day. My body feels like melting and i can’t walk and my body gets tingly and it’s the worst feeling ever and i just need help controlling/ getting rid of them if possible"
545,2,"I recently have realized how much i physically feel from the anxiety i carry with me, even when i am not feeling anxious in my head at all. Ive always had so many issues with my health and im just now realizing at 25 that probably 80% of that at least is just from my generalized anxiety. I dropped out of high school and had horrible attendance for all years of school because my stomach always hurt so bad and i had no idea why. everyone thought i was lazy and didnt want to go so i was making it up but i truly felt like something was seriously wrong with me from the ages of 5-25 (still do lol). I was able to link the stomach issues to IBS triggered by anxiety years after i dropped out and it really changed the way i see things. Now my biggest issues physically are pure fatigue, ibs, headaches, and brain fog (horrible memory issues). Its possible i have an actual condition and im going to a dr soon to get tests done but its wild how you can sit here and feel like you are actually dying when there is little to no current anxious thoughts. It just lives in you and makes you deteriorate from the inside out. Anyone else have any symptoms or issues they realized later were ""just"" anxiety? "
546,2,"I feel like my brain and heart jump or “glitch” every time I move my head. I’m dizzy and weak. 

I’m staying away from google, because I know I’m just gonna freak myself out more if I start searching.

I guess I just want reassurance that 1) I am not dying and 2) the symptoms are normal and not going to kill me. "
547,2,"Can someone help me understand what I went through last night? I’ve been going through an extremely rough patch with my mental health, I’ve been on 20mg prozac and .25-.5mg clonazepam for about a week. Last night I smoked weed (not unusual for me, I’ve been smoking for 5+ years) and I was watching one of my favorite shows. I started feeling a bit anxious and weird. I kept trying to brush it off but eventually decided to just try to sleep because I felt really, really weird. I went to the bathroom to brush my teeth and stood there staring at the wall. I’m not sure what happened but it’s like my thoughts and brain were separate from my self awareness? It’s so hard to explain but I was filled with pure terror, all I could hear were my own thoughts but they didn’t even feel like my own and they felt far away but so overwhelming. This turned into a huge panic attack and I had to wake my grandmother up to help me. Once she was awake and talking to me the feeling was gone. It was one of the scariest experiences of my life and I’m sorry for the long shitty explanation but I truly never felt anything like it. Is this depersonalization/derealization? Maybe it has something to do with the prozac I just started, but I took prozac in the past and never had this reaction. I’m so scared to experience it again it felt like I was going to die or go insane. I just recently started therapy and I’m seeing a psychiatrist next month. I’ve slept a few hours but I feel so drained from the experience."
548,2,"I got a an unprotected bj in Feb this month I was okay till may and in may because of heat I got white heads and foolishly I started thinking it's because of hiv. Now it started an anxiety In my anything new happens my mind says could be because of it. I've done research and studied articles from CDC too my case is a very low risk exposure to zero. 

But this anxiety is still lingering and disturbing me. Is getting tested only way? I'm bit scared to do it in my home town. Thinking to get it done next month or that next month when I travel out of city.

I get this feeling often that something is wrong
In me and my heart feels hollow sometimes. It's not just about hiv but i feel like could be death related. Pleased help. "
549,2,"Only for the last 2-3 months I have been getting these really annoying physical symptoms, I’m always being told by my GP, family doctor and other that’s it is just anxiety and I want them to go away, Is it just me that gets these physical symptoms; 

- often feeling like someone is poking me with a needle all over the top part of my body ( sometimes my legs) 
- weird heart palpitations; they don’t feel normal it’s like something is moving sometimes or like something big is moving in my chest that feels more uncomfortable than painful

These are the main ones that irritate me so much i sometimes think that it’s blood clots something like that, but i have gotten blood tests done at the end of March this year and everything came good just my vitamin D deficiency but that’s being sorted "
550,2,"i've gotten a cavity that i recently noticed and obviously its very necessary to get that fixed asap. my issue is i know its gonna pain but i've done this before so its alright. but what im actually anxious about is my hyper gag reflex. its just too bad. though my dentist knows about it and shes very patient with me about it. but the moment she puts in a cotton to avoid the saliva touching, i just feel horrible and start gagging. she managed without it the last time but im so anxious this time idk why. how do i desensitize my gag reflex? the anxiety isn't helping either. on top of this, the scent of a dentist clinic is so weird too. 😭 "
551,2,"i’ve been posting so much here and other places i apologize but my anxiety has been kicking my ass lately. 

i went on a walk today and i don’t exercise ever i take small 5 minute walks at work thats pretty much it. there was sort of on incline on the walk and my heart  rate would just go up and up and up. it would go between 130-170 and it would freak me out then towards the end of my walk i started to panic a little i was almost back home i could feel the panic and then my hr went up to 190 i wasn’t dizzy or lightheaded just feeling a little chest discomfort which freaked me out. when i got home i laid on the floor and i seen my hr going down and now my hr is between 100-115 and it just keeps fluctuating between that and im scared i had a heart attack or im currently having one. 

i feel bad bc its father’s day and my family wants to go out to eat and im terrified of going out the rest of the day :( and im just tired from that walk and that small panic i felt :( "
552,2,"Anyone else fears the idea of death? I am still very young and I understand that my time will come one day, but the idea of death haunts me so much. I don't understand why I feel so scared about dying. Sure, I might be at ""peace"" but the thought of permanently ceasing to exist is so frightening to me. All of your conscious thoughts and memories just BOOM, gone.
I'm more scared of what happens to me AFTER death. Like after an autospy, do they really just CUT you open, play around with your organs, throw them back into your chest, and sew you up? I sure as hell would not like that.
In a way, I already know what death is like everyday. When I fall asleep I have no recollection of the hours that I am asleep. Nothing. No pain, nor any joy. Everyday I sleep and my consciousness returns when I'm awake. Same thing when I had surgery a few years ago. Once the anesthesia went through my veins, it was an instant lights out until I woke up a couple of hours later.
Anyways, I know that many before me have gone through the inevitable process of death, but its just so unsettling and scary to me. Thoughts?"
553,2,I've been having such bad anxiety today. I feel like I'm all over and I feel like I'm crapped in a box and I don't know how to get out of my head. I even called a suicide line just so I'd have somebody to talk to. I'm not suicidal but I just started crying when she answered the phone. I don't know how to make this feeling go away
554,2,"hi everyone! i’m 15 and i’m going to start anxiety meds soon. i’ve had awful existential anxiety since i was ten, but started therapy a few months ago and i’m being referred to a psychiatrist to help me out. 

i know it could take a few weeks for them to kick in, and it could take a while to find what works for you. i’m not exactly sure what kind of meds i’ll be on, but i was wondering what it generally feels like. i know that each kind has a different feeling and different side effects, but do they all have a general calming/peace effect to them? if not, what’s YOUR experience with the meds? (this is mainly going out to the people that have been helped by meds)

how does it help you? does it change your thoughts? do you not care about the things you’re anxious about because of them? i’d love to know! tysm!"
555,2,"My anxiety symptoms evolve I swear and I have had a horrible 2 weeks mostly laying in bed. I can barely get out the house . No psych appointment til hopefully Monday. Today I noticed I have been having a racing heart and feel panic when walking even to the bathroom. .
I had TWO exgs and blood work this week along. I'm lost idk what to do. Everyone around me is worried about me and wondering why I suddenly left my job,and why I'm so isolated. It's because I'm having all these symptoms and I feel broken. 
One of the worst symptoms is heart racing when walking I feel like it's worse at night. "
556,2,"i started taking celexa about 4 weeks ago. i just wanted to be able to live a normal life without as much anxiety. i am always worried about throwing up, i think about it every day for over 15 years. something that always made me feel better is knowing i never throw up from anxiety, no matter how bad it got. 

i was out of town yesterday and i started getting nervous because what if i got sick? this is just how my mind works. well i got so nervous about it i started gagging and got the dry heaves. I hadn't eaten yet so nothing came up but it was awful. i can't believe this happened. 

i'm struggling with what to do next, now that i know this is a possibility. i have a dr appointment Wednesday and i'm thinking about asking to stop celexa. i don't know what to do. i'm so nervous since this happened, i can hardly eat. i know it's ridiculous. i'm just so scared"

560,2,"TLDR: does anyone else get upper abdominal pinching/minor pains for anxiety? Especially on the sides?

I was on Lexapro the last year after having bad postpartum anxiety. I tried to taper off the end of April and went back on about 2 weeks ago. 2-3 weeks ago, I started getting pinching feelings all around my abdomen. They started around my belly button but also impacted pelvic region. I had an ultrasound done and it showed a cyst but the doctor didn't think it was related. The pinching feeling is now almost constant in my upper abdomen. It's not severe, but it's persistent. I'm fairly certain it's anxiety because I don't notice it when I'm busy or socializing, but it acts up when I think about it. 
I've been diagnosed with IBS after a colonoscopy a few years back but that pain is usually lower. "
561,2,"Finally help is coming - will update

 "
562,2,"Could be something physical, mental, silly, whatever. I’ve been looking to try new things when the spiral starts."
563,2,"Hi, so I've had anxiety for 7 years now. First I was so scared and panicked I couldn't do much. These last couple years I got on antidepressants and even though a lot of bad things happened during that time, I slowly started feeling better to the point I could finally go to things again, make a lot of friends and enjoy hobbies. I still had anxiety, ocd attacks and panic attacks but I recovered from them quickly.

Now last august I travelled to France which was a 20 hours drive with my family for vacation. There I have had so many panick attacks and I threw up for the first time in years (which is a big anxiety of mine). I went home earlier cause I couldn't take it anymore. However since France I've had a feeling that everything's not right anymore. Like 6 years ago I got diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and a year back with avoiding personality disorder. I think these last couple of months I've been avoiding so much through my social media account and non stop going away for car and motorcycle content. But I felt so depressed and it felt all the time as if I'm slowly losing my mind. I lost in these last couple of months 14 kilos (before I couldn't even lose 1), I started sweating excessively at night, couldn't sleep well, nightmares, got sick frequently and eye infections and ridiculous hair loss. So I think my body was already telling me hey! Something is not right! Slow down.

But now a few weeks back I got nauseous out of nowhere, quickly went home and had an anxiety attack. First I thought nothing of it but the days after I stayed super anxious. Then another night I had one of my biggest panic attacks ever and even had to throw up in front of my new potential relationship. Since then it is completely down hill. I'm anxious every day to the point that it feels hopeless and I'm scared if I'll ever get better again. I'm too scared to go anywhere in fear of panicking or throwing up. It's like all my progress is completely gone! And I don't get why and how!

We did up my dosage and I felt a week horrible with side effects but then a few days better so I thought yes it's working. But now I feel horrible again. Yesterday evening I threw up the whole time. 

Does anyone have tips for a relapse? How did you experience an anxiety relapse? Did it get better for you? You think it's possible from my context that it is indeed that I just overworked my nervous system? It feels so unfair that after all that hardwork, I'm back at this point again.. Perhaps I avoided too much this time.

So many questions. Please feel free to answer it would help me so much, and hopefully will give me some of my hope back for the future <3"
564,2,"So whenever I feel something slightly off, I end up obsessing over it. However, usually I can try to ignore it for long enough that it goes away. This goes for most things I notice with my body.

However, my eyes are something different. Ever since my late teens I have had times where I obsess over whether my vision is good enough or not, like certain things would be somewhat blurry but I could never tell if they were blurry enough or not to be considered not normal. Up until recently, I have never had an eye exam. However, recently due to my anxiety around it being worse than usual, I finally got my first eye exam in my life hoping to get some resolution to finally stop worrying about it.

However, that didn't exactly happen. I have only a very mild prescription (+0.25 sph, -0.50 cyl in both eyes) and was told I don't really need glasses. I felt embarrassed for even going. But the doctor reassured me that people even with good vision should have exams done. However, that still leaves me feeling like I can't see 100% perfect and I still can't stop obsessing over it.

Does anybody know how to stop obsessing over vision?"
565,2,"Hi guys and girls. So basically my last 6months have been hell. Hospital trips, doctors trips. Everything tested and everything clear and it’s put down to anxiety. It’s draining I am so fed up :(. But last couple of night I wake up instantly once I fall asleep panicking. I literally got 3 hour sleep lastnight because I kept waking up automatically panicking :(. Anyone any advice? Also doctors gave me beta blockers but I’m scared to take them maybe I should start taking them. 
I have also order Vitamins…. b12, Iron, Magnesium Glycinate, vitamin D&K2 Many thanks "
566,2,"So finally managed to find a Dr. here in Australia that would prescribe it for Anxiety. Have been told to try a 10mg tablet away from any important presentation / situation to see how my body responds and told i can taken 20mg if need be for now if there are no side effects. 

I felt nothing. Didn’t really feel better or worse. Is this fairly normal when trying your first 10mg dose? 

I imagine ill only know if its working in a stressful situation? "
567,2,"Hi. Weening off 12.5mg atenolol and on day 4 I think? maybe 5? Havent found alot of info but is this common? Google AI says it is even off low doses (my body is very sensitive to meds).

Anxiety in AM has def increased... its not a day ruiner amount but has increased. I can take 1/2 a pill of lowest dose clonazapam but hate taking anything. 

In time ill switch to propanolol for public speaking or anxious appointments / work meetings  ive heard propanolol does wonders so excited!"
568,2,"
I’ve had social anxiety my whole life and I’ve always struggled to make friends.
In high school I had a toxic group of friends who treated me like shit. I always felt like a ‘backup’ friend, the kind of friend they would hang out with when there was no one better to talk to.
I used to hang out with them in school just because I didn’t want to be alone, but I always felt like an outsider.
I cut them out of my life after high school, but I’ve struggled to make friends ever since.
I have one friend that I met back in early 2023 at work, but I left that job in late 2023.
I am still in touch with her but only via text. I haven’t seen her since then and we mostly talk about our jobs.

I feel so mentally exhausted thinking about how lonely I feel and I envy those who have good friends. Due to my social anxiety I struggle to make conversation with people. But I really want to make friends, I don’t know how to.
I want to physically meet people because I’m skeptical about making online friends.
But I don’t know how to do that at this age.
I don’t even have a social life, I just get out of the house to go to work and then come back home."
569,2,"I’ve been on Buspar for a few weeks now, probably over a month at this point, and while I’ve noticed significant improvement with my general anxiety I’ve also noticed that my sleep patterns seem to be changing. Initially I had restless legs and woke up at least every two hours throughout the night. This lasted about a week and resolved itself without changes in the medication, but I also started experiencing very vivid dreams around this time. At some point the dreams became so vivid that I was having trouble distinguishing them from reality when I was awake, or initially upon waking up, which was pretty weird and freaky to me. I mentioned this to my doctor and she didn’t seem very concerned about it, and I trust her, so I think my anxiety on that has lessened and I haven’t been thinking about the vivid dreams as much.

Recently I increased my dose and I’m doing my best to tolerate the dizziness, it’s been about a week now and just last night I had an instance of something similar to sleep talking. My boyfriend’s cat is good about not chewing wires but she does tend to get into things especially when he’s sleeping. I was staying at home last night with my dog, not with my bf and his cat, but I had a dream that the cat was trying to eat my phone charger. My body was awake and I recall opening my eyes and pulling at the charger, trying to rip it away from the cat and telling the cat to stop. At some point I think I must’ve realized I was dreaming, because I texted my boyfriend “Don’t let the cat eat my charger while I sleep” and then “I keep having dreams about it” 

I didn’t recall any of this until I went to text him this morning and saw the message. I’ve never been a sleep walker or talker before at least not frequently, I had a few instances as a kid and one as a young teen where I talked some nonsense in my sleep. But this seems unusual for me. My boyfriend says it’s normal, but I have intense health anxiety and this is bugging me quite a bit.

Does anyone else have similar effects of buspar effecting their sleep?"
570,2,"After a while of not wanting to do it, I decided to say fuck it and give meds a try. I started with Prozac and it didn’t do shit. In fact when I upped the dosage I ended up having a breakdown at work and I was literally shaking and struggling to calm down. Now my doc has me on Zoloft and buspar. This also doesn’t work. I’m trying to stay positive but hopping around from med to med is kinda annoying. I know that most people have to do this until they find the right one but fuck I’m already annoyed. How long did it take for you? I’m trying my best to stay patient. "

572,2,"Health anxiety is ruining my life.



Lately, I feel like I’m constantly on edge. Every little ache or sensation in my body sends me into a panic. Right now, it’s a swollen area in my armpit. Two doctors examined it and said it’s not a lymph node, just swelling—likely from using crutches because of a leg injury. But even with their reassurance, I can’t stop obsessing. I keep checking it, Googling, convincing myself it’s something more serious like breast cancer (which I also obsessed about tonight while doing my monthly check).

I’m 38. I have kids who need me. And I’m terrified of not being here for them.



I started mammograms early because of a family history—though I don’t have the BRCA gene—but none of that seems to calm me down. My brain skips right past logic and lands in worst-case scenarios. Every twinge, every weird feeling, every ""what if""... it’s like I’m always scanning for something wrong.



 My relationship with my mom is deeply fractured. She lost her own mother when she was 12 and never recovered. She pushed everyone away, including her children. Today she has no contact with any of us.. She also had health anxiety, never addressed it, then mocked me for being in the hospital with HG which was difficult for me.



I have an appointment with my primary care doctor in a couple of weeks to talk about all this, but honestly, I’m scared I’m going to completely break down. Part of me feels silly, but the fear feels real and overwhelming. I don’t want to live in panic anymore. I want to be able to enjoy my life and my kids without this constant cloud of dread.



If anyone else has been through something like this, or found ways to cope, I would really appreciate hearing how you did it. "
573,2,"This rant is incohearent yapping, but is that not the definition of a rant? Here goes nothing;

Whenever I want to do something I like, I feel like I need to plan out how it's going to happen so as to ""maximize enjoyment."" If I want to watch a show, I can't just watch it whenever I have down time, I have to save it specifically for night time and I have to have a little treat while watching it otherwise I feel like I'm missing out on ""maximum enjoyment.""

A while ago, I really wanted to watch Nimona. So instead of just, I don't fucking know, *watching it*, I told myself that I was going to specifically watch it on Friday night on the downstairs TV because, well, it's the day before the weekend and it will be night which means I won't be bothered, meaning it's the best time to maximize my enjoyment of watching it and if I don't watch it on that specific day then I'm not going to enjoy it as much as I could.

Note that it was, like, Monday or Tuesday.

When Friday night came and my sister was downstairs using the TV, I got so upset that I stormed upstairs in tears. My mom and I sat down and had a talk and my sister left to go to bed like twenty minutes later, but it still felt like I couldn't watch it anymore because, well, now I'm upset, meaning that if I watch it now it won't be as perfect and I won't enjoy it as much, meaning I should wait until *next* Friday to watch it, which *sucked but if I watch it right now then I'll regret it because you can only see a movie for the first time once so I should make sure that my first viewing is perfect to MAXIMIZE ENJOYMENT*. My mom wasn't having that shit and told me to just watch it, so I did against my better wishes. I sincerely felt devastated that I was watching it on a non-perfect day because I thought that it would ruin the movie for me. And guess what?

I was FINE.

I had a BLAST.

It was a FUCKING GREAT MOVIE.

I don't know why my brain can't just, like, do things it likes. It needs to plan out ways to ""enjoy things the most"" and if I break it's plan I feel awful because, ""You have such bad impulse control, if you had just waited you could enjoy this more, but nooo, you need to do it now.""

PLUS, because my brain makes such a big deal out of enjoying things as much as possible, it's not ENJOYABLE anymore. It's STRESSFUL. I JUST WANT TO PLAY STARDEW VALLEY BRAIN PLEASE STOP FREAKING OUT.

Now it's happening again. The Strangers Things teaser for season 5 has dropped. I'm, personally, HYPED. I want to re-watch the show and read up on all the theories people have posted RIGHT NOW.

But.

My brain is thinking, ""Well the show isn't coming out for a few months, why should we re-watch the show now? We should wait to re-watch it until right before the first volume releases so that the knowledge of the previous seasons is fresh and ready. If you re-watch the show now, you will forget everything by the time the new season is due to release but because you had re-watched the show a few months prior you won't WANT to re-watch it again and then you will go into the new season knowing nothing. Same goes for theories, if you read them now, you'll forget them all by the time the show begins.""

And I tell my brain, ""No, when the new season is about to be released, I would totally be down to watch it again, you are making some massive leaps to say that I won't. Also my memory isn't *that* bad, I'll remember basic plot points and theories after a few months.""

""But why watch the show now?"" My brain replies, ""You basically don't remember anything. If you save it for right before the new season releases, you can watch the new season and old seasons back to back in order! If you do it like that, you will be able to enjoy it the most, but if you watch it now, you're being impatient and impulsive and you won't enjoy it as much.""

I ask, ""Why won't I enjoy it as much?""

""Because I'll be sitting here yelling at you about how much you aren't going to enjoy it because you're not watching it the way I want you to and because of that you are missing out on MAXIMUM ENJOYMENT.""

You- the person who is for some reason still reading this text wall- might be saying, ""Well, you know your brain is making a big deal for no reason as seen with the Nimona thing, so just get started watching it and your brain will shut up.""

Ohoohoohohohoho. You *THINK IT WOULD*! But NOPE.

If I decide to watch it now, my brain is telling me that I need to read *all* the theories and watch *all* the video essays and take *notes* and rewatch everything as *much as* I can because, ""Well, if I watch it now then I have months of time to prepare and become a lore aficionado. If I start studying the show for all it's worth I can go into season 5 knowing everything and ENJOY IT MORE.""

But I don't WANT to do that. I want to casually watch a show I like and read theories and have some fun. I don't WANT to take notes on a TV show. But at the same time, if I do, it will pay off in the long run because I'll be going into season 5 knowing a ton, and if I don't, I'll feel lazy.

Not to mention the typical things I have to do; I have to watch it at night because it's quiet, I have to watch it on the downstairs TV because of the big screen, and I have to be hungry enough to have a small treat while I watch because I like sugar while watching shows.

I'm starting a new medication so yeah that's that, it made my anxiety feel 100x times worse this week. Everything is making me worried and it does not help that I actually had a medical emergency last month, it's making my hypocondriac head feel like everything is actually something, after all last month it really was something, but I tried to control my emotions saying it's nothing but it was something. And now EVERYTHING is a voice in my head screaming. I had to go to the hospital today because I was feeling like I would throw up, and it was SO STRONG, I started having chest pains too. Just this week it's the 3rd ecg I've done, I'm glad it's nothing, like really glad, I'm happy I can be here, but this emotions and hormones coming out of nowhere just to make me panicky is so tiring.

My anxiety is still lasting til this day mainly an OCD subtypes eg fears of developing schizophrenia/going crazy/becoming a drug addict all these pop up at different times,,,I have experienced one panic attack since then but suffer with anxiety everyday almost eg with my surroundings, shadows and control.

i think it has induced OCD im constantly seeking reassurance for those fears

577,2,"Hi everyone! My name is Rosie, and I want to tell you about my story (obv. a trigger warning as im going to be talking about my experience, but ill try to keep it as un-graphic as possible!)

Christmas 2017, i was 8. I got an incredibly horrible case of viral gastroenteritis. I threw up over 20 times that first night. Obviously that made me super weak and dehydrated, and I ended up having to stay in the hospital for a week. Prior to this incident, I had never experienced fear surrounding stomach issues but the illness was so traumatic, I became severely afraid of any form of stomach pain.  
My horrible, but rather brief (or so I though at the time) was only the beginning. I developed nerve damage in my digestive tract, as well as an immune condition. My stomach was so sensitive that i could not eat. My gastric emptying was almost nonexistent. Due to my fear stemming from being sick, I refused for a long time to go to the doctor, but finally my mom made me go. I explained my symptoms to the doctor, and SURPRISE! my diagnosis was, you guessed it.... ANXIETY! Long story short, I didn't eat very much, lost a ton of weight and became severely malnourished. Eventually I was given an NJ tube. Keep in mind, it wasn't that i ""couldn't eat, but the pain i would experience in my stomach drove me away"" I was SO SO SO scared of being sick. I was so afraid that the word, *vomit.* Made me panic.

It was not until 2020, when I ended up in a Rogers residential facility for ""an eating disorder"" (my chart said anorexia, NOT TRUE) There, I was finally diagnosed with OCD and Emetephobia. Spoiler alert: ERP. Months and months of exposure therapy and I finally made enough improvement to be discharged from the program (also because my insurance. yay, American healthcare!) As soon as I was out of treatment, I relapsed. So, I started with a private practice therapist, who actually happened to also be my therapist at res! (she left to start her own private practice)

FIVE YEARS LATER i can safely say: I DID IT. I finished ERP! My stomach still sucks, and I do still throw up a decent amount. But guess what! Thats okay with me. Obviously it freaking sucks to be sick, but I can deal with it.

I guess the point of me sharing this story is to get the message out there:

YOU CAN DO THIS. I KNOW IT FEELS SCARY TO NOT HAVE REASSURANCE. TRUST ME.

Progress is not linear, and you will try, and fail, and want to quit. But it IS possible. Keep at it my friends, because living a life in fear isn't the way to live. You gotta live WITH fear, not IN fear.

You are an amazing, brave, BRILLIANT star. 🌟 You got this.

❤️, Rosie"
578,2,"Any advice in general would be greatly appreciated as I feel lost !

I 17F just got out of the hospital after 5 days due to a suicide attempt. I was on SSRIs and also used xanax for sleep the past month and im diagnosed with GAD but it’s not the inly thing that’s been causing the trouble in my head. My doc thinks i could also have a personality disorder but i full on lied when the psychiatrist assessed me at the hospital due to the fear of hospitalization and only told them very few things about my reactions to medication and stuff. I will be talking to my doc soon and also have an appointment with the hospital psychiatrists in like a week or 2. Now my issue is mostly that i cant even be fully honest to my therapist about anything in my head but also really want to change my medication and try something different than the ssri and benzo combo that i got going on but i feel like i can’t tell him that without looking like a drug addict."
579,2,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety basically my whole life. Started getting shortness of breath and stomach aches from it in elementary school. As of now, it had just been getting worse and was extra extra bad this week. I had two long panic attacks and significantly more physical symptoms. I cannot relax before bed because of the constant anxiety, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal shoulder pain from the lack of air. Does anyone have any advice, stuff they did to reduce their anxiety? I don’t know what to do. "
580,2,"Long time since i last posted here. I thought i kinda had my anxiety under control for most of the time, until now.

Tomorrow my wife is going on a 2 week trip and that brings with it a lot of anxiety. It would be the longest period we've ever been away from each other in 15 years as a couple.

Will be challenging, i admit."
581,2,What calms you guys down? 
582,2,"Fellow panic disorder friend here. I feel like this may sound silly because I’m pretty sure it’s just my sensitivity to bodily sensations that causes this. But does anyone here deal with the same thing? I’ll eat a decent sized meal, and maybe 30 mins to an hour later my heart rate elevates. It prolly goes to around 120-130 BPM while I’m sitting down. I can say for certain it does make me anxious too, and that in of itself probably makes my heart race more than it normally would after a meal.

Anyone here relate?

"
583,2,"Literally feel so terrified that anything I do will get me in jail.

Driving slightly wrong? Ticket
Trying to find the name of a hot girl I saw in a YouTube video? (Over 18 ofc) Yup cops gonna show up.

Searching up something on the internet that’s mildly sus? (Like the previous example of even an academic term like “sexual selection” bc it has the work sexual in it) yeah the coppers will be knocking at my door

Plz help this is affecting my quality of life…🙏

584,2,"im 15 years old and a female with a b12 deficiency. However since last year (oct 2024) i have been noticing lumps in my neck that are very much movable in different areas all around my neck, im anxious about this. 

The only swollen lymph nodes i have are when i have allergies in the morning and they suck, which is under my jaw. 

Im not sure if these are lipomas or anything but yes i did get my blood, thyroid and vitamins tested and did an immunology test, everything was normal. 

One side of my neck does feel harder than the other but idk anymore what to think.

Im really concerned because of these lumps and my neck feeling weird, i have no family history of lymphoma or anything. My anxiety has been so bad lately. Does anyone else have these? :(

(these lumps cant be seen but i can feel them)"
585,2,"How long anxiety induces heart pain last? Come and go in times or can it last whole day? 

Also, does it happen when you try to relax but it just doesn’t let you ?"
586,2,"I had some pain and I just looked in my mouth and there's a crack on the tooth. Last month I had 8 fillings and they said the decay was so bad it was almost to the nerve in the tooth that just cracked. Idk how this happened. There's a very clear crack in the side and I'm having slight pain and sensitivity. Please help I'm so scared 

I have 3 more to be filled next month so I guess I should bring it up then because i can't make another appointment until then which is the 24th of this month

Idk what to do, I'm so upset because I thought the problems and pain with that tooth were gone but they're not apparently

I'm so mad, I was having severe pain in that tooth for months and it finally went away and now it's fucking cracked


I can tell my dad but idk what else to do other then bring it up in my next dentist appointment 

If I dont address this it's just going to start decaying again "
587,2,"I’ve had social anxiety my whole life and I’ve always struggled to make friends.
In high school I had a toxic group of friends who treated me like shit. I always felt like a ‘backup’ friend, the kind of friend they would hang out with when there was no one better to talk to.
I used to hang out with them in school just because I didn’t want to be alone, but I always felt like an outsider.
I cut them out of my life after high school, but I’ve struggled to make friends ever since.
I have one friend that I met back in early 2023 at work, but I left that job in late 2023.
I am still in touch with her but only via text. I haven’t seen her since then and we mostly talk about our jobs.

I feel so mentally exhausted thinking about how lonely I feel and I envy those who have good friends. Due to my social anxiety I struggle to make conversation with people. But I really want to make friends, I don’t know how to.
I want to physically meet people because I’m skeptical about making online friends.
But I don’t know how to do that at this age.
I don’t even have a social life, I just get out of the house to go to work and then come back home."
588,2,"I’ve been putting off medication for a while with hopes that therapy, physical activity, cutting out caffeine, and deep reflection/rest would help. While it has to some extent, I’m having a very hard time regulating my anxiety and getting through my daily spikes of adrenaline. 

I’m finally going to speak to my psychiatrist about starting a medication. I’m terrified of side effects as I tend to be very sensitive to medication. I was hoping someone could provide success stories from starting a daily medication. I really want to get my life back and stop living in fear of my anxiety. I’m determined but I just need some extra help. "
589,2,This is so tmi so im sorry in advance but I have very bad anxiety and after I eat I feel like I can’t breathe (as if there is a weight on my chest and my lungs won’t fully function)and I get sick to my stomach I’ve been sitting on the toilet for maybe 30 minutes unable to breathe or make my stomach any better I’ll just say it like this the number 2 has been coming out almost the entire time I’ve been on the toilet I’m not sure what the reason behind it is if it is my anxiety or brain unable to allow myself to eat without feeling sick and out of breath just wanted to see if I am the only one (forgot to add this and don’t really know where it would fit but I feel a huge flood of fear when this happens which is why I believe it is anxiety and my brain working against my body when it come to eating) please let me know if this is not just me 
590,2,"im 20 years old maybe im acting immature, but I've been crying and shaking for hours, i know politics isn't a fun topic but everything thats going on has me in shambles. im so scared. im taking a break from social media but the posts i saw about the US being under attack have still left its mark. I want to know if everything will be okay. I feel so sick, i think i had a slight heart attack or something earlier I'm unsure, i am not going to therapy so i have no medication for my anxiety or overthinking or emotions or anything, im miserable. im so fucking afraid and scared. i hate these wars i hate our president i hate everything i just want everything to go back to normal please

edit: 
thank you all so very much for your support. I am feeling much better at the moment, and I will keep myself informed with trustworthy news outlets rather than focusing on social media. I am still anxious, but I am feeling better. I plan on getting some professional help at some point, and I hope this brings some light to my anxiety issues and I can find a way to treat it. Thank you all again 💙💙💙"
591,2,"Any experiences with this?  

Yes, I’m aware it’s a benzodiazepine and yes, I’m awake of the potential risks. "
592,2,"I feel a lump but my Dr says it’s just breast density. The bump is kinda long, like a small finger. My nipple is growing like extra skin on one side and it looks bumpy. No nipples discharge.  I have an appointment coming up in a few days but I’m terrified. Dr said just for a second opinion and to give me peace of mind. The bump would hurt at first and now it doesn’t. My period is to start tomorrow. Has anyone had this experience? "
593,2,"i’ve been having this internal buzzing/brain jolt type feeling in the back of my head where every time I move my neck, it feels like my brain is moving in my skull, and there’s a jello type dropping feeling and electrical jolt in my back that radiates in my spine. I have no clue what this is! I’ve been diagnosed with chronic migraines, PPPD, and have horrible health anxiety. I also have a lot of brain fog and muscle weakness. This has also happened since I upped my topamax dosage "
594,2,"Mine certainly isn’t, peeled myself out of bed to go down to see what the kids had gotten me, (spoilt rotten as usual) health anxiety kicked in “are these clothes too big?” “Am I loosing weight because I have cancer?” And of course the constant urge to take a deep breath and the nausea! My breathing is by far my worst symptom, anyone else experience this? "
595,2,"Recently fucked up my hrt dosage and had heat exhaustion at a show, it’s all but ruined my life when I had finally escaped the grasps of my health anxiety for a few months. All of my progress down the shitter. Haven’t seen most of my friends in a month at LEAST since the heat event. I had ended up in the ER because of this extreme pressure migraine after, bloodwork fine, got a bag for hydration and left, didn’t help. Realized my hrt dosage was wayyy off because I’m horrible with instructions and understanding, and I was basically extremely roided, went to the ER and got my bp and rbc checked along with regular bloodwork, checked out fine but quit hrt because I knew it was the main problem and needed to let my levels reset. Pressure migraine has vastly improved, but still lingers in more of a pain than pressure form though I believe I’m not adequately eating because of my messed up sleep schedule sleeping off this pain all the time. 

       The last remaining symptoms I’ve been dealing with is this gnarly random left arm throbbing pain. Either radiates down my whole arm or focuses in my upper arm, focusing in my elbow, my hand, and sometimes even my shoulder/armpit area, a sometimes producing cough (though I do have allergies but pollen count is low), some vertigo that has improved, throat/chest tightness on and off, ears ringing,this weird inner body trembling that focuses on my left chest and arm, and my back pain I usually have is extremely worse though I can chalk that up to spending like 2 months in bed and anxiety. My anxiety makes my shoulders, neck, and back tighten and my muscles there feel like lumpy concrete, focused on the left side of course. Lucky me.

      The arm pain started scaring me so much I went into the ER once again, third time this month. Had an ekg, bloodwork, d-dimer test, troponin bloodwork, chest xray, and vitals of course- all of which were normal. Still can’t help but ruminate on the arm pain. It’s been having this fucked up vibrating sensation, especially when I lay on it. Same vibration I used to get in my chest back when my back pain peaked again when my anxiety had me bed bound this bad a year ago. My throat’s spasming and tightening randomly with this pulse in the bottom. It’s just an overall miserable experience with health anxiety and no support system right now. I just keep thinking all of My ER trips missed something, or like I didn’t do enough tests. I know it’s probably anxiety, a pinched nerve, combination of the two in a type of chicken and egg situation. My anxiety tends to be a self feeding cycle especially with my hormone levels wired like this. Been spending most of my time googling my symptoms trapped in bed. I’m only 25, and I’m living like I’m 90. No idea where to go from here. I wanna just go right back to the ER and get more and more and more tests as it’s the ultimate reassurance, but that’s not good for me. 

     All in all I just have all these scary go to ER symptoms and nothing to do with them. I did what I was supposed to do. I went to the ER three times. They said I’m fine. Now what? Because I just don’t feel fine. I’m having panic attacks when I try to hype myself up to go outside. I had such a good life for a hot minute, thought I beat HA, right back where I started if not worse because of this fucking arm pain. Genuinely no idea what to do or how to fix it. HAVE to sleep on it because sleeping on my other side somehow makes it hurt and throb worse. Feels like it throbs in synce with the pulse in my throat. Scares me out of sleep, scares me into sleeping too much. I’m just venting at this point, this is probably the worst my anxiety has ever been. Idk, if anyone actually read this and made it this far thanks for listening to me. I appreciate it. "
596,2,"So I took 10mg of lexapro about 2 hours ago after drinking a beer 30 minutes before and it usually takes 30 minutes to take effect, and it did, but as I went to go to sleep my stomach stared to churn. So I rushed to the bathroom and threw up feeling an immediate relief but my anxiety is ramping up now thinking about if I fucked up taking the meds too close to drinking. I know I’m probably overthinking it but now I’m shaking trying to calm down and I can’t get out of this awful headspace, any tips or even reassurances that it’s ok would really help. Thank you for reading"
597,2,as the title says im wondering if this is safe or no i did just try it out i took a quarter of a 25 MG cbd gummie a little over an house ago and then just a few minutes ago i took a quarter of a 25 MG hydroxyzine tablet. just wanted to make sure this is safe i ddi take a very fairly low dose of both so im not super jacked up with it but just making sure i mainly did take both becasue im trying to actually be able tonsleep
598,2,"Looking for some solidarity and also some tips on how to get through it. I started a new job on Monday and my anxiety absolutely horrific. I am terrible with change and new scenarios so anything like this makes me anxious for a long time. 

There is so much to learn, I feel like I understand some things and then three more things I don’t understand come along… My new job is a step up from my last job and I feel completely out of my depth now and that I don’t deserve to be here! I am desperate to succeed and be good at my job, but also really need to rest my brain and I’m finding that balance hard.

I know it’s only been a week but my anxiety just keeps telling me I won’t make it past probation in six months. I wish I didn’t have to constantly feel panicked like this. 

Thank you for reading! "
599,2,"just as the title says, im having my wisdom teeth removed in 10 days. originally when the procedure was discussed, i thought it would be similar to the one i had years back where they would put me to sleep using gas, but a few days ago they told me i will be getting an IV. needles are one thing, but thats not the scariest part of it for me. the thought of having a tube in my body getting medicine put into me directly is horrifying. ive had an IV once before but it was a horrible experience and the medicine hurt really bad. i want to get over my fear so there wont be any problems when the day comes.. but i dont know what to do. the thought of the IV being the same as the last one scares me. any way i can prepare myself to get an IV? i want to make this as easy as possible for everyone involved "
600,2,"Hi all! I’ve had anxiety since I was a kid. My anxiety translates to nausea. I’ve never had a panic attack where i couldn’t breathe - my body just goes straight to “throw it up!”
i’ve been dealing with these symptoms since i was about 6 or 7 and i know how to recognize them. whenever i start spiraling i go nonverbal and kind of try to focus everything on not throwing up while my heart is beating 150 bpm. 
whenever i’m in this state and someone tries talking to me or communicating i get extremely irritable until the wave washes over me.
does this happen to anyone else? i always feel terrible after. i’ve been taking clonodine and that’s been helping. 
i don’t mean to get angry but in that moment it feels like nothing else matters than getting out of it."
601,2,Did you find it helpful for your anxiety?
602,2,"Is anyone else so hypersensitive to smells it will stress you out?  For example if I smell damp wood from my windows (my house is old). I will obsessively think about it. To the point of paralysis.  I need to replace my windows because they are rotted so I can smell the damp wood rot and my anxiety has been so high I'm not sleeping, eating, just stressing.  I know what I'm doing is irrational but I don't know how to fix it. Anyone have a similar experience?  "
603,2,"Hi everyone,

First time posting here so forgive me if this is inappropriate!

I need advice on what to do, i find myself spiraling about these wars and the idea of death.

I know its morbid, but its consuming me, on top of other issues real life presents.

I have been anxious for most of my life but this is taking the cake. 

I dont want to go too much into detail!

I welcome your advice on how to ground myself. 
"
604,2,"I just had a nightmare. I rarely have nightmares but I just had one and it led to a mild anxiety/panic attack and derealization. I think it’s because of sleep deprivation since I have been going to bed late these past few days and also maybe dehydration since I’m now noticing my mouth is kind of dry. That could also be because the last meal I ate was salty but anyway.

Here is my situation: I think I have had undiagnosed ocd for a while and recently I have been having some existential ocd related to things like the fear that I’m in a long dream right now and that I will wake up, and just questioning reality in general.

This started because I have been lonely for a while and so about a year and a half ago I became attracted to and emotionally attached to a fictional character and her fictional world. At first I wanted to find a woman like her in real life but soon I wanted to be with her. I wanted her to be real so bad that I constructed this fantasy in my mind that maybe I’m in a long dream and after I die I will wake up and get to be with her. Obviously this is ridiculous but I tried to convince myself that this was the case. I would look at normal everyday things that happen to others and can be explained by other things such as memory distortion, mandela effects, and nostalgia for a time I wasn’t born in, and I would tell myself this is “proof” that I was in a dream and soon I would wake up.

The problem began recently because with this type of erroneous thinking you can come to all sorts of crazy conclusions. Yesterday I had an anxiety attack because I had a disturbing intrusive thought that maybe I’m being tortured in another world or something and just dreaming or hallucinating right now. For whatever reason it disturbed me and the more I thought about it the more scared I got. I felt a bit better later that day but the next morning I still had some lingering anxiety. I realized that I had to let go of my fantasy that I had constructed in my head and focus on my current reality. The idea that I’m dreaming and I will soon wake up is unfalsifiable and as such should be discarded. I decided to focus on the people I love, my mother and my sister, and start making new friends and maybe get a girlfriend. The meaning of life is the meaning that you give it and for me I decided to focus on helping and protecting my loved ones, and enjoying life by doing activities I enjoy, and spending time with loved ones, and helping other people as well.

Anyways about the nightmare, basically in the dream I was worried that I would wake up and then the scary stuff started happening and I woke up and when I did I started to think again in my half awake state that what if I am dreaming right now and it triggered a mild anxiety attack. It helped to think that I can’t be dreaming right now because in my nightmare there was a bunch of logical inconsistencies and jumps from one event to another. But it got me thinking, why do we feel conscious in our dreams when we aren’t? I’ve even had dreams in the past where I thought I was lucid dreaming but I realized I wasn’t once I woke up."
605,2,"With anxiety, I am trying to get rid of worry thoughts.  Any strategies?"
606,2,"I made a thread here about flying to AUS for vacation 2 months ago. Thank you to everyone who tracked me. 😀

Now, I have a 12 hour return journey coming up on a 777 ER, from Brisbane to San Fransico.

The first leg coming here was **easy**. Funnest flight in my life honestly, felt like playing a video game. I was high on about 50.mg of TH.C and 100.mg of Benadry.l for the first leg. Go california! 🖖

AUS has no Over the C weeed unfortunately though, so I cant have fun going back. My anxiety and panic level is probably *higher* than most in this sub--I usually lock myself in the bathroom for the entirety of the flight. Or run out the plane right before doors close and cancel my flight.

Are there any *decent* Over the C pill to calm anxiety? 

"
607,2,"For the last few weeks I’ve been unfortunately suffering from a bit of insomnia, waking up super anxious, mind not stopping.  Oh and of course doomgoogling that my insomnia is from terrible disease.

Honestly I feel it’s from my anxiety, every though I recognize that, I still can’t get out of the cycle of no sleep.

I currently just started Prozac 10mg (day 3) and then have taken 50mg of Trazodone each night.  

Any advice on getting some well needed sleep :) all comments welcome.

608,2,"Hi there, I was diagnosed with GAD some months ago and was mainly dealing with it while being a stay at home mom.

612,2,"TL;DR: Got back from a 9-day trip with my brother (2000 km, hiking, site seeing early mornings, intense pace). We crossed 7 time zones to get there. I didn’t rest much before or after, and now feeling weird sensations like burning skin at times, nausea, eye burning and watering and heaviness in the body. It’s causing me to feel anxious. I have health anxiety from a past serious illness, so my brain has me worrying a bit. Could this just be sleep debt + nervous system burnout? Anyone else experience a post-travel crash? 

****

Hi all, looking for some grounded perspective. I’m in a bit of an anxiety spiral and trying to stay logical.

I just got back from a trip several days ago. My bro and I traveled 2000 km in 9 days, I did all the driving, we did lots of hiking, early mornings and new places. It was beautiful but intense. I’ve also been dealing with work stress leading up to the trip and didn’t get enough rest before or after. I usually sleep 9–10 hours, but on the trip I was getting more like 6–8, other than one 9 hour sleep. 

Now I’m feeling:

	•	Burning watery eyes 
	•	Mild nausea and body feels heavy 
	•	Nerve sensitivity in my legs and arms
	•	General fatigue and “off” feeling and anxious

I have a history of a past serious health crisis that robbed me of 8 years of my life, so my brain is wired to panic a little when symptoms show up—even if they’re likely from exhaustion or overexertion. It’s been 10 days since I’ve been home, and I feel like I should be right as rain, but maybe travel burnout is a real thing and can take weeks to recover?

Could this just be nervous system burnout + sleep debt + health anxiety?

Thanks for reading. I really appreciate any reassurance or insight. "
613,2,"hey guys so im starting on Lexapro today… and I was wondering if smoking a bit of weed a day has much of a effect on it ?? I know drinking does, but I don’t drink.

615,2,"Two weeks ago I drank 3 nights in a row after 7 months of sobriety from Drugs and Alcohol. Alcohol is a major anxiety trigger and I am extremely prone to “hangxiety”. The day after the third day I had dizziness, trouble breathing, panic symptoms, probably a mix of panic attacks and withdrawal. 

It’s been two weeks and I’m still stuck in an anxiety spiral. Chronic shortness of breath feeling, lightheaded, sense of impending doom, and imagining weird OCD thoughts about internal organs that send me into a panic. Idk what to do and looking for some advice to break the spiral. "
616,2,Hi all! My doctor recently upped my lexapro from 30-40 and my buspar from 5 to 7.5 because my anxiety has come back bad and I can’t seem to shake it. I’ve been on both of these medications for years now and they have helped me tremendously. Just haven’t upped them in a long time and nervous about it. Anyone on these doses?
617,2,How to deal with panic attacks? I am having panic attacks for long time. I am trying to control this without taking any medicine but I am not able to do it. Any tips would be helpful.
618,2,Hi guys I’m a 21 year old girl and I’m supposed to hang out with this really cute guy I’ve been talking to tomorrow. I have horrible anxiety and I’ve never taken meds for it. We are supposed to be going to the movies. Idk if it’s like a date or what but I literally have never hung out with a guy 1 on 1 ever Becuase I get so anxious about it. I really wanna go but I’m sick to my stomach thinking about it like seriously. I think I’m gonna chicken out and ghost him like I always do. But like I’m 21 yo I need to get over this especially bc I want a boyfriend (not saying this guy will become my boyfriend I’m just saying in general) so bad how am I ever gonna get one if I can’t even hangout with a guy. Also another thing that makes me so anxious is I literally have never kissed anyone like what if he try’s to kiss me how do I even do that. I might start crying and throwing up. Just kiddding (kind of) Please help me out. Also I stalked his instagram and his ex girlfriend is so much prettier so there’s that to. And I only met him once at the bar and we were drunk so what if he sees me in the daylight and he’s like damn she’s actually hideous. If thinks don’t go well I’m gonna over think about this forever and probably never do it again so I’m scared.  Has anyone else dealt with this or am I just a weirdo. 
619,2,"I can’t take it anymore. This anxiety, or whatever I’m feeling, is taking over my life. It controls my everyday decisions, and affects my social life immensely. 

I get anxious, and begin to shut down completely. I go quiet at school. I sit by myself at lunch. I avoid texting and calling (and said apps in general). I avoid going out incase someone sees me and questions me. I procrastinate, and instead think of all the ways I could miss school and/or social events (faking sick, passing out, making myself throw up). I don’t hang out with others, just sit in my room, left alone with my thoughts. 

For example, I missed school on Friday, and some boys in my first period were talking to my friends abt me (just abt smth I did), and then they were talking to my other friend abt it in his class. It wasn’t necessarily bad or mean, but I’ve been desperately trying yo find a way to avoid going to school in Monday because of it, despite knowing they’ll probably forget it by then. 
Another example of this is hanging out w my bf. It’s my first relationship, and we’ve been dating for a little more than a month. He’s really great: sweet, understanding, and not pushing me whatsoever. My bsf has made him aware that if anything is rushed I will begin to shut down, but I’m already doing that. I can’t hang out with him no matter what. It feels as if theres this huge pressure on me, even though there really isn’t. I skipped class last week to avoid it, I just can’t do this anymore. 

I really don’t know how to deal w it. I don’t have a therapist, and I’m definitely not going to talk to my parents abt it, but it’s really effecting me. It’s not something I can control. It’s consuming me, and taking over. I need help. Pls.

is there any way you can successfully be treated for anxiety? and not feel like youre walking on death row?"
621,2,Why do I question if I actually love my boyfriend every time I hit a stage where I’m overthinking a lot? I already stress myself out thinking he’s cheating or doesn’t love me when he doesn’t cheat or do anything wrong but my past relationship destroyed me and i think that’s why. i also suffer with severe anxiety & intrusive thoughts & severe brain fog which does not help
622,2,"I guess that's what panic attacks are anyway lol
But I'm talking about when you're just relaxing and they come out of nowhere. 
I've been dealing with that a few times here lately.

623,2,"i wasnt sure where exactly to ask about this but i need to at least talk about it. this sounds so stupid but i get really obsessed with things, mainly shows or video games, and a new episode of this show im obsessed with is about to drop and if i look at any of the updates or anything i have a really hard time breathing and start freaking out a bit. like i used to scroll through stuff the creator would post about the show and anything that had to do with like important events/future episodes (especially about my favourite character) would practically send me into fight or flight. just thinking about it, i contsantly have to calm myself down from the edge of a panic attack. WHY does this happen?? its just a tv show?? why do i panic more over this than anything in the real world that actually has an influence on my life??? i have a lot of trouble with some gnarly anxiety but this just doesnt make much sense to me. ITS JUST A TV SHOW"
624,2,"So I’ve noticed my first reading is always a bit higher diastolic. I feel like intense my stomach and breath shallower. At neurologist or ER visits it ranges from 135-160 / 85-99. At home it’s 90-125 / 62-89. When I’m relaxed I’ve seen it 96/56, 102/68, 110/72, 107/74. I know anxiety raises it and I’m scared about long term effects. I do not smoke or drink I take care of my body the anxiety is just sometimes uncontrollable and I spiral into panic. The anticipation of the first reading scares me and it’s worse in medical settings. Anyone have similar experiences? What helped you? "
625,2,"Im tense non stop and my have is non stop clenched. Also, the same with my shoulders. Everything becomes tense from that, my eyes hurt, my neck ,my head... 

I even get pain above my Adam's apple and hoarse voice, face twitching around my right eye and eyebrows. Every time I pay attention I notice my shoulders are elevated in a tight position and my jaw is clenched.

Is there a way to retrain brain to stop these habits? I was also thinking about starting daily stretching routine and investing in my chair to sit properly since Im sitting all day long.

630,2,"Got a gaming laptop yesterday.

Today my older cousins came and asked to show me the laptop. After a few calls i gave it to them. They just used it like a normal person. Like a normal human would do nothing else. But i am still anxious. About the whole situation. It happened in the morning and i am still thinking about it, its 3:26AM. 

The laptop was on a laptop stand, the screen was a bit directed downwards so they just made it vertical, possibly a total of 120 to 130 degrees. The laptop supports 160( maybe even 180, i am conflicted about the info) turns. But i am still anxious they damaged something. I am still making up scenarios in my mind how my laptop is fucked. I am thinking about how maybe they did not close the lid the right way or they used forced all types of weird stuff. I am telling you the main stuff, a lot more minor stuff is going in my head.

I in some part of my head do not want to use that laptop anymore. I just dont. I am tired of the anxiety. I wanna smash it hard on the ground. It feels satisfying in my head. I am just so frustrated and scared and angry idk rn. I just didnt want to damage my laptop. I did not want anyone to touch it. I did not want people to.


But if i refused, they would think i am rude or maybe crazy? Ahhh.I got this laptop for college and its pretty expensive (980 dollars)

i just dont feel sane rn."

632,2,"Well, I’ve been struggling with this every single night, and it feels so freaking bad!!! Feels like I’m having some sort of anxiety attack while sleeping, bc I get to feel the same sensation of having no control over my own body. I consciously want to open my eyes or move — but just can’t do it. Then, it seems like I’m “trapped” in my own body and I want to yell for help so bad which is EXACTLY how anxiety makes me feel. A mixture of fear, euphoria and panic. I don’t know what to do :( I’m on excitalopran 20mg + trazodone 50mg + Amitriptyline 50mg. Along with anxiety, I’m also diagnosed with bpd, mdd and ptsd."
633,2,"Hi everyone, I could really use some words of encouragement.

Back in January, I had my first-ever panic attack. Since then, I’ve been living with daily anxiety, intense enough that I couldn’t leave my house for a while.

For five months, I tried everything natural: supplements, breathing exercises, diet changes you name it. My partner was hesitant about daily medication, so I held off. But eventually, it became clear I needed more support, and I started an SSRI.

Now I’m in week 5. I’ve started going outside again, even driving a little and honestly, that feels huge. I’m also in therapy, working hard to take back control of my life, one step at a time.

The hard part is that my fiancé is still struggling to accept this. He’s embarrassed to tell his friends and family, who don’t really understand anxiety or medication. I once saw he googled: “Is it weird to have a partner who takes an SSRI?”

We’re actually engaged, and his dad told him to wait to get married “until I’m better”. This broke me. We’ve been together for 4.5 years and his dad felt like mine. 

It’s a lonely and confusing place to be, to feel proud of the progress I’m making while also feeling like I need to hide it.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation, dealing with anxiety while also navigating a partner or family who just don’t get it?

Would love to hear how you’ve handled it, or even just a few words of encouragement. ❤️"
634,2,"23M 5’9 145lbs “I’ve been smoking on a daily basis for around 3 years now, i’ve had my anxious moments through those years but never a “anxiety attack” around 2 weeks ago i was doing my usual late night routine of smoking weed and playing my video games when i felt a sudden discomfort in my chest that eventually went into my left arm. I immediately went to google and type in what i was feeling and started to panic due to it stating i was having a heart attack, that same night i decided to go cold turkey. The very next morning on my way to work i felt the same feeling so i decided to drive myself to the ER. Since then i have had 3 hospital visits, so much blood work and EKGs and even a stress test from the cardiologist to fully convince myself i wasn’t having some type of heart attack or heart related issue. 2 Weeks into being cold turkey i am dealing with lack of appetite, i keep waking up in the middle of the night and cant seem to go back to bed, palpitations, a lot of burping, i still occasionally feel the light pains and feelings in my chest and my arm but ignore it assuming it is just health anxiety but the fact 2 weeks into it im still feeling the same way has been driving me mentally insane. I randomly start tearing up or starting to worry about my health and i can’t shake it. How long does it take for the THC withdraws to go away and get better it is truly taking a major toll on my mental sanity."

637,2,"What's your dosage and schedule look like?

I have been struggling for weeks with somatic anxiety symptoms (palpitations, sweats, muscle tightness, all the good stuff) and after consulting with a psychiatric nurse practitioner, I was put on 10 mg propranolol twice daily, as needed. Part of the reason for this is I am tired of relying on Klonopin (usually 0.5 mg, but 1 mg if needed) to help with my symptoms, but also heard that propranolol is good for helping with palpitations in particular.

My first dose, I definitely noticed ""something,"" like an edge was taken off, but only slightly. The second time I took it I barely noticed anything. Is 10 mg typically a pretty low dose for this stuff, at least for anxiety purposes? And for those of you taking it, what's your dosage look like?"

640,2,"If someone has had or has something similar, please let me know.

This started over a week ago. I thought maybe I was getting bronchitis as I've had it many times in the past. I had what felt like a burned throat deep down, no redness or swelling, though. It almost felt like my trachea was burned, not my esophagus.

Anyway, I started getting this feeling of congestion/light pressure in my throat. I'd try to cough, but nothing would come up & it'd almost make the feeling worse.

I ended up going into urgent care, they did an xray. Nothing found in my lungs.

They thought maybe it was the horrible pollen here in wisconsin right now. (You can literally see green dust in the air & my car is green in the morning.) So they gave me albuterol & an antibiotic just in case.

I'm still having this weird pressure/congestion feeling, and it's really starting to scare me. I can breathe just fine & exercise, no shortness of breath, which is the weird part. This feeling is just kind of always ""there"".

I've had panic & anxiety for the majority of my life & I know it can do some weird stuff, but this is a new one. Even when I'm relaxed it's still there...."

fast forward, it did it all week. not all day but either random ones throughout the day or a few minutes here and there but it’s for sure gotten more frequent. it was so bad thursday that i called an ambulance. they did a 12 lead, twice, and said my heart rhythm was normal but beating hard and fast but i was also panicking. but it also wasn’t doing it while they were running the test so it wouldn’t have caught it. 

i haven’t taken my blood pressure in years due to white coat hypertension and i have had blood work done in a long time either. i am spiraling so bad. i have a cardiologist appt in a few days and a regular dr’s appt in a couple weeks but i am terrified. has anyone ever had anything like this? it does it so bad sometimes i feel like its going to stop altogether. my pulse is literally all over the place. 

little side note, i’ve been chronically stressed for years but never had this happen before now. 

thank you guys 😭😭"

644,2,"I work as an intern at a law firm. I attend meetings time to time as a note-taker for the meetings. There is a meeting on the 4th of September that I need to be present for. However, I took the first week of September off. We only have 5 days that we can take off during a year and honestly I need that week in September because I work very hard in my firm, always stay till midnight. I took that week off because I want to go on holiday and it’s also possible that I will also be moving houses during that week. I told the partner who is in charge of the meeting if we can adjourn the meeting to a later date and he agreed. I also told him that I could participate online. However, I panicked and only told him about possibly moving and not a holiday. There is a big possibility that the move will happen on October so it feels like I lied to him. It was never my intention to lie. I never try to get out of work, instead I work over time almost every single day. I desperately need that week off.

647,2,"This is a pretty long post but I wanted to cover everything so thanks in advance for reading. For context I’m a 19 year old girl.

so I’ve always been a pretty anxious/stressed person but it’s always just been in my head. Overthinking, pressure, stuff like that. Never had any physical symptoms. But a few days ago that totally changed and I’m freaking out.

A few nights ago I tried to go to sleep but every time I started drifting off, I’d feel this wave of numbness over my whole body and it would wake me up. It happened over and over until I eventually drifted off to sleep. I had work the next day which I was stressed about but I’ve been way more stressed in my life with none of these symptoms.

The next day my resting heart rate was pretty high above 110. I had to go to a party that night and in the uber my hr was above 120 the whole ride there. I felt better at the party but at one point while sitting down I felt the wave of numbness again and I checked my hr and it was 160. I ordered the uber back and in the uber my hr calmed to 110.

 Since then I’ve had:
	•	Feeling like I have to manually breathe
	•	A weird rushing feeling in my chest when I’m trying to fall asleep
	•	Super aware of my body all the time

The only thing I can think of that triggered all of this is that I smoked weed maybe two weeks ago and I greened out really bad.

I’ve been trying to make some lifestyle changes (going to bed earlier, taking walks) things I have never done before (used to go to bed super late, not very active) I’ve also quit vaping two days ago since I thought the vape could’ve been contributing to all this. I want to see a doctor/psychiatrist but my parents are pretty traditional and don’t believe in mental disorders. If I do go to a doctor what are they most likely to recommend? 

I’m just confused why I’m now all of sudden feeling physical effects of anxiety when I’m not even that stressed (it’s summer break-no finals etc) when I’ve never had a panic attack before. 

Any advice would be appreciated!

650,2,"For the past couple of months I've been dealing with this feeling that has been overtaking me and my life. Lately, my mind has been feeling like mush - I feel like mush. I feel hazy and out of it, almost like I'm in a mode of adrenaline or something or stressed and overwhelmed (despite the fact that personally, I don't think I'm having a stressful time at the moment). Because of this, I constantly CONSTANTLY have this urgent panic that I'm forgetting to do something or there's something I'm not doing, that I'm wasting my time, that somethings coming. It's so distinct that I feel like I spend basically all of my time thinking about what I'm supposed to be doing. I blamed it for a bit on my phone - tik tok and reels making me forget about stuff maybe. But it's happening even when I'm not using my phone - and doing productive things. 

It's taking over me - despite me being aware of this feeling and not missing or forgetting anything in my life, I still feel convinced by it that I am supposed to be doing something. it's a pit in my stomach and tightness in my chest, and no matter how many times I tell myself that there is nothing I am forgetting, I still believe that I am. Its making me feel incrediby forgetful and out of it. I'm feeling disconnected and it makes me completely unable to actually plan things in my life - because I always feel like I've got a million things to do already that I'm not doing. I've never had anything like this before, so consistent and convincing. Anyone got any advice? I'll take any ideas you got. "
651,2,"hi all 
i just wanted to know if i was the only one who experienced this. so i hâve ibs-m and have issues around going to the bathroom. a few years ago i’d get SO anxious about it to the point i wouldn’t est just to avoid it. recently i’ve realised i get very nauseous whenever i need the bathroom. i know it’s anxiety based bc the nausea often passes afterwards, or - like today - im left feeling a bit shaky. does anyone else experience this?"
652,2,"Hey. I'm.not sure how long this will be but I'll try to be as specific as I can. 38M from UK who was diagnosed with anxiety about 14 years ago after having bouts of very very fast heart beats. Heart tests were normal. For years my anxiety only manifested as palpations and mental symptoms though I did have 2 hospital admissions with fast AF early on. I became cardiophobic. Too scared to exercise as it increases heart rate etc.

 Fast forward to 18 months when new symptoms emerged. One day I went light headed. This episode lasted for about 5 hours. I was at work and having finished shift I didn't feel safe to drive home so I got my mum to get me and take me home. This symptom happened more and more and became more regular. It feels like a progression. I also noticed one of my pupils would randomly dilate and I was beginning to get blurry vision. I went to the opticians who noted the same thing but tests otherwise normal. Ive seen neuro also who ruled out seizures.  Saw an ophthalmologist who cleared me of anything serious. My eye when dilates reacts to light normally

Other symptoms stared to appear. Light headedness, dizziness, blurred vision, tingling all over my body. Like my peripheral nerves are firing, trembling and shaking. These would get very intense and last anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours. They make me quite unwell. Very unwell infact. I can become very close to passing out wothout actually passing out. I can best describe it as having really low blood pressure. Those type of symptoms. During a really bad episode I was at a football game (soccer for the US folk) and flagged down a first aider. I was feeling very very dizzy, feeling incredibly weak. I also get very loud and prominent tinnitus during the episodes.  Blood pressure was slightly elevated, heart rate a little tachy but otherwise normal. I had a brain MRI, again normal. These episodes feel very neurological. Anxiety does not trigger it. I can be as calm as I can but it doesn't make much of a difference. 

As someone who has had anxiety disorder for 14 years why are these symptoms appearing now. What's changed. I'm having therapy but its not working on the physical side. Mentally I try to remain strong. But these physical symptoms are unbearable and no one can give me an explanation what is going on. They can last hours, make me feel very very unwell. I dont find typical anxiety symptoms that happen. No edginess, hyperventilation, tachycardia (95% of the time). Your typical anxiety attacks or feelings. They feel totally different to my anxiety attacks and have now become an almost daily occurence. I take bisoprolol low dose and I do vape a very low dose  3mg nicotine. Vaping can exacerbate the symptoms intensely. I dont do it much however and im working on quitting completely. I cannot completely blame it though. They happen regardless if I've used it or not. Ive had episodes after drinking tea so I've thought of caffeine as a possible trigger too. Ive had some of my worst episodes when I've abstained from both. I also get the worst headaches I've ever experienced afterwards. 

I'm trying to tell myself that it is anxiety but im struggling to understand why be one way for so long and then this start now. Tests are normal and im thankful they are. The physical nature of it rather than mentally (where my life is in a really good place). Could it be years of years of stress thats caused it. I feel really ill when they happen. As ill as I've ever felt. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. Ive no control. My brain starts a series of cascading symptoms.  Are there others that have been through similar and what happened. As at the minute it's hugely affecting my quality of life. I'm convinced it is my brain doing it. Nervous systems going haywire.  I cant think of any other explanation. I dont want this life im experiencing atm. Ive 10 months left at uni studying to be a nurse. I understand this has its stressors but uni are really good in helping to reduce this. Ive a great and supporting wife and close family and we are financially OK. Ive been told by a few professionals that they suspect ASD with hyperfocusing so im about to have an assessment with this. Is this/could be anxiety or should I be having a deeper talk with doctor for something health wise?

If you've read all that then thank you. 😊 "

I’m still finishing my master’s degree and I’ll start a 6 month internship in three months. It’s a required step, but I can’t shake this overwhelming feeling that I’m behind especially when I compare myself to others my age or even younger.

At 23, I went through a kind of lost year. I didn’t do much. I’m not even sure what was going through my head at the time, but now I look back and feel like I wasted valuable time. 

Right now, I do have a few things lined up. I’ve been doing small jobs, like being a chess tournament arbiter for kids, and I’ll be working as a summer camp monitor in July. I’m also finishing up my last uni assignment this week. I know I’m making progress, and I’m grateful for that, but it still feels slow. I just want to feel financially independent, able to travel to the most amazing places, build my own life, buy a house someday… and the fact that I’m not there yet makes me feel stuck and inadequate.

My anxiety has recently been pretty rough. I had a panic attack which really set me back. 2 months ago I couldn’t even drive 5 minutes. Now I can drive 45 minutes on the interstate, but it is tough. My arms get numb, I’m dizzy, and I get exhausted.

I’m afraid a week long trip in an unfamiliar area is going to be too much for me. And the airport is really stressing me out. I can’t even drive an hour yet, how am I going to tolerate being trapped in a metal tube in the air for hours?

I’m afraid if I don’t go though, I’ll reinforce this anxiety. I just don’t know if this is a jump too far though. I honestly think it probably is, I’ve done this trip once before on medication, and it was still tough. And that was back when I could drive 9 hours straight no problem, and I was feeling relatively little anxiety. Currently I’m pretty much always on edge"
663,2,"Hi everyone. I'm 22. I'll be 23 next month, hopefully.

I've been dealing with anxiety for years now. My worst time was like 5 years ago when I suffered a psychotic episode from cannabis abuse. So I know really well how anxiety and a distorted vision of reality affects someone. Since then I've been doing better. Until last week...

I had the strangest panic attack ever. I was cooking dinner with my mom when I suddenly stoped feeling my left arm, like, completely. I started freaking out but manged to push trough for a bit. Eventually, the stress got so intense that my blood preassure went down really fast to the poitn were I almost passed out. My parents quickly brought me to ER, but like not in a hospital, just a clinic. They checked my blood preassure and my pulse and said that everything was fine and that I just needed to relax and get some sleep. 

Next day I woke up with a weird feeling in my arm, like some kind of tinggles and some pain now and then. I went all day trying to ignore It but I was extremely paranoid so I went again to the ER, this time by myself. They told me again that I was fine and that I had nothing to worry about. They told me that maybe It had something to do with a damaged nerve on my arm or even my neck/back.

Having this information, I decided to finally go to the hospital to get some tests done. They did a quick blood test, an electrocardiogram and a neck x-ray. Everything was fine, but the x-ray showed that I have a bit of cervical hyperkyphosis (my neck is more curved than It should be) and that MAYBE It's pinching a nerve and causing all of these issues.

My family doctor took all of the results and decided to prescribe me pregabalin. She said that It will help me with my issues right now, including the absurd amount of anxiety I've been dealing with since the first episode.

It's only been two days since I started taking pregabalin and I don't expect It to work like a magic pill from the first time I take It, but I just can't take It anymore.

My left arm feels weird almost all day, I feel tired even tho I've been less active this last week, I have sharp chest pains, they only last for a second but It feels like someone is stabing me on the chest, my neck also hurts and I've been having heartburns for almost 4 days now. I'm always paranoid that something's wrong with me and that a really terrible thing is about to happen. I've never experience so much anxiety in my life, not even when reality literally broke apart right in front of me. I really don't want to feel like this, It's tiring. 

Am I going crazy? Am I really having a fucking heart attack? I'm so tired."
664,2,"I feel like a burden, and very guilty.
I have loving parents, a couple of nice friends, I go to private uni which is great, I have good grades (until I got bad again and my grades are starting to slip) and a home and food on my plate.
What should I be worried about? Why am I like this? I am slowly slipping away."

Recently I have been having some symptoms that my health anxiety is driving me nuts about. About 2 weeks ago I woke up after sleeping on my stomach with some rib pain in my upper ribs where the bottom of my breast meets my rib cage. When that started happening I started focusing on my breathing so intensely for a few days that it was hurting my sternum to breathe in and out because I was constantly tensed up and over thinking if I was breathing normally. I chalked this up to my sleeping position on my stomach making me have the sharp pains in my ribs and the anxiety making my chest feel tight and painful when breathing, I also noticed that the pains really only happened when I started to focus on them I think. Anyways, those symptoms have gone away for the most part, but now I keep having this weird sensation in my chest for the last few days and I cannot for anything figure out what is causing it. It’s like when I breathe out I have the sensation of phlegm in my chest very slightly, but when I cough it’s absolutely dry. I have to make myself cough as well because I don’t feel like I need to cough like I have when I’ve been sick. I can’t get anything to come up at all. I also haven’t been sick in forever. It doesn’t happen every time I breathe in or out either, it’s random but happens sporadically throughout the day for the last few days. I also am still having random small sharp pains in my rib cage and sternum on both sides every now and then but it’s not debilitating, it’s like a quick little cramp almost and then it stops. I’m terrified I have a collapsed lung or lung cancer or something. I also have vaped for a few years and stopped a few days ago because I was worried that was what was causing this, but it’s still happening. I bought a pulse oximeter because I thought it would ease my thoughts if I knew my oxygen levels were fine but I’ve seen probably 20 comments on here in other subs where people have had collapsed lungs and their oxygen levels were still fine so now that’s not helping me at all. I can’t determine if I’m having these random sharp pains in my chest and ribs because I’m over thinking and making myself have them or if they’re happening because something is wrong. Also twice in the last 2 weeks while going to sleep I’ve convinced myself that I can’t breathe and I feel like I’m not getting enough air but again, don’t know if I’m feeling that way because it’s a symptom of something or if it’s all in my head and I’m making myself feel short of breath. I do not have health insurance and I’m still paying off a $800 ER bill from when I thought I was having a heart attack a few months ago and I was fine. I’m 24 years old and active and healthy. I also had an EKG and chest X-ray less than 6 months ago and everything looked normal. "
666,2,"i have been doing well with my anxiety yea i’ll have some moments but ive been reacting to it well and not feeling anxious. yesterday at work my heart was racing for the entire afternoon i didn’t check my watch to feed into it but i was constantly feeling for my pulse, i got home and i could just feel my heart racing for hours it wasn’t high high it would just chill around the 110-120 range then i started freaking out thinking my heart was going to give out because it’s been beating like that for a couple of hours. which caused me to go into a panic attack, luckily it didn’t last long only a couple seconds and i was able to chill out for a little i had an ice pack on my neck and i played some video games and was able to calm down. i woke up super early today for no reason its a saturday and i love my sleep and i can hear the rain outside which i love, but i woke up this morning feelings super anxious idk what happened yesterday but im also feeling some impending doom, like i feel like im just waiting for something to happen and it makes me so anxious it feels like something is wrong with me im terrified that this is going to build up into a bad panic attack. 

i was doing so well with my anxiety when stuff like this happens it makes me lose hope and think that this is going to be how i feel for the rest of my life. if i make it that long (sorry that was my health anxiety speaking). i have a trip coming up on thursday and im going to tx, last time i was there was for valentine’s day and i had a bad panic attack where i almost went to the hospital luckily all the hospitals were far and that made me not go. but im just scared of this anxiety building up and that happening again bc that really sucked and i felt so bad for my bf when it happened, after it passed i just cried in his arms i felt so bad it was after our valentines dinner. 

i’m so tired of feeling this way, any recommendations on how to let this pass i would greatly appreciate it <3 "
667,2,"When I was in 7th grade, the principal of my old school took all my joy away by mentally abusing me. Every time I cried, disagreed with her opinion, or did something that was considered wrong, she would tell me I was the dumbest kid in the world and scream at me. I asked my parents to send an email to her, asking her to stop, but they refused, citing the COVID-19 pandemic as why she acted this way. Now, I’m 16, and because of what she did and other traumatic factors, I became clingy to everyone who wanted to be friends with me. People got annoyed and I’ve lost so many friends because I of my clinginess and I wish they would just understand. Now, my RSD is heightened and I cry so often because they don’t understand. I officially have no friends and give up on trying. I wish people understood that I never wanted to be a dick, I just had to be one. Now, I’m at risk of losing another friend, so if anyone has any advice, please comment below."
668,2,Hey guys. I switched from Cymbalta to Vybriid about a month ago. I’ve noticed that I’ve been extra irritable and a little bit less happy on the Vybriid- but the physical symptoms I was having with the Cymbalta are sooo much better. Has anyone had this experience with Vybriid? Did it get better after some time or should I just go ahead and try something different?
669,2,"I just wanted to see that i am not alone, so i wanted to write here... We made a plan with two of my friends, weeks ago. We were going to go to the beach, to have dinner, and to party. I trusted them and I was really looking forward to my birthday party. One of them found lots of excuses not to show up a day before my birthday, and the other one didnt want to show up if it was only going to be just the two of us. I tried to reach out to one of my other friends but she didnt want to do what i wanted to do. So i am all alone again. In my room crawled under my blanket for my birthday. Every birthday of mine i am promising to myself that i am not going to be alone this year, but i always end up being alone. At least i am trying to stay stronger this time. But why this does keep happening? I have always showed up for my friends. I supported them whenever they needed me. This is what i deserve in return?

672,2,"Like how much water I'm drinking. I've always drank a lot of water but never once used to worry about it and my blood tests are always normal. But now suddenly this past week I am obsessing over it, keeping a log of how much fluids I'm getting and worried about if I'm drinking too much or too little. It's crazy considering I never used to worry about it at all and nothings changed health wise.

Have any of you started worrying about things that never used to be of concern?"

Like the title says i just got prescribed hydroxyzine tablets. I haven’t taken them till today. The instructions are to take 1 tablet 4 times a day as needed for anxiety. I took one because i was feeling anxious and then after eating I took another because i panicked heavy. Now im anxious about my anxiety meds. Unbelievable turn of events. I feel tired and like i have to poop. 

Edit// Thanks for all the replies and help easing me. You wouldn’t believe it, but i think i was panicking about my reaction because of my anxiety. 😟😟😟 LOL thanks again. i feel better than earlier. If anything just still tired, anxious, and have chest discomfort cause my anxiety does that. "
674,2,"I had anxiety last year. Almost all symptoms are resolved now. But as soon as I fall asleep, I wake up feeling like my breathe has stopped. This is especially during short naps and onset of sleep. Anybody has this? And what is this"
675,2,Sometimes I will feel a lump in my throat then my bpm gets higher.  It will last for few mins and comes in waves. is this anxiety induced? And how to stop this feeling because it scares me.

It makes me want to scream and I'm constantly shaking like an elderly purse dog. I currently am on prozac but recently some events happened that have skyrocketed my anxiety to a level that not even the medication can get under control. 

At the moment im a work and because I cant leave my post I ordered grub hub. Except after eating 2 bites I started getting in my own head about how it could have been poisoned by the driver and maybe he had a vengeance against me for only tipping 20% instead of 25%. So I set a timer for 30 minutes and even though those 30 minutes are up and I feel physically fine my anxiety is so bad I keep getting tunnel vision and feeling like I'm going to pass out at the front desk. And this sort of irrational thing happens every. Day. Multiple times a day. I have no idea how to deal with it because I can't afford therapy... 

I just feel miserable and I feel like I'm I pushing everyone in my life away by being so hesitant to do anything or go anywhere out of fear. "
677,2,"I recently (19y/o female) just came back from college. I have had a history of anxiety, but I generally stopped feeling it at school and in the dorms. But when I came back for summer, I found myself in an anxiety spree for the past 3 days. It honestly feels like my blood sugar rapidly drops. I try to do breathing to make it go away which it kinda helps, but it always circles back.

It’s accompanied by light headedness and elevated heart rate. However when my family member takes my blood pressure, it’s normal (both standing and sitting down/laying). I also feel tingling in my hands and feet sometimes. Chest pain. But my main concern is my heart rate. I just tried to take a shower and it started beating super fast. I couldn’t finish my shower. 

I’m worried this is something more than anxiety. Usually when I would experience anxiety, I just felt nauseous. But now, it’s affecting my head, heart rate, and also my ability to move around without getting dizzy. Has anyone else experienced this, who has found help? It came on so suddenly. I even had to stop driving the other day because I was worried I was gonna pass out. It also kinda feels like I can’t really focus myself (my vision isn’t blurry, but if I were to try and read something hard I would just kinda zone out)

EDIT: forgot to mention was off my birth control pill (yaz) for two weeks (insurance issue) and also have Xanax prescribed to me. When I take the Xanax it helps relax me but heart rate continues to be the same the next day."
678,2,"Hello, as I said im 21 y/o. I suffer from agoraphobia because im scared of having diarrhea. I tried eating better, less lactose, doing physical exercice, breathing exercices, exposure therapy but i feel like i still can’t go outside without having to take immodium.

I went to see a psychiatrist, but everything seemed odd. It lasted 30minutes before i was diagnosed with agoraphobia and depression. He told me to take 50mg of sertraline and after a week to take 100mg, and if everything was fine, to not see him again and get the prescription from my doctor. I was hesitant as it seems like a lot to start so i went to see my doctor and she told me its too early to take antidepressant and to only take sertraline when i need it (kinda like xanax)

Am I really too young ? Should I go see another psychiatrist ? Should I still try sertraline ? If I take an antidepressant, will the therapy still be useful (as i will feel less anxious for exposure therapy) ?

Sorry if thats a lot of question but I’m on holiday and i just want to be able to see my friends and do things. Thank you so much if you reply !🫶🏻"
679,2,"About 8 years ago, i had 3 classmates (who were friends with each other) and pretended to be my friends too. Whoever sat behind me, they used to whisper to them to annoy me/hit me . 
Once i confronted one of them and asked him why he was doing this. He said he isn't doing anything. I even threatened him that I will involve my parents in this. However, they still continued to do so. No one actually did anything to me. But it was distracting. I wasn't able to focus on what teacher was teaching.
When i moved to a different place to study after 2 years of being their classmate, even then they called me two times(they did not say who they were. But i came to know eventually).
Then for 4 years i studied in a different state . Once i came back, i made some new friends and one of them(who was nice to me initially) after sometime started hitting my testicles every now and then and also was rude. When i told him that it's causing me urinary problems, he said no it doesn't. I guess it was those guys who told him to hurt me. 
I have one big question in mind: Why me? One of those 3 classmates has a pic with one of my distant cousin. They live close. I once(8 yrs ago) asked that classmate if he knows my distant cousin and he replied no. The pic I saw is recent one. Also, my political ideology was totally different from most in class and I was famous for that. I don't know if any of this made them do it. I don't know anyone who had to face people like these in life. Also didn't find any such person on Reddit. So the question still is : Why me? "
680,2,"I totally understand I should speak to a psychiatrist but I deal with anxiety that  manifests almost entirely through physical symptoms. I have experienced probably 25+ symptoms in the last 3 months. 

Symptoms: dp/dr, headaches, shortness of breath, weird brain zaps, eye floaters, static in vision, feeling light headed, chest pain, shaking and stomach twitching, heat flashes, nausea, palpitations, seeing colors/rainbow when getting a panic attack, feeling like in a dream, light sensitivity, neck tension (feeling like I can’t hold my head up), dizzy when standing up, insane head pressure and ear ringing (tinnitus) muscle weakness and more! 


Funny enough, all of these symptoms last like 1-2 weeks before I get a new set of symptoms, it’s like my anxiety evolves. 

I’m not on any srris and don’t want to be, has anyone tried propranolol for physical anxiety? I’ve tried CBT and things have gotten better but I still want to try something else out to help in my recovery. Any advice or tips is appreciated! 




Note: I think it’s my body’s stress response. I don’t really have mental anxiety. "

689,2,"Ive been in therapy and on meds for a while now, but still pretty much every day for a majority of the day I feel like I'm in fight-or-flight mode for no descernible reason. If I try to think about my feelings, I end up finding something to be anxious about because of course I was going to. And if I try to ignore it, it doesn't go away and ends up taking all of my energy. The only things I've found that give me any sort of relief are mindful breathing (but literally only when I'm focusing on my breath, as soon as I focus on anything else the feeling comes back the same), and weed sometimes. It makes me feel like I don't have any control over my own emotions and I wish I could just feel relaxed, like fully relaxed, for once. Does anyone else experience this too? Are does your anxiety always come with a specific thought process attached to it? 

I feel like I constantly need someone to just tell me that everything is okay because I clearly dont know how to feel that way on my own. But my therapist says I shouldn't rely on other people for emotional regulation but like where else am I supposed to learn it? No one ever taught me how to actually do that. I don't have really anyone in my life besides my therapist who even tries to calm me down, they just either dismiss or ignore my feelings or they end up making me feel worse because they dont know how to handle their own emotions either. So I just stopped talking to people about stuff and now I'm looking online just to see if there's anyone out there that can somehow make me feel less alone and more supported.

691,2,"Hello all,

I’m coming back to this sub after a really long time since I’ve finally got on meds. Since January I’ve been on a tricyclic antidepressant called Dosulepin which I take every night. Started off with 25 mg and am up to 75 mg (my doctor wanted to get me till here) and it’s working well for my mood in general. I have also been prescribed 20 mg Propranolol which I take every morning before food. Overall, I’ve not faced any physical symptoms since Jan and I don’t feel that anxious anymore.

EXCEPT FOR LAST NIGHT.

Last night I woke up to a panic attack and my HR was at 147 (not had something like that since January, mind you). I drank some water and did some breathing exercises and also popped an emergency benzo that my doctor has also prescribed in case I feel anxiety. I went back to sleep after that. I also noticed that the whole of yesterday and today, my HR has been sitting at late 90s-early 100s throughout the day. I don’t really do much activity except for exercising for one hour daily.

I don’t know what’s happening all of a sudden. Everything was going fine till yesterday and I’m feeling very overwhelmed, anxious and scared to sleep now. Has anyone been through something similar? Should I go in for an early visit to my psychiatrist?"
692,2,"Hi everyone. I've had mild forms of anxiety for years with it being pretty stable. However, and this may sound insanse but after a long break I went back to the chiropractor and I think that combined with takong ashwagandha and votex trigged MASSIVE panic attacks. I thought I was going to die that night. I stopped the ashwagandha and it subsided but then for some dumb reason started taking it again. It's been almost a week since I stopped but I have a constant feeling of doom, feeling short of breath, feeling like my tongue is tingling and swelling (it's not), that my throat is closing and butterflies in my stomach. 

Sometimes the feeling of doom, tachycarida and tingling will ease up or even go away but the shortness of breath will stay. My blood pressure, O2 sat and capillary refill are all normal so I don't think it's a physical condition causing these symptoms. They're worse at night to the point I'm only sleeping 6 hours every other day. I can't keep going like this. 

I am under a moderate amount of stress dealing with a NMom (see my post in Raisebynarcissists (sp?). 

I also plan on stopping the vitex tonight in case that is making it worse but in the mean time nothing gives me more than a few moments of peace. Showers, cold packs, heating pads, skullcap, microdosing thc, magnesium, grounding excercises etc.

Please do not offer breathing excercises as they put the focus on feeling short of breath and make it worse. I also cannot take ativan as I am cursed with the rare side effect of tremors. I have reached out to my doctor and I'm trying to avoid the ER as tomorrow is father's day and I don't want to make it about me. 

Thanks in advance for any weird buy helpful suggestions. Even if they're not effectove for me personally. "

eft tapping - wtf is going on??

i’ve been in chronic flight or fight mode since 2023. im talking about EVERY symptom from head to toe. about 30 mins ago i was overthinking i legit thought i was gonna die. it felt like 500 elephants were on my entire body. i quickly did eft tapping properly for the first time but i don’t know if it worked a little or if im over reading stuff. my mum always does it but i thought it was stupid because my brain was like “ how is tapping on your face and body gonna get rid of your anxiety and help you think clearly” i was desperate so i did it anyways but this is what happened. 

- felt  extreme anxiety 
- began eft tapping while saying “ i am strong. i know that my body and mind is safe right now. i have nothing to be worried about and i know i have a dysregulated nervous system. my body is letting go of all tension and anxiety trapped within my limbs and brain” etc etc. 
- i did about 3 rounds, didn’t rly believe it was gonna help 
-  i felt like parts of my body was slowly fizzling out ( the anxiety and tension ) like my body could hear me?? 
- by the time i was done i felt a little more safe and comfortable. my thoughts were a bit more clear and my limbs ( especially my legs ) were buzzing?? 
- my anxiety went from 100% literal almost death to maybe 60%. could take around 2 or 3 more deeper breaths than usual while i had anxiety and was panicking. 

if this is my body becoming regulated ( i know it doesn’t happen instantly ) then damn im doing ts everyday 😭 my question is does that mean it ‘worked’??"

1. Is that true and 2. If anyone else struggles with something similar and have had something that’s helped. Thanks in advance! "
699,2,"Hi everyone, I’m going through some strange feelings I’ve never felt before and I was hoping I can get some insight. Maybe it’s panic related.

I’ve been diagnosed with GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) since I was about 16. I’m 25 now for context. Recently, I noticed that I start to have really sudden feelings out of nowhere that make me really uncomfortable. I’ll be doing a normal activity, for example just now I was laying in bed trying to fall back asleep since it’s early for me.nc

I then felt something really odd; I apologize since I’m not good at describing my feelings so I’ll do my best. My body starts to feel weird and almost warm, my head starts to feel almost tight and I get really really anxious. An immediate sense of fear about my physical health and it becomes hard to focus. I had to sit up and I called my brother because I get an urge to not be alone immediately.

I felt better very soon after once I started talking to him and the feeling went away. The weird thing about this to me is that it sometimes isn’t triggered by seemingly anything, rather just a really sudden random feeling that makes me feel like I might die because it’s so odd.

I’m wondering if this is a panic attack or something else. I also notice my body gets weak when this happens and I feel like it’s not as easy to breathe.

I just don’t want to have a serious health issue that I’m unaware of, I plan to go to the doctor very soon as I have an appointment set, but yeah.. it’s just kinda nerve wracking when that happens. I feel almost like I’m dissociating and desperately need to ground myself, but it’s also physical.

Another factor to consider is that I have been a daily weed smoker for about 5 years now and I just started trying to quit. I only smoke maybe once in a day if at all now but I just started doing this maybe a week ago. Thank you in advance"
700,2,"Hi for context I'm 19 and have been ignoring my mental health for far too long and I recently decided to do something about it I had crippling anxiety jittery hands shaky all that and i got 50mg sertraline it's been 2days atp and idk if it's helping or not and at what times do I usually take it should it be a fixed time or take it whenever my anxiety gets bad idk what to do my hearts always beating out of my chest 

Ps: I was told to take it at the same time every. Morning 
"
701,2,"How do y’all sleep with anxiety? The most I sleep is 2 hours and that’s during the day but I have anxiety of sleeping at night and I see things like flashes that make me panic any advice? 

Btw I don’t know what causes my anxiety and panic maybe because I live in a toxic household idk

And the chest pain is so uncomfortable I always think it’s a heart attack but I got to the ER and nothing wrong "
702,2,When I eat something right before bed it seems like I wake up with morning anxiety for the first couple hours.
703,2," TW: Body Dysmorphia/ Eating Disorders 


I have been overweight my entire life. It wasn't until this year I started taking my health seriously. I went to a dietician a few months ago for help. I have lost almost 10 pounds so far and losing some inches of fat. My starting weight was 204 lbs and now im at 195 lbs. 

I've always hated how my arms looked, which is why I never wore tank tops. They had to be covered up at all times, otherwise I would be super embarrassed about them. 

Today, I decided to wear a tank top at the gym.  It felt so much more comfortable, and honestly, no one was staring at me. For the first time in a long time, im actually starting to become more confident and less worried of what people may think of me. For me, this small win is a HUGE step. 

Thank you for reading. "
704,2,"Hello.
Im a 21 yr Girl who had a panik attack 1,5 month ago, since then i Got diagnosed with GAD.
Ive been overfocused on my Health and symptoms.
Ive been to the doctor and hospital multiple times. All my bloodwork is good and I got a ct of my stomach everything good
I started setraline 9 days ago.
I have a lot of small neck twitches, tremors and have gotten really bad headaches.
Since my panic attack I have had very weird vision and feel like I’m in a dream
I’m very scared I have like a brain tumor or something.
I have a mri in 2 days but I’m convinced I have a tumor. 
My headache is all over my head tho, sometimes sharper in my temples.
I do have a very stiff neck that hurts as well.
Has anyone had the same symptoms?
I’m very scared.

705,2,What was the best medicine you took for a uti that didn’t give you a panic attack. 
706,2,"Back in March, my Fitbit (not always a trustworthy source I have since learned) showed my heart rate dropping unusually low (low 50s), and I started feeling faint and tingly all over. I went to the ER and they told me I was fine, but it triggered intense health anxiety—panic attacks, many tests, and three more ER visits mostly for rapid heart rate, limb numbness, and adrenaline rushes. I started Propranolol in April and have been feeling more like myself since. The drawback is it lowers my blood pressure since I don't have high blood pressure normally. I still get occasional heart palpitations and daily have moments where it feels hard to breathe, but therapy is helping me not spiral over them. My primary doctor is recommending Zoloft due to how severe things were, but I’m on the fence now that I’m improving, and also worrying something could set me back again. Has anyone else been through something similar?

TL;DR: Doctor recommends Zoloft over Propoanolol for my health anxiety, but I’m hesitant since I’m improving. "
707,2,"Hi guys I'm posting again because I just panicked again. So I've read that there are cases where people died exactly when they thought they were going to die, and now it's absolutely caused my anxiety to skyrocket. I'm at my absolute lowest. My heart has been elevated the whole day, the last 2 days I've been thinking NON STOP about all of this, like absolutely overly obsessive, I wish I never looked up the nocebo effect at all. I'm so existentially terrified about psychogenic death that I don't know what to do. I have no access to meds since I'm overseas, what do I do??"
708,2,"I've been dealing with some pretty bad car anxiety since about July last year it started off pretty minor just some sweating and minor nausea while being in a car I'm not able to drive at all so the entire time I'm in a car I'm just a passenger but it's been getting far worse recently to the point I have a panic attack just going to the store 10 min drive away and it doesn't help that I have a wedding to go to later today which is a 2 hour drive out and on top of this I'm going to be a groomsman so I'll be extra nervous since I'm standing up in front of 120 people I know all the focus won't be on me at all but I can't help but think it will.

Some of the symptoms I get is just a typical anxiety attack I start shaking, get nauseous, sweating, entire body feels tingly and I start moving around a lot most of the symptoms come from the nausea cause I'm sitting there trying not to throw up and once all of it is done and I get out of the car I feel like I'm gonna fall over cause I'm so dizzy and tensed up.

The only reason I think it might be happening is because I've moved around so much in my life and have been in cars for 8+ hours straight multiple times in a stressful situation by moving as well as being in a car with my mom driving who also has major anxiety and freaks out sometimes while driving which has happened ever since I was young.

I don't know what to do the only way I can stop it from happening is distracting myself somehow I have a steam deck that I can play games on to try and help but I don't know if it'll actually work I've even brought a backup of a game on my phone in case my deck dies on me I'm also bringing a blanket and pillow to hopefully fall asleep if nothing else works I kind of just wish I had phone service so I could browse the internet with ease or listen to music that isn't a CD of music I don't listen to."
709,2,"I don't know if it's connected to my dreams or something but I remember them all and they don't seem different to normal. I've had a major spike in anxiety over the past year, like I've been an absolute mess, but it's eased off a lot recently.

The only thing that's still majorly affecting me is that every single time I wake up it's like I'm already halfway to a panic attack. My chest is tight, my heart is going crazy and it's like I can't breathe enough, I get that rushed urgent feeling like something bad is about to happen and I can't settle for the life of me for about an hour. It's making me start my day late from having to recover and also just not a great way to start the day tbh. 
Does anyone know any tips that can help ease anxiety like literally the second I regain consciousness? (Even before I open my eyes)"
710,2,"Hello reaching out of a friend who has had a seizure from heavy use for months in the past over a year ago and has been off of benzodiazepines since, but recently had 9 2mg bars in a 3 day span and worried about possible withdrawal mostly seizure.

i just feel like im too much"
712,2,"Hello reddit, I (16f) am writing this because I'm mad at myself but still anxiety ridden. I've had an uptick in Health anxiety the last maybe 2 years and I hate that I'm like this. This time it's Colon Cancer, 3 weeks ago it was a brain tumor I'm sick of it. I hate that I'm like this and the worst part is no one gets but even I don't get it. Earlier I was laughing about how silly I was for thinking the worst and now I'm sitting here googling symptoms while crying, it's so horrible. As much as my friends and my boyfriend love me and want me happy, I know they're getting tired of what I put myself through for no reason. I read the statistics and all the articles, I talk to everyone (But a therapist because I can't afford one) and nothing WORKS. I'm so afraid I'm going to lose other people over this but also that it'll consume my life, I'll be this anxiety ridden mess waiting for some miracle that'll fix whatever is wrong with me and my brain. I'm so tired of it. I just want to be normal. Reassurance doesn't work anymore and I'm just waiting for my ""symptoms"" to go away but honestly I think my anxiety is making them worse. Thank you for letting me rant, have a goodnight ❤️"
713,2,"For context, my dad has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer that has spread to his brain. He’s currently undergoing treatment, but I’ve been on edge lately. I was recently diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder with anxiety and depression, and I’ve been taking Clonazepam daily, but my anxiety just keeps getting worse.

I’m angry at everything, especially the cancer. My dad didn’t deserve this.

I see a psychiatrist and I’ve been open about my past suicide attempts, though I no longer act on them. My boyfriend, who said he’d support me through this, has been giving advice but it often feels textbook—nothing like “how are you feeling” or “do you want to talk about it,” even during arguments or when I’m clearly overwhelmed.

He’s distant and avoidant when I lash out, and while I know I’m not always easy to deal with, I expected a little more emotional presence, especially now. I get dry responses and it feels like he just doesn’t want to engage. I know I’ve lashed out because of the constant stress and anxiety, and he knows what I’m going through. I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I need help but i can’t even help myself."
714,2,"I've survived the 2nd year of College but in scared to go back in 3rd year. 

I think I'm afraid because I'm not really good at what I'm doing, architecture wasn't really my thing. I have chosen it because I thought it's related to digital Arts. thw workload is heavy and I just hate it.

My fear towards college just grows stronger and stronger. Probably because I'm not really good at Architecture, I'm just someone who is at the bottom of our class, I'm not good at drawings. It has lead me to depression before and also some addiction just to escape it. But one thing I just hated the most is going back to my aunt house, I hated it there, the food is awful, I rarely eat any food there. And the environment is also awful. 

I'm going back but idk how to go back without fearing college. I just want to start something Im having fun with, start learning editing videos, but knowing the work load of my course. I can't do it."
715,2,I am always jealous of people who have more of what I want. It causes a lot of toxic stress. Ways to cope?  
716,2,"Thinking about it too much will give me a panic attack. I don't think it's healthy to have so little contact with other people. I have no partner and no friends that I can casually hang out with. I have a couple friends in other states but sometimes it feels hard to get them on the phone and have an actual fun conversation. 

It makes me feel frantic. Like I feel like I'm slowly disappearing or losing grip with reality because no one is acknowledging my existence. I'm in my 30s and feel like it's just going to keep getting worse and it's hard to have hope for a happier future. 

It's so unbelievably painful and I'm so tired."
717,2,"Ever since I started to take propranolol I have noticed a lack of adrenalin(butterflies in your stomach) during sympathetic responses(fright, anxiety, jump scare, panic attack, etc..) I get a pounding headache. Although it reduces these episodes I find that I feel like my body isn’t responding correctly to the stress. Has anyone else experienced something similar?"
718,2,"Basically my anxiety has been through the roof consistently for a long time now because of all the shit happening in the world. I don’t think I have to be specific.

I’ve tried leaving social media but I find that makes it worse, because I know things are still happening and not knowing what’s happening makes me anxious and guilty. 
I’m on beta blockers so my heart doesn’t beat fast but it beats hard and sometimes it feels like it’s just going to burst out.

I’m so sick and tired of this and all the other anxiety symptoms, like it’s actively making me sick, but at the same time they make me feel human?? I don’t know. I’m in therapy and on meds but as long as the world is still the way it is it’s never going to go? How can I possibly feel happy and calm? "
719,2,"So I’ve had this problem in almost every job I’ve had. My boss will critique me (sometimes calmly, sometimes harshly) and I start spiraling. I internalize it, think of myself as a failure, worry that they hate me and think I’m incompetent, and of course worry about being fired.

It’s my 2nd week in a new job as a barista and after my shift today, my boss texted me “I have a question for you: why was the matcha not refilled?” and sent a message to the whole team explaining that baristas should not be standing around and chatting and instead should focus on their job. I did restock a bunch of things and did my duties, but I just forgot about the matcha. I apologized and he said “Please focus on your job.”

He’s usually pretty nice, I think he was just having a bad day. And apparently this is pretty normal in the food service industry. But still. How do I learn not to take this so personally and to continue doing my job moving forward? I had to take a panic attack pill to calm down. Although I’ve had an especially difficult week outside of work too.

Any tips are appreciated! I like my job and I generally like my manager, this just threw me a bit."
720,2,"I hope this doesn’t trigger anyone. Ever since I became sick with norovirus last year two times, ai images can cause me anxiety to where I feel a panic attack coming on. I notice it’s worse when I’m sick, mostly when I have a migraine happening. When I was really sick with noro, I had to take my emergency anxiety medicine just to sleep because when I closed my eyes, an insane excess of intrusive ai images popped up and I couldn’t sleep. I have to avoid fb because clicking a video, I think it’s real and then I notice the creepiness and my brain freaks out. I didn’t feel this way before I was sick. I didn’t care or thought the images/videos were dumb. I seem to often be sick these days. On days where I’m not, the images don’t bother me much. I don’t understand the connection with that. There are times where I feel anxious because irl if I see something that looks like ai, it freaks me out. 

Like right now, I saw a video I assumed was real then I saw the creepy way people walked and realized it’s fake, and it made me too anxious and now I can’t sleep or calm down, on the verge of having a panic attack. "
721,2,"Preface: I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder and depression and ADHD and stuff. I have taken my antidepressant and anxiety meds today even though even that made me nervous and was difficult. I have not taken any substances today (including alcohol) except for my own medications and one Unisom.

I had to stay home from work today (technically yesterday). This is the fifth full day off work I have had to take in the last two weeks due to a punishing combination of insomnia and anxiety that seem like they’re feeding off of each other.

I called my parents yesterday and told them that if I don’t call them tomorrow (today, I guess) I need them to check on me because I. Am. Not. Functioning. Right. I need help. I almost cried today because I realized I had to brush my tangled hair or it would become harder to brush later.

I know distracting yourself is a useful technique so I turned on a random wholesome family drama. Every little plot twist made me freak out and almost panic.

I called my cousin because I was having a very difficult tearful moment. When she picked up I could barely get my words out. She led me through some breathing exercises. They were hard to do because they felt like a lot of effort. I was exhausted so I figured the best way to get a break from feeling like absolutely every sensation or task is terrifying was to go to sleep.

It is 3AM and I have been trying to sleep for probably six hours. I know you’re supposed to get out of bed if you can’t fall asleep, so I did, but I’m so tired I don’t have the energy to do anything but lay on the couch. At the same time, my mind is racing and won’t slow down. I took a Unisom. I played soft music. I called my friend. I put my weighted blanket over myself.

I don’t want to turn the TV on again because the noise makes me anxious. I don’t want to be on my phone because notifications make my heart rate spike. I don’t want to be alone with my thoughts because they inevitably turn back to worry. I don’t want to read a book because the thought of trying to concentrate on it makes me anxious and so does the thought of reading about anything unpleasant. 

I want to go to sleep but I can’t take another Unisom because just the one seems to have made my legs restless. 

I have done DBT for like three years and I really like it but I am so tired and internally panicked I cannot remember much about what the techniques are that could help me right now except for putting my face in a bowl of ice-cold water. But GUESS HOW THE THOUGHT OF THAT MAKES ME FEEL RIGHT NOW?????????

My thoughts are getting increasingly confused. I keep forgetting steps to minor tasks. Today I got confused about where the electrical outlets were in my living room. I kept getting frustrated because every two minutes I would forget where the remote was. 

I have sleep apnea so I use a CPAP. I know the right place to stay is the couch because the bed is a bad place to be when you’re unable to sleep, but I know I won’t fall asleep on the couch because my CPAP is in the bedroom. The thought of moving it into the living room feels daunting. So that means that as long as I am on the couch I won’t sleep, but if I go back to the bed I’ll feel anxious about being in bed where I couldn’t sleep last time. I am so paralyzed I can’t decide which room to be miserable in.

I feel like I’m losing my mind. I know I need to make a doctor’s appointment quickly but in the meantime I have to get through the weekend. I am in hell.

I don’t know exactly what I need to hear right now. Tell me anything, I guess. Except for I have two requests:

1. Please no “tough love” where you tell me I created this mess for myself and I need to get myself out of it. I know I have to be the one responsible for my mental health. The problem is right now I do not feel capable of doing nearly anything at all.

2. Please don’t ask me to watch a YouTube video."
722,2,I am currently taking (Venlafaxine) for anxiety and honestly I’m sooo tired of taking medication in general. Whenever I accidentally miss a dose I instantly start to feel the withdrawals. The feeling of withdrawals are electrical shock- like sensations in my brain and also in my body. I hate it I hate I hate it. I currently don’t have insurance so it’s not like I can go to my dr and ask him to change it or help me ween off it. Any tips? 🥹
723,2,"Hello, I am a 19M and I have created this account as a sort of throwaway account because I really need other people's opinions on this. I have had GAD for the last 7 years now, ever since I was 13. And I've been dealing with irrational fears and severe hypochondria too. However, what I did 2 days ago really got me thinking whether or not I'll make it out alive. It started when my dad was feeling nauseous, and then I started to feel nauseous. Turns out though he just had to go to the toilet. But, I looked up about the ""nocebo effect"" and if it can possibly kill you. Then I found a BBC article talking about how belief can cause someone to actually die, and this sent me into this endless panic spiral. I tried looking everywhere else and it all say it can happen. After looking at a case about someone dying from hypnosis, now I'm scared that my subconscious is going to somehow overload my body with adrenaline and kill itself. It's 12AM and I can't sleep because this is so existentially dreadful I haven't gone 1 hour without obsessing over these thoughts. My brain has gone into overdrive, and I don't know what to do. My parents tried reassuring me, I told ChatGPT multiple times and it reassured me, but this psychological itch will NOT go away!! I feel so scared, guys what the hell do I do?! Can any of you research this for me and just tell me if this all can kill me or not, because I'm too scared to even do it myself. I'm scared that thinking that I'm gonna to die is actually going to cause me to die."
724,2,"When Im in a room with a lot of people(social anxiety) I cant focus on anything, I feel like I cant breathe and I just fighting inside my head, but after a while I get super dizzy and sleepy, it feels like Im high because I feel dizzines and a kind of derealisation. Idk what happens but I dont think its panic attack because I look normal from the outside, its just a war inside my head"
725,2,I feel like over the past year my anxiety has just sky rocketed and I’m so uncomfortably self aware. It’s making it hard for me to socialize or even just exist outside of my house. I constantly feel so not good enough. In the way. Too much or not enough. Or too tall or too short or too fat or too tall. Too loud. Too quiet. Just no matter what situation I’m in my brain convinces me that what I am and have to offer isn’t enough or correct. What is this? I instantly feel like everyone around me is talking about me or secretly is against me. Even in public with strangers I just feel like everyone is looking at me. Judging me. Plotting against me. I feel like I’m constantly messing up at work even though I’m not. I feel like my brain is just telling me I’m not worthy. Why?? I’ve always been insecure and anxious but not to this degree. I feel so envious of people that have friends and go out. I can’t bring myself to do either because I’m so anxious the entire time I rather avoid the entire outting.

731,2,"A two days ago, my head was hurting so I took an excedrin, just one because sometimes that’s all I need. Later on during the night, I still felt the pain a little so I took the other pill (two is the normal dose anyway) An hour later, I started to feel nauseous, and that spiked my anxiety. I thought I was going to throw up and I was having tremors.

This never happened to me before, so I looked it up, which is the dumbest thing for a hypochondriac like me to do. Sure enough, now all of a sudden I believed I hurt my liver in someway. I kept checking my skin and eyes to make sure it wasn’t turning yellow, and my stomach was still sensitive and I refused to eat. 

I started to doubt myself, wondering if I took more than two. I tried eating tonight but my stomach is still a little sensitive and I threw up a bit. (pizza was not a good choice) 

My family says I look fine and that I don’t need to go to the er, but I’m in such bad shape with my anxiety that I don’t believe anyone, including myself that I’m fine until a doctor tells me. Should I go to the er still? I’m not in excruciating pain, and I never saw blood in my throw up or stool. But I just don’t trust myself to make that call that I’m okay."
732,2," I am currently 15 but I have taken hydroxine for around 2 years or so but its an taken as needed medication and there are only a few times a year were I take it for a couple days for long term anxiety attacks, and a couple normal panic attacks sprinkled inbetween. I haven’t tried other medications (except for the one I take for general anxiety) but its one of the only things that keeps me from not going off the deep end when im having really bad anxiety issues. I recently found out that taking the medicine can increase the risk of having dementia, this absolutely terrifies me and I don’t know what to do. I even heard somewhere that taking it for 10 years can increase the risk of dementia by 50%?? I seriously don’t know what to do, my physicist never told me about possible side affects like this and im starting to worry about what other information that is being gatekeeped from me. Also I worry about what permanent damage hydroxine can do to my cognitive abilities in my growing brain. Should I be worried? If yes what other medicine could I take to help with panic attacks (not general anxiety)"

Me and my mother both got shots, the doctor did make me feel better saying I was fine but I dont know if he was lying to not worry me. After my shots I went to sleep but im still worried that I waited too late and the shot didn't work.

So for the last 4 months I’ve been having a couple panic attacks every month and recently my doctor prescribed me Sertraline I’m on day 4 and I feel like the panic attacks are getting worse like I used to have 2 every month but now it’s like every day I’m like constantly worried or start “freaking out” a little bit is that just a side effect? I’ve also noticed that it feels like there’s something stuck in my throat and I’ve never had that until I started taking the pills is this kinda like I thug it out and it will go away type of thing or should I talk to my doctor again?
739,2,"So i have been trying to find out from what i suffer from but i never found any information about something in the way i experience. But i just know its likely to be a category of DPDR or OCD.

Every time I go outside I see a car or someone walking and I instantly think “where are they going? what’s their life like? are they free? do they feel real?” and it just doesn’t stop and i start to suffer completly in my head.

I see random people driving and I imagine their entire life. Like: do they have a job? are they meeting friends? how do they know what to do every day? how do they have structure? fun? peace?

And then my head jumps to people from school like that guy who has a car i went to class with now or that girl who was super confident and i never saw her again. I wonder what the hell happened to me. We were just kids 3–4 years ago and now I’m sitting here mentally collapsing while they’re out living like normal adults?? Or when its weekend i dont go out because on weekends there are more in my age going out and i suffer if i see them because of my thinking.

It’s eating me alive. I feel like the whole world is moving forward without me. Like I’m just this broken observer stuck in time while everything else continues.

And when I try to talk to people about it, they just say “I don’t care about what others do” or “just don’t think about it.”

I literally can’t stop. It loops and loops and I feel like I’m going insane.

I don’t even know how I got into this state. It was always like this. But before it was with Height i got obsessed and hated myself for the Height i have. And not like that i am short (which i see is the biggest cause on reddit in any forums). I an 6ft 1 and when i see someone taller i just feel bad. I suffer and feel like they experience Life way better with much more opportunities by some inches. I still dont accept to this day. I used to just live… and now it’s like I’m watching my own life through a window I can’t open.

I hate this. I hate feeling like this. And the worst part is nobody actually gets it. They think I’m just being dramatic or overthinking, but this is torture."
740,2,"I don't know how to explain exactly, but I always feel like I did something wrong, or someone is mad at me.
My thoughts feels so real, and it makes me distrustful of everyone around me, specially my girlfriend, and I can't relax at all.

I was always like this since I remember. All of my life I've felt like the world revolves around me, but not in a narcissistic way, I just feel like I'm always the one to blame. These thoughts takes me to a point where I get severely anxious and even having panick attacks.

For example, the other day I was watching a TV show with my gf at my house and she was paying attention to the TV. Suddenly, I thought she was ignoring me, or she wasn't into me at all, for no reason. I know it sounds insane, and I know that these thoughts weren't true, but a still got anxious anyway. So I told her I was anxious (she's very aware of my problem by the way, and she's always supportive and tells me to say to her these thoughts so she can refute them), so I told her what I was thinking, and she asked me what made me feel this way, but then, as if I wasn't insane enough, I started analyzing the way she was talking to me, and I got upset that she was still looking to the TV while talking to me. 

I've never lash out on her or anything, I know it's just my messed brain, but it still feels so challenging, to deny everything my mind is making up, reality becomes so distant, specially when I get really anxious.

I just don't know what to do anymore, I was diagnosed with cyclothymia, I take my medicines, I did therapy for a long time but it didn't seem to improve at all. 

Maybe it has something to do with the fact that my dad was very strict with me, he used to beat me with a belt when I did something ""wrong"", and used to punish me like locking me in my room.

Sorry if all of this sounds too confused, I don't really know how to express myself in an assertive way. I just want it to stop 😭

744,2,"Hello!

I am f 23. Maybe I am acting immature but on the 3th July I have really important university exam. This exam decides weather you would graduate or not. I have sweaty palms, increased heartbeat and what not.

The thing I worry the most about is my memory. I feel like once I started to stress a lot about it I forget shit I actually learned. I try my best and everything but I feel like it isn't enough.

I still live with my parents. I will disapoint them if I fail. I live in a shitty country where university education is needed so I need to pass these with whatever grade.

I can redo them in September for free, in February too but I need to pay solid money, and in May next year but  I need to pay solid money again plus repeat 6 months of my education.

749,2,"I was on my last flight out of 2 months of traveling (7th flight) and I was relieved to finally get back home. I got to the airport 3 hours early and my flight was delayed 4 hours so I was already exhausted trying to keep myself fully awake for 7 full hours. Mid flight as I was listening to music, the seatbelt sign turned on and the captain told everyone to sit, buckle, and remain calm, WHO TELLS A FLIGHT TO “REMAIN CALM”!? There was no turbulence or anything happening in the passenger part of the aircraft. I started freaking out, luckily I was at the window and nobody was sitting between the aisle guy and I. I bursted into tears while texting my friend what was going on but it wouldn’t send because the airlines wifi didn’t support the wifi texting app I was using. I thought I was texting my friend my last words because the captain kept on dinging the seatbelt sign every 10ish minutes and reminding people to stay seated and buckled over the speaker along with telling the attendants to stay in their jump seats. This went on for 2hrs with minor turbulence, I was crying so heavily and I needed a tissue so badly. 

We landed. 

I still don’t know what happened but later once I got home I got news about the airindia flight that crashed as I was in air, not a fun coincidence and I am not going on a plane for a while after this experience. "

752,2,"Hello all, last sunday i had the worst panic attack ive ever had. i’ve suffered from panic attacks since i was about 8 (im 20 now) and so ive had my fare share, but never one like this. i won’t go into too much detail but it lasted from about 1am-7am, and left me with some graphic physical stomach upsets😭

Anyway, ever since then ive just been traumatised, it originally happened because i couldn’t fall asleep and got myself in a tizz because i had to wake up. so now, im terrified for nighttime. i’m so scared that if i try to fall asleep and can’t, it’s going to happen again. on sunday i had been out with friends, i haven’t since then but today i am on my way back from being out and for some reason i feel like because this was the scenario on sunday it means it’s going to happen again. i just need some help and guidance, i just don’t feel the same, ive lived in constant fear of it happening again now, i dread the sun going down, i don’t feel alive anymore. i’m pretty much all alone in this, my mum isn’t the most loving of people so i have no one to talk to. 

please help me "
753,2,"About 1.5 years ago I had first big job interview ever. I was incredibly anxious in the days leading up to it to an extent I had never felt before.  I ended up getting the job and assumed that because the interview was over the anxiety would naturally disappear. I was very wrong. For the next 6 months I was continuously anxious over nothing.  It got so bad to I was waking up in the middle of the night with my heart racing so loud I could hear it pressing against my blanket.  

I discovered some slight tricks to ease my anxiety over the next year but still suffered regular panic attacks and my body would sometimes shake uncontrollably while I felt like a literal tweaker.  

About a week ago I started taking 200 mg of magnesium daily and It’s like there’s a shield placed around my anxiety. I feel it still in the depths but it’s for the most part very bearable.   Hopefully i can go on this long enough to where it will naturally help with the anxiety and I can hop off magnesium. 

I am just shocked at how effective it has been like a light switch. "

755,2,"So, I do have diagnosed anxiety, and I certainly have my days where I am very overwhelmed, but on a more typical day-to-day basis I have what I often can only describe as ""buzzing"". While my mind feels clear, and I can name normal stressors (job, family, rise in fascism, etc), my body is *buzzing*. My muscles feel tensed, as do my shoulders, and I even feel the buzzing sensation in my lower spine. None of this is painful, and I am not experiencing the typical sensations people associate with anxiety attacks (shortness of breath, etc). However, the buzzing, the feeling of being tense, is incredibly distracting to the point where it is difficult to relax or do creative projects. All I can think about is my muscles, my shoulders, my spine and *the buzzing*. 

Frankly, I am just looking for advice or tips on how to manage or calm this sensation. It is genuinely disrupting my housework, writing, etc. I've been trying meditation, and calm music or frequencies, but not much luck so far, and I need some way to make it stop or, at least, calm down."
756,2,"Hi sorry if this is irrelevant, I’ve had about 100mg of caffeine, Mountain Dew around 5 hours ago + matcha around 3 hours ago, and I feel like there’s a heartbeat mainly in my head with like a 100 elephants running around in my head in circles  and like causing earthquakes in my head while they’re at it. 
Also the heartbeat applies to entire body as well, I guess jitters and I’m extremely nauseous right now, but it’s like sort of induced and not natural if that makes sense, this doesn’t happen with caffeine Everytime but I’m guessing it’s due to the lightish dinner I had. 
Also my entire body is shaking but it’s not like very serious just some slight trembling if you will like shivering. 
Anyway I’m describing this here since I don’t have access to a therapist or any mental health related help. 
Again I’m sorry if this isn’t allowed, but I just want to know if anybody else experienced this with caffeine I guess. 
Cheers 🥂 "
757,2,"I lived in a shared house about five years ago and there were four other tenants, the initial group that I live with were great but slowly they filtered away when I was left with a group of people who were horrendous, a luck of the draw situation!

762,2,"I'm currently taking 5 mg of buspar twice a day. And while I notice mild improvement, I still continue to be extremely nervous and anxious. Mostly about social situations and group environments. 

In social settings, my mind freezes and overthinks at the same time. My hands shake, my face gets red, etc. 

I guess I'm hoping for something that will at minimum stop the physical signs and at best stop my mind from overthinking if that makes sense. 

I have an appointment with my doctor soon and will be going over this with her. But I thought I would ask and see if anyone's in a similar situation and have somethibg that is working. Thanks! "
763,2,"Hi there :)  
  
Just wondering if anyone is kind enough to offer any thoughts or advice. 

In my early 20s (I'm now 26F), my anxiety started to become more of a problem, and I remember first getting terrible jaw pain on my shift working as a server when I was about 22 (thankfully, I'm no longer working in this kind of position). At the time, I think the combination of mild social anxiety from interacting with guests, my intense manager who oftentimes raised her voice (it was a upscale French restaurant), in addition to feeling a bit lost in life at the time all manifested in this jaw pain. I never really figured out how to stop it.

Nowadays, my jaw problems have really progressed, and it's the first thing I notice when my anxiety increases. I'll notice the anxious feeling: and then I check my jaw. It's hard to open my mouth fully. I know in order to save my jaw/find a solution I need to solve the anxiety long-term--it's all mental for me.  
  
Today, I was walking downtown (I live in a city), and strangely the combination of shopping (which sometimes makes me feel self conscious) and perhaps the crowds (?) triggered my anxiety. I was in intense pain coming home on the bus. As soon as I was home, I felt relief (lol?). Looking back on my day, I don't know what I could have done differently to prevent this mini-episode, although I know these kinds of instances over time are not good for my jaw. Another example of this is when I used to live with roommates that I didn't know very well (I now live alone). I used to feel quite anxious just with them around in the living room (for example, if I had to pass to use the bathroom). I guess this was a mild social anxiety.

I know I've talked to doctors in the past about have generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), but I'm wondering if it might be something else? i.e.,

* aspergers/high-functioning autism?
* some kind of PTSD (I honestly can't think of a reason for this though)
* why am I so sensitive? to everything? 

While possibly not related, I noticed I've been getting gray hairs and I can't help but think about just all the stress I'm putting on my body. 

I'm familiar with CBT, and I have seen therapists. I'm not sure. I hope I don't have to continue to put myself through these anxiety episodes day after day for the rest of my life.

Thanks for reading, it's appreciated."
764,2,"Hi, I’m not really sure how to start this, but I just needed a place where I could say this out loud.

I’ve always had a strong fight-or-flight response since I was really young. The earliest memories I have are from when I was around 4–6 years old, being terrified of cockroaches and spiders. I would imagine huge ones crawling toward me—even if there wasn’t anything there—and I’d just start sobbing. That happened more than once, and even though there was never an actual bug, my panic was very real.

When I was a bit older, my brother used to show me disturbing videos—things like Happy Tree Friends or creepy Hello Kitty edits (one where she cuts open her mouth with a knife). I was just barely aware of the world back then, and I think those images stuck with me in a deep way. They terrified me, but I didn’t know how to explain that to anyone.

In 2018–2019, it got worse. I had a terrible panic response to the whole “Momo” thing that went around online. I was so stressed I actually got cold sores and couldn’t sleep without a light on. I’d freeze in place at night thinking something was breathing behind me or watching me. I remember one time I stayed frozen for an hour and a half, too scared to move or even cry until my mom walked in and turned on the lights. I just broke down sobbing.

I eventually got over Momo and things got more manageable. Yeah, I’d still check behind me, sleep with the TV on for light, and close my blinds tight—but I hadn’t felt that deep, bone-chilling panic again… until just now.

Today, I saw a TikTok that totally triggered me. It was a video of a woman at what looked like a McDonald’s counter. She said “Can I have a–” and then suddenly dropped on all fours and lunged over the counter at the workers, then got up and started dancing frantically. The video was meant to be funny, I think, but it unsettled me so badly. I instantly felt that old fear hit me again like a wave. I couldn’t stop imagining something creeping up behind me. I got scared of my own shadow. I even cried watching my own reflection for a second.

I showed the video to my mom, who found it silly, and to a friend, who only said the music was creepy—but it absolutely shook me. I’ve been carrying this huge panic in my chest since, and it unlocked all these old memories of fear and hiding and seeing shadows and hearing voices as a kid. I even went to a school counselor once and mentioned I was hearing my name or seeing things, and she just… never called me back in again after that.

I don’t even know what I’m asking here. Maybe just… if anyone’s ever felt like this? Is this something trauma-related even if I wasn’t physically harmed as a kid? Is it okay to still be scared of these things?

Thank you for reading if you did. I feel really alone sometimes, but even writing this is helping me breathe a bit better."
765,2,"so this has been a problem for a while now but me and my girlfriend have been together for a while now and i believe i have what is called “relationship anxiety” and i just be overthinking about the littlest things, i always feel like im doing something wrong, sometimes i feel paranoid if they don’t text back for a while, i constantly bring up/think that i feel as if shes gonna find someone better or lose interest.. etc. you guys get the gist. but i feel like im just not cut out for relationships and it breaks my heart cus i love this girl to fucking death but i’m just so lost. i don’t wanna ruin things, and i feel like i am going to. i just need some guidance i guess. i’m not the happiest person either, like i have shit going on in my life but i just don’t see that playing into this. so if anyone could give me tips or anything i would greatly appreciate it."

Hey all, my anxiety has gotten so bad, I got a job where im basically running an entire inn and ive stressed myself to the point of no return. I am finding another job but in the meantime I am not sure how im supposed to deal with anything right now. I cant eat and I cant sleep and I started lexapro last night but really that's going to do nothing for me for an entire month. I asked if there was any way I could just have something to make the panic attacks go away and they told me to go to the emergency room? I literally thought that the emergency room was for anything BUT anxiety as that is the most acute reason you could ever go in. I'm just at my wits end and dont know where to go from here, any advice? I really would love to get something as needed so I can just stop the panic attacks and resume my life ive been having one for like 3 months straight and I'm severely underweight due to it."
768,2,"Omg I know this may not sound like a big deal, but I ordered food from uber eats and the restaurant called me to say they’re sorry but one of the things I ordered had sold out ajd was there anything else they could get me instead . I just got anxious and said oh er er yeah um pardon um yeah sorry I can’t talk properly and then the man on the phone said to me that it’s fine. But I can’t stop thinking about it 

I’m so nervous speaking to anybody that I just stutter even on the phone I make a fool of myself "
769,2,"Hi, I'm new to the sub and I had a baby almost a year ago, and the postpartum anxiety on top of my regular anxiety has been crippling. 

I wonder if it can even be fixed, because its so hard-wired into me. As far back as I can remember my dad would talk about how every single little thing could either kill me or screw up my life, how I needed to ""win"" every conflict I got into, how every problem I had at school or wherever was my fault no matter what because I should have seen it coming. He did it out of love, he obviously has anxiety, but he'd never admit it. My mom would always encourage me to just move on and let things slide when it came to conflict, and while my dad was the more overprotective parent, she was pretty overprotective, too. 

Now in addition to wondering what could kill me when I leave my house and having made up arguments in my head, I also picture my son in those situations with me. There's a whole other life to worry about now. It's making relationships with my in-laws strained, and it's hard to distinguish if I'm too overprotective or if they're way too underprotective (I assume some of both). 

My question is, with severe anxiety so deeply rooted in me and my ways of thinking, is it even possible to be normal? Or to relieve any of it? Several medicines haven't worked, I've been to a few therapy sessions but haven't found any change in my anxiety. I'd love to go to more, I have a great therapist, but I don't have money to have a $150 session every week or two. Has anyone had a similar experience and found relief? I just need some hope. "
770,2,"I'm at the point when I feel constant stress and fear no matter what I do or where I am. That constant feeling of tightness in my chest and nausea is driving me insane. New work only amplified all of this. I was so scared of doing something wrong I thought I'd throw up. I couldn't stand the feeling of everyone looking at the new guy who of course fucked something up. Of course, I felt like a loser after resigning, like I was running away from being an adult. The problem with me is that my fears don't disappear but change into different ones."
771,2,"I’m finally going to take anxiety meds, I first developed anxiety in 2019  it’s been years. In 2020/2021 I had gotten better but in 2022 I lost a family member and 2023 was kind of rough by 2024 around may I started having constant off balance issues/vertigo I basically got agoraphobia again I couldn’t even leave my room, scared of showering couldn’t go out and enjoy life. It’s June 2025 and this off balance issue is still present I feel off balance ear fullness ear clicking lightheaded and it kick starts anxiety and then panic it’s becoming unbearable. I went in again to get sertraline and to be referred to a psychiatrist again. Hopefully these meds work for me. Im in my mid 20s  and I need to change for me and my family. I need stability! I can’t continue living how I was doing so, I need to be independent and grow up. "
772,2,"Hello! I have been dealing with terrible anxiety for the last few months. I started having this shaky feeling when moving my muscles. I can feel the shakiness all over. Arms and legs, core muscles when bending down. Sometimes it moves to different muscles and sometimes it goes away and comes back. This has been going on for the last couple of months. When I sit still I’m fine, it’s when I move or flex my muscles I notice the shaky sensation. Like my movements are not smooth, they’re jittery, or like I have a lot of tension. I notice it gets a lot worse when I’m really upset or on the verge of a panic attack. I do get uncontrollably shaky when in full panic attack mode but that is nothing new.

  
I went down the whole ALS/MS/Park rabbit hole which was fun… Neurologist ruled out Park and doc doesn’t think it’s MS. But i still worry. Could this be from anxiety? Could it last this long? I have illness anxiety disorder so I keep worrying about it and checking every time I move basically. Does anyone have anything like this? I feel like I’m going crazy. I went on vacation last month and it went away fully, until I came back home and noticed it picked back up again. I also thought it was the meds (tried escitalopram and zoloft) that was causing this, but now I switched to something that is not an SSRI and I still am getting the shakiness. Any help would be greatly appreciated. "
773,2,"I’m 22 years old and I’m actually worried that I’m in an extreme minority of straight men.

I would much rather hang out with a woman as a friend than entering any sort of relationship (romantic or sexual). Socialising with women is definitely more fun than socialising with men. I talk about this subject a lot on Reddit because I’m actually so embarrassed to mention this to a real person, most men my age hate it when they won’t get the ‘benefits’ part of the friendship. 

The problem is that I don’t really have any friends and one of the things holding me back from doing so is that I’m worried about other men judging me for not wanting sex or relationships, especially with the advent of the manosphere and Andrew Tate. What I find hard about talking to women (at least to make friends) is that I’m worried that I’ll be looked at as feminine/‘beta male’ by other men — I feel as if most single straight men my age are OBSESSED with sex.

I would actually pick to hang out with a woman and maybe go bowling or shopping or a walk in the park over intimate sexual relationships."
774,2,"Hi everyone,

I have my son’s birthday party coming up tomorrow, and the anxiety has already started to take hold. This is my first time hosting something this big, and while I want it to be a happy day for him, I’m honestly feeling completely overwhelmed already.

The party will be both indoors and outdoors. Outside, there’s going to be a huge inflatable waterslide that I know the kids are going to love. Inside, we’ll have food, decorations, and a space to cool off. It sounds like a fun day on the surface, and I really do want to create those memories for my son. But underneath all the planning, I’m feeling a ton of pressure, fear, and self-doubt.

My mind keeps jumping to worst-case scenarios. I worry about how I’ll handle everything — the people, the noise, the social expectations, trying to stay calm when I already feel on edge. It’s like my brain won’t let me enjoy the idea of doing something good, because it’s too busy imagining how badly I might fall apart.

I’m posting here because I know a lot of you understand what it’s like to carry anxiety into situations that are supposed to feel joyful. If you have any advice, grounding strategies, or even just a kind word to help me feel less alone in this moment, I’d be really grateful.

Thank you for reading. Just being able to say this out loud already helps a little."
775,2,"Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, but I've had pretty aggressive anxiety in recent years (well, actually my whole life, but it's been more or less intense in certain periods), so I thought that this felt related.

But does anyone else feel like others are allowed to be upset with you, but you aren't allowed to be upset with them?

I have felt this way in relationships, friendships, with family, and at work. I always feel so patient and empathetic with others, but rarely feel this in return. Rather, my feelings when I am upset feel invalidated.

Through my anxiety, I've always been a pretty sensitive person and try to be hyper aware of how I come across as to not upset anyone (conflict has always been incredibly hard for me). My brain tends to latch onto potential negative interactions (even when they were actually perceived as fine or positive) and I feel anxious about them for much longer than needed. When there actually is obvious conflict (whether is starts with someone else or with me), it sends me into a period of intense anxiety and normal everyday stuff feels harder for days, weeks, or longer.

I guess I'm just asking if anyone can relate and if you have any potentially helpful strategies.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you're all having a great day :)"

I called to leave a message to my provider to see if the prescription was ready/approved, haven’t heard back yet. This was two days ago.

I don’t know if it’s placebo and I’m just freaking myself out, but I already feel off. Unbalanced, my head feels funny, etc. Like there’s electricity and tingling when I move too fast.

Hopefully, it will be ready for pickup on Monday, and I’ll just have to get through the weekend. 

Otherwise I might go without it until Wednesday - Friday. Or maybe it just won’t be refilled. I’m just scared and could use some reassurance/tips.

I’m scared of every little pain I have in fear that it’s going to be something serious and I’m scared to death I’m going to die. I’m dizzy and nauseous most of the time I have black spots in my vision but I do have bad eye sight. Sometimes I feel like I’m in a cartoon like I’m not actually real. I’m constantly emotional. I just want help my doctor won’t do anything and won’t send me to a therapist. I’m sooo tired of this. 
783,2,"**Hi everyone,**  
This might sound a bit unusual, but I had an intense go-karting race on May 5th, 2025, and right after it ended, I felt awful — nauseated and off. Within 30 minutes, I experienced a severe anxiety episode, and now, six weeks later, I still haven’t fully recovered.

I’m a 55-year-old man and have dealt with anxiety on and off for many years. Most of my past episodes were situation-specific and usually settled within a few weeks, especially once the triggering issue improved and with some medication. But this time feels very different — it's thrown me off completely.

The anxiety isn’t always severe, but it’s been mild to moderate throughout the day almost every day. My psychiatrist prescribed 0.5 mg of Lorazepam three weeks ago, which has helped a bit but hasn’t brought complete relief. Some days are better than others — same with certain hours.

I continue to do breathing exercises and yoga twice daily, but they don’t seem to be making a big difference.

I’m trying to understand what’s going on. Has anyone experienced something like this? How long does it usually take for the nervous system to fully recover from such a shock?  "
784,2,"I had an anxiety attack about a week and a half ago (was sick with covid and I think ignoring some stuff I should have been talking about in therapy) and I’m really struggling. I have a lot of issues with loss of control and judging myself, both of which have been prominent this time around. I keep looking for a pattern in my old flare ups to see how long this will last and if I’m on “the right track.” It’s driving me crazy.

As an example, when I get really anxious I have a hard time eating. I will usually eat one fairly small meal a day, and then as the days go by I’m able to eat more. Yesterday I was able to go out with my mom and sister and eat lunch! I also ate a full dinner. Today, I didn’t eat until 6pm. I kept thinking all day this meant I was in a  setback and my anxiety was going to flare up all over again.

Does anyone else feel the need to control the situation, or have issues with judging themselves and how they deal with their anxiety? Any tips on how to remind myself not every attack is the same and the more I worry the harder it will be?"

I do suspect some ADHD and Asperger traits, but mild and not obvious.  From the moment I took the first dose, I’ve had some tinnitus, waking up after an hour’s sleep which isn’t like me and raised background physical anxiety symptoms. This hasn’t got any better over time. I’m sensitive to caffeine, but like coffee although I can’t drink it after 3pm and sleep. I am borderline obese and so looking to lose weight.

At my appointment he was my able to see how I can’t make eye contact, my whole body tenses especially shoulders neck and head. And I shake. Just a total nervous mess. We’re not going the ssri/snri route at this time as I’ve tried a lot and we’re giving me a break from them.

789,2,"ive struggled with anxiety and ruminations/intrusive thoughts for years and have managed it quite well but in the last few months. say april through may, it’s kicked up a notch to the point where every moment of the day im thinking about something horrible, i try to exercise, listen to music, or run cardio to get my mind off of these thoughts but they continue to persist. it’s almost become unmanageable and i dont know what is wrong with me, it sucks because a few months ago i was doing completely okay and progressing in my life and now i don’t even know who i am, i don’t talk to any of my friends anymore & ive developed a deep hatred for the world and everyone around me which probably stems from a deep seeded hatred for myself. everything and everybody just makes me so angry. i just want to completely destroy myself or something inside of me to reach this anger and then rebuild a version of myself that im not so angry at. the issue is that part of me is still holding on to my old self because im worried that this may not be the best course of action & i feel like im also being attacked by my mind when i try to progress into a new version of myself.

is this just a coping mechanism that my mind has put in place to prevent me from just killing myself?"
790,2,"28 F, 4”11 and 180 lbs, BMI is 37.6

Some days, especially when I don’t get enough sleep (4 hours or less), I have moments in the day where I feel light headed or deprived of oxygen. 

I get this strained feeling in my neck and in the left side of my chest, not a pain but it just feels like it’s being tugged on. 

Then the feeling comes over me of not having enough oxygen. It’s subtle though. Not like I’m gasping for air, but that I’m just not receiving enough oxygen throughout my body. 

I then start to psyche myself out and convince myself that I’m going to have a stroke or a heart attack. Tonight I felt panicked, but my blood pressure was perfectly fine 119/82. It was my heart rate (bpm) that was ranging between 120-140. 

Has anyone ever felt this way? I know I should just go to a doctor but I’m from a very small country with no cardiologist so I wanted to gauge others who might’ve felt this way. 

Context: I’m diagnosed with Bipolar Type 1 with psychotic features, I’m pretty sure I have anxiety (GAD) but was never officially diagnosed. I’m a heavy cigarette smoker, sedentary life and my diet is not the best. I drink occasionally. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!!

791,2,"I’ve been constantly falling into the horrible news rabbit hole, and just seeing the lack of empathy the disregard of human life, not to mention the militarization that we are living through and the fact that horrible people are getting away with horrible crimes.

793,2,"It all started about a week or 2 ago. This is the best way I know how to explain it. Basically I was just sitting on the sofa one afternoon, and all of a sudden my personality just flip flopped. . Listen… I’m usually a very caring, very concerned type of person. I wear my heart on my sleeve. I care deeply about everyone and everything. I’m a very down to earth person and I like to get involved with what’s going on/current events no matter what they may be. I was full of excitement, full of life, full of life, full of love.


…Now where it gets dark. All of a sudden. I don’t care about anything. I am overthinking like crazy, my thoughts are quite literally out of control,. I keep hearing screaming voices in my head, but they’re not real voices. They’re just my thoughts amplified in my head if that makes sense. I am having crazy urges, I have excellent self control but I have not acted on them in the 16 years I’ve been battling my mental health. My psychiatrist has started me on new medication, but most psych meds don’t help most of the time. I’m just this robot on autopilot who has absolutely no care for anything or anyone. It’s extremely terrifying. I’ve literally been in bed and don’t get out except to go to the bathroom and when I eat, it’s mostly in my room.

I cannot emphasize this enough, I feel really really scared. This is not who I am. I see two routes this can take:

Number one: let my life deteriorate and continue to get worse and the possibility of me ending up in jail or doing something else seriously regretting not to mention my life getting ruined.

Number two: getting help now and doing therapeutic techniques on my own because appointments in my area are backed up over a year. I’d like to try CBT, but I’d also like you guys to throw any suggestions you have at me that’ll be relevant to what I’m currently experiencing because I am desperate right now And I’m terrified that my life will be over soon if I don’t get help.

Please help me. Please.. I’ve had several therapists tell me there’s no help for me and I just feel hopeless but there’s something that I keep hanging onto. I just feel like I’m a burden to everybody .

798,2,"

I made a good friend back in the first year of college. She was one of the first people I could talk to comfortably, which was quite important to me because I'm reserved and I hadn't been able to open up for about the first three months.

We became friends in the second semester and we maintained contact even during the summer. When we came back, it was really nice to talk to her and all but over time, I started to feel more distant and even a little anxious.

I'm someone who's incredibly conscious of her social awkwardness as well as her limited friend circle. I was one of her two friends. I don't know if this is some kind of self-hate thing but I didn't like how she would keep telling me how much she loved and missed me, especially because I hadn't properly opened up in college back then.

Over time, I've reduced contact because I assumed that I'd grown out of the friendship. I texted her recently to check in, in a moment of weakness and she seemed to be saying the same things.

This makes me really anxious, possibly because of her refusal to withdraw despite my lack of Interest, although she was not the one to reach out to me. I know I'm probably at fault here so I genuinely need advice.

Every time I think about drifting away further, a gnawing voice telling me that nothing is stopping me from all my friends doing the same to me haunts me. I also become overly conscious of my awkwardness. (I have anxiety.)

It seems like she's put me on a pedestal and that combined with her awkwardness, her tendency to complain about things and stay cooped up in her room kinda bothers me.

But today I accidently found the best anxiety relief ever. I started biking again, and its Summer Time in the Texas heat and now after taking a rest I realized, I didn't have a single anxious thought while biking. The summer heat and the physical activity completely occupied my mind, and currently afterthefact my anxiety has returned but it is much better now. The exaustion and tiredness is occupying my physical senses and my mind is busy on cooling off and hydration. I'm sure this is an obvious answer to others but I had never connected the dots to intense workouts reducing my anxiety.

801,2,"Hi English isn’t my first language so sorry for the mistakes ! 
I want to share with you my experience with my anxiety and don’t hesitate to reply I would love to not feel alone about it even if I’m sorry if you have anxiety. 
I’m almost 20 and my anxiety started after the COVID (approximately)
I had a rough life as a kid and I have some traumatic events and memories that still impact me today but I never talked about it (nowadays I try sometimes with few friends that I trust but it stills complicated for me tbh) 
My anxiety started with some symptoms pretty common: stomach issues, headaches,nausea, extremely tired and lazy and it got worse with heart palpitations. I didn’t know what anxiety was which made me think that I was going to die everyday and I also wanted to die everyday because of it. I taught I was not normal, weak and that maybe I should quit this earth for my own good. 
This feeling of fainting because you can’t breath properly became my worst nightmare. I was scared of doing a panic attack again which made me doing more because I was too anxious about it (funny isn’t it) 
After many medical check (3 before the doctor diagnosed me) I decided to do some researches about anxiety disorder because my doctor didn’t want to give me medicine to calm it (maybe it was to strong idk tbh)
Thanks to my research and also a personal development which has followed (also in a spiritual way) I found peace and my anxiety has decreased. 
But recently my anxiety is coming back and tbh I didn’t want to so it makes me feel really bad and I realized that as I always do I just hide it and I didn’t heal properly ( for me I didn’t have it anymore but I was wrong) One thing that you need to know is that anxiety is a part of you. She expresses what you really feel because you can not express your own + your brain has the habit of having it so for it it is “normal”. 
And now at 19 I decided to take for the first time of my life an appointment with a psychologist and tbh I feel like I don’t need it because my problems are not worse than another person. I wanted to share this with you even if I don’t know you because I know how much it is hard to live that alone and I hope you will understand that you are not weak or weird because you feel that way. Don’t hesitate to share your experience I would love to read it and if you have any advice I appreciate 🩷"

When I’m really low, I get intrusive suicidal thoughts like, “what’s the point if I can’t fix my life?” It’s scary, but I don’t even know how to talk about it.

811,2,"I have no trouble GETTING jobs but keeping them is so hard. I finally got a full-time, full benefits, retail job less than five miles from my job. It's work I'm comfortable doing. I've done it before. It's retail but the store is only open ten hours a day so it's not like it has terrible hours or anything. 

But I'm just so anxious. My onboarding took five hours and I was throwing up in the bathroom at the end of it. My first day went okay, then I had my weekend, and today I just couldn't. I was sobbing on my partner. 

I hate this so much. I'm a 39 year old woman. I started work when I was 11. I should be able to handle a speciality retail job. I NEED to be able to handle this retail job, it's not like groceries are getting cheaper. 

I'm on medication, BTW, 60mg duloxetine twice a day and busiprone 5mg as needed. 

Idk, guys. Like just seems to be one struggle after another. "
812,2,"My usual methods are ok and help me manage it pretty well. But i'm open to trying new methods as well. I use a mix of talking to others, positive affirmations, mindfulness, distraction, haelthy lifestyle, getting enough sleep. Anyone have something i haven't listed that works for them? I'm looking forward to maybe learning or trying new things to add to my repertoir!"
813,2,"Hi. Any tips for titrating down atenolol? i take 12.5mg a day..

Prescribed atenolol for anxiety but dont feel it does much after 2 yrs. Doc suggested stopping it (12.5mg a day) and taking propanolol as needed for public speaking. 

I do have clonazapam I take as needed... but dont like to take. 

Propanolol has high ratings, fast onset, works on beta 1 (heart) AND beta 2 (nervous system), and leaves your system in 6 hrs. Sounds like a great alternate to atenolol (can also slow metabolism and hair loss) as well as good alternate to clonazapam!"
814,2,"Firstly, I am under the care of a professional, and that is whom I will be making my healthcare decisions with. I just want the viewpoints and advice from my fellow anxiety/panic comrades.

I have severe anxiety, as well as a bad panic disorder. I've tried coming off of all my meds (tapering), including klonopin, to see what my baseline truly was. Let me tell you, it's terrible, and I have finally admitted that I need pharmaceutical assistance in managing it all. At my height, I was taking 1mg of klonopin 4 times a day, as well as my antidepressant meds. I'm currently on .5mg daily with a prn dose, and going back up on the antidepressants. I am seriously considering going back up on klonopin. 

I see people absolutely vilifying benzos in these types of forums, and maybe it's for a good reason. I have personally never abused benzos; in fact, I catch heat from my loved ones because I will suffer greatly by not taking a klonopin, because I'm trying to get through it myself.

I want to hear your thoughts, pros and cons on daily use of benzos for someone like me. What do I do? My disorders are not managed at all, even though I put in the work with therapy, CBT, DBT, etc. I throw everything at it, and still I really struggle with it."
815,2,"Long story short, I have anxiety about having anxiety. 
The one thing that is my trigger is physical sensations 
Dizziness, shaking, fast heart rate, hot flashes. 
But these only come during social events, interviews, or any social events. If I’m home,
I’m okay. 

I tried buspar and it doesn’t help this at all. "
816,2,"Anyone take propranolol for:

-sweatiness, shaking, fast hr 
-daily
-have NO health issues. 
-has low/normal blood pressure (110/65)
-has low resting heart rate majority of the time 
-exercises

817,2,"Does the full moon have effect on anxiety? I have been feeling extra weird after lunch every day now for few days. So basically going on a long walk feeling like I will collapse on some random times, in general feeling bad...

"
818,2,"Hello! I (23 F) am flying alone for the first time in less than a week and would love some advice, tips, or general words of encouragement. 
    
For context, I’ve struggled with an anxiety disorder since 2020 (I’ve been an anxious person all my life, but it became a disorder after a panic attack in 2020), and although I can say it’s gotten much better since then, this is a big step for me. I am also unmedicated.
    
One of the main triggers for my anxiety is being in unfamiliar places alone, and the prospect of being thousands of feet in the air with no connection to anyone I trust is extremely daunting. My main concern with this flight is not being able to control the anxiety, I am aware I will be anxious inevitably, but my goal is to not let it overwhelm me.
    
I’ve flown many times before, but never alone, so I know what to expect logistically, but this is new territory in terms of my anxiety. 
    
The flight is 4-5 hours long, and I’ve already planned ahead to be in an aisle seat near the back of the plane, close to the washrooms (two less things I have to worry about). 
    
I would appreciate any and all advice if anyone has experienced flying alone with anxiety, feel free to suggest any exercises, distraction techniques, or anything that would make the process a bit less terrifying. Thanks!

819,2,"23F, sufferer of anxiety since I was a child. 

For the past few weeks, everytime I try to fall asleep, I start hearing my heartbeat throughout my body. Particularly when I lie on my side. I feel it everywhere, in my chest, head, back, arms. Idk if I’m being hyperaware. After this I try to ignore it & I fall asleep, maybe a few seconds after I fall asleep my heart gets fluttery & I get palpitations and it wakes me up & then I start panicking & I can’t sleep. I end up staying awake until I can’t stay awake anymore and I eventually pass out. 

I have extreme health anxiety and everytime I get my heart checked (ECG, X ray) they come back clear so the drs tell me it’s anxiety. I wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this to validate me so I don’t feel like I’m crazy. "
820,2,"hi everyone,

one of my favorite bands is finally touring in my state, and i promised myself the last time that if they ever tour again i’ll have to go. so after ruminating over it for almost 3 days i finally gave in and bought a ticket.

now, i managed to get a seat and that’s great cause my initial fear was having to stand in a huge crowd, but my mind is still racing for some reason. i’m sure it’s a culmination of different factors — the fact that i’ll be alone, the fact that it’s my first concert, and maybe also that the venue is an hour away and i might have to take an uber there.

a part of me is also thinking i might regret doing this, that i’ll get there and not enjoy it at all. but right now i’m feeling a bit sad because i’ve looked through forums related to this and people are usually expressing excitement to see their favorite artists while i’m just full of dread.

i know comparison is the thief of joy though, and i want to do this as a way to break out of my shell, since even small things like going to the store alone scare me sometimes.

the concert is in a few months so i have time to “brace” myself i guess :) i’m wondering if i should try to go out alone as much as possible until then or something. maybe take small steps? or should i just not do it at all?


does anyone have any advice or tips for convincing yourself that nervousness is actually just excitement? or maybe you’ve been in a similar situation? i know things like this have been posted before here but i’d love to get some encouragement and a deeper insight if possible. 

thank you for reading 🍀"
821,2,"Just yesterday, my car almost got rear ended up a huge truck. If I did not process that quickly, it might have been really bad. I got anxiety so bad I could not feel my breath, I thought I was having a heart attack. Now I keep getting flashbacks and very very anxious. Same thing happened last year, where my car was totaled. How do I deal with this "
822,2,"Hi!

I'm(27/F) curious if anybody has been prescribed beta-blocker medication for anxiety? I was at my doctor's today for a med check and we were discussing my anxiety symptoms. I was telling him about how my anxiety at times will feel out of control. I explained that the other night during an anxiety episode, I was standing still and I was hearing what sounded like the bass from very loud music. I was rather confused about it until several seconds later I looked at myself in the mirror and I could see my carotid arteries pulsating on both sides of my neck. That is when I realize that the ""bass"" I was hearing was actually the sound of my heart beating. 

He decided to start me on a low-dose of Propranolol at 10 mg 2-3 times a day, with the possibility of switching to an extended release or Atenolol if I felt that it was working for me. I don't have a history of high blood pressure or any cardiac history.

If you have been prescribed beta blockers for anxiety, what has been your experience with it?"
823,2,"Hey everyone, as the title suggests, i'm scared of dying in a car crash during an upcoming trip. 

Short background information, i've been experiencing extreme fear of death and health anxiety and all that for the past year. It's gotten worse and worse and now I literally can't go a second without thinking i'm going to die or my loved ones are going to die. (yes i've been trying to get into therapy but the waiting lists are just incredibly long, no chance)

Well, I'm going to go on vacation next month with my boyfriend and his father. We're driving from Germany to France (about a 15 hour drive) and i'm so incredibly scared of getting into a car crash and dying. I can't even explain why, but I have a really bad gut feeling that i'm just going to die during the drive and i don't know what to do. I've got no reason to be scared, his father drove even longer distances to go on vacation on his own but i can't help and feel like ill just die. 

The past 2 nights i couldn't sleep at all because the anxiety is so bad and i've had frequent panic attacks. I'm literally at a point where i'm just gonna stay home :/ And i was so excited for that trip, our first vacation together. 

I don't know what to do it drives me crazy, it's the only thing on my mind and i can't handle it anymore. I'm so scared. "
824,2,"Hi. 

This is so freaking stupid but I just have to know. Does ANYONE out there have anxiety based on pain in your stomach and diarrhea? My worst fear is getting the stomach virus and it’s really affecting me t the point that if my daughter has diarrhea(she is 2) I panick. I’ve stopped eating food that might cause diarrhea and my whole life revolves around my stomach. Is there anyone else out there with the same problem??? I’m so freaking lost. "
825,2,"I’ve always had some degree of anxiety, not anything too crippling. Went to a doctor about it, who prescribed me Prozac and told me I’d have to quit smoking weed (I was a daily smoker). Now my anxiety is through the roof. The thought of taking the Prozac gives me terrible anxiety and going cold turkey on weed has made it worse. I’m at the point where I’d rather just smoke, and quit Prozac all together. I’ve only been on the pill for about a week, but my side effects are crazy. Has anyone else gone through this cycle? Because I feel like I’m going mental. With the Prozac I’m terrified of my mind being screwed up, even though I understand it’s not the science of it. Maybe it’s just the stoner in me, but I feel like I’d rather just smoke weed and go to therapy. "
826,2,"I just need to talk. I have had a particularly hard time with health anxiety. I've literally convinced myself of about 6 different cancers this year and it's only June 🥴. Im struggling this evening.

I really really hate how I can manifest symptoms. Even knowing this, I have a hard time convincing myself its anxiety causing the issue. 

I am currently stressed about colon cancer. I wasn't having stomach issues until I went down this LONG LONG dive into cancer scares. I have a history of unexplained stomach pains. I HATE how symptoms of other stomach issues overlap colon cancer. 

Im trying to not unload on my husband and wanted to say this where others understand. Thanks for letting me ramble."
827,2,Upped my Lexapro 5 weeks ago from 15-20. Anxiety is to the roof. Doc put me on Pregabeline 3x a day 25 mg. Any experience?🙏
828,2,"I was prescribed a small amount of Xanax (.25) to use as needed a while back. Funny thing is I was always too anxious to try it!

A few days ago I was having a horrible series of a few days of panic, so decided to try it and ended up using for four days- once a day. First two days I cut the .25 in half and then the two next days the full .25. 

I’m through my episode and feeling better. I don’t intend to take more and actually might dispose of the rest of them due to my anxiety of taking them. 

Is there any reason why at those low dosages that I should see any physical withdrawal symptoms. I know we are talking something very small; but I was hoping for someone to clear my mind.  "
829,2,"24M.

For the past week my right hand starts heating up whenever I bend my fingers, it’s most prominent when I’m holding my mouse. It’s not hot per se, it just feels hot which leads me to think it might be a nerve issue. Does anyone have any idea on what it could be?"
830,2,"I have been suffering from panic disorder for about 13 years now , i am on benzos and i just recently discovered the power of accepting the symptoms and just trying to live the life and let them just be there , the problem is that i am not very disciplined and this is VERY hard , so if anyone wants to join this discussion so we can help each other stay on track and even DM me if you want to so we can pull each other forward that would be great , one day at a time , one challenge at a time. "
831,2,"I’ve just started a course of Fluoxetine 10mg and I’ve also started my period. However when I took my regular painkillers that usually work, it hasn’t. Has anyone else had this?"
832,2,"I have had the sensation that my (left) ear is blocked from a foreign object and/or that there is a pressure in it for the past few days, and the more I think about it/the more I focus on it, the stronger the sensation gets (especially when I get the thought that someone else could have put something in there, (I get quite paranoid) in those cases the sensation becomes super strong).

I keep trying to rinse out my ear with water and doing that thing where you block your nose and redirect the air to your ears to unblock them, but nothing makes the ""blockage"" go away. I don't know if there actually is something in my ear or if this is a completely mental phenomenon as it practically goes away when I'm not panicking about it. I also keep comparing the difference between my left and right ear and how it feels when I only redirect air to one of them, and I can sense a difference.

I get this in my throat quite often (i think it's called globus sensation iirc), but this is new to me.

It's getting really exhausting and I want it to stop. The feeling of my ear constantly being clogged and the worry that someone might have put something in my ear is causing me panic attacks. What do I do?"
833,2,"I recognise this beginning, the start of something horrible, it's the same shit too, losing connection with friends and family, feeling lonely af, feeling like there's no point of anything, basically thinking that everyone is fake and don't actually like me they're just tolerating me for some reason. Last time i saw this beginning, towards the end of it i actually lost my mind, it was terrible, and now i feel it coming back. What do i do before it gets real and bad. How do i stop it, because once it's on, it's very hard to go back."
834,2,"It's been a little while since ive really been on here but having a bit of a rough day. Think it's a combination of no sleep, poor diet and too much smoking but it's caught up to me today. So figured I'd jump on here and see if anyone is up for a chat to help ease my mind.
If you're also struggling feel free to reach out anytime, always happy to help 😁"
835,2,"I was put on low-dose Xanax (alprazolam - first 1 mg then slowly all the way to 5) by my GP about three years ago and it was genuinely working wonders for me. Like my anxiety was crazy at that point, I would be throwing up before literally any minor activity, I was horrible with eye contact, would shake when someone spoke to me, but I was actually able to have a pretty good social on xanax.

Unfortunately, my GP ended up retiring so when I managed to find a new one she said that it's crazy that I am just casually on xanax without therapy and said she absolutely will not prescribe it to me. I asked if she could at least send me to a psychiatrist because I really don't think my issues can be solved by just talking and she said that it's only gotten so bad because I never went to a psychologist in the first place. Like idk maybe I am overly reliant on meds but I really don't wanna go talk about my feelings or whatever, I really don't think it will stop me from shaking and shit. I even told her about my CSA and that most of my anxiety stems from it and intense bullying and she's like well that's exactly why you gotta talk through it.

Now I am literally doing worse than ever before, once again back to intense panic attacks that happen far more often thaN they did before, I can hardly stand next to someone without shaking and I can't even control it. I've been suffering thru uni and literally self-medicating thru substance abuse otherwise I would not be able to function at work. Doesn't help that I work at a bar lol. I thought about giving the psychologist a try but I'm a broke student and it looks like a waste of money and time. Any advice? Unfortunately, I am from Eastern Europe and unsure if it works here the same as anywhere else. :("
836,2,"i’m really terrified of starting it. the potential side effects are what worry me the most. i’ve been putting it off for years but it’s starting to feel like the only option i have left. i was prescribed citalopram last year, but never even picked up the prescription because i was terrified. 

what helped you guys make the final push to just give it a try? what has your experience been like? and what medications are you guys on? i tend to get quite depressed and also struggle with ocd too. 

thanks guys 💜"
837,2,so I have anxiety disorder but a few people around me used to tell me it's just anxiety not a disorder and that I was being dramatic. I tried to explain the difference but I always have a tough time with it so can someone properly explain it? 
838,2,"For example I have a lot of anxiety in the morning , worrying about everything but then in the afternoon I feel depleted and tired and couldn’t care less about anything. Anyone else have this pattern of symptoms? "
839,2,"Pls send help!!

I called my ex today despite everything that took place between us!! I feel like a cheap floozy now if all things!! God, why did I succumb to my own impulses??!"
840,2,As the title says I couldn't do the bloodwork work cause of my own anxiety trust issues and on top of that side effects of the anti anxiety meds which it didn't help my major case of anxiety of doing bloodwork I don't know what to do now and hopefully the side effects of the anti anxiety medication fades away too am I the only one struggling with anxiety and trust issues and dealing with side effects of the anti anxiety medication? Any advice or help will be appreciated greatly 
841,2,"I have experienced anxiety ever since childhood but thought everyone had that tight feeling in their chest it wasn't until I was 15 and online when I realized it had a name 'anxiety' but it wasn't until I was 17 when I found out that feeling anxious almost every second of the day, having constant panic attacks, chest tight, thought spirals, sleepless nights and much more isn't just anxiety but anxiety disorder. 18 got prescribed anti depressants. It's a boring story but social media lowkey saved me. "
842,2,"Has anyone started Prozac and had ZERO side effects? Was recently prescribed 20mg of Prozac and hydroxyzine to take as needed. I’ve never been in any type of antidepressant or SSRI. 
I stay home and take care of my 4 kids (10,9,3 and 3) so I’m always nervous and paranoid of something happening to me while I’m here alone with them. I don’t want to get sick or have really bad panic attacks while I’m here with them. 
I was thinking maybe I should just take it at night before bed? But then heard maybe I won’t be able to sleep? 🙃🫠
What do you guys think?!"
843,2,I've been experiencing loneliness due to Anxiety about going out and socializing. It is a choice but it also isn't. How do you guys deal with loneliness? And social anxiety?
844,2,"Ive heard prozac is bad for anxiety due to being super activating, i was on it for 3-4 weeks before a old doctor took me off says it shoulda worked by then and i do remember being kinda restless and shaky and panicky Alot. Snri seem to make me depressed more. My anxietys taking over now to where i get quite a bit of physical symptoms and my newish pshyc wants to try prozac again since lexapro, celexa, zoloft, paxil are all yellow and says significant reduced efficiancy. And she said it could take way longer then 3-4 weeks to work for prozac. But im scared as i cannot afford this anxiety thats way worse now to get even worse like it did when i tried prozac 7 months ago.  I was freaking out wanting to call 911 scared to death most the time. I do have benzos now to maybe help. "
845,2,"Here is the situation,

  
My fiancé's parents are coming into town from India to stay with us for two weeks. This is already a bit of an anxiety-inducing situation, hosting my future in-laws. There is a language and cultural barrier, and on top of that, my fiancé and I share a house with two other roommates. Our roommates have OK'd the stay under the impression that my partner's parents would be staying with us for only four or so days. I have mentioned to him several times that he needs to discuss the extended stay with our roommates, as it is more than twice what they had expected. He is not understanding me when I tell him that this is a pretty big imposition to put on our roommates, and the date for his parents' arrival is coming up (a little more than two weeks away now).   
  
While my fiancé's parents are here, my parents are flying into town for a few days to meet his parents for the first time and will be staying at a hotel nearby. I think the meeting will mostly be okay, but extremely awkward again due to language barriers, cultural differences, and also the fact that despite never meeting, my parents already have a dislike for my future father-in-law because he and his side of the family have had a lot of opinions about my ethnicity.  
  
On top of all of this, I have just started a new job and will be managing this all while trying to host and having to take some time off work to take my in-laws around.

So anyway, every time I think about this entire situation gives me so much anxiety that I feel physically ill and have to lie down to prevent myself from throwing up. So, I am wondering if it would be possible to perhaps get some sort of medication that I could just take temporarily during these two weeks to keep my sanity. I don't want anxiety medication forever, just to manage this particularly stressful time for me. Is that possible? "
846,2,"For the past 6 months, I've been having issues with my stomach. It all started when I actually WAS diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis. From there, my health anxiety spiraled. But now I'm terrified I have colon cancer. My stomach is all messed up. Pain, diarrhea, gurgling. I just can't take it. I'm scared. I do plan to have it checked next month, but I don't think I can cope that long. "
847,2,"22 | M

I have a history of mental anxiety on and off, at best I would loose appetite/weight. But recently, seemingly without any apparent direct anxiety, I started feeling scared that increased my HR to 120-140 which I kinda know to just let it happen and pass. Until it reached 160-180 which I tried to sit with it as I had already got checked by a doc, got blood tests related to heart done and everything was normal so i was sure its just anxiety. When it stayed like this for like 30 minutes and peaked at 200, I had to rush to the ER because I was feeling like its gonna explode. They did 2 ECGs, one during panic attack, one after it. Both were normal. BP was 150/90. And the recorded HR there was 175 bpm.

After like 20 days, a similar episode happened again, this didnt go to the ER but had a propanolol 5 mg (cuz 10 mg just feels alot), which I took and just sat somewhere alone and it thankfully came down after 15-20 minutes.

Now according to the tests, my heart is fine, but iam not!! I dont even know if this is panic attack, cuz my HR rises first, I check it, get freaked out, and then it rises more, so it pretty much seems like a heart problem, but like my tests are all ok. I am just confused as hell now like should I take propanolol daily? Like I cant just live normally now as my heart rate will SEVERELY increase at any moment? "
848,2,"Hello,

I was wondering if people have successfully stopped taking meds without rebouncing. Did your anxiety / depression return after you stopped or where you managing without meds aswell? 

I am really curious so let me know about your stories:)"
849,2,"My anxiety is so bad I can’t eat, my heart is always pounding and I feel so scared and alone . I’m on a SSRI (Lexapro 10mg once daily) but it’s not helping! I constantly feel like I’m trembling and I just want it to stop. "
850,2,"Yesterday, I suddenly started having an episode of tachycardia. I didn’t have any other symptoms of anxiety besides that. My palpitations were EXTREME, and even after taking Metoprolol (a very small dose) and Buspirone, it didn’t get any better.

At some point, it subsided, but as soon as I lay down to sleep, it started again. It was more than three hours of horror. For several minutes, my heart was beating so hard and fast that I could feel it in my ears. I turned to ChatGPT to find out if it was time to go to the hospital (judge me if you want), and it recommended that I shouldn’t take anything else or go, as based on my symptoms, I wasn’t in any danger.

I sat down and listened to some relaxing music, and it gradually got better on its own. But this started at 9 p.m., and I only managed to fall asleep at 4 a.m.

What’s most interesting is that my anxiety has always been triggered by my heart, and this time I had the worst tachycardia of my life, but it simply didn’t trigger any of my other symptoms.

It was very cold here, and since we’re not used to low temperatures in Brazil, I believe that might have been a trigger."
851,2,"Ever since COVID hit, I've had to deal with anxiety issues. Currently, I'm at my breaking point. I panic every day. My parents are never there and neither are my friends. My house has many problems and I don't have enough to fix it. I've been threatened many times. I'm done. It's gotten to the point where I have 3 attempts. I just don't know what to do anymore. "
852,2,"Okay, here’s the thing. I’m so confused. Everyone keeps saying it’s OCD, but like… what I go through feels so much messier than that. It’s not just one obsession or one ritual. My brain doesn’t even work like that.

My biggest issue isn’t handwashing or checking stuff — it’s that my mind doesn’t shut up. Ever. I have racing thoughts, like 50 tabs open at once, and every single one is screaming at me. Or even one single thought that cant leave my mind , not even one specific fear — it’s just a constant storm in my head. I get stuck in thoughts that loop forever  and they don’t stop unless something outside forces them to.

Sometimes I put on music and pace around the house just to feel normal again. Not because I want to daydream  but also because it’s the only thing that gives me a break. But then I feel so guilty and mentally sick after ( it's like this is the only way I can get better) like I wasted all my energy on stuff that doesn’t even matter. It’s like I need loud stimulation just to feel okay — which makes no sense, because most people can’t focus with noise, and yet I can’t function without it. What is that???And when I tried meds, like SSRIs, they didn’t help the way I expected. They didn’t stop the thoughts in a healthy way. They just made me emotionally flat. Like I wasn’t thinking anymore, but I wasn’t alive either. That’s not healing. That’s shutting down.

Yes, I’ve had OCD-ish stuff before, like redoing prayers or staying in the shower too long. But honestly? Those never ruined my life. I’ve lived with that and adapted. I wasn’t miserable. But these racing thoughts, this constant brain-noise, this hijacking — that’s the stuff that kills me. That’s what I’m crying out to fix. That’s what makes me feel like I’m losing my mind.

So yeah, maybe I do have some OCD traits, but this feels bigger, messier, and more layered. It’s not just about fears and rituals. It’s like my brain has no brakes and the only way to survive is by throwing myself into random distractions to “shut it down.”

I thought classic ocd is like a thought pops in, I get scared, and then I do a compulsion to make the fear go away but in my case its more like relief comes only through emotional burnout, not through some ritual like checking or counting yk what I mean?

  
I don't wanna take meds jf they will just numb me out

853,2,I went to my new psychiatrist today and he was very nice and he was very knowledgeable while answering all of my questions. He did a psychiatric evaluation on me and he doesn't believe I have bipolar disorder which I knew I didn't but I knew about the anxiety and depression that he was actually very concerned. I tried everything to control it but it just keeps getting worse and many of the antidepressants that I took just didn't work. If it works even 60% I would be happy but he's also thinking about adding a mood stabilizer eventually. I wish I didn't have to be on two different medications for antidepressants but mine is just so severe that right now I don't have a choice. I remember my old psychiatrist told me that ADHD was for kids and that adults couldn't have it. My psychiatrist also explain to me that sends I'm on the autism spectrum that it's not uncommon for them to also have ADHD. I feel like I made some progress. I only had to go to one appointment in person and the rest will be on Telehealth because I don't drive due to other medical reasons. 
854,2,"I’m experiencing persistent episodes where I feel like my consciousness is flickering on and off minute by minute. It feels like I’m on autopilot or sleepwalking and then back to reality. 

Things that happen in the morning feel distant and weeks ago when at night. I feel confused but I can remember things. Can anyone relate? I’m scared I have a neurological issue.

855,2,"I take Vyvanse 40 mg for my ADHD and Lexapro 10 mg for anxiety every morning. I have started to get lightheaded, dizzy, shaky, nauseous every morning just before work or before any stressful(to my brain) situation. My psych NP doesn’t believe in Xanax or Klonopin because they are addictive. What other options are there to stop this panic attack/over the top anxiety I’m having? I had .05 Klonopin once before (7 years ago) and it worked but it always had a secondary anxiety attack the next day. 
Help please I feel like this is ruining my life. Thanks. "
856,2,"Hello, I'm 17 and here is my anxiety journey in a nutshell. I don’t understand why it happens >:C, especially when I feel completely prepared. Even when I know I’m going to ace an exam and I’m sitting confidently in the exam hall, the moment I receive the paper even knowing all the answers I suddenly experience intense stomach pain and have to rush to the washroom.

This all started during my first chemistry test in school. At the time, I didn’t think much of it, but over time, it has slowly taken over my life. Now it happens even outside of exams. At the gym, I get severe stomach aches, start sweating, overthink everything, heartbeat out of this universe, start feeling very very weak like I can get blown by the wind, and my vision begins to fade as soon as I step in. The same thing happens when I go kickboxing even though I know I’m safe and nothing bad is going to happen.

I tried seeing therapists, but all they did was diagnose me with social anxiety disorder and prescribe different types of antidepressants, increasing the dosage every week. Eventually, they told me to find a different therapist of the same ethnicity, but I haven’t been able to, and honestly, I’m not even sure that would help.

My school is about 40 minutes from home, and the drive has become one of the hardest parts of my day. Around the 20 minute mark, my anxiety peaks I get a horrible stomach ache, can’t sit still, and feel like I’m falling apart. But the strangest thing is, as soon as I step out of the car, the pain just fades away, and as soon as I step into my school, it starts again :/

It’s really hard to explain the pain to my family or anyone else. They think I'm pretending so I don't have to go to school or trying to skip something."

858,2,"I've been going through CBT and OCD therapy and I've come to a realization that I think I purposefully make myself anxious or at least trigger the physical symptoms of anxiety as an act of justification. For example, I am nervous to fly on a plane, but I know that there are plenty of things to keep me safe (pilots, airport security, my bf sitting next to me, etc.). However, I then tell myself I am not *feeling* anxious enough to justify my anxious thoughts.  Is there anyone else in here that feels/thinks similarly? Is this literally what anxiety is? I'm really over that and my OCD being my biggest internal bully. TIA!"

861,2,"I have never been able to manage my stress well. That's important to note. I have been on Venlafaxine (Effexor) for years. My dosage has increased and decreased. I am currently and have been for a year at the max dosage of 225mg.

I get cluster migraines triggered by stress. I have now triggered an anxiety attack as well. I recently went to the e.r. because I had racing heart, started to get upset and heavy sense of anticipation/dread. I felt like something was about to happen to me. (Like someone is gonna jump scare me? Closest thing I could think of feeling wise)
They did all the tests and gave me medicine to help me relax. (Can't remember what they gave me ) But after a few hours they released me with ""anxiety, palpitations and tachycardia as my diagnosis"" and I was able to sleep. Before hand I would jolt awake every few hours. 

Fast forward to dr follow up. I communicated everything to the best of my ability. She told me that stress seems to be the trigger. She continued to tell me things I can do to help. She also told me I could take Buspirone to help as well. She told me that some people take it daily while others as needed. I've looked at a few articles online and they say it takes weeks to take effect? If thats the case why would she give me the script and tell me I could take it when I need it? I did tell her I would take the script so if I need it I have it. I've read some reddit posts about it as well. I'm terrified to try and take it this weekend to see how it works for me. I'm wondering if I should even try it this weekend and risk being miserable or just taking it if / when I need it for increased anxiety? 

Any opinions, experiences, tips, etc are appreciated. "
862,2,"My anxiety is beyond embarrassing, my panic attacks feel so vulnerable and exposing. I’d rather go anywhere completely alone because the thought of panicking in front of others in a social group is so humiliating to me. I feel like a walking vibe killer. If I was somewhere in public but by myself, it’s not as bad because I can dip without having to over-explain myself to my group what I’m doing and why I’m leaving, or putting the burden on them to help ground me. 

Idk i’ve just never quite had that true feeling of safety with friends or social groups. I feel safer just tending to myself, tbh. Anyone relate to this? "

I go months at a time without taking it, but if it a bunch of big social events come up, I limit myself to 2 x a week. Is there any downsides to taking .25-.5 mg twice a week for a few week at time? I have zero physical desire to take it anymore then that but just worried about if it could affect my health negatively. Im very well aware of the addiction potential which is why I figured twice a week is ok but just wanted second thoughts! Thank you"

869,2,"Hi! I’m wondering if anyone has any advice on pushing back on taking a SSRI that was prescribed for anxiety/GAD and asking for a treatment plan without the use of medication? (E.g. CBT, exercise, diet changes etc.). Have you had a positive experience doing so or were you met with resistance/insistence on taking medication as part of your treatment?

Without going into the gory details, I’m struggling with burnout / workplace related stress and anxiety and I’m developing a treatment plan with my healthcare provider. I’m currently taking some time off work to recover. My healthcare provider prescribed Zoloft + doing CBT for 8-12 weeks, as well as lifestyle changes such as diet and extra exercise. 

I’m keen on doing CBT and the lifestyle stuff but I want to give those a shot before seriously considering taking pills. I’ve always been a bit hesitant about taking medications but this one seems particularly daunting with the possible side effects etc. I just want to make sure I’ve done all that I possibly can without starting SSRIs. 

TIA!"
870,2,"Hello I’m f(18) and I’ve had extreme anxiety and often panic attacks since I was in first grade. Whenever I see the clock ticking down and I only have a certain amount of time to submit something I can’t control myself anymore. Just today I had a test and I got locked out of submitting my work because it was 1 minute past the deadline. I had a full breakdown, i desperately emailed my teacher and all she told me was to email it to her in a single PDF and that she’s not answering anymore emails tonight. I want to get my anxiety under control desperately. I even went to a therapist with anxiety as one of my main concerns and my therapist just told me that I was fine and everyone has anxiety.

871,2,"Like for example, maybe my chest hurts and I start getting anxious thinking I am having a heart attack.

The fear isn't the heart attack itself, it's more what if I am actually having a heart attack and I didn't listen to the signs. What if I could survive this but I'm not going to because I didn't go to the ER or whatever.

Funnily enough I feel really calm in hospitals, because in my head it's like, well if I start having a heart attack or something it's out of my hands at that point, I'm surrounded by people who will do everything they can to save me, and if I still die there was nothing that could be done.

It's strange, I don't have a fear of dying, I have a fear of dying to something that could be treatable. Anyone else feel like this? I also don't fear being dead, I fear the process of dying and the panic that will definetly set in when I realize I am dying."
872,2,"Hey everyone,

I started quietiapine 5 days ago to try and treat my anxiety. My doctor started me on a low dosage, 25mg. I know it's fairly early to tell, but increased my anxiety considerably over these past 5 days.   
Anxiety increased in strength and frequency (although it was always underlying for me).  
The backup option my doctor suggested me, although completely different kind of medication, was gabapentin and I am honestly considering switching out already.   
I already also tried pregabalin before and all it did for me was making me sleepy and making my head spin frequently, both reasons for which I decided to stop.

Do you think I actually should go ahead and request my doctor for a gabapentin prescription, or should I try give quetiapine a bit more time and see if this changes? What are your experiences with both, gabapentin and quetiapine for anxiety?  
Thanks."

875,2,"Hey everyone, I've been dealing with anxiety for a couple of years now, and lately I've been trying different online resources - some meditation apps, breathing exercises, even some worksheets I found. It's been somewhat helpful, but I'm curious about what's worked for others here.

Do you prefer apps, websites, or more traditional methods? Sometimes I feel like having everything in one place would be nice instead of jumping between different apps. What's your experience been like with digital tools vs. in-person therapy?

Not trying to replace real help, just looking for ways to manage day-to-day stuff better. Would love to hear what's worked (or hasn't worked) for you all!"
876,2,"**I'll keep the background quick and get right into the feeling.** For the last month and a half, I was constantly getting worried due to my partial emetophobia (fear of throwing up) and fear of needles. These are my top two fears. Originally it was the emetophobia: something would trigger it, and my brain would go ""oh gosh, I'm going to throw up"". This was at least once a day, every day, and was rarely actual nausea and more of stomach noises/sounds and a comment from another person (""my stomach hurts""). Then I started getting anxious about the upcoming Doomsday: a day when I would have to get a shot. Long story short, my emetophobia has cooled down, and Doomsday was resolved.

**But that's not what this post is about.** This post is about the feeling I had on Doomsday right after school (I'm a teen, the shot took place in school). I was never called to the Gym to get the shot, and I was now worried my mom would take me right after school. So I'm walking to my mom's car, worrying like crazy, and she asks why I looked upset (I'm an optimistic, happy person, so if I'm not smiling after school she knows something's up). I tell her, and she explains the whole situation to me. 

**On the car ride home, everything started to sink in.** I wasn't getting a shot. I wasn't going to throw up. I wasn't going to die. I could finally look forward to the end of the school year (with Doomsday as a blocker, I hadn't done that yet). I was calm. I felt like a little kid again, innocent, just solving 1+1 and playing on the playground. Never thinking too far ahead, never stressing over irrational things, shedding tears over silly things for a few minutes instead of over real ones for hours. I was free of the struggles, the pain, the emotions. I was free of stress, of depression, of negativity. **I was human.**

**I don't know if any of you have ever felt this before, but if you did, I'm sure you know exactly what I'm talking about.** And for those who haven't, well, I don't hope you'll develop anxiety, but if you do, the feeling of it all going away is definitely something to strive towards. Good luck on your anxiety journey. I hope this post made your day even a little better."
877,2,"I’m 22 and still live at home with my mum, it’s just me and her. 

I have this deep fear or sense of uneasiness whenever she leaves for work in the morning that she’s gonna get into a car crash and die or something. I’m always scared that when she walks out the door, that’s gonna be the last time I see her again and I’m gonna get a phone call that she’s dead.

Or if I don’t go in and physically say goodnight to her then she’s gonna die in her sleep and I would have missed my last chance to hug her and tell her I love her. 

I don’t have any friends and my mum is pretty much the only person I hang out with and rely on so maybe this is exacerbating my fear as I don’t know how I’d live without her.

Her: the new anxiety meds might help with that too

883,2,"Hey everyone,

I’m a 22-year-old female from India. I’ve lived in a metro city all my life, and now I’m about to move to another metro for further studies. Even though it’s still a big city, the thought of moving out and living alone for the first time is honestly overwhelming.

I’m really close to my parents and have never stayed away from home, so it’s a big emotional shift for me. I do know how to cook and manage basic stuff, but I’m unsure how well I’ll adapt to a completely new environment.

Sometimes, I spiral into worry—like what if something bad happens, or I end up with a nightmare of a roommate? I know it sounds dramatic, but those late-night thoughts just won’t stop. I’m also concerned about my parents’ health. They’re getting older, and since I’m an only child, I keep wondering how they’ll manage without me around.

Another major concern is safety. In my current city, I know the roads, the people, and I have the confidence to get home safely, even late at night. But the city I’m moving to has a reputation for being unsafe for women (I won’t name it to avoid controversy, and I might be wrong — it’s just the general perception I’ve grown up with), and that’s been adding to my anxiety.

If any of you have gone through a similar transition — moving cities, living alone for the first time, or dealing with similar fears — I’d love to hear how things evolved for you. Did it get easier over time? What helped?

Also, I’d appreciate any tips on must-haves to carry while packing — practical things that made your life easier during the move.

Thanks a lot in advance 💛

884,2,"Hi. I graduated in 2021 with a good grade from a highly rated university. Since then I have had jobs but I have been underemployed. A reason for this is that when I apply for jobs I am usually offered an interview, however I always become highly avoidant of preparing for the interview due to heightened anxiety (in the days/ weeks prior to the interview, I am almost in a dissociated state of being). I follow the same pattern every single time — I get offered an interview for a great job, I fail to prepare, and then at the last minute I have panic attacks and cancel the interview. Then I exhibit delusional behaviour and think that things will be different next time. And I repeat the same pattern — again and again and again. I have probably done this about 60 times since the beginning of 2021. This means that I have missed out on lots of wonderful job opportunities. Every time, after I have cancelled the interview, I feel like a failure and self-hatred creeps in. Does anyone have any good advice on overcoming extreme phobia/ fear of interviews? Please help, this problem is having huge repercussions on my career and my finances. "

Hi, everyone! I need to get something off my chest.
I'm using the translator, so if there's anything strange, you already know.
I apologize for the length of the text, but I have to write it down if it doesn't make sense.

Well, to put it in context, I'm 23 years old and I'm currently in graduate school. 
I've been suffering from severe anxiety for a few years and unfortunately I don't treat myself.

My anxiety is mainly focused on health issues, I've had several crises because of this (from tumors, cancer, diabetes, heart attacks, etc.)

By not treating myself properly I ended up getting used to living with it and developing some personal strategies such as breathing tricks, not researching anything on the internet and other small things that I've learned to deal with.

As a result, I live with unusual stress as well.
The last time I had hormone tests (about two years ago) my cortisol was very high, but nothing was done about it.

But lately, since the start of my postgraduate studies, I've been feeling really good, I've matured and I've been really focused on my academic portfolio. I felt my stress was under control and my anxiety I could deal with like a normal person, without thinking about illnesses or paying attention to absurd physical things. I was even considering seeking medical help to improve even more.

However, today I did something I shouldn't have: I woke up a little more stressed about things that were overdue and I didn't remember, and I felt something I hadn't felt for a long time. 
That's where I'm at: every time I get stressed (like a lot) I get a pain in the middle of my back in the kidney area. I've had it for many years, it's not something recent and it only appears in very stressful moments.

I can't explain it, but it's a deep pain that comes and goes. Usually when I move it hurts as if it were muscular (?) and it lasts throughout the period of stress. 
So, guys, I broke a personal rule of mine: I researched a lot of things on the internet and now I suspect I have some bad things.

I researched my pain in the kidney area and came up with things related to high cortisol levels (which I already have), a possible cushing's syndrome and tumors in the area that cause this stress. As I write this, I'm feeling a little better, but I'm still worried.

I've suspected I might have this syndrome a few times, but I've brushed it off. I have almost no symptoms of it (at least I don't think so): I sleep well (it's very difficult to have a sleepless night), my blood pressure rises with crises, but in normal mode I don't have high blood pressure. I don't have concentrated abdominal fat and I don't feel my legs are weak (many people have said they have this). 
The only possible thing is a certain “hump” in the neck area that I think I have and have been observing, the high cortisol that I have / a lot of stress.

Now I'm here, I was fine for weeks and now I'm scared to death. Could it be that after so many years of untreated anxiety/stress I've developed this syndrome? Is the pain I always feel when I'm stressed a sign? Could it be a tumor that hurts (???) and is actually related to the kidneys?

Anyway, I know I need to go to the doctor because he'll give me the right answers. I just wrote to let off steam so we could talk, I don't know. 

I want to get rid of these feelings and it's high time I did. I need to know what's going on in my body and in my head. But deep down I'm scared.

Thank you for reading this far 💕💕💕"
888,2,"Hi this is my first time posting on here but I could really use some advice. My last couple hours of work yesterday I started to get this stabbing pain in the left side of my chest, coincidentally right where my heart is it feels like. It feels like I’m getting stabbed, I would even describe it like an intense zap or burning kinda sensation. I could point to the spot right on my chest it’s a small area right over my heart. 
I’ve had the pressure/soreness kinda feeling due to my anxiety but never this. These seem a little more intense. I been freaking out over it and now I’m obsessing over it and feel it on and off all day. 

My thoughts are telling me it’s the end for me and I could really use some reassurance if it’s just my anxiety… has anyone ever experienced this? 😭"

living a nightmare over here. recently l discovered my anxiety might be OCD, currently figuring it out with a therapist. "
890,2,"Im mostly just posting this because I feel pretty scared and alone these days and thought that having some community would help ease that but 

The past like 6 months my anxiety has spiked like crazy and I think (probably due to some nervous system dysregulation) that has manifested in digestive issues ive already had worsening. I dont have health insurance and things have been complicated so ive just been able to schedule an appointment to see a doctor, but the appt is in 2 weeks. I already have medical anxiety so this whole thing keeps making me spiraling and it's just so hard to wait. I just want to feel safe in my body.

I'm going through the motions but its just so hard. Im going to therapy, trying to do yoga and meditation, ive started taking vitamin D and some other supplements, practicing distress tolerance techniques, but everything is so hard. Its hard to work, its hard to get out of bed, its hard to just get through the day. I'm trying, but its so hard. 

Does anyone have any advice or can provide any solace for me during this period? I feel like im just waiting for my efforts to finally amount to something. "
891,2,"Okay I want to just say I’m pretty sure I have social anxiety but now I think I’m developing or always have had like “regular” anxiety. I just was on a flight and we had rough turbulence that I’ve never experienced before and I thought of everything that could happen and I was shaking so hard. (Especially since  that air India flight crashed hours before I got on). Everything ended being okay but now I think it triggered me. I’m now thinking what if we crash while on the airport shuttle or in the car ride home. Every little shake or bump on the tram has me panicking. It’s gotten so bad I’m thinking man what if I die in my sleep. I’m so scared and I feel like I died and this is my own personal hell. 

Im not asking for a medical diagnosis but do you think this is just me being dramatic or should I talk to my therapist about this? (Sorry for the long text) "
892,2,So I felt a lump in my armpit but I know I’ve had it before where I get a cystic pimple so I tried to squeeze and some blood and puss came out but I noticed this on Tuesday and it’s still here. It itches and it’s uncomfortable and my brain wants to say it’s cancer. Just freaking myself out and what’s the difference between a cancerous one and a pimple. Bc it feels firm like a ball almost? Idk I’m scared 
893,2,"This may seem corny to most, but this is for people that were like me and literally felt like they had no one that cares or no one that understands them. I can promise you that there is someone that loves you, and that's yourself! Man for years and years I was my own worst enemy, multiple self-deletion thoughts and even a few attempts. I recently crept back into it pretty bad, but I realized something this time, IM not a bad person. I'm not some scum of the earth, I DESERVE PEACE AND HAPPINESS. I've started writing notes to myself, listing the positive things about me, and there are quite a few! I have a huge heart, I've always tried to help people, even people I didn't like. Ain't no chains can hold my body down, and anxiety/depression isn't gonna fucking stop me. Again, you can laugh at this, but I hope one person can get something out of this. You deserve to be happy, you deserve to have peace, and it is out there! I'm wading in the shit right there with you! Life is hard, but we're harder! I'm no therapist, just a guy fighting shit everyday, but if you feel like you have no one, you have me! I will listen, dm, whatever I can to help. Much love 🤙🏻. "
894,2,I am constanly paranoid that someone I love or my friends will betray me and hurt me.
895,2,"ok so i entered a very stressful point in my life around november of last year and im also a generally VERY tense person. like something is always pulling at my mind and i can never relax. ive also been depressed as shit for the past month and i don’t brush my hair consistently at all, so it knots up at the ends. when i’m bored or anxious for no reason, i rake my hand through the knots and try to untangle them, but im losing a lot of hair by doing this because i either end up pulling the knots out entirely or just small strands come out as i go 🥲 my hair’s been thick all of my life but it started thinning out around december/january because of this and i just can’t stop. even when i catch myself doing it, i stop for like 2 mins and then start up again without thought soon after. im not sure what this is called or if its a thing but can someone PLEASE give me any advice 😭 i want my hair to be healthy so bad but this habit of mine is ruining it "
896,2,"I’m not sure what’s wrong with me sometimes. My anxiety is over things like getting sick at work or running late. Mostly small things but I’ll have a huge panic attack over things like that. However let something absolutely terrible/ a crisis happen I’m extremely logical, no anxiety and ready to go. I’ve always been like this even as a child but why does this happen?? "
897,2,"Hi everyone,

I’m really struggling right now and just need to talk to someone who understands. I’ve always had a hard time making decisions, even small ones — but this time it feels unbearable.

Right now, I’m stuck between two job offers. One offers more money, and the other offers better growth and future opportunity. On the surface, it might seem like a good problem to have, but for me, it’s causing intense anxiety. I know what’s beat for me but I fear I might make a bad decision. I’m constantly overthinking. My mind won’t shut off, I can’t sleep, and I feel like I’m on the verge of tears all the time. I keep worrying I’ll make the wrong choice and ruin my future.

I want to talk to my parents about it, but I don’t know how to bring it up or whether they’ll understand how heavy this feels for me. I’m not even sure if this is normal anxiety or something deeper. It’s starting to affect everything — my focus, my mood, and even my ability to enjoy anything.

Part of me feels like everything bad always happens to me. I know it’s not rational, but it’s how I feel in the moment. I’m tired of carrying this alone.

Has anyone gone through something similar? How did you manage it? Did therapy help you with decision-making anxiety? 
How did you tell your parents/partner? I’m open to hearing anything — advice, personal experiences, even just knowing I’m not alone.
"
898,2,"I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed lately, and it’s been building up for a long time. One of the things I’ve struggled with is how deeply I react when I accidentally break or damage something I own. It might seem small from the outside — like dropping something or scratching an item I bought — but for me, it triggers this intense wave of guilt, frustration, and self-blame. I try so hard to take care of my things, to be responsible, to do everything right… but when something slips, I feel like I’ve failed completely. I start calling myself names in my head, like ‘reckless’ or ‘stupid,’ and those thoughts just spiral until I can’t take it anymore.

Sometimes, that pain becomes so unbearable that I end up doing something destructive — like throwing or breaking the item on purpose — not because I don’t care, but because I feel like I’ve already ruined it, and I’m so mad at myself for ‘messing up’ again. I’ve done this with multiple things over time. And every time it happens, I promise myself I’ll be better, I’ll try harder, I’ll keep things safe. But then something small happens again, and the cycle repeats. It makes me feel ashamed, like I’ll never learn, and that I’m too much — even for the people who care about me.

The person I usually talk to is my boyfriend. I tell him everything, even when I’m at my lowest, and I’ve told him about this pattern many times. But I’m scared I’ve become a burden. He recently asked for space, and while I respect that, it also hurts so much because now I feel even more alone. I don’t have a lot of friends or support systems, and I can’t afford therapy right now. So most of the time, I just keep everything to myself until it explodes. I don’t want to keep living like this. I’m tired of the anxiety, the guilt, the way I turn on myself. I want to understand why I react this way and learn how to be more gentle with myself — but I don’t know how to do it alone. I’m reaching out not because I expect anyone to fix me, but because I just want someone to understand. To listen. To maybe remind me that I’m not broken beyond repair."

I cut my pinkie with a salad slicer. It cut off my skin a little and it’s been bleeding ever since.
I wrapped a plaster around it but it quickly drenched it with my blood. Then I used a lot of tissue papers and applied pressure on it. It was still bleeding and painful and throbbing.
I used another plaster and so far it doesn’t seem like it has drenched it with my blood but it still is throbbing a bit.
My brother has suggested using aftershave, but I’m not so sure when it’s still bleeding.
What can I do?"
900,2,"Triggers: talk about illness and death 
When I turned 18 I started having a lot of health issues but I’ve always had anxiety and I’ve been in therapy for 5 years. Because i started having health issues I think I sort of developed this horrible fear of always having something wrong with me. It takes so much self control not to call my doctors all the time or make a new appointment to see if there’s something wrong. 
I think I struggle with this because there has been SEVERAL times where I went to the doctor and there was actually something wrong. I can’t really just say “it’s all in my head” because there’s been several times where it really wasn’t. 
I feel like my every day is a cycle of rituals to keep me from dying prematurely. Gotta sleep enough because I don’t want to develop dementia, floss every day because I’m scared of gum disease, waiting for my drinks to cool down enough because of esophageal cancer, staying completely sober because of cancer and other related diseases, putting on sunscreen all the time to avoid UV rays. I feel like these are normal habits and I even get praised by doctors and other people for being so consistent. But I live in fear of disease and death all the time. 
When I had been depressed earlier in my life I didn’t care about my health at all because I didn’t care about myself but now that I’ve sort of gotten into a period of my life where I’m somewhat content, new strong anxieties have popped up because I’m so afraid of losing all of this. 
Everyone in my life I talk to thinks it’s not that big of a deal and that everything will be fine with me. But I don’t think they understand how much my life is controlled by fear. 
I think occasionally my therapist isn’t really aware of how badly this affects my life. 
It makes it worse that I know that stressing is actually bad for your health as well. 
I have a really hard time trying to tell if any symptoms I’m having are worth seeing someone for or not and my family is mostly no help because they don’t understand anything about illness for the most part.
I just needed to scream into the void and put my feelings somewhere"
901,2,"Don’t you hate it when your brain randomly brings up an anxious moment that happened forever ago? Like a moment where you remember it, and your heart just falls to the floor? I remembered something from January 2024, and now that exact moment (and those exact feelings) are just playing in my head. Anxiety is great. 🫠"
902,2,"TW: ergophobia/performance anxiety, panic attacks(?)

Hello,

Lately I've been having intense anxiety about going to work and also at work. It's gotten to the point where I can spot when I have an anxiety/panic attack approaching. It's happening around 1-2 times per week. I don't think they can be classified as proper panic attacks since they don't totally take me out of commission and I just work through them when I can.

But I know that just working through them and letting my anxiety about it grow isn't healthy. I think the main problems are that my workplace is short-staffed and I'm not very quick at my job so I always fear that I'll run out of time and won't be able to complete everything I need to. We're paid by the minute and any overtime needs to be approved beforehand so I'm afraid that if I ask for more time too much I'll be fired.

I'm just trying to figure out what I should say to my manager. I already asked for help because I'm afraid that I can't get things completed and they provided accomidations for that already. Logically I know that I can't be fired for my attacks but I worry it would be too much to accommodate and then I'll lose my job."
903,2,"After a brief few months of anxiety back after graduating college (age 25), I had been fine until I was 32. All of sudden I experienced a panic attack during a meeting out of nowhere. Constant chest tightness, random acute shooting pains, numbness, etc. After two years on Lexapro and then briefly trying Welbutrin combo'd with the lexapro, I finally decided the lack of motivation, sex drive, and other side affects were not worth it. I weened myself off of all the medication except I will take a hydroxizine when I feel an attack coming on. I truly don't believe it's anxiety causing the chest pain anymore and think it is something like costochondritis or a back disc issue???? I have ruled out everything else. I had a gastro run a 24 hour ph study, literally 0.1% readings for acid reflux and they recommended not even bothering with my scheduled endoscopy. I have been to a cardiologist and had a stress test done. Chest X-rays, ECG's, EKG's, every blood test that would indicate any infection, myocharditis, etc. All of which have been negative results and have shown no sign of issues. If I am sitting in a car for too long, bending over to fold laundry, I get a tight feeling in my chest. I've stretched my arms upwards and had shooting pain in my sternum that makes it hurt to breathe deeply. None of the doctors have thought it sounds like costo. Is it possible I have something wrong in my spine or back that could cause the constant chest discomfort? I am running out of options or things to try and it's reducing my quality of life heavily. I feel like the chest issue is being caused by something, which then triggers the anxiety and chest pain, rather than the anxiety causing the chest pain. I am out of tests to run and things to try."
904,2,Just got my first job that isn't working for a family member. It's in fast food my first day I almost passed out an hour in due to hyperventilating. My  second day I called out sick in the parking lot because I saw how many cars were in the drive thru and panicked. Theyl place I'm at is really short staffed so they couldn't train me just stuck me on drive thru and told me good luck. Since then I'll start randomly hyperventilating and heart skipping beats even at the thought of showing up to work. I'm trying to look for a new job before outright quitting but I don't know how much longer I can deal with this. I'm trying to find a job with less human interactions but I can't find any.
905,2,"This has been happening for about 7 years. I don’t remember when or why but one day I developed a fear of throwing up. Over the years it’s gotten better and I’ve been able to see people throw up without it bothering me but the thought of me doing it sucks. In public and around people I tend to get pretty anxious. It could be anything, maybe I smoke too much and get scared or I start thinking about work I have to do. It starts small but then I start to feel it in my stomach and from there I get anxious that I might throw up. I could be any feeling in my stomach or neck even just spit forming in my mouth and I get scared that I will throw up. This then makes me even more anxious and starts a cycle. This happens almost every time I’m out or with people and I don’t know what to do. People have told me that I need to just face it but does that mean throwing up? I don’t know if I need to get through the normal anxiety first before facing the fear of throwing up. "
906,2,"Years and years of me worrying over the news and current events have taught me what are good sources, and what are sources that are trying to scare people for clicks. I am probably far more media literate than the average person. In addition, the bout of severe weather anxiety I suffered as a child actually made me quite interested in how the weather works, and meteorology as a bit of a hobby."
907,2,"I (21F) went swimming at Blue Hole park in Georgetown, TX on Saturday. It's part of the San Gabriel river and it has several small waterfalls/dams where the water flows. I wanna say the temperature outside was around 94°, so I'm concerned the temperature of the water was suitable for bacteria growth. The water where I jumped in was deep enough to where my feet didn't touch the bottom. I didn't hold my nose, but I know how to keep water from getting up into my nose by blowing out. So if on the off chance I did get water in my nose, it was at the surface, and it certainly wasn't forcefully enough to be an issue. But I am still terrified. I've had a stress/sinus headache for the past 3 days which is probably from crying, but my ENT said there is a blockage and that's causing the headache. I'm so utterly terrified that I'm going to develop symptoms. I'm on day 6. It's 1-12 days for symptoms to develop, but I'm afraid that even after that point I am going to be freaked out. Would I know if I had it by now? Is it possible that I even got it at all? Any advice is appreciated"
908,2,"I bought a lot of mangeisum from Pure 180 tablets, NOW 180 tablets. I took 1 tablet (120mg) before bed and it kept me awake all night. The opposite of the sleep aid I wanted. Should I continue, I bought too much. Has anyone had the same problem and how did you handle it?"
909,2,"I keep trying to socialise in r/teenagers but my posts keep getting removed because of the way I speak probably, I've been told my whole life that I'm not good at socialising and I'm getting really tired and just want someone to relate to"
910,2,"*crosspost

I made a mistake and I don't know what to do, I keep waking up with the anxiety problem stuck to my brain. I keep waking up with constant anxiety. My muscles are tense. My head is spinning. I would greatly appreciate your advice, I'm really mentally/emotionally unstable and I honestly can't even think properly. I have so many emotions.

When I was 14, I was diagnosed with mental health issues. It was OCD (just checking and counting), depression and anxiety due to a stressor of having a life transition (middle school to high school) and my grandmother who passed away. When I was 19/20, my symptoms of OCD became worst (hoarding and compulsive shopping) due to a stressor of having family problems.

When I was 11 (3 years before I was diagnosed with mental health issues), I had a first love (or puppy love to speak). I'm 25, and I have never thought of him in years. Usually, he would just cross my mind for just a second once every few months or so. He even went to the same high school as me (when I was diagnosed with OCD, depression, anxiety) and whenever I would see him sometimes in the hallways, I didn't give him a second thought or anything. Recently, I saw news from his ethnic country and randomly started thinking about him. Usually, whenever I hear of his ethnic country, I don't think of him at all so this situation was odd.

I had a thought about him all of a sudden, so I decided to search him up on Facebook since we're both friends there. And when I saw his profile, it pretty much triggered my OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) and then I felt alot of grief, nostalgia, ruminating about the mistakes we did to each other... I even felt envy of his success because he changed so much while I feel the same or got worst. A big stupid reason I unfriended him and his brother was because I didn't want them to look at bad photos & memories of me from the past if they decided to search me up one day. And after I unfriended them, the guilt, the regret, and anxiety ate me up alot and does in the mornings.

I unfriended them after literally 13 long years of not even interacting with them in any type of way. Not a single peep.

I felt so much emotions. I felt anxiety, regret and guilt from unfriending him. I have never in my life grieved over someone who is alive... or even a version of myself.

When I saw his profile picture, he looked like a man... not the little boy I fell in love with more than a decade ago. He used to be shy and awkward when I was with him. He seemed to be doing well - it looked like he has a good job, a university degree, a sociable life. He's a completely different person now that looks like he got life together.

Myself? When I was with him at 11, the little girl that was me was so outgoing, sociable, had big dreams and hope of a happy life ahead of her. She wanted to be a nurse one day. She was told by people close to her she had a golden heart. She was healthy in every way - mentally, physically, emotionally and even spiritually. She had everything in life.

At 14, the world came crashing down on her due to a mental health issue that she didn't even know what it was...and didn't even ask for. She became diagnosed with OCD, depression, anxiety and years later, stress. Over the years, her symptoms became worst. She wasn't mentally healthy anymore. Over the years, she gained unhealthy weight, became diagnosed with diabetes and high cholesterol. She wasn't physically healthy anymore. She became so emotionally complexed and overthinks way too much into spirals. She wasn't emotionally healthy anymore. She stopped praying to God. She wasn't spiritually healthy anymore. She developed a bit of social anxiety, wasn't so sociable anymore, and became isolated from her friends. She didn't have big dreams but now a hopeless and fearful life ahead of her. The 11-year-old girl changed just like the 12-year-old boy she loved, except - she didn't get her life together like he did. She has no degree or a stable job, barely a social life too. Her life didn't get better, it got worst.

He reminded me of a time when I wanted a life like he did - a university education, a good job, a stable life. But I lost everything in life.

I never had a lover after him, for some reason. I never kissed a boy after him. I used to flirt with boys and had many crushes after him too, but for some reason, I never had a lover after him.

I'm sure I developed more OCD symptoms after thinking about him... but now, it's like mental OCD so it got worst. Past/guilt rumination, relationship OCD perhaps, false memory OCD, real event OCD, maybe even memory hoarding.

On Facebook, I still have everyone else from that time in middle school. I'm scared he'll search me up one day and get sad to realize I have everyone else from middle school except him, leaving him excluded.

I feel the need to add him as a friend again because I regret what I just did so much. If I don't add him as a friend, I feel regret, guilt and sadness and anxiety. If I do add him as a friend, I feel intense anxiety. But the thing is, he'll know I unfriended him because we were literally friends on Facebook for so long... 13 years of literally no contact at all. It's weird. What if he asks me the reason why I unfriended him? Telling him that I was in nostalgia, grief, ruminating about our mistakes, envy of his success, deleting him because of my vulnerability in my old past and old photos is WAY too much to tell someone I haven't said a word to in 13 years. To be honest, even if he doesn't ask me why I unfriended him yet still accepts my friend request, I feel the need to give him a reason to make sure I didn't unfriend him out of malice. My OCD compulsion & anxiety is telling me I need to over-explain everything clearly and to the point: the nostalgia, grief, ruminating on mistakes, envy of his success, deleting him stupid so he doesn't see my past and my past photos... but not only is it too much to come in as a random storm for someone I haven't spoken a single word to in 13 years, it's also so embarrassing too. I don't want to lie but I don't want to have anxiety either. I feel the need to fix this now because I'm scared years down the line if he ever asks about it or if I question it, I won't remember the exact clear reason why I unfriended him.

I'm scared if I add him, he'll message me and it can trigger my anxiety to talk to someone I haven't said a word to in more than a decade. I want to and honestly feel the need to leave a message saying I didn't unfriend him out of malice but that can trigger my anxiety too. I'm scared he'll question or think weirdly of how I unfriended him when he knows for sure he was always friends with me on Facebook. I'm scared we'll either both send a message to each other, but even if he doesn't, I still feel the need to tell him I didn't unfriend him out of malice and I swear talking to someone I haven't spoken to in years can trigger anxiety.

The anxiety is so bad... because it's been way too long I haven't talked to him in any way. It's been SO long, that he doesn't even know I have mental health issues.

His brother seems to not use Facebook at all so giving him a friend request can probably take years for him to accept and then I don't know if I'll feel anxious the whole time. I also want to give him a reason as well as to why I unfriended him too and it'll be odd to just talk to him like an emotional storm coming in after not saying a word to him as well after more than 13 years.

I regret unfriending him and his brother on Facebook... I shouldn't have done that. I honestly didn't know I still care about him in a way. That was the last piece of social media of just a small connection knowing he's alive and well, even if he doesn't post anything at all. Just a small bridge and I burned the last one.

I don't know what to do. I'm really lost. It's making me have so much anxiety... I'm panicking alot. I would greatly appreciate advice.

Thank you all, so much.

TL/DR;    
Unfriended a first love and his brother after having them on Facebook for 13 years. Never said a word to any of them for 13 years. Now, I regret it alot and feel anxiety from it. Feeling like I need to add him as a friend again but scared of intense anxiety. I'm scared he'll know I unfriended him because we were friends on Facebook for a long time. I'm scared he'll ask me why I unfriended only him and not others from our same former school. Even if he doesn't ask me why I unfriended him, I feel the need to tell him it wasn't out of malicious intent but that can trigger my anxiety too to start a conversation. I have anxiety and OCD compulsions, so I feel the need to over explain but I feel very embarrassed to say I felt grief, nostalgia, envy of his success, ruminating on our mistakes, not wanting him or his brother to look at my past photos or posts if they do decide to search me up one day. Not only embarrassing, but WAY too much to say to someone you haven't said a word to in 13 years. If I don't say all of this, I'm scared I'll get OCD guilt rumination for not clearly saying the reason. His brother seems to not use Facebook at all so giving him a friend request can probably take years for him to accept and then I don't know if I'll feel anxious the whole time. I also want to give him a reason as well as to why I unfriended him too and it'll be odd to just talk to him like an emotional storm coming in after not saying a word to him as well after more than 13 years. I feel the need to fix this now because I'm scared years down the line if he ever asks about it or if I question it, I won't remember the exact clear reason why I unfriended him. I'm also scared that if I don't fix this now, I'll forget about it years down the line leaving this problem unresolved. I never had a lover since then, but I would still like to keep this small connection on social media just to know they're okay and well. I never had a lover since then, but I would still like to keep this small connection on social media just to know they're okay and well. "
911,2,Does anyone else have panic attacks that start by noticing your heart racing?? I was just sitting here. Feeling fine. Checked my HR because it felt a little fast. It was racing. Then I panicked. Did some deep breathing and now its back down. Like either the fastest panic attack ever. only lasted 2 minutes. Im just not sure if its actually anxiety or my heart racing causijg anxiety......
912,2,"So I’ve had severe anxiety for over a year, my physical symptoms are dizziness, balance issues, feeling like I’m going to faint. I’ve have extensive tests and imaging done to rule out anything else. I have tried Prozac and Zoloft but hated them both. That was several months ago. The physical symptoms continue and are driving me crazy I feel like I can barely function. I decided to give Lexapro a try and I’ve only taken it 3 times, 5mg, I take it at night, and I already feel a thousand times worse. How so quickly? I wake up freaking out, my thoughts are racing, I feel disconnected, nauseous, head pains, restless and the most alarming thing is when I’m laying in bed either sleeping or just starting to fall asleep my legs start shaking pretty violently. Like a super violent hypnotic jerk. I want to give up already. I don’t see how this can make me better. 
I know meds aren’t for everyone and I have been against taking them as well but I haven’t gotten any better since this started. So I really want to try to get through at least a month of meds, the longest I made it was 2 weeks on Prozac. "

914,2,"Those that are anxious about their finances please skip this, I'd be anxious reading this myself.

Just renewed my car's road tax and insurance, it's around 1k.

Then I reached out to the agent that rented me the house to renew my tenancy, just to find out that I need to pay around 1k, just for the renewal fees. Even if I do move, I am not sure how much I'll have to spend just to move.

I still need to send the car for maintenance, which is estimated to be around 500 to 1k. 

I cook my own food, I don't buy what I don't need, I saved what I can, just for all these money to disappear just like that.

Sorry for this vent, my situation is probably not that bad compared to slot of people, but my mind had just been spiralling out of control by just thinking about money, my hands literally went cold and I just feels like crying.

It's just funny how I'm always told by media that ""money can't buy you happiness"" since young, and then here I am, stressing out and getting all anxious because I'm not earning enough for savings.

Thanks for reading this far, gonna go back to brainstorm how to earn extra cash.

All the best out there, my fellow anxiety fighters."
915,2,"elp. Literally help. I believe I have sleep onset anxiety. Pretty much my body panics when I try to sleep. I get like jump scared by nothing. Or I unconsciously hold my breath and wake up gasping because I'm not breathing. Nothing is helping. The only think that worked is Ativan and zopiclone but I can't get any more because of the kind of drugs it is. I don't know what to do. I can't afford therapy and have to wait a month for doctors appointments. Fluoxetine is giving me side effects so I think I'm going to have to stop taking it and try another med but that'll take weeks. I can't sleep. I have to keep my eyes open until I physically can't anymore and pass out from exhaustion.

Anybody else have this?"

When did you realize your meds had an effect on you and what did it feel like. 
I literally can’t fathom not being anxious, I’ve been anxious my whole life it feels. 
I know a lot of people say their anxiousness subsided but I’m having a hard time imagining what that actually feels like 

Sorry if this is all over the place "
917,2,"I’ve just been prescribed sertraline for anxiety and suicidal thoughts, i’ve never taken medication for mental health before and have heard a lot of bad things about sertraline so i was wondering what anyone’s experiences on this SSRI is/was like? thankyou!"
918,2,Just curious what they were looking for when they put me in a ct scan with a liquid that made me feel like I peed myself lol. They waited a while and said everything looked really good but I was so tired I didn't ask for an elaboration. I started noticing the trouble breathing and weird heart beats like a skipped beat thoughout the day a couple times a day after my dog passed away unexpectedly:(. I think my hearts ok they did a full panel blood test and an ekg.
919,2,"Lexapro to Wellbutrin – Looking for Insight from Others Who’ve Made the Switch

Hey everyone,
I’ve been following this thread for a while, but this is my first time posting here.

I’ve been on 7.5mg of Lexapro for almost 4 months, primarily to treat mild anxiety. It’s worked well for that — my anxiety is definitely more manageable, which I’m grateful for. However, there have been some downsides that I’m struggling with.

I’m a regular runner and work out about 5 days a week. Since starting Lexapro, I’ve gained around 4 pounds (not a huge deal, but noticeable), and my workouts just don’t feel the same. I get tired much faster, run shorter distances, and feel like I’m not getting the same performance or satisfaction out of them.

The biggest issue, though, is fatigue — especially in the mornings. I wake up feeling groggy and low-energy, which is new for me. I never dealt with this level of tiredness before Lexapro.

My doctor recently prescribed me 150mg of Wellbutrin, but I haven’t started it yet. I’m hoping it might help with the fatigue and boost my overall energy — especially during workouts.

Has anyone here made the switch from Lexapro to Wellbutrin and noticed a big difference in energy levels or workout performance?

Also, for those who’ve switched meds:
	•	Did you stop Lexapro completely before starting Wellbutrin?
	•	Or did you overlap them for a bit?
	•	What approach gave you the best results in terms of effectiveness and minimal side effects?

Any personal experiences, advice, or tips are super appreciated!"

921,2,Hi this is my first post on here and I’m just wondering if anyone else has experienced weird side effects for Atarax like mood swings or becoming really scatterbrained? Been taking it for a few days and I’m just wondering if this a me thing or if this has happened to anyone else.
922,2,"This has been one of the hardest struggles in my life 
Doctors nurses even a psychiatrist that I saw had no idea what kratom was 
It's a true nightmare because it's more addicted than anything in the world that I've ever dealt with 
And I've been using it for 10 years 

Needless to say this put me back into one of those severe anxiety phases where I'm battling just to get out of the house 

It's getting so bad that I'm barely able to function 
Like I was in the bank today and when it came my turn to get up to the teller I walked out because I was scared of having a panic attack 

I'm really worried about my mental health but I'm trying my best 
Has anyone else been through this with kratom?

I'm going to have a teladoc appointment on the phone tomorrow 
Has there anything specific that I should request? 
I was off ssris for 5 months until this day 
Should I ask for a specific SSRI? 

I really didn't want to go that route but if I have to then that's what I have to do I guess 
But is there anything else I should request like clonidine or maybe something that would help that it's not as serious as an SSRI ?"
923,2,"Just a vent you can reply if you want to. I've been dealing with chronic anxiety and panic disorder ever since I was 16. (5 years ago now) I had my first panic attack at a friend's house and that was the start of my torture. Googling symptoms, sleepness nights, thinking horrible thoughts every minute, 1000s of symptoms, when will this ever truly end? I've done therapy for 3 years and it barely helped, probably because I was honestly too stubborn to really try half the things I was recommended, doctor has put me on countless medications and I've been going through complete torture, I can't even leave my house anymore without freaking out. Anxiety has made me lose 60 pounds in total, I feel like a complete and total failure I'm constantly fighting with my mind everyday to try my very best to not have a panic attack and Everytime I have a panic attack I think it will be my last and I pray while my heart rate reaches 200 bpm and I sit there terrified alone with nobody, I get relief for a few months every now and then, but then it comes back and reminds me that it's not fully gone I've experienced just about everything u can expect from a panic attack. Auditory hallucinations, chest pain, dizziness,tunnel vision, bladder issues, intense fear,sweating, and then after that I spend 2 months traumatized in my bed because every panic attack to me is traumatic. I lost all my friends, I had to move back in with my mother, I lost my job, and the hospital doesn't even accept me showing up anymore because they just know I'm having anxiety, I tried excersize, I tried changing my diet, I tried therapy, I tried meditation and the only thing that helps slightly is medication, I hope this ends soon for me and all of us suffering from this horrible thing. "
924,2,"This is kind of a vent/kind of asking for advice.

Earlier today I was driving with my 3 kids in the backseat and as I was nearing my exit, the car in front of me slowed down quite a bit. Enough that I had to hit my brakes on the highway. There was a semi truck coming up close behind me. I knew I had enough room to pass before my exit so I moved to the left lane and accelerated. The slow car immediately sped up and matched my speed preventing me from passing. My exit was fast approaching so I tried to slow back down but the semi was there. I only made it over right as the exit was passing and had a fleeting thought of trying to swerve over last minute but knew I was going too fast and didn’t have room. So I missed my exit and had to use an outer road to double back. 

No big deal, right??

Except I *can’t* stop thinking about it. This happened 4 hours ago and I’ve been nervous and sick feeling since then. My stomach is in a knot and my head is pounding. I keep thinking about what would have happened if I would have swerved over going too fast. I’m trying to remind myself that nothing happened and we are all safe but I keep imagining it. "
925,2,"I’ve been thinking I might have anxiety, but every time I look it up, the symptoms just don’t match me. I don’t have panic attacks. My heart doesn’t race. My hands don’t shake. I don’t have insomnia. I’m not losing weight or skipping meals. in fact, I eat more when I’m stressed. Especially around exams, I feel like I’m constantly hungry. So then I start doubting myself, wondering if I’m just being dramatic or looking for something that isn’t there.

But deep down, I feel like something isn’t right.

I overthink constantly. Not just once in a while.I mean every single day. My mind will always find something to make me worry about. I go in loops about school, my relationship, my family. I replay conversations and situations over and over again in my head, imagining different outcomes. I question if I’ll pass this degree, if I’m good enough for my family, if my boyfriend will eventually leave me when I can’t get it together. And I know these thoughts aren’t rational, but they still won’t stop.

When I’m overwhelmed, I just shut down. I sleep more, I procrastinate everything, I binge-watch shows because thinking feels too heavy. I rewatch The Big Bang Theory from start to finish on repeat.(I've watched it so often that i know the entire script from memory) I can’t eat unless I’m watching something. And I always need noise in the background, like silence makes my brain too loud.

I function, technically. I go to school, I get things done eventually. But it always feels like I’m walking around with a weight on my chest that no one else can see. And because I’m not crying or breaking down all the time, I worry I’m just being dramatic or weak ,even though I feel exhausted and mentally drained 24/7.

I guess I just want to know…
Can anxiety show up like this? Quiet, internal, and constant?
Because I don’t feel “anxious” in the textbook sense, but I also don’t feel okay."
926,2,"so, im fairly young and i’ve never been diagnosed with anxiety (since i never had a therapist nor a psychologist), but ever since last year, mostly during winter or random nights, i get this constant urge to take deep breaths and yawn(i yawn about 8 times each night when this happens)

i used to have yawn “outbreaks” when i had a seminary to present, or after i finished an exam(usually accompanied by the urge to take deep breaths)

is it possible that i have anxiety and its just undiagnosed? or is it just my body adjusting to the cold temperature?"
927,2,"The past 2 weeks have been hell. Constant anxiety, I cant go to work, and when I do I leave early. Im trying to push through, im on new meds. But it feels impossible, like this will never pass. Im so tired."
928,2,"What’s up everyone — my name’s Austin. I’m 23, a lifelong football player, a college athlete. I’ve been on the field since I was 6. I was always strong — mentally, physically, emotionally. But everything changed the moment I lost my mom.

**The exact day I left the hospital after she passed, my body started reacting.** It was like my grief snapped something in me open. I had my first panic attack that night. I didn’t know what was happening — I thought I was dying. That was June 2024, and since then, nothing’s been the same.

# Trying to Be “Normal” Broke Me Even More

I kept trying to pretend I was okay. Went back to being a regular college kid. I even went on a spring break trip and binge drank for a week — trying to feel alive again.

That’s when my heart went into **AFib** for the first time. I ended up in the ER. Heart racing, dizziness, shortness of breath. I was terrified. Doctors said it was AFib and it could be stress-triggered. But I couldn’t believe stress and grief could destroy me like this.

Even after all that? I played a **full football season** through it. Hiding it. Chest aches, panic, PVCs, fear, shortness of breath — I didn’t tell anyone. I felt like I had to be the strong one. It nearly broke me.

# Here’s What I’ve Been Dealing With Since That Day:

* **Chest aches** (dull and sharp — especially left side/pec and under ribs)
* **Heart palpitations** (PVCs, skipped beats, flutters, pounding at rest)
* **Weird internal vibrations** (especially at night or after eating)
* **Stomach pressure, rib tension**, aches near sternum
* **Neck stiffness**, especially right side
* **Fear, panic, doom** hitting randomly
* **Rollercoaster feeling in my chest**
* **Scared to go too far from home**
* **Always hyper-aware of my heart rate**

# Tests I’ve Had (All Normal):

* **Echocardiograms** – March 2024 and March 2025 (normal structure and function)
* **Multiple EKGs** – occasional PVCs, sinus rhythm otherwise normal
* **Holter Monitor (3 days)** – no sustained arrhythmia detected
* **Stress Test** – cleared
* **Chest X-rays** – normal
* **Bloodwork** – all clear
* **Emergency room visits** – ruled out heart attack, PE, etc.

# What I’m On Now:

* **Zoloft** (SSRI for anxiety/depression)
* **Propranolol** (beta blocker for heart rate)
* **Hydroxyzine** (as-needed for panic)
* **Therapy** and processing grief slowly

# Why I’m Here:

Because I feel like I’m dying — not metaphorically, but **literally**. I wake up scared. I go to bed scared. Every ache, flutter, and skipped beat sends my mind spiraling. Some days I don’t feel like fighting anymore. I feel broken. Defeated. Like no one understands what I’m carrying inside.

But I’m not ready to give up.

I need other people who *get it*. People who’ve been through it — grief, AFib, anxiety, panic, unexplained symptoms — and are still fighting. I want to build a space where we hold each other up when it gets dark. Where we remind each other we’re not crazy, we’re not alone, and we’re not done yet.

If you’ve gone through:

* Panic attacks after grief or trauma
* AFib or other rhythm issues that scare the hell out of you
* Being told “it’s just anxiety” when you *know* it feels like more
* Getting clean test results but still feeling broken
* Losing someone and your whole body changing from that moment forward

Then I need to hear from you. Let’s talk. Let’s fight this thing together.

Athlete or not. Younger or older. All are welcome.

Let’s build something real.

929,2,"When I met him (33M), I truly felt he was the one. We traveled, made memories, lived together for 6 months, and imagined a future. He lies, has a DV case from his past, talks to his mom for hours daily, and now she wants to come live with him. He’s emotionally unavailable despite trying for me, and I hate his friends.

At first, it was all butterflies and fun. But as months passed, he opened up that he just wants to settle down and have kids—no parties on weekends, just rest mode—because he’s “seen it all.” Our life felt stagnant—we’d just eat, smoke, and do nothing. But I like to be active, go out, play a sport, make new friends, dance, workouts. 

I’m 23, and my parents would never accept this marriage because he’s a divorcee. I’m not ready for marriage either, and I felt stuck with no growth or momentum. His family is pressuring him, and he’s already talking to girls they found for him. I love him deeply, but I had to choose myself and walk away. I’m moving out in 4 days and I’m terrified. I have anxious attachment and childhood trauma, and the fear of being alone is overwhelming. How do people survive this?"
930,2,"A very dear friend of mine who's only 17 , has went through shit tons of physical and verbal abuse been suffering from depression and anxiety attacks . He told me that he felt he was falling into it a year ago but it all has been unfolding more and more since a month or so 

He suffered an anxiety attack 2 days ago when his father suddenly entered the room and slapped him for talking to his friends at night. He's been the purest soul I've ever seen and can say without any bias he isn't wrong 

He told me "" i like staying in dark , there's nobody who can harm me and the moment I turn on the lights it reminds me of past trauma ( p/v abuse etc ) and that he's not sleeping coz the moment he closes his eyes it reminds him of all the intense voice of his father shouting "" 

He does have other friends who help him a lot and loves talking to them on voice chats but he can't anymore coz his parents are alerted 

Any help/guide/advice would be much appreciated - please don't ignore coz he's only a minor and yes your tiniest efforts may lead to wonders 

Thanks a ton"
931,2,"Hey everyone I just wanted to give a review of a medication that has truly helped me. I have gone on and off of it depending on where I’m at. Im very hesitant to try medication and if anything , my worry is that I *won’t* have a good outcome from medication or have a ton of side effects. I was pretty surprised when I had a good outcome with this medication. I’m super stubborn when it comes to psych medication because I usually get every side effect in the book since I’m so anxious. 
I have terrible ocd and health anxiety — I also have had some fairly unrelenting panic attacks. I was prescribed hydroxyzine — I only take 10 mg but within an hour I feel like someone helped me screw my head on straight and I can at least rationalize things better. Like I feel 60% more normal. My heart rate goes down, I feel like I can get some sleep. 
I did have some restless legs  and dry mouth when I first started taking the medication but that has gone away. It’s not a long term use medication as it is an anti-cholinergic (can increase the risk of dementia down the line) but if you are struggling short term and need some relief, hydroxyzine is a cheap, overall safe and non-addictive alternative to benzos. 
A lot of people think it is just Benadryl. It’s not. It IS an antihistamine but it also has anxiolytic properties that work on serotonin, dopamine , and adrenergic receptors (albeit mildly). Benadryl doesn’t do that. 
So, YMMV but psych medication really sucks, and as someone where it takes a ton of courage to try medication, this med has really helped me get through a tough time. "
932,2,"This may trigger some of you with health anxiety, especially surrounding you know, that zoonotic disease that starts with R.
About a year and some change ago, so like October of 2023, I was struck in the face, on my chin, early in the morning by a flying creature that I cannot prove 100% was a bat, but I'm sure it was. There was no visible bite or scratch, and I don't think it did anything because it flew away so soon, but I did fill a twinge of pain (most likely from the impact of the bat hitting my face). I was a minor at the time and so when I asked my parents to take me to get a rabies shot, they said no and that I was being ridiculous. My mom asked her friend who was a nurse and said friend told me that there would be absolutely no question if I was bitten or scratched. 
But here I am, over a year later (I know I'm over the incubation period by a bit), scared that I have some freakish strain that's gonna last in my body for years before it kills me and that even if I DID get the shots, it would be to no avail. 
Can someone here assuage my fears?"
933,2,"I’ve suffered with anxiety for years and after panic attacks have became more frequent I’ve been set on a course of propranolol by my doctor.

I’ve heard horror stories of how it makes the psychological factors of anxiety worse and destroys your ability to sleep well and now I’m anxious about my anxiety medication. Does anyone have any tips to avoid these things or how to make the most effective use of my medication. I’ve tried everything but medication so this is kind of the last straw, if I can’t make it work I fear I’m doomed to live with anxiety forever."
934,2,"Hi, I was recently prescribed Trazadone. I have been on the 25mg dose for about 3 days. I do not suffer from insomnia, I was prescribed it because apparently the Lexapro I am taking for anxiety is causing me to have a lot of vivid dreams that interrupt me at night and I wake up with a headache. But these days with Trazadone everything has worsened, the vivid dreams have not improved, I have headaches often, mood swings, more anxiety... Is this normal and is it because my body is adapting to the medication or does it mean that I should take it off? Thank you in advance.

Hi all,

I am a really health anxious person, however I have located a lymph node in my neck that is bigger than a pea.

It is almost the same size as the diameter of my index finger. I am not poorly or seem to be coming down with anything and have noticed this lymph node since about Feb this year (could have been longer).

I have no symptoms of anything except general fatigue (I am really anaemic too). Today I have been feeling my neck non stop and I have noticed a smaller lump down the bottom of the back of my neck and I can’t tell whether this is a pimple or not.

I am really nervous and worried and don’t know whether I should be concerned by the palpable lymph node. It is only on my right hand side at the back of my neck close to the base of my skull.

Please share some insights for me 😊"

Im really worried cuz i cant sleep at all - im up till 5 am and have to wake up at 7 for school, ots always been like that but its getting really bad. I guess it might be hormones but i keep on having panic attacks and i dont know how to stop them or calm down - it feels like i cant stop my brain from talking and i keep on having to take these really long breathes and sighs cuz it feels like i can't get enough oxygen in and in the summer especially i do get more worried which leads to hallucinations sometimes - like full blown seeing giant spiders come down from the celing and 'im secretly being watched by the gov' type thing.

939,2,"Hey guys, I just need to vent a bit, this place seems nice. Pardon my English, it's not my first language. 

I got laid off back in February from a job I absolutely loved. My colleagues were awesome and supportive, and even though it was a retail job, people that came in were nice and the pay was pretty good. It was a rough two months after, but I had a nice job opportunity in another city. My SO and I thought about it and bit the bullet. We moved, we both had some time off, and I started this new job on the first of the last month. That's where everything started to crumble. I HATED IT. It sucked my soul out. 

I quit today. I started having panic attacks daily. Before my shift, or during it. I just can't deal with it anymore. I feel like a failure, like not enough of a man for my SO, like a bad fucking son for my parents. They are supportive as hell, but I'm feeling so.... Not enough. Weak. Like a pussy for letting it control my life. 

I just thought like after 3 years on meds and therapy, that I would be past this shit. And then it fucking hits again and I'm back to square one.

949,2,"Hi all. I’m a 31m and have been dealing with anxiety since 2014. They have always been bad, the normal feeling like I’m bout to die, and I’m not really here. Shaking, cold. Probably for a year or so, I have been dealing with palpitations. They started every so often which caused the cycle of anxiety attacks. More recently they have been EVERY SINGLE DAY, ALL DAY, literally. Went to my cardiologist who said heart was healthy and did not see any issues. Had all the tests and sonograms. Currently on sertraline as of now which helps with anxiety. Buuuut not with palpitations. I feel lost. Helpless. I started taking magnesium supplements because I heard they helped but it’s only been a couple of days. Any suggestions on what I can do to end this vicious cycle without any more meds!?"
950,2,"Hi, I am new here so I hope this post is alright. Also, English isn't my first language so sorry for any errors.

Can you recommend me any tips how to deal with my somatic symptoms?

Right now it's a neverending circle for me. I've a nasty symptom, I KNOW that it's because of anxiety but after a month or few I go to doctor to check it anyway. If I am lucky, doctor does some tests and obviously all the results are perfectly alright (if I'm unlucky they day that it's anxiety and I should start meditating or ""stress less"" - thank you very much for this helpful advice). After my results turn out good, symptom magically vanishes for a few months... and is replaced by another one. Repeat from step 1.

I was diagnosed because of heart pain, breathing problems, dry mouth and lack of saliva, constant tiredness, problems with sight... everything's alright with me except of the fact that I constantly feel ill.

The worst thing is that even though I know that all these problems are for 99,9% caused by anxiety, I still start spiralling and I am sure that it is some serious illness.

I tried journaling or tracking my symptoms to see if there's any pattern but it only made things worse for me. 
I also tried to use over counter stress relieving drugs and teas (herbs-based ones, with i.e. melissa or valerian) but they don't really work for me.

Right now I am not under psychological or psychiatric care. I don't earn enough to go privately and while we have public healthcare in my country, queues to mental health specialists are VERY long and their attitudes toward patients are abysmal (at least in the area where I live).

So, how do you deal with physiological symptoms? Do you have any useful tips how to tone them down or at least stop being so stressed about them?"
951,2,"I've heard a lot from people that got rid of panic attacks that said ""you have to accept it"". How is that possible?

However, every once in a while, I get these one, maybe two off readings and they really scare the crap out of me cause I don’t know if they’re real and I don’t know if they’re fake so all I can go on is what the reading was before that and the reading after that, my high reading is gone.

For example, today I was leaving work and I wasn’t feeling the best but I walked out to my fiancé’s car got in and it said my heart rate was 175 then went down to 100. So i have no idea if this was real or not.. "
