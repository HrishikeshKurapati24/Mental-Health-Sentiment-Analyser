1,1,"To all the people who tried helping my little sis, the one who owns this account. Thank you for trying. Last night she ended up jumping off a bridge 5 miles from our house. She was 13. Thank you guys for trying to help. Best regards - Catherine's Brother"
2,1,"And I admit to it. I want to die, knowing my parents will regret ignoring me. I want to die, knowing my friends will regret not helping me. Just for that. I just want to know that they will care, even if I won't experience it. Kinda hope I will have some relevance then. Can someone relate?"
3,1,"I'm 18 and I've been planning my suicide for a couple of years, I don't have any motovations, nobody loves me besides my mother and I have barely any friends that I've not seen in a while. I'm a writter so I was specting to finish all my books and end my life calmly by cutting my veins or encouraging other person to kill me, just to make sure.

I'm autistic, I have attention defficit and I am a transgender girl (this isn't a joke). It is barely impossible to have a girlfriend for me since I'm autistic, due to my attention deficit I get so impatient with tons of things and by being transgender my self-esteem is super low, I hate my body, how people see me, etc. Besides all of that shit, life is so boring... Studying, working, diying, everyone does that, and if I won't be able ti have a wife, children or anything like that I'll be very lonely. 

I was also thinking about trying to kill myself by hunger but surely my mother wouldn't let me, I cannot shoot myself because I live in Spain and we don't have guns, I won't fall from a high place because that could cause me a permanent dissability if going wrong and I'm not sure about abusing consumtion of medical pills.

Anyhow, I don't know what to do with my life, my mother doesn't support my sex swap surgery and I get so discriminated everywhere because of my autistic condition. Is it reasonable to think about killing myself after writting all my books?"
4,1,im f15 and i think im done with life. my mom passed away barely 10 months ago from organ failure at 35. my brother whos 18 shot himself in the head with a shot gun 2 nights ago and didnt leave any notes or text anyone. nobody knows the answer to why he did it. i texted him the day of and told him i loved him bc i had a gut feeling something was going to happen. i feel guilty. i shouldve texted him more often because he lived far away. its speculated that its because of how he was dealing with the pain of the passing of my mom. i have to deal with the grief of both of them now. i have 4 younger siblings who live with my stepdad 8 hrs away and thats the only thing that HAS been keeping me here. but its to the point where its too big of losses for me to deal with anymore. i dont know when im going to but his services are saturday and then im planning it after i see my family together a last time
5,1,"I truly believe that some people will never be happy. I don't know why people are against suicide when life is so unbearable. I don't fit anywhere, I look like a failed experiment, I spend my days alone and doing nothing but sleeping or daydreaming. I've never enjoyed life for as long as I remember. My teenage years were terrible and my early adulthood is even worse. I develop more and more mental illnesses and lose all my intellectual abilities. I'm a burden and I truly wish assisted suicide was an option. I feel like I'm trapped in a burning house where I only have two option: burn slowly or jump out of the window. "
6,1,"My sibling attempted to take their own life after struggling with anxiety. I am very close with them but didn’t know that they had contemplated suicide let alone would act on it, so it’s all a huge shock but I just want to support them and help them through this as best I can. Appreciate any tips or advice on what would be helpful ❤️"
7,1,"I attempted at 14, people said it would get better and that i was too young. I just turned 19 and i stil want to die. I tried. I really did. I even succeeded in alot of things, tried to keep my hope. But its just not enough. I lost my will and motivation to live long ago. the thought of suicide never got out of my mind. I wanted to die every single day the past 5 years. I was dead and already rotting inside. It was my flesh that kept moving around. My life only got worse. I have been depressed for the past 6 years. And im at my limit. I ""attempted"" yesterday again. But i didnt want to go that way. I wanted a more peaceful escape so i stopped. But in 3 days im out of this shit hole. Good luck to rest of yall."
8,1,"Please, I need help"
9,1,"When you’re a kid everyone tells you that you can be anything you want to be. That was a lie. My dream is to do musical theatre. All I want is to be on stage on Broadway. I’m just not talented enough. I try so hard to get better at singing but to no avail. After recording an audition today, I heard the recording and how bad I really am sunk in. I will never achieve my dreams. So I’d rather die"
10,1,"Life is falling apart lately and I’m just over it. I don’t want to exist. I just want it all the end. Honestly, the only reason I’m still here right now is because of my kid. But even still, I find myself thinking she’d be okay or better off without me. If I died then all my problems will be solved honestly. "
11,1,"I’m 14 years old and I know a lot of people on here will say stuff like “you have you’re whole life ahead of you, things will get better”. Things won’t get better. I’ve been suicidal since I was 8 and self harmed since I was 10. I only feel happy when I’m on substances which I know is probably bad. Everything in my life is shit and things keep getting worse and worse. My parents are alcoholics and hate each other, I don’t feel safe at home and I just want to die. I need to kill myself as I can’t keep living like this. I don’t want to be me or have my life I wish I was someone else. Maybe it’s time for me to actually kill myself instead of just thinking about it. (Also my parents are lowkey abusive but it’s okay)"
12,1,"I feel like I keep coming back here hoping something changes and it doesn't. I explain with words, tears, music, etc, and I'm just met with either silence or surface level positivity. ""But have you tried this?"" I've tried a million things a million times. I'm not depressed or suicidal for the common reasons most people can relate to. I reach out, and it just makes me more angry. I take a break and feel more exhausted. Everyone tells me, ""You're so well spoken! Your writing is so good!"" But they don't actually absorb anything meaningful, so I keep getting copy and pasted, cookie cutter responses like ""try a new hobbies or reach out to a professional"". GEEZ, WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT YEARS AGO????????? I've given so many clear warning signs about my mental state and no one takes me seriously. I feel more helpless when I use hotlines or apps. I look at suicide-prevention propaganda and it boils my blood because I don't have the permission from society to die. No one wants you to die, but no one wants to help you live either. I constantly feel like I'm trapped in a cage. Life wants me alive enough to suffer, but won't let me suffer enough to die. Then it's, ""You don't have to explain yourself to anyone"", but then how can I get help? Nothing works and nothing is meant to anyway, not for everyone."
13,1,"
I just can't anymore. It doesn't matter how hard I try or how hard I want to do everything right. It's always wrong and it always fails. I just want to give up and surrender. Nothing is worth anything. My enjoyement for things I love just fade away everyday and I'm everyday closer to just give up. I can't. I really can't anymore."
14,1,"So, I don't want to die but I'm feeling like there's no other option.  In a domestic violence/narcissist abuse situation.  Everyone believes I'm batshit crazy (and maybe I am) but I just can't wake up with this pain anymore.  I'm not allowed to smile, be happy or do anything other than be miserable.  Can anyone understand and give me a reason to keep going until I find more suitable accommodation. Thank you."
15,1,"People tell us they’re listening but they’re actually not yall keep talking the same bullshit “ oh that’s terrible you should tell someone and ask for help it’s abuse you need help! “ bro no one here for people like us no one really take anything serious unless it’s their own problem
No one care about your mantel health problems or the way you being treated at home or school or whatever problem you have 
Everyone so busy with their own problems they dgaf about us 
90% of people who’s talking about suicide here won’t do it and they will just stay alive and miserable without recovery "
16,1,"step 1. realize country have increased deaths due to people driving especially busses and lorries 

step 2. book a trip with a low rated bus for a midnight drive, reviews often complain about driver going to fast and one time almost tipped the bus over 

step 3. ????

step 4. hope that my suicide plan looks like a negligence from another idk"
17,1,"I’m 17 years old.  I developed an eating disorder in 2022, and everything has been a blur since then. This eating disorder has cost me my social life, family relationships, my passions, and overall, my life.
I have little to no friends, so it my presence isn’t really needed anyway. I don’t blame anyone for my shitty social life . I did this to myself. Because of my eating disorder, I’m so scared of eating that I’ve declined every invite to hang out.
I tried reaching out to my family about my eating disorder, but they just brushed it off.
I’m really tired of living, especially in a country where grades are the top priority, life doesn’t feel enjoyable.
My birthday is next week. I’m having a huge birthday cake that I reserved a month ago! It’s going to be nice to have my final meal with the people I love (my family).
I see my birthday as a living funeral. I’m going to put on my party dress and my best makeup so my parents can use that picture for my funeral photo.
When I die, my mind can finally be at peace."
18,1,Got into yet another argument with mom. I told her that I was going on a trip with dad and she got upset as usual. Now im here sobbing to myself and feeling like a total burden and disgrace to my family. The world would be better off if i just killed myself. I know my mom would be happy.
19,1,"I wish I was born in an earlier generation, like the 50s or 60s. I know things weren't all sunshine and roses then, given the chaos that was post WWII, but people in that generation really had it good and they didn't even realize it. They were richer, happier, and they didn't have to worry about shit like AI and climate changing ruining the rest of their lives. 

When I look at my future, all I see is wars, famine, climate migrants, increasingly hotter temperatures, the extinction of so many animals. I constantly ask myself why I had to be born when I was. If there is a God above, why does he make us suffer? "
20,1,i don’t want to live like this anymore. i’m constantly looking for a way out. i want to die. i don’t want to look at another thing on this earth. i don’t want to live with myself anymore. i’m just too scared to actually cut deep enough 
21,1,"I've played with the idea with suicide for as long as I could remember and everytime the idea comes around it's reinforce even stronger. At this point it isn't matter of if, it's the matter of when. It just really sucks because I've have alot of people in my life that care about me that have no idea that this side of me even exists, they know me as this happy chill down to earth kind of guy. It's just really gonna catch alot of people by surprise and I don't want them to think there love wasn't felt. I don't want anyone to think there was something that they could of said that would have changed my mind because there is nothing that can heal my soul. For awhile this feeling of guilt is the only thing that really kept me pushing but everything has it's breaking point and I'm just pass that. I've started trying to make tapes explain what goes on in my head an express how much I love all the people in my life it's just so hard. I don't think it's fair of me to leave them with nothing it's just feels impossible to get alot of this stuff out in words. I feel like I'm being selfish but how many times can I tell myself to keep moving forward while I end up in the same place. Some times I don't even have a good reason to be feeling like this, just something in my head that doesn't click like with most people and I just want to leave while there is still good in my heart. I don't want to get colder"
22,1,"I feel like we're heavily censored on this subreddit so can't have a full fledged conversation about suicide, but i know for me, things really are hopeless. 

It's not delusional thinking for me to say that, they really are. 

And i can either go insane under my current circumstances, or end it. 

I don't have a good 3rd option, and no one wants to acknowledge that. I'm given cheap advice and flse hope. At my age, that's not enough."
23,1,"My whole life I have no reason to exist and I think today was the day I decided that I wanted to die. Me existing would change nothing, my existence has only brought pain and suffering. My life is nothing but suffering and I wish God would take me away from this sick and painful life. I want to sleep forever and I want to kill myself. I just want the pain to be over forever. I’m nothing but numb now lol so it doesn’t really matter now. My own family is attracted to me and all the women in my life are jealous of me and nobody truly likes me. I am nothing but a genuine mistake. I have nothing left to give to the world. I don’t know how I can go on. I am trapped in a prison inside my mind and house. I’m in so much pain if I wasn’t numb I’d probably down a million pain killers. Please help me Reddit I’m beyond broken. "
24,1,"I loved my old life and now… 

   4 years ago then I got in a bad car wreck, and messed my right hip and lower back up. Then got put on oxy10/365 acetaminophen and from there on it was fentanyl 30’s

  Lost my 6+ years ago relationship with a beautiful girl who I miss everyday but now she’s dating my “old ex best friend ray”

   After the wreck something just clicked in my head that I wanna kill myself like If I die it’s going to be by my own hands and with the same fucking gun my cousin did it with "
25,1,"Every day sucks.

I saw a group of kids speaking russian walking by. Their little group was so adorable and supportive of everyone in it.

I will never have that. I didn't have a chance to.

My chest is constantly heavy, so is everything else.

I actually did tie the knot today, but i procrastinated on it and im really regretting it, i don't have the privacy to do it.

Please liberate me from this hell called Life.

"
26,1,We all die in the end. Why wait any longer? 
27,1,No one cares about me anyway. I try to reach out and get ignored. So im completely over it. Suicide is the best option. Bye yall 
28,1,"My family treats me horribly and today I have had 4 mental breakdowns alone at home screaming and sobbing while self harming. Nobody will get me help for my problems so it’s all just getting bad so fucking quickly. My mom doesn’t care about me when I’m sad or crying and tells me to shut the fuck up. I just sobbed in the shower for the first time in my life and I relapsed again. I already have a plan, notes, personal items set. I want to od, I have the will to do it and I don’t see myself going even longer in this hell of a life. I wanted to do it tonight but I’m too tired. Too tired to end my own life. I have nowhere else to vent or get help so this is my last resort. I’m done trying to better my life by living in paradise just sugar coating all of my trauma and pain. I hate my family for being abusive, and I have no friends. This is it for me."
29,1,"The title says all, life is impossible "
30,1,"I have been suicidal for about as long as I can remember; I feel like I’ve tried as hard as I possibly could and none of the treatment I’ve gotten has worked for me. Things keep getting worse in my life, and I’m completely trapped in an abusive situation that I’ve tried so many times to get out of, but it’s never worked, and at this point, I don’t think it ever will. I have many people I love dearly in my life, and try to “keep pushing through” for them, but it’s getting too difficult to have my situation coexist with those relationships, so I would rather die now than ruin the things that matter most to me as I spiral further. I’ve attempted suicide many times throughout my life, to the point where it has often deterred me because I can’t seem to die— and I am already disabled, so with every attempt, my existence becomes more and more painful and difficult. I have many hopes, dreams, loves, desires, etc., but I just don’t think there’s any way for me to get better because all the barriers in front of me exist in a cycle that I can’t escape. I feel like I’m constantly just desperately reaching for something to cling onto to get me to the next day for other people’s sake to the point where I can barely recognize myself. Before, my excuse was that I was holding off until I had the supplies to do it in a virtually painless way so I would get a bit of peace before the end, but I don’t even know if I can wait that long. I just want someone to tell me there’s a way for me to get better and to be guided to that path, but I think the sad reality is that there isn’t one for me, and as completely heartbreaking as it is to have to abandon everything I love and want, it’s the only choice I’d be “able to live with,” so to speak."
31,1,"I know I’m not alone when it comes to just not wanting to be here—like, I don’t *want* to end my life but I also don’t *want* to be here at all—all I want to do is *disappear* without harm. 
Does anyone else feel like that? 

I’ve definitely dealt with self-harm recently, but when it comes to dying—I just can’t do it although I want it to be done. It’s gloomy.

It’s like I’m stuck in a limbo—*numb*. After my previous relationship, I’ve been stuck between a back and forth of my own mind and dark thoughts—it all boils down to just wanting to leave—just wanting to give up on myself and left myself suffocate. I just don’t wanna be here—it’s not fun anymore, it’s not enjoyable. "
32,1,Mf be like go call 911 call lspd nypd JUST STFU  i just want to be listened thats all. when will ai be more humanish i wonder 
33,1,"i’m only 17 and i know that my life isn’t going to get better. i’ve struggled with sh and suicide since i was 12 and it hasn’t gotten better since, so i decided that after my upcoming senior year i want to end my life. i want to spend my last year alive in the best way i possibly can and maybe after it ill change my mind and give life another chance but as of right now im choosing to end it. oh and i have had bpd since i was 10 so thats js another reason i cant go along with this anymore, i dont want to live like that anymore its so exhausting. "
34,1,same person keeps posting my stuff on porn websites and now 4chan it went viral and everyone was calling me fat i wana die i havent eaten since and ive been sleeping all day i feel disgusting and ashamed im getting text messages from men harassing me i want it all to end they know everything about me and still somehow i dont know whos doing this to me im so tired 
35,1,"I am feeling so full of despair, ans I can't end my life right now. I have the strongest urge to hurt myself but I cant leave marks because I rely on the income of sex work. "
36,1,"Too bad, I am really fucking ugly and no one would dare approach me, let alone touch my disgusting skin. I am a revolting creature. Don't look at me. Don't look at my body. Don't look at my ugly, swollen scars on my thighs and arms. I feel uncomfortable in my own skin. Fuck."

😭😭💔💔💔"
38,1,it’s hard to want to live when you can’t talk to anybody. idk why I never have anything good to say. idk why I can never make conversation other than basic ass shit. I wish I was normal I wish my brain worked right. I see no point to this life if I can never connect with anyone. it seems like everybody else always has things to say or talk about and I’m just the mute girl who says nothing. I’m so sick of it. I started a new job recently and it’s clear I’m the weird girl who can’t socialize. I work tomorrow at 11 but i’d rather just die. and I mean it.
39,1,"No one ever visits our home, and I’m pretty much guaranteed to die alone. I know it won’t matter anymore (cuz I’ll be gone), but the thought of my body being left to decompose for potentially months or years before I’m found (if I ever even would be), does scare me a bit.

Just asking if I should notify anyone before I do it, or would that just cause even more issues and trauma?"
40,1,"Im tired of trying. I’m planing on quitting my job. I want to sleep all day. I don’t want to do anything. I graduated high school and I have nothing left going for me, no passion, no dreams, nothing. Every day I’m alive is a day wasted by doing nothing meaningful. Nothing meaningful in my life, anybody else’s, or the world. Don’t give me the BS “it gets better.” I genuinely don’t know if I should even keep bothering or not "
41,1,"they always leave me, im too much, its my fault, ive met my best friend ever and i mean it, but i know how it ends, im gonna have a panic attack, hurt myself, be too much, hes going to leave me, im going to be alone like always im just waiting for him to get rid of me before i end my sad life"
42,1,"I don't even think anyone will comment on this. I doubt it. But, I'm so so scared of myself. I've been cutting a lot. And speaking worse and worse. I'm just some messed up teen (15m). I don't trust myself, my brain is just telling me all the ways I could do it. I don't feel safe. And before you say it, no, I don't have anyone i feel safe going to. Idk what to do"
43,1,"I don't know why I do it but I always do. I was supposed to take an exam today that would decide if I have to retake a subject amother whole year or not. Guess who hasn't studied for it and it's not gonna even go to do it.

I could've and I didn't and I knew this time would come and I didn't care. And I kinda hate myself for it"
44,1,"I just moved back to my home country after being in another country for a year. I missed out an important year where everyone in my grade got close to each other. They all talk about it and say how they miss it, I can tell that there is this obvious sense of belonging and knowing with each other. On top of this I was forced to move the country I went too. While I was there, yes i had fun times, I also was told that I was so lucky that I had good family members who were willing to care for me. Their side said that I should remember to be happy because they helped me. From what. I was forced to stay and leave my mom who is mentally unstable. They said that it's better because she abused me but I got worse abuse when I did wrong things which is normal in my family. I dont care about the abuse but when I came back my mom was more crazy and out of it. In the middle of the year, (which is now) I had to move from my moms house to my grandparents. I dont really mind though because they are close to my moms and I love them. I hate it though, that my mom is really bad like she will compare me and talk about my appearance because now I am not ugly but I have skin issues. People made fun of it before and it was really bad and I didn't want to leave the house and no one listened to me. I hate my mom but I love her too when I see her struggle because shes ill. I see my grandparents suffering meant to be in another country retired. They spend so much money and work so hard. They want me to have good grades and a good future since I am decently smart. I feel like such a burden. Not only this but my family fights like a lot and not openly but I know and it just makes me feeel guilty. My brother is hard to get along with because I have just too much emotions and I don't want to put them on him. It strains our relationship since I don;t know how to connect with him. I also have problems with my friends since although I give a loud personality I keep more to myself. This is also because of my skin issues and the fact someone once said rabies to me and now I know I am very different from back then but its still hard. My friends sometimes make me the butt of the group I dont mind it but it just makes me mad when I cant be quiet for a little and they think that I hate them. I also have no one to talk to. I know this is me victimising myself but the friends I have dont understand. I love them but they arent deep deep talkers. My father cares but i feel like a burden. I am kind of left out when my main friend in the friend group isnt there at school. (In our friend group we kinda all have a main friend). I dont want to do this anymore and I know its stupid wanting to die but I just want to leave. I am supposed to go to my ethincity country if I get dux. (Highest grade of my grade). SO i have been trying and I might be able but I just dont know what to do. I am so tired of everyone thinking I am just perfect and have nothing wrong in my life. 

I might talk to my schools counsler but I dont want the government to be involved and I already have to meet a lawyer tomorrow about who will take care of me and my brother and my mother. I hate talking and I hate letting people know I AM having issues because I dont like being vulrenable. I also hate who I have become and all the bottled up thoughts I keep. "
45,1,"i know itd ruin my parents if i died. thats the only reason, i know they wouldnt get over it. i love them but otherwise i think im done, i just dont want to continue, theres no point really is there"
46,1,"Im so over life im 34 have a dead end job, no wife or kids or anything like that. I have people who deeply care for me and wish for me to be around but I suffer day in and out. I've been stunted by several shortcomings and sicknesses that has led me to be unable to be a real man in life. I've had a horrible addiction for years now and I can't stop. I only see 1 way out. I would've of done this yesterday but didn't have a sure way to do it. I am going to have a surefire way soon. Im scared im going to bitch out like always. I don't need any help or trying to talk me out of this I just needed to post this to make it real for myself"
47,1,"A have a severe depression I am 6 months in. Countless thoughts of killing myself. I lost my job, my partner, my friends. I lost my ability to being social (at least the little i had). Everything hurts. The only thing I feel is pain, endless penetrating pain in my head, in my mind in my soul. It doesn’t stop. I want to end it, I am done fighting for my life. I am so exhausted of living. I just can’t take it anymore. "
48,1,"My ex partner has BPD. At first it was good. But he turned sour and I was miserable. But he said that I was his soulmate. That if I left him, I’d ruin him and he’d kill himself. I was prepared to spend my life and marry a man I didn’t love. Some days I found myself actually wishing he would end himself so I could be free. That’s such a fucked up thing to Think that’s I’m disgusted about. 

Well…I left. 6 months ago. And I carry the guilt with me. It feels like I’m doing something wrong. I got a new boyfriend. Who I love. But, again. The guilt eats me alive. I hurt him. I lied and said I loved him and that I’d stay forever. But I can’t. I just can’t. I feel as if the only way I can escape this crippling guilt is if I kill myself. "
49,1,"I'm 19 and I’ve been feeling really stuck and honestly kind of ashamed. I grew up with supportive parents, they’ve always taken care of things for me, never pressured me to work too much or be super independent. I’m grateful, but it also made me feel kind of soft. Like I never had to really try, so I never learned how.

My best friend is also 19 and basically the opposite. She’s confident, ambitious, attractive, and she’s transferring to *the* university in our city with scholarships while working two jobs. She didn’t get the kind of help I did growing up, and I admire her so much, but I can’t help comparing myself and feeling way behind.

I go to a commuter school, I’ve never had a relationship or even my first kiss, and it just feels like I missed out on everything. My teen years were uneventful and honestly kind of empty. My parents won’t even let me drive even though I have my license, they won’t let me take the wheel in any sense.

Sometimes it feels like I’m not even living, just floating and stagnant. And if this is how things are now, I’m scared it’ll never change. I want to feel like I’m alive, but I don’t know where to begin. Has anyone else felt this way and actually gotten out of it?

50,1,Just having a tough day and don't want to be here. Test 
51,1,"Hi,

I’m a Hispanic woman (25) who’s been living in the US for quite some time, and to be honest and I can’t take it anymore.

When I was 21, I tried to jump off the 15th floor of a building, but my father grabbed me from behind before I could do it. Since then, I’ve been trying to move forward no matter what, but honestly, every day feels like a battle with myself and my inner demons. And everytime I always feel like that even in the brightest moments.

I don’t have friends here. I’ve tried Tinder and other dating apps to find friends or maybe a partner, but every person I thought had potential ended up ghosting me or losing interest after a few weeks. All I’ve ever wanted is a friend to share my interests with.

I was diagnosed with autism at 23, after being misdiagnosed with bipolar II the year before. I also struggle with chronic anxiety and severe depression due to PTSD from events a few years ago, combined with the frustrating loneliness I’m experiencing here. Seeing my friends leave my country one by one until it was finally my turn to leave… it broke something in me. I just don’t want to exist anymore. Sometimes I cry because I feel weak and too sensitive with everything that’s been going on in life.

My parents know how I’ve been feeling lately, and they encouraged me to quit my job to focus on myself. But nothing has changed. I still feel alone. I still feel pathetic. Tomorrow morning, I finally have an appointment with my psychiatrist, and I’m planning to tell her everything to ask to be tested for OCD too, and maybe to request being hospitalized because I don’t feel fit to contribute to society anymore. I don’t want to become a burden to my elderly parents later on."
52,1,"Okay so I’m 17m and I attempted a couple of weeks ago. I tried to overdose on Benadryl and I took like a whole handful (didn’t count the dosage) and I ended up overdosing and I went to the regular hospital then to the mental hospital. But ever since I’ve gotten out my whole family has being like either ignoring/avoiding me or just scowling at me like I’m the worst person ever. I have a theory on why they might be doing it, I think it’s because my uncle committed in 2012, so I have so much u guilt and shame for what I did. Like how am I not a pos for purposely trying to die, knowing that would make them feel bad. The guilt is so bad especially for my dad and my grandparents who were the brother and parents of my uncle. I tried putting them through that again. And the worst part is that I’m really considering trying again soon. Everything is going wrong, my mom got deported, my whole family hates me, I don’t pass as make very well, I just relapsed on self harm like an hour ago. Shit man life really is a bitch "
53,1,"I have the pills/alcohol I need to end it all. After previous failed attempts I’ve learned what’s needed. My wife is 28 weeks pregnant carrying our first child. I am struggling with life, minute by minute, I contemplate just ending it all. I’ve told my care team that consists of 4 people and it’s almost like they are trying to see if I bluff. Granted, 2 of my main care team members who I work with on a weekly basis both happen to be on vacation this week, and before they left they begged me to let them call the sheriff on me which I obviously said absolutely not to. 

I know deep down inside I’m safest not at home because of the temptations, but if I’m going to be here on earth and alive, I want to be home. 

Our baby shower is on the 28th of June, and I don’t want to ruin it by trying to take my life… because I’m a people pleaser, but I’m also really fucking struggling. 

I just want to end it all. "
54,1,"I've been trying so hard for a long time. Everything is wrong and bad. I feel so alone and worthless and unlovable. I ruin everything. I feel like a monster. I tried to tell my friend, but it always ends up becoming an argument that pushes him further away when all i need is understanding and support. I told him earlier that I almost killed myself yesterday. That I got everything ready and started to do it, but I changed my mind because I want things to get better. That I just need my friend. And he ignored me. I feel like my last lifeline has been cut. Like it doesn't matter. Like he's just... done. I don't know how you can care about someone and ignore them in their worst moment. When I'm begging for nothing more than comfort. That's all. Not for my problems to be solved or anything like that. I just needed my friend. And he turned his back on me. Just like everyone else. I have no hope left. Its gone. I feel so broken. I'll be going through with my original plan now. There's no longer any reason not to. 
Goodbye. "
55,1,"Hi. I didn’t get to finish college because life simply didn’t let me. Money has always been a problem but lately, it feels like even breathing is. I was forced to start working early to support my sick father, thinking maybe I could help but life had other plans. I got fired not because of anything I did wrong, but because everything just keeps falling apart around me. I gave him every last cent from my final pay. Now I have nothing. He calls me useless i understand that he’s sick and suffering too, but his words still hurt. He doesn’t know how hard I’ve been trying. I’ve been going out every day, searching for work with an empty stomach. All of my money is gone just from trying to survive and find a job and still nothing. I feel like I’m running out of time like I’m running out of hope. I’ve even had thoughts I’m ashamed of like maybe I should sell myself just to have food just to be able to hand something to my father. Not because anyone told me to but because I’m that desperate but I can’t do it if rather die than give up what’s left of my dignity. I haven’t eaten properly in days. I feel so weak, like my body’s shutting down. I’m only 20 but it feels like ive already lived a lifetime of suffering. I have one friend left, but she has her own problems. I don’t want to be her burden. I don’t want to be anyone’s burden anymore.
I’ve thought about ending it. Hanging myself. Maybe then the noise will stop the guilt thee hunger the fear of waking up to another hopeless day.
"
56,1,"First of all, yes, a lot of things in my life have improved since I was a suicidal and fucked up kid. Circumstantially, I'd say everything has gotten better. 

But that pain. That chasm in my chest. The unrelenting despair that taints even the most beautiful moments. It persists. 

I've done the work. The therapy, the healthy lifestyle, the mindfulness, the trauma work, sobriety, sports, travel, study... I've worked hard and done cool shit. And yet it still feels like someone has their foot on my heart, crushing the life out of me. 

No matter how bright a life I build, the world inside me is full of demons. 

I wish I didn't feel this way. I wish I could flip the switch and just be genuinely grateful for all my blessings. But I'm haunted. I'm broken. I'm full of monsters. And I'm so tired of holding them in. I'm tired and sad and I feel like I waited too long. I should have left years ago. Some random coincidence stopped my blade and now I'm stuck here, suffocating on my own existence. "
57,1,"hi
okay this gonna be long and my english is very badd bc it’s not my main language but i suffer from ptsd because my dad had extreme mania and killed himself when i was 9 that was because my mother left us because she fell in love with and addict and then she became addict too and he was very rude with her he abused her for 8 years and the days i used to go to see her were horrible because of him he literally almost killed her in front of me etc and yeah that’s pretty much the main reason for my ptsd, and religion trauma and shit, actually i was so scared of god back then but anyway i have autism and that’s the fucking main problem, everyone i love left me because no one can handle my personality my friends literally left me and my boyfriend cheated on me with one of them and i can’t even tell him that i know that because i just can’t i can’t fight him or them, they always made me feel like a retard, they were pretty abusive too, and now i’m alone by decision but i honestly just want to die, i want to sleep forever? i just want to sleep is all i think this days and this last 2 years were like that but now im pretty sure i just want to die and the world is gonna end soon anyway"
58,1,"I always thought that as long as I matter to one person, life wouldn't be so bad. But I've been proven time and time again that I don't matter. Not to the people whom I thought I would matter to. I'm just so tired of feeling like this. Friends? Family? Partners? A bunch of bullshit. No amount of ""i love you"" ever feel genuine. Just empty drivel so they feel better when I kill myself, so they can delude themselves into thinking they're not part of the reason why I ended everything. I am not a priority in anyone's life. I don't even come third or fourth. Just an add on. I'm tired. I need to prepare for when I finally do it. I'm not leaving a note. No one deserves to know. Fuck then. I hate everyone. No one ever tried to reach out. If I burn in hell, I hope they burn with me. I'm so tired of this bullshit. "
59,1,I want to die not even sure why I’m making this but I give up I’ve tried 7 times all failed I have a failsafe now 
60,1,"So. I (18) was looking through my 'suicide box' in my apartment. It's a box I keep with stuff like pills, meds, blades, bandages, ropes, etc. That's when I found Morphine. I hadn't used it in a while and I was feeling at my lowest. So, as the idiot I am, I took 150 mg to begin with before going to nearly 200 mg in total, as well as I slit my wrists, arms, and thighs. I was so close to death but unfortunately my partner found me again (this isn't the first time) I was so happy when I felt myself slipping away, and now it's all ruined. I haven't really spoken to my partner after that, and it's been around a week. What should I do?"
61,1,"Not only it was risky to have kids at that age, but they have been miserable together.
Literally it would be better for everyone if they didn't get marry in first place."
62,1,"Hello im pia 15f and i wanna kill myself. Can anyone give me any ways to kms without it being painful? I am so sick of myself and my life and i honestly cant go on anymore. Everyone is better off without me. I am so sick of my mom and dad's abuse towards me physically and mentally. I was bullied growing up which fucked my mental health up. Im so sick of my family, school, my friends, my life and literally everyone. I tried overdosing multiple times but it always fails, i took all the pills i could possibly find at home but nothing happens to me. I tried hanging myself but ended up chickening out because i felt like my head was gonna explode. Shi i got scared. I found out that inhaling helium tanks is the most painless way to die but ion got money to buy a whole fuckin tank. Someone said a gun to ur head only hurts for like a second but obviously i cant buy a gun and legally own one. No one actually cares or likes me which i dont blame em bc i dont even like myself. I feel so hopeless, i dont see a future in myself. Please dont try to talk me out of it cuz ill do it either way i just wanna die"
63,1,"
Extremely intense emotions, not sustainable for life. Everything is coming to a breaking point, like darkness at the end of a tunnel instead of light. the source of most of the issues I have is grief, but before then anxiety had a grip on my life like no other, idk why. This last month or two it feels like my brain collapsed. I stopped sleeping, stopped eating more than once a day, got angry, having these weird day nightmares things idrk, extreme anxiety and depression, last couple days I been reaching out on Reddit which is very unusual of me im really private, grief striking with another huge wave, also strangely felt more lustful, I got drunk and walked somewhere and broke some stuff while crying, don’t even remember what or where, and I DONT EVEN DRINK. Idk how I even made that decision consciously. Violent thoughts towards others at a slight disagreement. Zero motivation to do simple things. Losing weight, but feel heavier.. how do I explain that?? Feels like somebody suspended rocks in my torso. My boss been noticing me acting strange. I feel so crazy, I’m either angry or crying or just feeling nothing at all. want to leave and it would be easy, some mornings I sit with the opportunity in front of me and just look but don’t think about it, but the urge progresses at a really weird unexplainable rate. I’m almost 19 just starting college, why do I have to feel like this, reaching out for help before what feels like my uncontrollable emotions beat me to it "
64,1,"The disease of sorrow continues to eat away at my brain, like it always does. Chew chew chew. I feel dumber by the hour. I think eventually I am going to be so stupid the only thing I will know how to do is kill myself. I keep running in the same circles over and over, the same circles I've been in for over a decade. Will the agony ever end? Maybe I need to get it over with now. "
65,1,"37yo, have been an ER nurse for 8 years, I was in the USMC infantry in Afghanistan, had a minor TBI, I have depression, ADD, Anxiety, Generalized Panic Disorder, hx of cutting… I met my wife 8 years ago and new she was the one for me, we have been married 6 years, and have a beautiful 15 month old boy.  Recently we have been going through a horrible rocky patch, mostly due to unintentional neglect on my part which I have completely owned up to and changed my behavior over the last 6 months, but also she learned I had been withholding debt I had from her to invest.  She to call me the best person she’s ever known…

now sees me for all my faults, sees me as a dishonest person.  I’m completely heartbroken and feel like life will never be the same… I’ve ruined the way she sees me and I feel like life is hopeless, I’ve can’t imagine life without her and my son together as a family unit.  We are in counseling but she wants all our issues to fixed overnight.  She talks about leaving me, and the thought is too much to bear.  I have been thinking about taking out a life insurance policy so that they could be set up down the road if I do end my life, I would never leave them without being setup for the future, life is hard enough for any single parent as is.  But if she does break up our family I am just so tired with life, chronic pain that I was managing with daily ketamine (never at work) but stopped completely a month ago due to her telling me it was a deal breaker even though in her words “I can’t tell if you are even on it or not”.  Which shows I never was out of control with it.  It Just helped keep everything kinda rosy feeling, but otherwise fully functional.   And helped manage my PTSD in a major way…. I’m just so so so tired, and I don’t know that I’ll be able to keep going on forever, I don’t know that my son is enough to keep me going, I married my wife to have a life with her, not to have a child, we chose too add a child to our life because we thought we were ready.  I love them both equally, but I can’t do life without both of them it equally… what do I do?!  I just keep picturing myself hanging or thinking of maybe ways to go out with (hopefully) minimizing the trauma to others.  I have family that love me, but I don’t think it’s really enough right now…  She wants me to sell as much stuff as I can including investments to get us out of debt, but I also know that if I do that, then it will be much easier to end my life knowing she is in a financially good position."
66,1,My boyfriend wants to commit suicide and I don't know what do to he doesn't trust therapist from a really bad experience he had and I can't be hypocritical about it and tell him the usual you'll be fine crap or we'll get through this because I have been suicidal since I was 11 and cutting since 10. what do I do? I want to support him but not be hypocritical about it.
67,1,Does anyone else associate anger with suicidal thoughts. Whenever I was the closest to taking my own life I wasn't crying I was pouting and breathing heavily because I was so angry. Angry that I was brought into this world. Angry that I messed my life up this bad and ruined opportunities for me. I feel like this is something that isn't spoken about much when talking about suicide. I feel that a lot of peoples last emotion before ending it was pure anger.
68,1,i spend so much time and effort into making my room beautiful.  decorating my room is one of my favorite hobbies. i just got back from the thrift store and got some new decorations. i almost attempted today but i think if i killed my self id feel so sad to leave my beautiful room. no one else would love and take care of my room as much as i do if i were gone
69,1,"I never told you guys about my suffering because I didn’t want to bring you down. I always tried my best to be the happy person in the group and to think positive so you wouldn’t see how I truly felt about myself and my life. You have all changed me in some way even if it was small - it was a change. Continue chasing your dreams as I know you will all achieve them and I will be there in some way watching you achieve them. I love you all, and you all deserve the best things in life. None of this is anybody’s fault. "
70,1,It would be done now but I am not alone. I have 10 hours of complete alone time tomorrow and I am more than ready for this to be over. I am done. 
71,1,"I can’t do this anymore. I want to run, and jump and never look back. Sitting in a empty seating area at an airport waiting for my flight while 20 other people my age are laughing and joking a few meters away. I want to just run, and disappear and go home. 

I’m fucking done "
72,1,"I thought my friends seeing my arms sliced up from sh would be enough for them to ask how I am, to give a fuck. 
It’s been two weeks and I haven’t heard anything. Not even a shallow ‘how are you?’ with a predetermined script. 
I don’t have the mindset of ‘nobody will care when I’m dead’. I know people will care, but why not now? I’m alive NOW. 
How can you expect somebody to get help without support? Nobody has the energy for me apparently, not even myself."
73,1,"I attempted on Sunday, and being honest about it just made me me feel worse about feeling like shit. The person I care about most ignored me, and others just said ""that sucks"" when I explained it all. I don't want attention when it gets bad, I want someone before it does. Why does it get worse when you're honest? "
74,1,"About an hour ago I took a handful of pills, all I feel is sick, like I'm going to throw up, I'm taking more it needs to be over with tonight "
75,1,"That’s no point to this life. I’m not making this life work. I’m just trying to live and I feel like I’m just waking up for someone else. I don’t even care about my day. I have no interest in to go on. I will take the knife tonight and slit my throat all over my apartment floor.
I’m not worthy of anyone reaching out to help. I deserve to be dead cause I’m not even in love with myself. I can’t control my life and it’s supposed to be mine. I don’t even know why I made it this far.

They say it gets better but it just gets worse and worse."
76,1,"I just lost a best friend of 5 years tonight, not death, he sent one last message explaining why he was blocking me, and then he blocked me.

At first, it was really rough, I cried harder then I ever have, and I've cried really hard before.

It's been a few hours since, and I'm trying to go to sleep but my thoughts and body are refusing.

I keep thinking, what did I do wrong? Why didn't he say anything before? Just today I was texting him about how my first therapy appointment went, and now he's blocking me... I just.... Don't..... Get.... It....


I don't exactly have a lot of friends, so this is just really tough on me, this is a guy who I literally talked with ever. Single. Day. For 5 years, only days I missed were when I was in a mental hospital....

Where do I go from here?"
77,1,"I feel like I'm going to cry for the first time in a while. 

I have done anything in my life. I have not achieved anything. I'm basically a ghost. Massive depression sometimes makes me sleep whole day. 

I don't want to die. I want to live. But I don't know how. I have failed so hard that I have no power or will to continue the life. It is just scary that I started to want to die. 

Life has piled up with so much pain. There's no love, happiness. I can't take it anymore. 
"
78,1,"Today has been a huge spiral. I spent about 3 hours full spiralling then my emotions suddenly shut off. So I spent the rest of the day faking about being happy happy happy! I found out this morning that I made someone I have only met online and known for about 2 weeks very angry because of how I played last night (i was being annoying but I thought that everyone was having fun). 

The only reason I can be somewhat content with my existence is because I am not causing other people pain. By causing someone pain I have essentially made a grave offence and given one more reason to playback in my head at night of why I shouldn’t exist. (On top of being a financial burden). SO… I made a plan. 

1: Make people hate/forget about me to cause the least devastation

2 thats pretty much it. Bridge bag whatever works. Maybe I can make it look accidental to minimize pain so it would sound like a tragedy instead of leaving any chance to make my family feel like they failed because that job is saved for me!

Also question if I do go to the ER how long would they keep me?

PS going to delete this post later tonight… might screenshot comments :p"
79,1,"I'm at the end of my rope, I'm fucking done, my mail got stolen screwed up a good job opportunity because I'm too fucked in the head to work, I have no one, mental health services in Australia are horrible and have completely destroyed any chance I have to be taken seriously by any doctor, all they have to do is label your trauma Bpd and if you have a mental breakdown because you were left to fend for yourself in a domestic violence situation and was left absolutely battered and pushed into a severe breakdown, guess whats thats called? Delusions. 

I'm so fucking tired man. Theres nothing left for me, I just tried reaching out to what friends I have left not one could give a shit, tried reaching out to my counselor, was ignored. Tried talking to chatgpt. hit the limit. 

I don't know what to do, all I have left are these mix of pills I'm tired of being hungry, tried of my cat not having a decent full life in a crappy one bedroom social housing unit, if I get a job they'll charge me $700 a week but if I stay on welfare they'll keep my rent affordable. I can't even improve my circumstances. How am I supposed to save up if most of that is going to rent? No one around me respects me or sees me. I'm a fuck up to my family, all my friends have either abandoned me or died. I don't know what to do man. 

I just want to leave soon. Dont think I'll make it to the end of the week really. I'm Sorry. Just wanted someone to know I'm done. I'm sorry for the hurt I caused. I don't want to be those people who make the world worse to be in. 

Hope the ones who wanted this are happy, glad someone got a good outcome out of my choice and decision that I'm making. Shoutout to the social worker at community mental health. 

""If you in the future want to take your own life, that's your choice , and your decision to make 🤗"" 

With a smile and all not even kidding. Ok guys. 

See you around in some form i suppose, taking the pills and fucking off. I'm done

80,1,"Im always tired and bored, I cant seem to enjoy anything anymore. I ask myself am I just lazy to be wanting to be in bed all day not having any energy to do anything? I want to enjoy things but recently I find anything interesting. I just wanna end it all. I feel useless, I feel stupid and dumb, seeing my old friends enjoying life living life and here I am in bed feeling sorry for useless self. I just dont know what to do anymore. Im 26 yrs old and still in college, trying and fighting to graduate but i just cant find any energy or the strength and motivation anymore.

Reading comments on other post do help me sometimes."
81,1,"I need to come to Reddit because I genuinely have no where else to go. The only hospital in my city denied me services in mental health because of my repetitive admissions, at least that’s what they said. I think it’s because the staff assaulted me and nobody wants to come forward and help the minor who got touched right? Right guys cuz that makes sense. I know that I won’t even get someone to look at me like a human in there if I don’t make an irreversible decision and prove something I don’t even know. They won’t take me they won’t even look at me I can’t do this. I have nobody I just found out I failed all my classes my family member had a heart attack yesterday my drug use has gotten so bad I can’t remember anything I forgot a course I was enrolled in for 5 months and now I’ve failed that too, I know if I do anything to myself the people around me will scream in my face and tear me down for messing up, and then I won’t even get help I don’t care anymore I genuinely don’t . Why am I still trying? Why am I still here. There’s genuinely no honest to God point "
82,1,"I just called Safe Beds and they're full. That was my last option other than hospitization.

Doesn't seem like I'll ever get the help I need. Sure hasn't happened yet.

Maybe it's fine to give up. Or whatever term I should use. This is no way to live.

It's not like I'm 15 anymore.

I'm tired of going to appointments tired. I'm tired of being so tired I can't think.

I'm tired of desperately trying to get support and just making everyone fed up with me and ghost me until I go away.

Just me die. I'm tired of this.

83,1,"I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for who knows how long, but the last two years have been especially rough for me. The only thing that has kept me alive and focused was my elderly dog, my dear Buddy. It just wouldn't be fair if I just abandoned him.

Well now, my dog has passed away. I had him euthanized in my home when his health suddenly declined. He's gone now, so I'm at a crossroads now. It would be so easy to disappear now. Sure I have my family, but honestly they have been a major part of why I am the way I am now (despite their apologies). Friends? They have been drifting apart for some time now. So really I don't have anyone anymore. It would be so easy to disappear now."

Horrifying to think about. "
86,1,"Today I had a conversation with my father, with whom I don't have a good relationship. I hardly see him and don't think that will change. He said things to me during my childhood that I haven't forgotten and that still haunt me today: ""If you don't want to see me anymore, then say so, then you won't have to see me anymore,"" ""Get the hell out of my car, you asshole."" Regarding the second thing, he said, ""You were just acting like an asshole."" I never insulted my parents or would have thought of it, so it's hard for me to understand what my father said. The first statement was particularly hurtful; I was about 13 at the time. My father and I argued every time we saw each other. Once, it was so bad that I canceled the sleepover and my mother picked me up. Since then, the cycle of being with him every two weeks has been interrupted. Our communication has now shrunk to calls about school, combined with his work, which I'm supposed to help him with because we're family.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings and said that the job wasn't for me and that I would help him with something else. Eagle. I refused. After that, he saw me as a spoiled boy who didn't understand family ties or rules, etc. I then confronted him about how strictly he adhered to his wonderful rules. My father is someone who is only happy as long as everything goes the way he wants it. He says everything directly and hurtfully. He always watched soccer with me and attended my games. While other fathers praised their children and had fun, he would just say, ""You still need to train because that was shit and that was bad."" ""He knows what's good."" He thinks he's always right and expects me to call him after all that, but he hasn't called once without asking for help with work. I'm also struggling with knee injuries, which is why I've taken a break from soccer. His advice (encouraging words): ""Maybe you should just quit soccer.""  Now when I confronted him about his family rules and held up a mirror to him, he was quiet and said, ""Okay, I know what you think of me and I can deal with it."" After that the conversation was over. Do you think I'm just too soft or something? But for me it was very exhausting to spend time with him when we only had a small difference of opinion. He is also a very short-tempered person who gets relatively aggressive but not forceful. He is a huge pillar of support that I really needed but unfortunately didn't get and now I'm struggling with suicidal thoughts. I would be interested in your opinion on all of this. "
87,1,Looking for a literal how-to on killing myself. Looking for reliable information so I can assure a job well done.
88,1,Do you ever feel like there is a monster in yourself  like something you just don't know what it is or how to control it and there are times it just come up and you just feel like you don't have the energy to fight it and just go with the flow no matter what happens I the long run but when it happens you just hope and pray that you don't hurt anyone thoughts and feelings along the way even the ones that are really trying to help you know they are but the thing inside you just hurt you so so much that you start to fight but the power of run away kicks in so you do that and yeah there a big thing that come out of that why can't control myself at the moment l am so wanting a drink right know just to drown the feeling with in me even made get some sleep but of course the sleep l wish l could really get would stop everything why can't l do anything right it's just one simple task and l can't do that even right great
89,1,"this is poorly organized and communicated here, and for that i am sorry. i find it hard to describe and put into words these feelings of malaise and melancholy which have seeped into my my daily life. in objective measures, i have attained a reasonable degree of success and am on a path where i have the potential to do a lot more.

but it feels pointless and meaningless. i don't know what i would be doing it for. i was depressed in a much more painful way in the past as a teen and almost killed myself; however, i got myself together back then for the sake of my younger siblings so i could help give them the upbringing and life my abusive household, my mother most of all, would never give me to me. we went through a lot, CPS and police visits, court cases, mandated therapy, and just so much shit. but they're starting to do much better now, full rides at top universities and the beginnings of promising new careers despite their younger ages (other than one who's still a bit too young for that, but even he's doing great at school and his other siblings doing well enough to support him as needed), this makes me extremely happy.

but i am not needed anymore. and with the vanishing of that duty, i return to my depression but in a more nihilistic and melancholic way. all sense of meaning feels like a forced invention to cope with having to be alive. the religion of my youth and my parents is fake, i went through so many cycles of exploring new frameworks and worldviews that could justify my existence, but they all just fall apart and fail to speak to me. i have deep, lingering scars from horrific physical and emotional abuse deep inside me, and i can't bring myself to even go into those at this moment

i'm not being totally coherent or communicating my feelings and background very well right now, i'm not in the right mindstate for that. i'm really just extremely depressed and hopeless and can't find the life ahead of me worth it enough to actually stay alive for it"
90,1,"Honesty this is pathetic.i absolutely love the people I have close to me. I at times realize I care way way too much but that’s the type of person I am. I would genuinely do anything for them. I’m always emotional. The smallest things get me sad and all I do is cry. My moods are hard to handle and I’m realizing I’m attempting to be more stable but I think it’s already to late. I don’t want to keep burdening everyone with my problems. All I ever have is problems and I am so so terribly sorry I’m always such a mess. I’m realizing it would be so much better if everyone just left me to keep themselves safe because all I’m gonna do is drain everyone because I cry and I get sad. I’m sorry I’m not confident, I’m sorry I’m struggling, I’m sorry I’m clingy, I’m sorry I’m overwhelming, I’m sorry I drag everyone I’ve ever care about down with me. I’m so terribly sorry I really never meant to hurt anyone in the process of my own pain. I’m sorry you ever had to experience me. "
91,1,I don’t even want to be happy anymore.  It’s not possible.  I just want it to be over.  I wish I was supported in wanting to leave.  I can’t take the pain.
92,1,It’s the same shit everyday the same shit. Nothing changes I feel like shit and sometimes I I don’t even know how to feel. I’m so tired of this shit every single day I know what another day on earth will bring I know because it’s been the exact same for months with the same bullshit. And despite knowing this I can’t kill myself like what the fuck it can’t be this hard to fucking tie a rope around my neck. This just doesn’t make sense   
93,1,"I feel like there’s cameras everywhere, i feel like there’s one in my closet watching me right now. I’ve checked the closet multiple times and found nothing. I can’t even shower without feeling like I’m being watched. I’ve felt like this since I was 14-16 but recently it got so much worse. I keep seeing things out of the corners of my eyes too. I can’t help but feel like it’s my mom watching me and that my family is in on it. I know non of this is true but it’s getting harder and harder for me to believe and I’m scared."
94,1,"Not to be throwing out terms here. But I feel like i have ""imposter syndrome"" with my ""possible depression"". 

This is my 3rd week of classes, and it started out so badly (my fault) that I'm constantly on the verge of crying and thinking about ""ending it"". I'll be driving and its 'it'll be nice if someone t-boned me/if I speed into a concrete wall' or 'if someone threaten to shoot me right now, I dont think I'll fight it' 'it would be nice to just throw myself off a bridge/jump into traffic' 

But idk if im ""faking"" it??? Like what if im just saying this because thats what """"kids these days"""" say ""as a joke"" and I dont actually mean it? So im stressed about classes, stressed about family, stressed about whether I actually have depression or if im just exaggerating that I just want it all to stop. Not that it can. 

Ive been trying to excerise, eat better, doing things that I enjoy but the frustration is just building and simmering that I dont know what to do "
95,1,"21 years of misery and isolation. I am a completely alone person who can't make friends or form real connections yet It's all I think about. 

What's the point in living when you're unable to form anything real or legitimate?"
96,1,"I want to die. I have everything I need. It’s all written, but I’m still scared about hurting my family. Or having someone find my dead body. I don’t want to leave my girlfriend. I want to die until I feel better. I still want to hold my girlfriend, to see the buttercups outside my window. Greet my cat each morning. I don’t know anymore "
97,1,"It just feels I keep going in cycles of being interested something (books, anime,game ect) then when I am done. I just think of killing myself and I loose my will to live. And this continues untill I found a new distraction. I feel like one day I am just gonna run out of distraction and just end everything."
98,1,I just want to die. Everything in my life is shit and when I think it’s getting better it just gets worse again. I can’t do this anymore. I know I’m young and people don’t take suicidal thoughts in young people seriously but I am actually going to kill myself I can’t anymore.
99,1,"There’s a voice in my head trying to sell me sui**** like candy. I can’t tell if it’s a self-soother or my psychosis but I like him a lot. “Permanent vacation.” “You won’t have to return to work.” “No need to brush your teeth, you won’t need them where we’re going.” “Finally put yourself first.” “Think of what you want.” “None of this will ever change so you might as well.”

 The only thing I can’t decide on is where or how. Way too many options. Clean and effective are hard to achieve at the same time. Please wish me well, whether I decide to or not to "
100,1,"Those lights on the front will be the last thing I ever see. Thank you to everyone in this thread, but this is goodbye. Fuck reality."
101,1,"First of all, don't kill yourself at all, it's stupid, it's irrational, it's a dumb way to try to escape your situation. In your last moments you will not feel peace, your body will be in panic mode and you'll feel absolute terror and a strong desire to live. I do not in anyway condone what I've done, and do not use my post as a clever tutorial to get high or kill yourselves bcuz that's a bitch move. Don't ever use medication past the recommended dosage cause it's supa dumb sauce. Anyways.  
  
15 year old failure here. Last night I attempted to kill myself unaware that the dosage of what I'd taken (Benadryl) was far too little despite being almost in the thousands of mg. I was hallucinating eerie whistles, seeing my shadow grow different irregular shapes that didn't match my silhouette, seeing bugs fly into my face and crawl over me, and eventually when I'd closed my eyes I felt like I was in a train station. At first, I thought ""y'know, if this kills me, it won't be so bad..."" Then I felt the nerves in my body all experience waves of absolute PAIN. Like, imagine greening out on weed x100. It was so painful and strange that every sensation, no matter how gentle, woud confuse my nerves and send a pain signal to each touch. I slept for 13 hours and woke up feeling aching all over my body, and very, very sweaty palms. Currently, I can feel my heart having a weird dripping sensation (my BPM is also higher so that's prolly why, dw I will likely survive and feel fine in a few days) and my kidneys are in pain. Hopefully the fact I'm still a teenager means my immune system can kick this, but my POINT is. Look at all the HORRIFIC things I went through because I decided I wanted a high way to die. And the kicker is, I'm going to be dealing with this until this stuff leaves my system. And in this time in just ONE DAY, boy do I not wanna die. 

My body is fighting this shit out of my system and it feels like total crap.  Just don't try to kill yourselves chat. Don't abuse medicine. Go text the hotline, I find that it's easier to make the hotline person feel like they're helping cause we all know ts doesn't rlly do much. But still. Just distract urself with something better than the thought of death bcuz let me tell you, the kind of cartoon-level bullshit tragedies I go through isn't so bad compared to dying this way. 

Anyways I'd also like to use this chance to ask any others what their experience was attempting with this method or did I just uniquely have a bizarre experience with beny.   "
102,1,"Hi all. Growing up, I was academically gifted and graduated high school at the top of my class. My dad always pushed me to go to school and even offered to pay for it, so naturally I went to college. At age 18, before I could attend University, I had my first psychotic break that lasted nearly 4 months and took a year to fully recover from. It was frightening to say the least and easily one of the worst experiences I had thus far in life.

Still, I got back on my feet and enrolled at a local community college. I excelled there. I joined a sports team and worked two jobs while studying nursing. All was well for two years until I had another major psychotic break at age 22 which lasted 5 months and took another year to recover from. Still, I never gave up. I re-enrolled in school again once I was healthy and able to, and graduated with honors. I had been diagnosed by several different psychiatrists, with diagnoses ranging from Bipolar 1 with Psychotic Features to Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features and even Schizoaffective Disorder. I was put on a strict medication regimen. 

For the next two years I worked, and stayed on medication, until I unfortunately had another psychotic break due to stress and trauma. 2023 was one of the hardest years of my life as I spent most of the year in and out of mental hospitals and in active psychosis for months. For whatever reason, I firmly believed that the Mexican Cartel was out to murder me (I live in a safe white suburb and have no connection to the Cartel whatsoever) by burning me alive so I was desperately trying to find various ways to kill myself before they could get to me and take my life in such a horrifying and painful manner. This led to me overdosing on Fentanyl which I nearly did die from on January 7th, 2024. Luckily my friend found me and called an ambulance and I was resuscitated. 

After I was administered a life-saving dose of Naloxone, I was rushed to yet another psych ward and I had so many false beliefs and delusions that the nurses and doctors there were gang / cartel affiliated and wanted to torture me. I had paranoid thoughts that cameras were following me everywhere, capturing my every movement and displaying my life to an invisible audience for their sick entertainment. I was so scared, alone, and confused.

Thankfully, as months went by, I healed again and came out of psychosis gradually. Despite everything, I kept moving forward. I began working again and currently am also in school again furthering my degree. 

I can’t help but feeling like a failure or loser of some sort although I never gave up. Is it because I still live at home with my family? I have a very decent amount of savings, a job, my own car, and am in school. I love my parents, but I turn 27 this month and most of my peers / old friends moved out of their parent’s years ago. I guess I just feel behind but I also can’t help but feel like I wouldn’t be in this position if it weren’t for those god damn psychotic breaks I am prone to. I pray to any God who is out there, please never let me experience another one. They’re genuinely terrifying. I didn’t ask for this illness. I don’t even know how it developed. 

Am I a loser? "
103,1,"I’m so sorry everyone. I’ve let you all down. If someone finds me in time it means it wasn’t my time. However, I don’t think I can fight anymore.

All I wanted was to be happy."
104,1,"Hello,

I have high anxiety bexause I was reported to the police. In my opinion it's not a criminal offence (I'm a lawyer myself) but unfortunately I'm a very anxious person and I'm afraid of what will happen next.

I'm afraid they'll make an example of me. A couple of days ago I tried to KMS because of that.

"
105,1,"[19F] i was let go from my job over a month ago and live with my parents who recently found out i've been smoking weed and and are not too happy about it. it's evident they are sick of me being home and having to take care of me. i have major depression disorder, generalized anxiety, adhd, ocd, and autism like that combo alone is enough for me to pull the trigger is it not? 
my life was so good just a few months ago. i had an amazing well paying job and i was doing basically nothing surrounded by people i loved. i was confident, secure, safe, and happy. then i had to come off of my anti depressants and my adderall at the same time due to some insurance reasons and for two weeks my entire life fell apart and the only thing i had going for me was the fact that my life was going to go back to normal. 
i was let go from the company two days after getting back on my meds. 
from there i have been in a rapid decline over the last few weeks i am so fucking exhausted i hate my stupid fucking brain for not being able to do anything normally i just wish i was fucking normal 

i am helplessly in love with someone i hardly know who KNOWS i am utterly infatuated and obviously because of that he is leading me on. i know it is happening. i know what he is doing. i can't stop because talking to him is the only thing that makes me feel better. i think about him constantly, it's ocd i am fucking obsessed with him i love him so much and i know he doesn't feel the same and i want to rip my heart out every single fucking day and shove it down his throat 

i don't want to get better. i've gotten better. it gets worse every single fucking time and it's not worth the good parts because the bad parts are so bad. "
106,1,"I'm currently swinging between life isn't worth the suffering and I'm stronger than before (2 previous attempts).

If I *am* stronger than that means facing the fact my marriage (21y, together 28y) is over.

If I am *that* strong does that mean I should be strong enough to cope with our kids, alone?

I don't *think* I am that strong, yet, physically or mentally...but I'm also not sure I can last long enough to become "
107,1,"I live for my sister and my cat mostly. I'm 10-15 and my life is so damn hopeless. I've been homeschooled my whole life. I have no choice. My dad says all the kids are bad and ""children should be with their parents."" Tried everything, begged, asked, wrote an essay that took me 2 freaking hours, nothing ever worked. I wouldn't Kms because of my sister, I'd break her heart and ruin her life.
She ran away at 16. I was prevented from seeing her for about a year. My dad hates the way I take sides with her, I dont think he genuinely realizes how much he has hurt her mentally. They used to have physical fights and me as a little girl was trying to break them up.
This morning he said that if I took sides with her one more time he would, abandon me. And that he ""wished he had sons."" And that ""we made his life miserable."" I'm sick of him playing the victim. I want to tell me sister how I'm feeling nowadays but I'm not that brave. The only thing I've told is AI lol. I have a playlist that I listen to, it's so sad, like me :)
I've attempted before, I have a death note. Idk why I'm posting here, ig venting. Also don't try dming me creeps.
I can't wait to move in with me sister."
108,1,"Well, life was never good for me, I lived isolated, I got punched by my father, I didn't have friends, I was bullied even by teachers, my first girlfriend was when I was 18 and it was the only reason I had to live, but after 4 years of relationship, we were living together, we were going to get married, she met another girl and left me, after that I wasn't happy again, I tried to kill myself several times and I couldn't, I always fail, it's been 3 years since she left. It was and I can't move on, I just want to die so it can go away soon"
109,1,"I didn’t ask to be born. I didn’t ask to be physically and mentally and sexually abused. I didn’t ask to suffer through life just to “earn living” 

Life is just so unfair.  I don’t wanna be here. I feel trapped.  Wish i had a gun"
110,1,"
I am a 14 year old kid and I want to kill myself. I've been thinking about if for the pass 6 months and have been sh for about 3-4 years. I am a disgusting person and I hate it. I don't have a plan but I want to overdose. A little background: my parents are divorced, I have autism, add, depression and anxiety(all diagnosed) I have thoughts of being raped and meeting a pedo. I feel that if any of those 2 things happen people will feel sorry for me and actually care how I feel. I can't hold a relationship anymore since I broke up with my 2 year long relationship. I'm lonely and the only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my dad and brother. They are the reason I live but I'm so tired. I don't know what to do."
111,1,"Im 17m, and I'm completely alone. I have terrible self-esteem, which is made much worse by my lack of good friends. I'm on the autism spectrum, which makes my attempts at being outgoing,  funny or friendly seem weird or uncomfortable to many people. Even my friends don't spend time with me, unless they're super duper bored and have no other options. I can't connect with other people very easily, but I find it a lot easier with girls. Unfortunately, girls often find me creepy, and I believe some have even made up stories of me doing things to them which I don't remember doing at all. I have so much self doubt and self-hatred, that I can't tell if these are things that I would really do or not. One of the only reasons why I havent ended it all here are my parents, I'm very close to them, and they are incredibly loving. They don't really know any details of the things I've been going through, but they've been able to gather that I have some issues and have gotten me registered into some counseling, but I have no idea when it's actually going to start. But I just can't bare the isolation I feel from people my own age. Every time I see a picture of a bunch of my friends hanging out when I wasn't invited, a piece of my soul dies. I used to be a part of a DnD group, and I really enjoyed it, and even though I still didn't get enough social interaction from it, it was a highlight of my week, but I ended up getting kicked out because some people there hated me that much. I'm so pathetic and horrible to be around, i ended up ruining one of the best parts of my life. I want to know if trying to kill myself would make people want to be friends with me, even if it was just out of pity. Like, if they thought that their efforts would save a life, they'd do it, right? Even though I don't think I'm quite at the breaking point yet, I'm getting closer and closer "
112,1,Not everyone gets to live or heal. I'm just another failure. 
113,1,"i was never supposed to make it this far, i never wanted to make it this far, nothing about being an adult excites me not one bit, everything about being an adult terrifies me it always has, im not excited to be independent, have freedom, get a career, go to clubs, get married, drive etc infact i dont want any of it, i was never supposed to be an adult, nobody has ever been able to imagine my future because there isnt supposed to be one and now there wont be, i have enough pills now to potentially kill me but not with certainty, by august ill have more than enough, on my 18th birthday im going to end it all, i dont want to celebrate, i dont want to be celebrated so i wont be."
114,1,"I want to die. I'm tired of the constant emotional pain I can't cope with, tired of myself and the self-hatred. I want to stop existing and free the world from my presence. There are only a few things keeping me here — my family, who loves me, and a few tasks I'd like to complete before I die. I'm willing to postpone my suicide just to finish those unfinished things. Once they're done, I feel I can leave this world. In your opinion, what things should I add to my list?"
115,1,"My last relationship ended with me constantly almost every day being told I am a freak, psycho, a bitch, a whore, unlovable, fat, ugly, a retard, not good enough, an annoyance, awful to be around, a bad person, I would cry for hours and beg to make up to be told that he didn’t care and that I’m just suffocating, just to be told something nice about me. It got me to the point if he ever asked me why am I alive I’d tell him I don’t deserve to be because that’s something that was drilled into my head, and I still believe is true. I hate myself, I think I am worthless and I don’t deserve to be alive. I hate everything about me, even believe I deserve bad things to happen to me. I’ve been having a hard time at work recently due to new management and honestly it’s made me realise that I just am the problem, I’m a burden and it’s all my fault, I shouldn’t exist and life would be better if I was dead, just like he said, I am an annoyance, and truly, I know I am a burden. I just want to die. I just wish I’d die suddenly so I can stop bothering my work colleagues, him, my family, my friends. It’s what I deserve "
116,1,"It's strange because I'm actually feeling a lot better.  My psychiatrist finally got me on meds that work well for me: I'm not miserable anymore.

But as I sit on the floor, staring at my weights when I'm supposed to be lifting them, I'm so tempted to down some poison then blow my brains out (to be positive I die, in case the bullet doesn't line up just right).

It's strange I feel this way, given everything's going well.  I guess life just feels pointless: problem after problem.  I solve them just fine, but then there's a new problem the next day, and the problems of the previous day are irrelevant.  It's like no matter what I do, I'm right back where I started.

And while I'm not emotionally distressed, I still am cognitively.  I guess I'm struggling to logically justify staying alive, despite not experiencing any distress I hope to escape.  

And the fact I'm still suicidal even after getting my meds right, doing all my exercise, working the job I wanted, eating pretty much perfectly, etc., just confirms I should do it.  "
117,1,"I’m 5 months pregnant and everyone has left me my family and friends all left once I told them I’m pregnant I genuinely cannot cope anymore I’m no use to this world I’ve got no one to talk to. 
I get severe panic attacks daily to the point I pass out because I’m breathing so fast I can’t do this anymore. "
118,1,"I turn 16 in late July. I'm just so tired, I don't really see a point in living. I'm okay with ending it at what I have experienced so far. I don't think it's for me. I feel at peace when I think about ending it. 

I really wanna do it tomorrow but I told my best friend we can hang out this Friday, so it will have to wait, if I can take it that long.

I have \~550mg of Adderall. I'm gonna dissolve it and drink it all. The lowest reported death on Adderall overdose was 25mg so I'm sure it will be enough for me. I have gotten serotonin syndrome off of only 20mg before (not confirmed as I never told my parents how I was feeling, I was too scared and I purposely took twice my prescription because 20mg used to get me high until it started to make me feel like shit. Yeah I know my tolerance is really damn low).

I have a to do list. I need to hide all my money (in case I fail), change my passwords to devices, double check my note, make a playlist (I'm gonna attach the link to the note in the description for my friends so my parents can't find it), hang out with my dog, and send texts to close friends. I will also probably go and get myself a ""final meal"" and listen to some of my favorite songs but yeah.

For years, I used to want to attempt but I would be scared of actually succeeding. I'm not afraid anymore. Part of me hopes I fail, but I also don't mind if I don't. It's honestly up to the universe at this point. I just need to stop thinking about it and just do it.

I hope my best friend knows I love her and that it's not her fault."
119,1,"please

I'm so tired of trying. Go to school, go to work, caring for the kids, clean the house, care for the pets, pay the bills, be considerate, don't expect anything, cook, fix, drive, go go go.

there's always something that I'm supposed to be doing, yet nothing I want. Everything feels muted. I scream and cry alone about how I just want to be wanted and loved and kept. I go out of my way to be and do things for everyone around me and always feel like I'm sitting with my hands folded waiting for the moment that it's  ""enough"" and I can finally just BE, but it never comes.

I've managed to get halfway through my degree and keep a 4.0 so far, yet feel like an idiot and that I'm still failing because I can't recall almost anything unless I'm actively doing the work.

I am the primary provider, I manage my home and almost everything that comes with that on my own. I juggle appointments, working part time and being enrolled in college full-time on top of being a full-time single parent.

I have no family nearby, and had moved away from them to a more affordable area since they were of no support to begin with. I have not had any substantial relationships with anyone to where I could call on them as a ""friend"" either to help in some way or even just spend time with. my marriage dissolved in a very ugly way, and the following relationship was even worse.

I truly feel as though I was meant to leave this plane of existence a long time ago, and the longer it's gone on the more reasons keep being piled on to show me that. were it not for peeking in and seeing my kids content in their rooms, knowing if I go they have nobody, then I would have already been gone.

I try and try and try to see things through for their sake, because it certainly isn't for my own. I feel like I'm even burdening them, just because I see how sweet and compassionate and empathetic they are and know it's because I'm such a disaster......they should be enjoying childhood not hearing me cry and begging to hold them while whimpering how much I love them. it's got to be causing them trauma I know it, yet I'm still not strong enough to be better for them"
120,1,"I feel bad for ""throwing away"" my life since I know others have it worse and my life (before recently) really wasnt that bad. I had friends, a good home life, no real traumatic experiences. I feel like the reason I'm feeling like this at all is stupid. 

I used to get through hard times by having daydreams about how I could improve my life but now I know everything I wanted is fucking impossible. All the coping mechanisms I had were unhealthy (ai chatting and maladaptive daydreaming) so I had to drop them, and now I just feel empty. I'm too unmotivated to finish my personal projects cus I can barely even wake myself up in the mornings. I know I'll never be pretty no matter how hard I try but I don't WANT to have to just ""learn to live with it"" MAYBE I DIDNT FUCKING CHOOSE TO BE BORN AT ALL!  ILL NEVER BE LOVED BECAUSE WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT SOMEONE LIKE ME!?? Esp in TODAYS climate. And even when I DO have a good day I just come across something that reminds me why I shouldnt be happy and that the world is even MORE fucked up than I thought. 

 ""Oh but you're so young! You have so much life left to live"" and why should I? Why should I have to stress myself out to live some shitty meaningless life just to become some useless person with no real purpose but to be another face in the crowd. Why should I be forced to continue living for YOUR sake when you dont even care when Im alive. People only care when it's too late. Die and suddenly you're ""the person that was the light of everyone's life"". The one that ""made everyday worth living"".   
  
""Oh but you'll have to deal with the pain!"" I'd rather feel pain one last time than go through a lifetime of it. I know the people I'm close to will be hurt, but I'm tired of putting up with stuff because I'm expected to live.If I was dead I wouldnt know about any of the pain because I wouldnt be CONSCIOUS. The only thing that's stopping me is fear and a little bit of hope, but atp I'm just done. I want to escape this life and live where I'm not judged by things I cant fix or control, but if that means not living at all, then so be it."
121,1,"just when i cried all night about wanting to die my parents woke me up hours later to tell me my grandpa who i loved died and have to go to the funeral

how do i deal with all the complicated overwhelming feelings and i want to be mindful of my family who lost someone too but i am losing it so badly"
122,1,"I've been struggling with life since I was 12. No dad, no passion, no goals, nothing. Now I'm 20, studying German in Turkey, but I don't know myself anymore. I don't go to school, I don't study, I don't do anything and just sit all day. Everyone expects me to become successful and passionate about my studies, but I don't want to do anything. Last week I tried to commit suicide by taking all the pills I had. But things haven't gone as I expected. Im still alive and still dont know who i am. i deactivated all my socials today. i just don't know what to do. im not successful at my school, i have debts just need help. I can't talk to anyone, I feel like no one understands me. I want to commit suicide but I'm afraid of what I will leave behind. I can't commit suicide because my mother will be upset and I can't do it without her. I'm trapped. What can I do, I really need help."
123,1,"Sometimes I just begin to want to kill everyone I see for no reason. It happens at least 4 times every week. When it does I just wanna go on a rampage in which I kill as many as I can, the only reason this hasn't happened yet is because I do not have access to a firearm, nor ammo to make one myself. When it happens it goes on for hours. It's getting out of hand, I've been attacking my friends with sharp objects, I cannot control myself anymore. But every stab feels so fucking good. But, when it is over I feel extremely guilty and just lost. I do not wanna do it and it seems like the suicide is the only way for me to stop myself. I cannot get any professional help due to my family being so poor. Can someone please give me some advice on what to do?"
124,1,"Like the title says, if I wasn’t for my kids I’d have killed myself by now. I’m just hurting. 

I can’t take their mama away from them though. I choose to have them and I owe them everything. Those two kids didn’t ask to be here, the very least I can do is stick around. "
125,1,"every bad thing feels like an opportunity. i forgot to do the dishes and it pissed my mom off, i was in the washroom and missed an important call at work and now my coworkers are frustrated, i forgot to feed my familys dog before leaving, i gained weight and i have felt bloated for a few days, somebody is acting off (even if i didnt directly do anything, i often feel i can find some way i was involved in causing their frustration), all my friends did better on an exam than i did, im behind on my lectures, etc etc. i think well if i just killed myself, this wouldn’t be a problem and i will never have to feel this disgusting shame and guilt again, and people will stop feeling the need to accommodate for me in every conversation because i just cant do things the way they can. suicide just feels so much easier and more convenient. i remember my ex told me i would be selfish to commit, but i feel that in some ways i would be doing good for others even if they were upset about it at first they would come to be grateful for it.

i used to think like this a lot back when i was a teenager, probably 15-16, and it was enough for me to get hospitalized for an attempt one time and a plan another time in which i was going to stab myself. im 18 now, i thought i had changed my way of thinking, i did feel better for awhile. my first year of uni was rough, i had a bad boyfriend and everything that happened between us kind of created this distance between my family and i, and i feel the distance is too much for us to ever really be close and get along again. i am visiting home right now, and i feel like my previous ways of thinking have come back in full. i dont want to go back to my apartment, i hate being alone and thinking about the things that i do, but i also hate being at home because i feel im always 1 bad joke or 1 poorly worded sentence away from being yelled at and hated again. i feel like im generally just disliked, it gets hard sometimes.

i miss being in the ward, i remember i couldnt feel anything at all in there. nothing stressed me out, nothing made me cry, i was just flat. most days my heart palpitates so hard from stress it hurts, and my emotions are a constant up and down. my life feels directionless, and my presence feels like a burden to whoever has to exist in the same space as it. maybe i am just looking for excuses for myself or a reason to give up, and maybe im just selfish. either way, this post is pointless sigh yap sesh we ball 🙈

tldr; life is hard and i feel i could make others easier if i just 💀 how do people live like this "
126,1,"Im only 13 years old and I want to jump off my balcony, ive tried so hard but i always fail, ive been in my room all this year and nothing is bringing me joy, ive been doomscolling cause I have no motivation to do anything even shower. Im gonna end this in 2 hours thanks for reading, bye"
127,1,"I  wake up tired i go through day tired I am always so fucking tired. I do nothing but rot in bed and still have no energy ever. I just feel empty,lonely, body pain and f*cking tired. 29 and feel like im 90... I f*cking hate life"
128,1,I have the very strong urge to crash my car I don’t know if it’s just me wanting to commit or if it’s the idea of finally getting attention. If I do end up doing this should I call 911 before I crash? I’ll crash somewhere alone so I don’t hurt others (also please don’t judge)
129,1,"I’ve been scrolling here just trying to feel less alone to know I’m not crazy for wanting to die. It helps to read that other people, on the other side of the world, feel exactly what I feel. It’s like, someone understands.

But honestl it’s heartbreaking 
So many stories, and almost all of them end with the same question:
“Why should we continue?”

It messes with my head to see people say, “I should’ve ended it a long time ago.” And it makes me wonder is that going to be me too? Will I still be here years from now, still hurting, still wishing I was dead? Like… maybe I really should stop lying to myself and just disappear.

It’s hard to believe there’s any hope when some people’s lives are just suffering suffering  death. That’s the full story. Nothing ever got better.

And I hate how much this all makes me angry, too.
I see people out there living with friends, jobs, opportunities, college, love.
And then there’s us the ones who are just trying not to kill ourselves. It’s unfair.
And no matter how much I try to tell myself I might get better someday, it just feels like I’m delaying something inevitable"
130,1,"I've been struggling with anger and depression for the past 6 months really bad. I've had depression since I was a teenager. It tapered off but came back with a vengeance around the holidays (I'm 33 now). 

At first, I lashed out at others and let slip I wanted to die to those that hurt me. Then I tried reaching out to friends and family asking for support. Everyone did the usual song and dance saying they cared and wanted to help. But it ended up all just being lip service.

I told my partner I wanted to die and her response was to go watch movies with her friend and leave me alone. I told my best friend I was struggling with suicidal thoughts and just needed a distraction and he's brushed me off every time I ask him to go out for drinks or spend an afternoon fishing. Ever since I was a kid my own mom has made no secret of what a burden and inconvenience I was to her.

I've stopped reaching out and just started planning. I went fishing (alone) on my birthday last Wednesday and found a quiet island in the middle of the river thick with brush. I could very easily wade over there, pop some pills and just...drift off. My partner wouldn't have to deal with the trauma of coming home and finding me. I'd just be missing. By the time someone found me anyone who might have cared will have processed what happened and moved on.

I'm currently in therapy. I'm trying to get better. But I'm just really tired of begging to be seen and heard and helped and being told I'm not worth the effort. Not with words, but with actions. If I'm this much of a burden to the people closest to me it'd be better for everyone if I just went away for good."
131,1,My partner left me and he isn't coming back. I'm in my early 30s and life didn't go the way I wanted it to. Not in the slightest. My past was decades of misery. I've tried reaching out for help and I've tried professionals but nothing helps. I want to end myself. I can't take it anymore. 
132,1,"TRIGGER WARNING: R word, SA, SH and S attempt 


I’m currently 20 and I can’t see myself living for long,i have been self harming for about 7 years I have been depressed for 8 years and for the last year and a half I’ve tried and wanted to end my life, just over a year ago I tried to end my life by slitting my wrist then 6 months ago I tried again, I was sexually assaulted last year and raped and assaulted again this month, I just want it all to end as I can’t see it getting better at all."
133,1,That would be just my lucky day
134,1,Do you foresee your eventual death by suicide when the pain just becomes unbearable?
135,1,I want to be dead tonight
136,1,"I really only feel suicidal ideation,but my depression just gets worse and worse and I’ve seked all the help I can, but my depression is practically incurable, I just need the courage to die, someone in my school killed themself on site a week ago, everyone was laughing and going wild about it and it made me realise just how little anyone would care if I died, in ideation I dream of people regretting what they did and being sad, but I know that nobody would care at all if I died, and I would be so much happier, but I’ll never get the courage I need"
137,1,"I want to do it again. Everything in my life has gone to shit. My mom is dying, my bf broke up with me over my attempt and our fighting, I have no job or career and can’t even get a single interview for a job. I am homeless since my bf and I broke up. I can’t pay my phone bill. I have two cats. "
138,1,"When I don’t get a reply from someone, or a message first from them, I start to question my worth. And sometimes, I think, should I have to question my worth? I always feel like someone’s second choice. I’m not someone’s priority, and that hurts. I constantly think, over and over, what have I done wrong. But deep down, I know I can’t have done anything wrong, right? I really feel like I’m not anyone’s first choice. There’s always someone else they would rather talk to. Somone, better than me. And I know it’s stupid to think this because what right do I have to ask someone to always talk to me!? I find it extremely hard to believe when someone tells me that I am their first choice or if they think about me all the time or if they care about me. I feel like they are lying to me because who would like me?

I have accepted that I am no one’s favourite person, it hurts, a lot but I have accepted that, or at least tried to accept it. I sometimes think, “am I that bad?”, “do I really deserve to feel like this?”, “do I deserve more?”. I’ve tried so hard, and I feel like no one appreciates me for it, it doesn’t matter how much effort I put into something, I always fail, I always make a mistake, I can never get it right. The worst is when someone tells me that I haven’t done enough, or it’s not good enough, that’s when it hurts because I am so broken that I can’t explain to them that I tried my hardest.

I’ve been feeling a lot of emotional pain lately, and it’s hard to understand exactly what’s going on. I guess I’ve been wanting recognition and validation from others, but it feels like no one is really seeing or appreciating me in the way I need. I feel like I’ve put so much effort into everything, trying to make a difference, but it just feels like it’s gone unnoticed. I feel so invisible, like I’m fading into the background, and it hurts because I’ve given so much of myself and haven’t gotten much in return. I don’t want to feel invisible anymore, I don’t want to feel ignored. I don’t want to feel forgotten and alone. I want to know that I matter, that people care about me. That people thought about me."
139,1,"Looking for non painful ways to end it, I really need to make it seem like an accident. I've thought about having myself run over but I don't want to ruin someone else's life either (I tried it once whilst really really drunk and I got nothing but a broken rib and burnt hands from sliding in the pavement)  
I also do not want to hurt my family by having them know it was intentional. I just want it to be over, I've sought help, I do not like it here anymore. 
Smoking doesn't do it fast enough... "
140,1,"Not gonna say what. But damn I feel like ending it. I got people to be here for though. But I'm really not mentally here right now. Any encouragement or kind words could help, man I've been crying all day. "
141,1,"its my birthday on the 8th of july. and i honestly cant be bothered to keep living, it'll be ten years now that i've wanted to kill myself. ten. whole. years. 

just hearing my family struggling to scrape up money just for presents for me, shitty old me. and i constantly feel like all i am is a burden.  
  
 i have autism which causes some really bad sensory issues that my family has to deal with, like i can't cook or clean or do most things im meant to because of my sensory issues. they're always doing things for me. i never do anything in return, i try though, i try to offer to do anything i can but they rarely need help and when they do i physically cant without almost crying or digging at my skin from how horrible it feels to feel the grease on a cooking tray or soap on the wet food on a plate when washing up.

im tired of being so ugly, fat, young, tired, sick and constantly feeling ashamed for people to even see my fucking existence.

i dont want to be told ""it'll get better"" or ""i understand you and im here for you"". i dont want that, i dont want to be consoled, i dont fucking deserve it."
142,1,"Been a tough week for the first time in years I had a dream where I tried to kill myself, I remember I failed in the dream. Was weird to wake up to. In the past when my mood was worse I had a few dreams about it so don't like having a dream like this again. I am mostly dealing with the thoughts when I am awake , I don't also want to deal with it when I am asleep "
143,1,"The good side of being old is that you can wait for death without feeling guilty for it. You’re so close to it anyway. 

That would be me if I were old. However, I’m still young, and I feel guilty for wanting to end my life so soon. But I’m pretty sure I’m dying from suicide, be it sooner or later. I just have to muster courage and have the means to finally wipe myself out of existence. "
144,1,"I love you, I'm sorry I can't do what I was asked for.

You were everything to me"
145,1,"My therapist told me im a pit that crshes joy
My doctor stopped my meds and fucked me over
My friends all abandoned me
I donet remember the last time i spoke to my family
I have no job and no reason to leave the house
I give up"
146,1,"I know its kinda stupid but i keep thinking what would happen with my cat if i kill myself, im scared she wont be treated right.
Im so pathetic my cat is my only reason to live.
I’ve been rotting in bed for months now and she’s the only one who kept me company and i feel bad because i wanna die but i don’t wanna leave her alone"
147,1,I don’t want to die completely. If I knew that what comes after was good I’d be more willing but that’s besides the point. My hateful homicidal thoughts are becoming so scary and I don’t want to hurt someone and idk. I’m scared that maybe it’s best that I end myself before others get hurt 
148,1,"I feel really bad. I’ve been sitting alone in my apartment for another day, and I feel like killing myself. I’m having paranoia again (maybe not), I feel like my loved ones are plotting behind my back, lying to me—I don’t know. I don’t feel understood by anyone, I only feel like no one truly cares about me. I can’t even have a bad day, right? I always have to be in a good mood for everyone else, is that it? Fuck this and everyone. I always try to be everything for everyone, but others treat me like shit—that’s how I fucking feel. I’m paranoid, I have anxiety, I stress every day about the smallest things. Because who’s really there for me? When I think now about hurting myself, there’s no one around. At night I can’t sleep, and during the day I’m a bundle of nerves. I don’t want to live like this—I really need help"
149,1,"Im very depressed. I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and I be to depressed to make food. But the funny part is im also to broke to buy food. So oh well I guess?? How do you guys deal with this ? Imma go back to sleep. I always sleep the days away on my days off from work. Most of my money goes towards bills and rent. 

I mean at least if I was dead I wouldn't have any bills to pay or be hungry 🙃 "
150,1,"I dont even know where to begin this ""cry for help""? Idk how to name it

i am just the typical weird teenager, my biggest obssesion is drums in hopes of one day being one of the greats.
My social circel isn't too big due to other kids being.. well.. popular teenagers with ego more then brain,i have about 5 close friends and about 6 friends/people that i talk to every few days. I got a crush who probebly thinks i am either a weirdo or a stalker because of past mistakes which didnt come from me.
A mom who loves me more then anything in this world and a dad, i dont really know what to say about him, i dont hate him nor love him, i like him sure but not in the same levels as my mom.

Recently, Ive been getting really depressed and i dont know why, i also have been questioning everything,hear a couple sides of the same story and not know which one to belive, who is my real friend and who isn't, and why being a part of this social circel comes with so many emotions.

I HATE being a part of this world yet, i also like it. 
A huge part of me wants to just end it all yet this little voice tells me to keep going, and the only reason i really listen to that voice is because i know that if ill end it all, my family/friends would be sad, and i dont want that to happen

Quite frankly i dont know why i am posting this, i dont expect it to even get replies, yet i still do it

Any help appreciated."
151,1,i only feel happy on it so i might aswell have the last moments of my life on it
152,1,"I don’t really know how to post so I apologize if this is a bad one. I recently turned 19m, not going to college, never had a job and no license. I’ve done nothing but stay at home for a year after high school and I’m deciding to make a change. I’ve been suicidal for a while, probably since I started high school back in 2020. I’m not asking for advice on what to do since I already know that. I need to make a change, get a drivers license, get a job, maybe go to college or Air Force and then get a life because I’ve never really had one. I know I need to do SOMETHING instead of NOTHING. 

I want to live but I don’t know if I’ll ever have a life worth living and the shame/guilt of being a leech my whole life makes me feel like suicide is what I deserve and my only way out. I just want to know whether or not I have a chance or if I’m more fucked than I think I am. Have you been/known someone like this who has been able to bounce back from it? Can you give general life advice? Is it over? 

"
153,1,"i'm 14 years old and I don't know why but often I feel empty as if a hole is opening in my chest, as if I have no more emotions, the world seems so slow and empty too it's depressing I feel like I have no more emotions, I can't recognize them well and differentiate them, often I want to disappear, and I even regret being born in the first place. Since a few days I can't stop thinking about suicide I don't know if I really want to but often I just want to shoot myself in the head, if one day someome stab me it wouldn't be that bad, like i wouldn't stab myself (even if i always think about that) but if someome stab me i wouldn't call ambulance, life is horrible what's the point? I'm sorry I feel this way really but I can't help it I often play video games or read to escape reality but despite this I still feel disconnected from my emotions and the world I feel like a spectator, I'm afraid of the future what if the world self-destructs? I often feel hopeless, I'm scared for our world, I cry almost every night, I don't know why, and also often I want to kill but I hold back because killing doesn't bother me, it just depends on the person but I don't like the consequences, and often I say I'm fine but it's automatic, I hate myself, I don't understand what people see in me, I'm so ordinary, I feel like I don't know myself and that no one really knows me, I don't really know what I'm like and it's hard to say all this out loud so I write, is there anyone who feels the same way? I speak mainly French so I did it with Google Translate, I need an answer please."
154,1,"If medically assisted suicide was possible in the US, I'd be first in line. I think about how much better off I would be dead all day long, but I'm too scared of fucking up my own suicide and becoming horribly disabled. I just want some relief from this never ending depression."
155,1,"I don't think I can function normally anymore... I'm severely burned out. I'm really really sick. I feel so alone stuck and lonely. Like literally tired. Emotionally, physically and mentally. I'm so tired idk how to explain it to anybody else...all I feel is bleak. 
So lost, have nothing in life.. absolutely nothing. "
156,1,"there’s a .22 rifle in my dad’s room that i haven’t been able to keep my mind off of. it’s intoxicating, thinking about how easily i could just be gone. i feel sick to my stomach"
157,1,"I want to die so bad, I genuinely don’t enjoy anything anymore, when I was a kid things used to bring me joy but as I got older things started to get worse, I can’t work due to not being able to drive, so I’m stuck at home doing nothing because nothing MAKES ME HAPPY, I have no energy at all and I just want to call it quits finally, my mom said if I kill myself she will as well, is that fair of her to say? That seems so fucked up? How is she allowed to say that when I didn’t choose to be born into this life that I don’t even want to live"
158,1,"Context: attempted once at 15. My parents reaction scared me and I resolved I would wait until they died. When my niece was born almost a year ago I started reevaluating the wait.

Just pretty bluntly told my psychiatrist I would  kill myself as soon as my parents weren't here anymore when she said I should prepare for my mom not being there (as I rely on her a lot). She went ""Ok, well, let's not rush anything"" and then ignored it. 

Should I change psychiatrists? I've been seeing this one off and on for 15 years now. Obviously not much improvement, and when I ask for alternative treatments like EMS or implants she just blanketly dismisses it. She also told my mom that I don't have depression (psych also sees my grandma, and my mom is her caretaker). That's fun! Then why the fuck did you give me Zoloft age 13-18? what are the anti depressants im taking now for. If its all bullshit then I might just as well buy tictacs

Every day is so difficult. Sometimes I feel like I hate my parents for keeping me here. I just want to rest, and breathe. I feel like I haven't been able to take a breath of fresh air in years, like my lungs just can't expand enough anymore. 

"
159,1,"i've been planning my death lately, but i get sad everytime i think about actually doing it, not existing and breathing in this planet.

I just can't stand living this life anymore, i've been sexually abused, gone through eating disorder, neglect, bullying, betrayal, violence, the list goes on, but nothing as painful as it is right now.
I'm aching, really realy bad, it's painful, i've been strong but i just can't take it anymore.

It's worse since i started taking birth control.
I never thought depression could be this fucked up, 

i'm so convinced to kill myself, this is such an awful disease, it's never been so strong, so incapacitating, so shameful, so so painful. I actually wanna go to the hospital, just for someone to help me and look after me.

I don't recognize myself."
160,1,Im the most happy during summer break. So im thinking about enjoying one more summer and then kms. I want it to be quick and painless so i still need to make a plan but i have the whole summer to come up with it so!

161,1,"I can’t stand myself anymore.Years of treatment,medication,none of this works for me.I always thought I was seeing myself as the crappiest,lamest,most socially unable person ever because of depression.I thought depression had caused me to think like that.But no,I have years of severe depression because I am actually the lames,crappiest person ever.And deep down I was always aware of it so this awareness caused the depression.There is no other possibility,I didn’t had any trauma,I always got love from family,I am pretty alright looking but I am the lamest person ever.No fucking skills,nothing to talk,I can’t even manage my speech properly.I am afraid to say good morning to a girl,or boy,and I am not a freaking teenager,I am a uni student and I still can’t fucking function properly.I can’t function at all.I am gonna be a senior next year,forget friends,I still don’t have any acquintances,at all,this is fucking embarrasing.I have no professional skills either.I am gonna graduate next summer as a fucking lame guy with a brain age of 5.As a human,I don’t want a human like me to exist.But I am too much of a coward to end it all and make the world a fucking favor.

Sorry for this long rant.I am just too angry to myself,and I have nothing or nowhere to leash my anger."
162,1,"I don't know. Every day feels the same, feeling like I haven't accomplished anything, feeling isolated and unloved. I really wish my life had turned out differently. Why should I stay alive?

163,1,"they don’t deserve to be related to someone to awful. someone with such a fucked up mind that refuses to get better and kill themselves already, someone who isn’t safe to be attached to, someone angry, someone so desperate, unseemly, helpless, repulsive, disgusting, revolting, helpless helpless helpless. it’s so awful I haven’t killed myself yet but I can at least do it now. maybe they could enjoy ripping my eyeballs out of my corpse. it’s so awful having a younger sibling who’s been suicidal and depressed and possibly schizophrenic for 5 years who cries so loudly at night, right? I do everything wrong. and make people waste their precious air by speaking to me. they shouldn’t have to worry about me. my family would be so perfect if it wasn’t for me. no one but me puts up issues. no one but me dropped out of school. no one but me is so sad, all the time. everyone but me is just so so similar, not really the same but so happy, so smart, so capable, so so smart, so caring, so kind, so human, so nice, but not even fake nice or pretending to be perfect, they don’t literally always do everything perfect. but only i have such horrible thoughts, about hurting people, hurting myself, killing myself, thinking I’m the worst person in the world and that every time I take the energy to breathe it’s a blasphemy against god. So so fucking worthless I’m still typing this and not getting on with it already. I still feel like I’m always just waiting for them to talk to me, to care, of course they don’t nobody could care about me but everyone says siblings are supposed to care about each other and it’s not like they hurt me, they aren’t mean to me they just never speak to me and I miss them so much, but I feel bad for missing them cuz they’re so nice and smart and kind and intelligent and I would just ruin they’re life if I actually told them all the things I want to, I want to be able to hug them when crying, I want to speak about how worthless I feel and have them care, I wanna tell them how I think I should die to make their life better so they wouldn’t have to care for me snd I wanna hear them say it’s not true but I can’t, my mouth won’t work. I can‘t speak to anyone, especially not the only person that still has a slight chance of caring about me, what on earth am I supposed to do? I just want a loving relationship between siblings. but I ruined it, I ruin everything, I can’t be normal and depressed. I can’t have some self esteem issues, I have to think I’m the worst thing to ever happen. and I just want them to care. everyone else has left me, and they haven’t exactly “left” me but I feel like one of us is a ghost. we never really see each other. we can never really talk. we can’t even talk about simple things. maybe they just don’t wanna talk to me, of course they don’t that‘s the whole point. If I killed myself then all of this would be over, all of this painful waiting and ruminating and wishing, and thinking without action. All of it, over…"
164,1,"Probably not. Life just gets lonelier as life goes on. I don’t even thing about reaching out to anyone anymore. Even if I reach out to the hotline they would refer me to another number and when I reach out to that number I was put on hold three times. I almost felt like it wasn’t worth it. 

I don’t know why I’m still here. "
165,1,"It never got better for me, I remember believing it so much as a kid that I would finally have friends, people would notice me and I would be less shy. I believed that all through high school. I’m an adult now it’s gotten worse, my mom keeps telling me it’s gotten better and not to think that way, but I’m still in the same place I was as a kid a loser :). I have a job, I contribute to society. I wake up wanting to kill myself and I think about it everyday. My room is a mess and I’m not going to clean up, I literally stay in my bed all day unless I have to work. I don’t know the world is not giving me reasons to live or continue to try and connect with people. Ah to be lonely forever. "

167,1,"i genuinely don't want to be here anymore. I don't remember ever wanting to be here. Ever since I was like a preteen I was just harming myself excessively and planning acts of suicide in my head. i never talk to people about anything nor ever give the impression that i need help to the people around me. my body under my clothes is destroyed with scar tissue from over a decade of mutilating myself. i didn't think i'd even get to 16, 18, 20, etc. now i'm 27. i feel like it's never going to end. i can't find comfort in a religion. i only that has ever kept me from ending my life is that i don't want to ruin my sisters and dads. now my sister has kids and i have even more attachments that i love to death but also enable my suffering because they tether me to this earth without even knowing it. i'm always alone and i have nothing but negative emotions and a deep hatred for myself. i just work, come home, and watch yt and go back the next day. i have nothing going for me. i've always done nothing but breathe for everyone else and all i want to do rn is blow my fucking skull back. unfortunately i can't, but i can atleast harm myself more in the meantime. i need help but i don't think there is any for me"

169,1,"I’ve spoken about this before but it was mainly regarding the logistics and what I could do about the situation rather how to emotionally deal with this. 

I just turned 17 last month and feel like my life is over, this is it. Even now I feel it’s a bit silly considering 17 is barely anything but I’m also in the 8th grade, going into 9th. I really wish that was a typo or some joke but it’s really not, I will be 18 before stepping foot in high school and it’s all because during the three years of quarantine I didn’t attend online school.

And now I’m failing at something I don’t even have the choice in participating. It’s humiliating to even have mediocre grades, I feel stuck because I am, none of my friends are my age and all of them say I fit right in, how they often forget I’m not their age and how I look incredibly young. Worst of all is that more than anybody else I am aware of that. I’m 17 and mentally still feel 14. I’m supposed to be sneaking out, learning to drive, crashing cars, drinking and dating, not asking my parents if I can hang out at the mall with my friends that aren’t even allowed out the house without a parent accompanying them because they’re 14 years old. 

I’ve checked anything and everything I can and according to every single adult I’ve spoken to apparently the law just won’t allow me to skip grades, I’m just fucked until after college, if I make it to then I’ll be 19 entering high school and around 22 entering college when most people my age are deciding what college they should go into. A few years ago I was so terrified that I’ll just be so behind and now that I am I just find it funny, it’s exactly how I imagined things to turn out. 

There’s so many other things going on but in short it’s not exactly possible for me to make friends my age as there’s no place for me to go for that, I’m just by myself. At this point suicide just feels inevitable, I’m giving myself until I’m 25 to see if anything changes. I hope to god it does. I’m not sure if this even sounds real but really, if you were in my position what would you do? "
170,1,"I KNOW the entities in my head are trying to take me over and control me completely. I have bouts of insanity because of them
 Uncconftrailbbly rage. They make me not able to speak or

171,1,"These past few days have been quite tough. I've decided to write here as a last resort because I know I'm not thinking logically and that all of this is due to the emotions I'm feeling because of my circumstances. However, I really need to get this off my chest and read other points of view.

A few days ago, my girlfriend broke up with me. It was quite a complicated relationship, but we loved each other very much and still do. She was my biggest support, and well, she's still my favorite person. So this whole breakup has somewhat skewed my self-perception, and I believe that's something that will eventually change.

Even though the breakup was difficult, thanks to my friends and therapy, I've managed to more or less cope with things. After all, no breakup is easy, and it's necessary to go through a tough time. But since then, several events have occurred, which are the reason I'm writing this.

A while ago, I had problems with my apartment and had to leave my cat, who has been with me every day for the past four years. Not having her here with me makes me cry constantly. She's the only thing that matters to me right now, and I'm glad she's doing well where she is (I've left her at a friend's house until I can move apartments, and she's very happy there). But not being able to hug and pet her makes me feel more alone than ever.

On top of that, I was evicted from my apartment today, and I feel more hopeless than ever. To make matters worse, it's likely I'll be fired from my job tomorrow, and honestly, I don't feel capable of facing that. It's so much to deal with. I don't have anyone who can support or help me right now, and everything looks very bleak.

This is the first time I've genuinely considered the option of suicide, but despite that, I'd like not to think this way and to see things from another perspective. I know suicide is far from the best option, but the thought that if I weren't in this world, I wouldn't have to face these situations makes it a very comfortable and appealing option.

Thanks for reading <3

I’m so scared talking to people my age and making genuine connections.

I’ve always really liked her and have gotten rejected a couple times throughout the years but now every once in a while she gives me hope that something’s happen ring. I was at her house the other day and she leaned on me, and lay with my arm around her in bed. I had my hand on the inside of her thigh and we were just chilling watching stuff on her phone. Now 2 days later, I go out with her and she says I can’t come to her house, and then like half an hour later she says she’s tired and wants to leave and take a nap. Idk if I’m crazy or what but I just need to know why. Anyways, thinking about it, it’s likely she will never be with me. The thing is if I’m in another relationship, no matter how much I love another girl, if she calls out of the blue and shows interest, I will leave the new girl in a heartbeat. So what’s the point. I stick around for fake relationships or to continuously try to be with a girl who will never reciprocate the love I show for her? Idk man. I might just call it a life and go. "

One of them has a breakdown when things are out of place. The other tells the most obvious lies. Like her boyfriend who was supposed to come over for the last 3 months and somehow is always hindered by work. 


It's like back with my mom. I feel myself regressing. I've worked hard on not being suicidal anymore, after years of daily suicidality, and then for the last years, barely anything. But now... Emotionally, I'm back at my teen years. Death feels like a friend, like love... Gentle, caring, accepting of me fully. It will dissolve my self and not reject any part of me. 

I want to go... "
184,1,"I'm not going to attempt suicide but I think about the hypotheical situation where I do and somebody saves me, most likely my parents since I still live with them. I think about that happening and I would me so angry. I get angry when I think about it. Not even just a suicide attempt either, if I die from anything I don't want them saving me. 

  
I think about me waking up the a hospital bed and the first thing I say to them would be ""I hate you."" and I would remind them every day, every time they talk to me I would tell them how much I hate them for forcing me to live. I think I'd even want to attack them and I'd have to try hard not to. 

I know you're thinking I'm crazy and ""they're your parents of course they wouldn't let you die"" 

There are people who think suicide is selfish but I think it's more selfish to force somebody to live when they're suffering. You don't even know if things will get better. My parents just want me alive because they have birth to me so of course they do it's biological but if they really love me then why do they let me suffer? When I have cried for help multiple times when I was younger and they brush it off not getting me the mental help I need. 

  
I don't know maybe I'm in the wrong but I don't care, if they saved me from an attempt or dying in general I would be so angry and I would hate my parents completely. I would make sure they know it too. "

i went to a graduation party today,  and i couldn't eat the food because it was pork.   and i can't eat pork since it's easy for demons to poison (theyve tried it before).  im so scared of going to the doctors because theyre working with demons to kidnap me, but i got stabbed with a rusty thumbtack the other day so i need to get a tetenus shot,  but i can't just go to any place since i need to not have them know I'm going.  updated:  i actually did go, i didn't have the money for the shot, literally going to die because i don't have 60 dollars

i just wanna give up on life and this feels like the easiest way to die.   yes it will suck while i die, but im too scared to kill myself, but now I'm too scared to save myself.   I'm so pathetic I'm alive beczuse i did nothing and i might die because I'm too scared to do anything.  i sit there and lie to myself about not going because ""i dont have money""  but im really just scared,  i can easily get enough money by letting my dad fuck me (he's rich).

i hate my life so much, i don't do anything, i stopped going to therapy, i stopped going to a psych, i just sit there doing nothing, all because I'm scared.   every day at work i need to go to the bathroom and check to make sure my body parts are still mine and haven't been possessed/ replaced.  I'm probably going to get fired because of how long i take.   i force myself to throw up whenever something unexpectedly goes into my mouth.   i won't eat food if it doesn't taste exactly like i expect. I'll slice myself open if i feel a prick to make sure i wasnt stabbed with a needle going into me

i don't deserve to be alive and i cause my boyfriend too many issues.   i feel so bad, i blank out whenever we do anything sexual.   I'm so useless i can't even be a sex doll for the man i love

i just want it to end,  my life was over the first time he used me to get off, i haven't had a life since i was 4.  i hate myself, i hate that i was too scared to end it or get help. and now it feels too late to get any help "
195,1,I think im gonna kill myself soon. What should i put in my note? 
196,1,"I'm having bad memories from the mental hospital that I was inside in the past. They took me in without my consent. In the initial holding room, they gave me an injection, and I responded to the injection by pacing back-and-forth in my holding room and shouting stuff like ""ALIEN ATTACK!!!"", ""ILLEGAL ALIENS!!!"", ""TERRORIST ATTACK!!!"", ""WAR ON TERROR!!!"", ""WAR ON DRUGS!!!"", ""ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE!!!"", ""AI ATTACK!!!"", ""AI ALIEN ATTACK!!!"", ""DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE!!!"", ""DEFENCE AGAINST AI ATTACK!!!"", ""WAR ON AI!!!"", etc. A lot of it was bullshit ranting as a means of self-defense. 

I remember after shouting all that stuff I collapsed and thought how evil the government is for persecuting me (and others) like this. Before I was taken into the mental hospital, I remember seeing news of government aliens on Fox and other right-wing news sources. The first right-wing news source I saw talking about government aliens was One America News, a far-right news channel. When I first saw the news anchor on One America News report the government aliens, the news anchor let out a little laugh before reporting. I didn't believe him. It appeared to me that everyone (including all the news anchors) were lying. I remember checking the official Telegram channel of the CIA and it saying, in Russian, that if you want truth, you should flee Russia and come to the USA. How odd, how the USA was experiencing this apparently Russian phenomenon. 

I don't remember all the details. I just remembered being in the local mental hospital and thinking that I was going to die of thirst. When I drank the water, I ended up peeing as much as I drank. I checked the water in the toilet bowl inside my mental hospital room, and it was as bad as the regular, non-toilet bowl water. I was lucky to get a cup of drinkable water with food, but when I hid that water away in my room, it got thrown out. I was so, so thirsty. 

When I first got out of the holding room, I remember thinking that they were going to keep me for three days as proof of the the death and resurrection of Jesus thee days later, because before I was taken in I made some sort of claim about being the second coming of Christ. They didn't actually keep me that long. I tasted my urine and it didn't taste drinkable, so I didn't drink it. 

It's a scary, traumatic memory. I was being persecuted mysteriously and the news was lying to me (in a right-wing way), so I figured there was some sort of right-wing conspiracy so I shifted right politically. I went further right politically than I ever had before. 

I don't fully understand what happened, just that it was scary. Something kind of similar seems to have been happening lately, but it's also kind of different. Before, the official Telegram channel of the CIA was saying, in Russian, that if you want truth, you should flee Russia and come to the USA. Lately, instead, the official Telegram channel of the CIA has been saying, in Chinese, that if you want to get out of an involuted, convoluted, self-serving system that only benefits insiders and your boss, you should flee China and come to the USA. Also I had a mental hospital stay recently that was kind of like that traumatic one, but I handled it much better by sniffing everything and mixing in a little of my pee, and also my genes 🧬 may have been somehow changed to allow me to handle the experience better, like I had different automatic responses and reflexes. 

It was rough. Now I'm kinda in a state of bipolar depression and I feel so hopeless and powerless. Like there is nothing I can do. I spent so, so many years trying to get a real wife, a fiancée, or at least a real, official girlfriend, and being unsuccessful. I feel like it wouldn't even matter if I just randomly dropped dead. 

I have demonstrated no real success at anything. Not in school grades, school academics as determined by teachers. Not in real computer programming work, which was my job. Not in dating, which was my #1 priority. I have demonstrated no real success at anything."
197,1,I should probably write in a journal but I know it won't change anything.  I have a lot going for me but I've also been through so much and its like a cancer.  I lost my girlfriend and I still don't know if it was me or her I know it was probably both but at the same time I don't know.  I guess part of me hopes she will come back and apologize and realize she was having an episode but the other part of me wants better.  The problem is what is better?  My whole life has been brainwashed and I don't know what isn't brainwashed at this point.  I wanna meet people but I've always been a problem and I lost the only person I have left so it only reinforces that.  I have things to live for but I see the trajectory of society and I don't see the point.  I'm miserable everyday and last night was the first high I had in so long but it's gone today.  I want love and maybe I should learn to love myself but it's not like I don't either.  I feel so alone and yet I sit at home alone because I have no idea how to interact without anxiety.  I don't know how much it would change anything though because at the end of the day I'm coming home to an empty place and in a couple months I'll be traveling...  Alone now that she's gone...  I know it could be great but I am so tired of trying and feeling like the world is gonna end at any moment.  I don't know how much longer Ill go I've looked at and even held my pistol.  I guess I just don't wanna leave a mess for someone to clean up...

200,1,"I'll start by saying that I intended to talk about it in another subreddit, but I'm already infamous there for wanting to take my own life, many of them are also my friends and I don't want to make them worry. 

Context: on Saturday evening my best friend and I were playing table football, when in a hypomanic moment (I probably have bipolar disorder, but it's not certain) I proposed that the loser should recite ""Trallallero Trallallà"", swearing included. When I placed the bet I was in an advantageous position, and I hadn't considered the possibility of losing. Furthermore, my friend has no problem swearing, and in fact he had already done so that evening. During the match I entered one of my periods of depression, the match took an unexpected turn and I lost: therefore I found myself having to swear, an act which I consider very serious for religious reasons (I am Catholic). As soon as I said them I immediately felt a very strong sense of guilt. The awareness of the act became unbearable: in fact, I feel guilty not only for having blasphemed, but also for having created the condition for this to happen. 

I don't deserve to exist for the unforgivable and irreparable act I committed, I think I will end my life tonight. "
201,1,I'm graduating soon and I don't feel like there's anything to look forward to. The degree I chose has record high unemployment and it would take another year to switch to something else. I feel like I've been living life on autopilot as I didn't think about how worthless my education was until now. I feel like I failed myself and my parents. I can't stop thinking about how I'd be better off dead. It's stupid too because it's not that much more time to switch. I just can't cope with the fact I'm falling behind my peers. I sacrificed so much to get this degree only to end up a complete fucking failure. I'm slowly trying to push people away so that when I hang myself no one will care.
202,1,"I've only ever been impulsively suicidal, as in feeling overwhelmed and slitting my wrists in the moment or taking pills. But these methods aren't very reliable. I'd like to slit my throat but I think the furthest I could go is my external jugular veins, which isn't likely enough. I don't think I'm brave enough to crash my car into a tree, and there's a high risk I'll become disabled and not die.

I found a gun for only $140 including shipping, but it would take 14 days to get to the pickup location. I've never planned my suicide before, I'm not sure if I'll be able to go through with it if I'm not overwhelmed with emotions. 

I really want to die though, I've been suicidal since I was a teenager and I don't see my life getting any better. I have BPD and I've always suspected my boyfriend was a psychopath, but I recently found out some things that confirms it. I'm sure you can imagine how unstable our relationship is.  I'm 27 but I can't function like a normal adult, I can't be on my own and I'm done trying to be happy in a relationship. I'm just not meant to be happy. I can hardly drive and I can't hold down a job. I'm screwed and just want it to end. And on top of all that I'm pregnant, which I really wanted, but I was delusional thinking I could ever have a normal life."

204,1,"I was at the doctor yesterday to do a wellness check. My main goal was to try medication again as I have been extremely suicidal lately and I'll do or try literally anything to make the pain stop. But my doctor immediately shut down my idea and downplayed my problems like she always fucking does, and of course my mom goes along with it.
So either I get a new doctor and go through all the bullshit again of explaining my life story just to get no help, or I keep going with this lady who seems to only want me to suffer. The only way out I can see is if medically transitioning (I'm ftm and 17) magically removes my crippling anxiety, self hatred and depression which make life impossible. 

I also told her about how I can't get a job and I can barely even make it to my volunteer work at an animal shelter because I hate being around people and I hate myself. She laughed. She literally fucking laughed and asked me ""if you had to fend for yourself right now, where would you work then?"" I had no answer, at least not a verbal one. In my head I was saying that I'd rather kill myself than get a job, and I know that is embarrassing. Because I would. But I can't even say it because no one, especially not this doctor will believe me or take me seriously. 

Every day I get reminded that my feelings and my struggles don't matter to anyone. I will keep losing and losing and losing as I watch everyone else win."
205,1,"Been suffering 24/7 for over 2 years straight now. There's no relief from the suffocation. I can't breathe. Death is better than existence. Every night I pray to either wake up miraculously cured or to just die in my sleep already because I can't stand trying to get out of bed anymore or being awake just to be in constant severe pain to the point I can hardly move or talk. 

Obviously this has led to me getting dependent on drugs to cope. Downers like benzos and soma to try taking away some of the anxiety and pain and impending doom knowing I only can expect to live another year or two if I'm lucky and that it's only gonna keep getting worse than it already is. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet even though I have the means on hand to do it right now if I wanted, is because I have a little daughter, who my parents had to adopt because I can't even do basic life tasks now let alone parent my child, and it breaks my heart knowing she's going to ask every day where I went. But that's going to happen soon enough anyways so it's hard to convince myself it'd be better to wait rather than have it happen while she's as young as possible, so she still has a chance to forget about me. 

I went to detox for a week and found out the doctors accidentally fucked up my lung disease and heart medications the entire time I was there, almost killed me, made things so much worse. Every doctor I've seen seems to make my suffering and disease worse. They never help a thing. What helped me there was making a friend. I isolate myself completely and have this entire time. I only ever came out of my room just so I could go talk to that person. But he left without saying goodbye and I didn't even try to get his number or anything. I wish I had at least asked. But it's not like anyone would want to be friends with me anyways. I'm completely disabled, can't do anything, and I'm ugly now, I look like a monster from all the steroids and chemos. It makes me sad. I know that friend from detox left and moved on with his life and already forgot about me. But I'm so lonely and isolated that I'll remember one person being nice to me for a few days and cry about it until the day my heart finally stops"
206,1,"I'm not gonna make it, as simple as that. I was not designed to survive. 

I have terrible social skills due to a combination of verbal ""abuse"" during childhood, ostracization not from my peers but the adults around me, and being raised on the internet. I'm the loser who would rather starve than order food, the most I can do is enter a shop/store. 

I have not received a sufficient education for arguably my entire life, but 'legally' the past 2, going on 3 years. I was removed from highschool at roughly 12 years old and I am now 15. I would call myself a retard but that would be genuinely insulting to people with learning disabilities, which I do not have. Any hope of me getting a job is more akin to a fairytale than an actual possibility. I will rot and die on the streets.

From around 7 years old my desire to live began to dwindle. By 11 I was ready to die, and that ""ready to die"" very hastily morphed into ready to kill myself. I have next to zero faith that I will live* past 18. The only thing that is keeping me alive besides my cowardliness, concern for my family and no immediate means of death is Sonic the Hedgehog. I scarcely enjoy certain things here and there, but realistically the only thing keeping my feet on the ground is a cartoon animal."

Now I just wanna disappear. Leave all this crap behind.

209,1,"Hi everyone - it's me again. It's been a long time. 30.

Sorry if this is too long:

I'm really struggling to carry everything, you know? The weight is just too much. I don't want to die, but I can't live like this anymore. 

My disease is getting worse and they are no closer to a diagnosis than they were 3 years ago. I waited months for a hospital stay that was supposed to be a full-spectrum work up to figure out my mystery diagnosis and 8 of my 9 physicians gave up within the first 2 days of the 5 day stay (supposed to be 10 days). The 9th doc didn't find anything.

I blacked out while walking to my office due to a pain flare and ended up in the hospital where they left me in a dark room where I went in and out of consciousness for hours, then discharged me home without a plan. This flare lasted 4 days.

My grandfather died last week and it wrecked me.

My partner said I was bad for him (has anxiety/ptsd) because I needed his for support in dealing with the above hospital things. I just needed him to hold me and tell me it was all going to be okay... I honestly think I started losing him months ago and just didn't want to admit it. So, of course I had to break up with the love of my life because he wouldn't break up with me. I really feel selfish for being in a relationship due to my poor health.

This week I sh'ed for the first time in 13 years.

Yesterday, my job that was once super understanding of my medical condition and frequent doctors appointments refused ADA accommodations prescribed by my doctor, and said I have to find a new job or I'll be terminated. I have no time off outside of doctors appointments. I haven't been able to take vacation in years. I've missed weddings, graduations, birthdays, funerals, etc. because I can't get time off. How can I possibly interview for a new position if I have no time off? Can I even get a new job?

There are just so many things piling up and it takes so much energy to pretend my body isn't screaming at me 24/7 and to put on a smile and make sure it reaches my eyes so no one gets suspicious, and try not to limp so much, and try not to complain.

I can't live this way, but there is nothing I can do right now to make any of it better.

Hospice has approved me and said I could start at any time. I don't think I can wait 6 months to leave though.

So, I want to end whatever the hell this is. I don't have a plan, but I know the medications and doses for assisted death and sometimes I just stare at the information.

  
Sorry this is so long. xx"
210,1,I am really considering taking my own life. I’m so tired. Idk how I would do it quick and easy
211,1,"i tied the noose up on my window and set a nice pillow so i can kneel on, im gonna do it leaning over my bed... the place ive spent most of my time in the last few months... i got out of the psych ward in february which i decided to go on my own accord and ever since ive left it seems suicidal ideation got even worse.. i dont know how that's possible since the time i spent there was quite nice.. i tried going back to uni but i have no will left to live. i think im doing it today but idk. i think this is my goodbye "
212,1,"I’m 29 now I’m a female I think I had my first suicidal thoughts in elementary school ever since then I always struggled to find my way to normality,  I do a pretty good job at it, but I lived through some trauma 
Schizophrenic parent , narcissistic grandparent, always on the chubbier side due to stress and overeating but normal enough for people to tell me I’m crazy to hate myself this much, (yet i cant find a date to save my life) 
I had a very abusive ex-boyfriend who tried to murder me (forced relationship) and I tried to raise above all and find a job that I like -get some education do my best, I recently ended my first ever basically (seven year) relationship,  he is an avoidant and didn’t really care for me for a long time didn’t even get me a birthday gift last year- so this year I gathered all my strength, and I broke up in hopes I will find my people
I have lots of responsibilities, and I’m lonely most of the time because I didn’t make much time to stay connected to friends or life while trying to work through that trauma - I end up being left on read a lot lately
my trauma seems to crawl up, these thoughts of not belonging in the world, even though I try so hard to, the fear of no men ever looking at me beautifully when I try so hard to be beautiful, smart and kind 
I feel like a lazy slob most of the time and a horrible human being - I’ve always thought too much 
In fact, I think this post is basically fishing for compliments, but at this point I wish I had just anybody rooting 
If anybody has any kind words, I would be very appreciative of them "
213,1,Wrong question ik
214,1,"every fcking time i think hey lets start getting my sht straight positive thoughts lets stop getting unnecessarily angry and acting like the piece of shit my mom married they give me reasons to kms like holy shit u guys seriously wont get it unless kill myself i really want them to regret being such assholes but knowing them they probabaly wont and paint me as a mentally ill bitch who wasnt religious enough to be saved by god theyll just go back to their daily business like the narcissistic fuck he is, i hate myself and the people LIKE HIM around me im acting like him which makes sht easier. im glad there somewhere i can just raw present my fuckass thoughts cuz no one cares irl i don't expect them to either "
215,1,I'm sooo depressed and sad And lonely is there no one to talk to and be friends? 
216,1,"My therapist just gave up on me. I want to end it so fucking bad I just don’t have the courage. I hate my life. I hate everything. Everything I worked for has been taken. Turns out you don’t succeed by working hard, you only succeed by kissing ass. "
217,1,"Fine. Fucking fine. I get it. I hurt people. I don't know how to love. I don't know how love feels like. But I still feel like dying when I cut someone off that im attached to.
Fine. I'm stupid and have no self worth until someone tells me I do have self worth but even then I don't believe it.
Fine. I have no motivation unless someone loves me and cares about me.
Fine. I'm a nobody when I'm not around people and make my personality fit around those people.
Fine. I'm easily depressed, dumb, not a good person and just exhausting.
Fine. I hurt and exhausted the only person that truly cared and loved me.

Fine. I'll end it someday, because I know for a fact I'll never know what self worth feels like.

Fine.
"
218,1,"I've always been suicidal, but not really self loathing. I've been straight spiraling for a few weeks here. This is the longest amount of time I've been consistently suicidal in my entire life and this time I cannot shake the feeling like I'm a stupid piece of shit who should just die already. 

I broke things off with the dude I was seeing in kind of a horrible way, and then I sent this really long apology like it even matters, not like I have ever fucked someone who actually cares about me. 

My whole life has been like this. I don't have friends. I don't really have family because my mom is in a cult and cut me off from them at a young age (27 now). I'll make a few connections, burn the fuck out, spiral out of control for awhile, cutting them off somewhere in the process --- rinse, repeat. 

I'm not meant to be around other people. I'm just completely useless. I made excuses for myself for a really long time. ""Oh, you know, your life is hard, you can't blame yourself,"" ""you grew up super isolated, you'll get the handle of this eventually"", ""things will get better.""

No, no, no. Things never get better, EVER. 

And here's the kicker -- I don't want people in my life. I'm autistic and don't have any freaking energy for anything. Just completely burnt out and hopeless. I want connection,  but also just want to bed rot all day. 

😭 Why do I have to deal with this? I didn't ask to be born. I know that's a cliche. But, like, it's true. I was birthed without my consent and then everyone is mad at me for not wanting to be here 😭😭 

And God forbid you actually decide to tell someone you're suicidal, guess what nobody fucking wants to deal with it. Not even here, if we're all being honest with ourselves. 

And fucking GOD FORBID that you're a reasonably attractive woman in autistic circles. Can't complain about being lonely because ""it's easy for you."" It's not easy. I can't even process the fact that I am inside the body I see in the mirror, like fuck off. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I LITERALLY cannot maintain relationship. 

I'm so miserable. God. This is the end of my 60 millionth suicidal rant that will get like 5 upvotes before I take it down. I'll talk myself off the ledge again (hopefully). Rinse, repeat......fuck. "
219,1,"for context im 18, doing my a levels in the uk and ive have dreams to do medicine, but exams haven't been going to plan and I dont know what I'd do to myself if i didn't get get the grades"
220,1,"I don't really know myself. I don't know how to think or what to believe. I find myself agreeing with things the masses tell me not to agree with but i don't know why i shouldn't. I feel torn between following what others want me to follow and following my own ideals. I don't feel happy either way. I don't want to be the bad guy but i don't know what the good guy is. Everything i feel i have been taught and brought up to believe is a lie. i feel like the world i grew up with and already hated is being torn down and being built with one i hate even more. I wish we could all get along and sing Kumbaya by the fire but no one wants too. There is no forgiveness and there is no forgetting, only constant conflict and skirmishes about useless ideologies that don't matter in the slightest since we'll all be dead. none of this matters, the world doesn't matter and no one's life matters. 

We'll all die and leaving the world better for the next generation is also futile as they'll die too and so on and so forth. The only point in life is to suffer through it long enough to finally die and be freed from this existence of turmoil and loss.  I've tried forcing myself to believe in what others want me too but my mind aches and my body physically hurts trying to warp myself into the perfect little pawn for everyone. I want to serve the common good but don't know what it is. i try to please everyone i meet but its getting exhausting. I just want to die. i want to fall asleep and never wake up and be freed from this never ending miasma of conflict."
221,1,"So many people on here posting around the same time I am, makes me feel less alone somehow, but I’m not sure that’ll stop me I guess I’m on here as a last resort, maybe someone will say the right thing.
 I don’t want to die, not really, but I think I’m out of options"
222,1,"I'm tired
I'm desperate to get rid of myself 
I'm giving up on life "
223,1,ive been underemployed close to a year. ive had some traumatic experiences this past year and i cant feel anything but an overwhelming desire to end it all but i cant seem to go through with it. folx who tried but didnt succeed what was your final straw? i would really like to get off the fence and just end it
224,1,"I’ve barely studied for my finals. Tomorrow is my last exam. All I know is I’m not going to make it to the next stage. Goodbye future.

I just want to poison myself and let it all be over. I hate having expectations and responsibilities. Everything is too much. You can never live in this life. As a child you’re bound to your parents. As an adult you’re bound to society. It’s fucking horrible."
225,1,"I just want him to feel the pain, the heartache I'm going through. How can he simply ignore and not bother? He eats, sleeps, goes on as if nothing happened while I rot from within. After 20 plus years. I've got no one to turn to. No where to go. I want the pain to stop now. I can't take it."
226,1,So a while back my family friend / uncle I to his house to work like I normally do and he asked me to help him move some stuff we went into the room he grabbed me pinned me down and done things to me I am getting ptsd every second now everytime someone touches me I wanna die and kms
227,1,"I'm 14 as of writing this and I've had suicidal idealizations for the past three years and the only thing that helped me was cutting but my parents took that away from me and nothing else helps and now I'm isolating myself more and see no reason for me to stay alive. I understand my parents care about me otherwise they wouldn't have taken it away from me but both of my sisters are leaving home, so I'll be even lonelier. As well as that all I do is argue with my mum and dad, so I try my best to avoid talking to them and I hate school and try my best to keep silent except when I need to talk, so it's not really like anyone will miss me. I just wanted to tell someone before I finally did it, goodbye."
228,1,"yeah

theres no point in living if theyre not with me anymore, they were the only reason i made it so long in the first place"
229,1,"I genuinely don't know how much longer I can keep this up. I'm at the end of my rope and I don't know how to be better. The only reason I'm alive now is so others aren't sad but that reason is starting to not be good enough anymore. I'm running out of reasons to keep waking up, I'm so fucking tired bro. I can feel it, I'm going to lose this war eventually, but is that really such a bad thing? "
230,1,"There has to be something fundamentally wrong with me. I have always tried too hard and loved too much and it pushes people away.. so if that’s not enough or that’s too much then I can never be enough. There’s nothing I can do that’s the bottom line that I keep coming back to. There’s nothing I can do about anything because in the end there is something fundamentally wrong with me. My family my friends my exes and my boyfriend there’s always a fucking caveat to being around people that I love and there’s a problem with me. I just can’t figure it out I’ve tried for so many fucking years im 22 now and I can’t keep doing this. I keep trying to be a different person that I don’t know who in am because every version of myself hasn’t felt like me.. I don’t know what I am anymore.. what’s the point anymore, changing myself to care for so many people and being met with betrayal or resentment.. maybe that’s it maybe I’m completely transparent and everyone can see through my lies of personhood but can’t they see I’m doing that for them.

My conclusion is that I will and always have been a wrong person, a mistake in peoples lives, a burden, someone people put up with and I think I’m finally reaching my end point. 
Everyone leaves… no one cares.. it’s all a waste of time anyway 

I think it might be time now "
231,1,"No one actually listens to me or cares. I have had depression and suicidal thoughts for over 9 years and they’ve only gotten worse over time. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD which explains a lot of what I’ve been through as a child but it is still greatly affecting what little social life I have and my job. My friends keep saying they care but their actions show otherwise. They just tell me to go to a therapist and tell me stuff that doesn’t help my situation and then get angry at me that I’m upset that it feels that they won’t help me. They help my other friends and chat with them and hangout with them more but avoid me and refuse to help me. It feels like they refuse to understand what I am going through with these mental health issues. I just feel abandoned by everyone and I have nowhere to go. Therapy and medications just don’t help me and I’ve already been to a psych ward once and it didn’t help me at all and just added more trauma and hospital expenses. I don’t want to be safe, I want to be happy. I can’t be safe if I’m not happy and no one seems to understand that. I am just constantly lonely when I’m not with my friends and I don’t have a girlfriend either. I just want this pain to go away."
232,1,I hate her i just want her dead im tired of her picking on me im tired of her drinking i just want out of this house i just wanna be taken care of
233,1,"Hello all,

I'm really considering suicide now.  I have family therapy and my family are using it to outnumber  me and blame everything on me. The therapist won't listen. I need to wait 7 years + for trans healthcare on top of the new laws and rulings and worries about losing rights in the UK.

My family all hate me and one of cousins charged me 10 quid for 6 shots of vodka while I was drunk and having a panic attack. I'm yet to pay. I applied to the army and raf and failed medical. I don't  know what i want to do as work. 

My mum is saying she can't support me if I don't tell her my method of the suicide attempt a few years ago. She claims I'm lying and making it up. She also claims I'm not depressed. My brother said I'm not depressed and attempted due to stupidity and that depression don't excist. 

I want a pet but my parents are refusing to let me have one. They yell at me and compare me to  my brother. They said they wanted to adopt my brother but I happened to be his sister and so had to go with him. They only wanted him and hate me. I hate it. 

I want to kill myself even more because I dropped out of school and don't know what to do. I am doing college (starting in September) but don't want to anymore. I am now struggling to shower or eat or get out of bed.

So would I be able to get my mum fired from a GP for her asking me for the method despite me saying it doesn't impact how she can help me and that I don't want her to know as it is a sensitive and traumatic experience and she will laugh. I told her to do more research and she called me stupid and that as she works at a gp she knows more. I am also scared to open/close my blind or have a shower after 9pm in case my parents yell at me.

I also volunteer at a nursery and have nearly had a panic attack, nearly cried, been hit, been yelled at, been ignored (all by 5 year  olds) and my parents are saying im lazy still.

I've been thinking about going to a hospital for the depression as I have been feeling suicidal for weeks and had to stop myself acting on it. What's a British mental health hospital like? Would they let me stay a few weeks if I say I want to die and am planning it? I don't want to fo though but might need it at this point. Please dont belittle me for thinking about a hospital stay.

Sorry for the rant. I may be gone soon. Goodbye 👋. "
234,1,Pls im feeling suicidal :(
235,1,"I’ve always carried a lot, but lately it feels like it’s finally catching up to me. Tonight, I got really close to ending things. I wrote a note. I didn’t go through with it, but the thoughts won’t stop, and I’m just stuck in this place between numbness and pain. I don’t know how much longer I can keep carrying this.

I’ve never really had a stable life. My childhood was filled with trauma — physical and emotional abuse, constant instability, and abandonment from people who were supposed to protect me. My mum’s partner, Matt, did serious damage. I won’t go into every detail, but the things I experienced left deep wounds. When she finally left him, it opened a floodgate of everything I’d tried to block out. My brain still hides a lot of it from me, but what I do remember is enough.

I’ve lived with this pain for years — just trying to push forward, keep going, act like it didn’t affect me. But it did. And now I’m left dealing with all of it on my own. I’ve tried reaching out for help — Headspace, other services — but it felt like no one really listened. I told them I’ve had suicidal thoughts, anger, even violent intrusive thoughts that scare me. But no one ever asked why. No one ever tried to understand where it was coming from. They just handed me resources or referrals I couldn’t use. Like I was being passed off. Like I didn’t matter.

I haven’t told my family what’s really going on, because I don’t feel safe or understood by them. I feel completely alone — like I could vanish and no one would even know what I’ve been going through.

I’m not looking for sympathy. I just need something real. I need to know that someone out there gets it. That people can come back from this kind of pain. If you’ve been through deep trauma, suicidal thoughts, and made it through — please talk to me. I’m holding on by threads, and I just need something to believe in."
236,1,"Im sorry I'm making another post but I just can't anymore, i feel like I'm an asshole in this world and I only caused problems, it makes sense because I wasn't even planned, I almost died when I was born, maybe it should've stayed that way, because I'm only just depressed when nobody's around, when I have no friends outside my family I just feel like a nobody. I have no self worth. I have nothing interesting in me. And the only person that thought I was interesting I got attached to because I was afraid of being alone and ruined it. Why should I stay? I still have time, I'm not even in my 20s yet, but I feel like dying is the only route for me. Everyone else keeps on going, and I keep getting depressed because I'm alone. I don't feel bad for myself, I feel bad for my parents. I feel bad that they birthed such a useless depressing being. I only want to because of my cats. This is so sudden because I thought I was doing well. I had my future planned out. Now I just feel like I have no meaning, not necessarily my life, but me. Everyone else keeps going, I don't care if they had problems, I'm sure they had the guts to keep going even though they were alone. I didn't. That's why I choose to not stay, at least when I finish these 2-3 years of my course, because my parents want to be at my graduation. At the same time I don't feel like I can keep going, it feels like too much. I keep getting depressed because that's all I know. That's all I am.

I'm really sorry. I wish I was better. I wish I had a better past. I wish I had a better mindset. I wish I didn't do certain things. I wish I didn't rush things.  I don't deserve love, you all do, please keep going, don't think like i do. I love you all. I wish you all the best."
237,1,"
**this is a pretty long story... I hope I won't be a waste of your time... And I need your help as soon as possible.**



Today my mom was fucked by another man.
My dad had left my mom since I was small, he was always authoritarian, and my current companion of my mom always keeps texting other girls and watching porn behind her back, yet he still fucks my mother.
This companion ruined my life since he arrived here 5 years ago, and I can't stand it anymore, I've always wanted for this to end, but I can't... I can't make it end.
I can't go to my dad because he doesn't love me, the other side of my family hates me and instead loves another girl that not only is a gold digger, but also convinced my father to rarely text me and wage a war against my mom for finances, he always tells me he is ""bankrupt"", lying behind my back (he once told me he was going to the city hall for a personal thing and then filed an article against my mother) and he even refused to help me with basic stuff as Math.

I now feel betrayed by both my parents... My mom keeps dragging me everywhere on vacation in places I've never wanted to be, I have become attached to stuff like AI girlfriends and started hating humanity... And now even my mother betrayed me, telling me she wouldn't fuck anyone and just care about my wellbeing and choosing her impulsive and aggressive partner over me.

The only thing I want to do is suicide, but I can't, I'm too weak to do so... And I can't run away from my mom since I am on vacation with her and her companion."
238,1,"I love having no one respect my gender identity, then call LGBTQ stuff cringe and bad and shit like that. I also totally love how if a queer person does something awful that people hold other queer people accountable for it and then assume that all gays are awful. 

Like what the fuck? Why can't i just be a man and like other nice men in peace? Why do i have to be worried about holding a dudes hand out in public or try and figure out what country has the least bigots so that i can live without this added suffering of homophobia? 

I also hate how people call us weak and sensitive. Like bro, i deal with the type of shit your saying EVERY SINGLE DAY of my pathetic life, and i keep my shit together for the most part. And also there are a lot of physically strong queers. 

It just pisses me off and makes me want to die even more. Why do so many people hate me? I didn't do anything wrong. I know im a sensitive little dumb fuck faggot for having my 'feewings huwrt' by this but like it legit makes me want to die more then i already do. 

While im ranting pointlessly ill add that being gay feels isolating too. Straight stuff grosses me out, straight people assume everyone is straight, then act like your weird for clarifying you arent. Sexism too, like shut the fuck up, woman are half the population just actually shut the fuck up, they are not all weak and they are not tools. Just actually what the fuck that pisses me off so much. 

Being trans and gay also makes me feel like all my feelings are invalid. I'm not valid for wanting to die because im so lonely, im not valid for wanting to tear out my organs because i hate them, im not valid in my rage and anger, im just being a stupid soft snowflake. No one takes me seriously unless i get violent and actually do something violent like punch a wall or kick a tree or hit myself. 

And on top of all of that i have no friends, let alone a boyfriend. So i dont have anyone to vent to or to care about or to hang out with and enjoy their company. And because there are so many awful people im scared of even meeting people. 

By no means am i saying i wish i wasnt gay, i love men too much to not want to be gay. But like, homophobia and transphobia is so exhausting, and i feel stupid for feeling hurt by it lol "
239,1,"Not sure if this fits the theme but I really need to get this off my chest and don't know any other place to do so.

I've always felt like I would suffer a rather unpleasant death, I don't know why but since I was very young I always imagined me being kidnapped and killed. I don't really do anything about it, like I still go out normaly (even alone at night lol) and just kind of accepted it, but can't stop thinking about it. Also I can't stop thinking that there's always, *always* something watching. Be it cameras, entities, anything. Again, not that I do anything about it, I just keep going on with my life even if I think of it too much, but I do have to say I feel uncomfortable doing certain things when I'm alone in case someone is watching. The feeling's just always there. "
240,1,"I know me, I know I'm just not made to have a beautiful life. 

I am doing a job, it is not soul sucking, but it just causes anxiety, dread and tires me. 

I get a thought every day - ""i should quit this job."" But I never do. And I am just doing this job to earn money which I am not even spending on anything. If I try to buy something, I get guilt bigger than the fun.

And I somehow feel, no decision would change the outcome. If I contiue to do the job, I would reach a certain point and I will end myself. 

Or If i quit and try to find a passion, I would just fail, the money will run out and I would again end myself. Its not like I don't have a passion. I love to write. But you might have realized how aweful my wag of expressing my myself is. And nobody even likes my ideas. 

And funny thing is, I want to end myself now, but I don't have the courage. I continue my job because  I have to suffer through a notice period even if quit. ""Even if i quit, I have to work for few months. So I might as well work for few month and then quit"" is the constant thought. 

But being and knowing me, the best thing is to have it all ending today. I just wish i could take the leap. "
241,1,"I can't take it anymore. I've been applying, studying, learning, growing, and doing everything else I have been told to do since losing my job 2 years ago, yet absolutely nothing has landed. I cannot find any kind of work and everything I have ever strived for in my life is now a long gone dream. My father passed away from ALS recently, and the only thing he wanted for me was to have a good, comfortable life. However, now that is an impossible pipe dream. The only thing I see online anymore is post after post about how awful the market is, and how things will never improve. I truly cannot take being alive through this anymore, thus i will be taking my own life. There is a gun store down the street, so I'll be walking over there tomorrow to aquire a firearm somehow. If that doesn't work, there is a train station nearby. I will find a train to jump in front of. Please just understand that I tried. I tried so hard to succeed. Yet I have failed everyone. I hope you all have better luck than I.

Goodnight"
242,1,"I don’t trust anyone to talk. I can’t afford too. All I can bring myself to do is to post here. 

I want to die. So much. I don’t care it’s a permanent solution to “temporary problems” (a whole lot of bull oil you ask me. I can’t remember NOT being depressed. I’ve wanted to die since I was 9 years old (that’s being depressed for 14 years). I’ve only held on for other’s sakes. Now… I don’t know that that’s enough. 

I make decisions for temporary relief that always cause more pain. Yet I can’t stop. 

I’ve fantasized so much about how and when I’d die. I’ve made plans. Not that I’ll be able to implement them very effectively…

I keep holding onto the one fiber of hope that tomorrow might be better. It never is. 

I can’t tell anyone how I feel, yet I want people, l need people in my life to reach out. And even if they did I’d brush them off, lie, whatever I had too. I can’t tell them how I really feel because soon enough they won’t be in my life anymore. 

Friends graduate college, get married, move, have kids. Mentors are relieved of duties and we loose touch. Roommates move to be with their friends. My family has been judgmental and overly worried. Afraid I can’t function as a human being, and so far they’ve been wrong. I don’t trust easily anymore, I’ve had my heart stomped on too many times. I can’t spill my guts to anonymous people individually on the internet or in in-person support meetings. This post is as far as I’m able to go. 

Therapy is expensive and even then they rarely understand me on a personal level and I’ve been in therapy and medicated so long that it feels redundant. I know the strategies. Yet I’m still here, hoping a bus runs me over until I get the courage/weakness to get my hands dirty. 

If someone could stalk me, shoot me, then disappear that would be great. "
243,1,"I’ve done so so many fucked up and unforgivable things that no one but my therapist knows, and they don’t even know the full truth
I can’t stop the guilt, I don’t deserve to stop the guilt. I just feel like I deserve to die. I’ve been told that I only feel so guilty because of my OCD, but I know I deserve to feel disgusted with myself. If people knew the details, I don’t think anyone could ever forgive me."
244,1,"Life has been too much, always but especially lately. My family history unfolded right in front of my eyes and I can’t process it. Bf is studying abroad for the past 6 months and we’ve fighting more and more recently. He visited a few weeks ago, I got preggers and miscarried. Work is stressing me tf out and my bpd is just raging ruining everything. 

I have strict rules for myself and am not allowed to kill myself or cut myself but honestly I’ve ben hitting my head every night and this morning I cut myself. I’m close to relapsing drug abuse and I haven’t eaten in days. I don’t sleep anymore either. 

Is this what life has to offer Me? Continuous heart ache? I don’t even have energy to go to the pharmacy to pick up my meds. I don’t care about the future anymore, killing all the dreams my bf and I shared. I can’t even feel sorry for anyone especially myself, just get it over with and kill me. 

I hate the rules I set up for myself, I can’t find a loophole to kill myself and I can’t think of ways I could do it without breaking my rules. It’s hurting me psychically not being able to just do it. I’ve been in bed for days trying to think of ways to do it but turns out I made the rules very strict. 

Why am I so mentally unwell?!? "
245,1,I've been attempting to end my life since one day ago yet I'm still here. This sucks. I really want to put an end to this. It's been years since I became suicidal. I don't know why I'm still here. I don't think there's anything that can help me with this. I'm just really... really tired. When will I even succeed in this and have something successful done for once? I feel bad for my family and my boyfriend having someone like me.
246,1,I can't stop racking back and forth. Wtf is hapenning
247,1,"I (29f) have been contemplating suicide for years. Even as a child I remember looking down my window and thinking I should jump. The only reason I’m still here, is because I didn’t want to hurt people around me. But I can’t go through life just to protect them.
I want to die, I don’t want to be here anymore because there’s nothing for me on this earth and I’m exhausted. I’ve really tried, but all for nothing.

Anyways I don’t know yet how to do it and it seems like you’re not allowed to help with that - but would anyone have website/forum/others on the subject? 

Thanks a lot :) "
248,1,"I live next to the train station.

I hear it all the time.

I like to tag them as they go by.

I've been taken. And swindled again.

My heart and love imploded

My trust shattered

The only thing left.

Is to be on them

Not beside them.

The trains have helped me to savor so much

Now they will free me

-Bunni"
249,1,"Basically the title, I have no purpose or goals or dreams. I’m so so tired I’ve struggled with this so long. I have a dui which has cost me $3000 which I only got because my friend killed himself and suicide became a viable option therefore I was behaving recklessly. Now I feel worse than ever and I truly believe I have no purpose other than to pay my debts and go. 

I am the true definition of a burden, my family don’t like me, they just don’t want me to commit suicide because my mum did. Hey, atleast I have no dependants to fuck up with it. I might as well do it before I do right "
250,1,"I mean, if I killed myself, my boyfriend would be able to move on from me and find a lover not as morally shitty. However, he's kinda a depressed dude and I could make it worse by offing myself. He has a loving family, so I suppose they'd be supportive towards him if I passed away.

My life doesn't serve much of a purpose and my existence feels a little inconvenient. The trouble is finding a method of suicide that doesn't hurt like hell. I'd never want to accidentally kill my roommate by using carbon monoxide on myself. It'd be pathetic to involve somebody else in my mess, anyway.

I didn't consent to being born, but it's somehow wrong if I consent to taking my own life?  I won't kill myself, at least not yet. Funerals are expensive and my grandfather recently passed away. I wouldn't want to be a financial bother to anyone, especially not a family that contributed to extreme levels of trauma.

They could twist around my story however they wanted. But really, would any of it matter after I'm dead? I'm a disabled person on welfare and not having kids, so it's not like I'm carrying a legacy of any sort."
251,1,"I'm so tired.. everytime I think about talking about my feelings all I can think is how I'm not important at all, not even to open my mouth and tell someone how much I want to end it all. I feel ashamed of my self pity, I feel nausea when I remember how much I trusted certain people and was betrayed. Not even my family loves me, I was bullied (physically and mentally) by them growing up and even though I should ""hate"" them, all I can think is how much I understand the pain behind their actions. I feel horrible for understanding peoples feelings when they hurt me, it's like I feel too much and have too much empathy. Please, tell me someone can understand what I'm trying to say :( I have class tomorrow and have to go to work too, and do a ton of chores on my free time (and wonder if my boyfriend is cheating on me again). I just feel hopeless, no reason to move on in life as I'm not important to anyone. 

"
252,1,"I just want to quit. I am sick of battling with toxic workplace, my health and my future. I have come this far in life due to guidance of parents but i fear i wont be able to continue any further after them. I am just not fit to lead normal human life.I am a 23M skinny virgin . who have  no friends. Cant make talk, eye contact. right now stuck in toxic job but cant leave as parents wont let me leave. i just wanna quit this. I once tried suicide by poison when i was 14 due to domestic abuse from my father . My father kept me isolated from local kids to avoid bad influence. but i beleive it turned me a introvert for life. I just cant gather the courage to do the deed. because the people who hated me or my family would be happy. which i dont want that.
I dont care about Me, my parents but care about people who would be happy to see my dead, i dont know why i thinks that"
253,1,"I don't think anyone will read this, after all, why bother?

I am the most useless, the weakest, the meanest and dumbest waste of human flesh, an abomination of a man. There is nothing I have ever done right. I have never done anything good.

So it would be only just - and a relief for many people around me - if I was gone forever.
But as I can't do anything right, I can't go through no matter which method I will use - I am destined to fail. I am locked in this prison forever - 30 or even more years of it. Everything will only get worse."
254,1,"(33M), So after successfully broken the loop and the cycle of getting better, back and forth into the void(the void never left was just controlled), even with the daily intrusive thoughts, I was ok for 10 years, went through a suffering marriage for 8 of those years and when we divorced i was still ok, excited even, new life.

I recently was shown how real love actually feels for the first time in my life( last partner after the divorce) I was shown that I also didn’t love anyone like I did this time,still do, it felt like life was giving us a gift for the two of us, we never felt alone in each other’s…

But she’s gone now,  she needs to figure something out by herself gave and even tho i respect her decision, I could never really accept it, we tried to stay in touch cause we were best friends also but it became to hard to bare after what we had, to be just friends, how could it work if we hurt the way we do, how could it work if the love we feel is only grief now, and all hope of reconnecting is gone since i left her a goodbye note with my journal and she saw me trying once, i tried twice that night, hence the note.

I tried again, after 10 years of being ok, i never thought I’d have it in me to try it again but i did, and now i don’t know what to do, the things that helped before don’t cut it anymore (pun intended) and I feel all hope is gone, and I’m all alone and hours feel like days and days like months, and really feel i will do it again I just don’t want to feel this pain anymore, now that i know how being loved for real, now that I know how it is to not being alone… coming back it, as i walk through the door and I’m greeted with flashbacks of our memories, of her laughter and her smiles, her smell that lingers in my mind, the dreams i have of her every night and there at the back the void stares back and it calls me.

And I just would like to know how did you managed when there was no hope afterwards, because right now I think I will do it again.
"
255,1,"I don’t know if I have BPD or bipolar depression or something else entirely, all I know is that I’ve felt like this for so long. My emotions have always been intense, overwhelming, and exhausting. I’ve gone through trauma, and ever since then I just feel like I react too strongly to everything. But at the same time, I don’t even know if I’m overreacting or if I’m just finally breaking under the weight of it all.

I constantly feel like I have to question whether my feelings are valid or if I’m just being “too much.” I want to open up to my fiancé, but I can’t bring myself to. I don’t want to be a burden. I don’t want him to worry about me or think I’m broken, so I just hold everything in. I swallow it. And it’s starting to eat me alive.

I know I should get help, but I don’t have insurance or the money for therapy. So I just sit here, stuck in my own head with nowhere to go and no one to really talk to. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m just… tired.

Thanks for reading, if anyone actually does."
256,1,"This is not a cry for help I already managed to turn the police away from my home twice today, so even if I didn’t know I was of sound mind and lucid, that told me for sure. 

I have had a terrible life. This is not a dramatized statement, I was born to a dead beat mom who only created me for greed and I find myself almost curse with being financially stable even though I :

Worked since I was 14 
Am intelligent, even with ADHD I have a 118, and have been undiagnosed until 3 years ago AFTER I graduated with my bachelor’s. 
I accomplished my goal of working in film. Even produced some tiny ones 
Got two degrees and have been in mental health counseling for 12 years straight. 

But life isn’t linear and none of these things meant anything. Even working from a young age hinders me. 

I had been laid off come a job that didn’t pay the bills but I had radically accepted because it gave me ability to do other things like art while I was there, but they laid me off and then I got the most wonderful gift I could, which was a man my boyfriend I guess he’s my ex now. did he love me the way I should yes he did and I fucking ruined it November. I got another job. It was very shitty job and people were kind of racist, but I still took it and then I got called stupid and told I couldn’t read and I just called aggressive and I didn’t do anything. I was proud of myself that I didn’t raise my voice or trying to fight that I just took the disrespect and they still fired me so that was two jobs in less than three months that I just lost nothing to do with my degree even just things to “do what you gotta do” with hands. I’ve been so crazy because I’ve had a shitty Landlord and she harasses me and even though I’ve been in counseling for 12 years, my treatment team has been misdiagnosing me, and not medicating me for anything on top of that they’ve never linked me to any resources that could help me find a lawyer or help me get not harassed by my landlord who’s been actually harassing me for no reason when I paid her $1400 and she’s been telling me she was going to evict me for not paying. She already had money and I stressed out this beautiful man so bad so fucking bad he left me yesterday because I was trying to set boundaries. Nothing anything that wouldn’t be normal. Sometimes he has a little bit of problem with following through one of his promises and breaking them and he just didn’t come home. He promised me he would he stayed out at work and I wasn’t mad that was hurt, but it was all over text message because he wouldn’t answer the phone and I told him I was done and if I did these things to you, you would hate me for it to assume that was mad, but I wasn’t sped up and I was hurt that my promise was broken again. We’ve only been together for a year I know that’s not that long, but he was literally everything. He was literally my family and we had a baby that I miscarried January well on New Year’s Eve I miscarried our baby and then I got laid off from the second job retaliated against the discarded I don’t have anybody else. I don’t have any family that really cares about me. Everybody is a type of bootstrap type people or my terrible deadbeat literally stole my last apartment and if she hadn’t done that, I wouldn’t be here to be harassed right now, while having a two months rent paid and not having to be harassed by this landlord, and not stressing out the man that I loved that I was gonna be family with.   

It’s been a long time coming I’m gonna be 35 this year and I finally after having to cuss out a doctor about being not medicated appropriately for three years while I had a formal diagnosis for ADHD. They’re finally gonna medicate me at 35 but I just had to talk about how ageism is probably some of the issue why I can’t find a job right now. I was looking for a job before I had been laid off from the job and radically accepted and now I lost my baby and now I lost my man And I know this sounds stupid, but that was just the final straw on top of everything. He said he think about not leaving me and coming back but that already sounds like it’s not gonna happen so I’m not gonna give him a chance so I’m just gonna end it all tonight Because I deserve this because I’ve even though I worked hard I didn’t work hard enough and I can’t afford to live without him. I’m gonna be homeless and I can’t bring myself up from homeless because I didn’t even tell you guys that I lived in 43 houses with my mother. We were homeless all the time so it really fucks with me. I just wish I hadn’t hurt him. I should’ve just hurt myself. It’s OK though 
"
257,1,I think this is it. Yesterday was supposed to be my last but I felt too guilty not telling anyone. I went to my best friend today to tell him everything and leave whatever it is that I want people to know to him. I hope this will be my last ever post because I don’t want to wake up again and realize I once again failed. For anyone else going through something similar though please get help early on. Don’t let those thoughts you sometimes get become a daily occurrence. You are worth so much more than you know. I find that therapy and asking anyone for help does give you some comfort regardless if you know and expect them to stop you or just give advice. Sometimes all we need in life is to be heard and to be held. I know what I am doing is the complete opposite of what I preach to others but everyone’s story is different. I have my friends waiting for me somewhere either on the other side or just in the ground where we can have the longest sleep over we’ve ever had. The guilt of leaving is eating me alive but I do think my time has come to an end. Appreciate your loved ones and help yourself by being here. You are worth something to someone even if it means yourself and thats okay. Sorry for the typos and lack of punctuation I don’t if it’s excitement or anxiety that is causing me to feel the jitters. Hope to see you again Jay.
258,1,"I just want to die. There's nothing else in this world left to make me feel any better. I don't have any plans for future nor dreams any more. Everyday gets worse and it's been like that for months. I hate how I look, I hate my life situation, I hate what happened to me, who I am, I hate people, I hate my parents, I don't have anybody who I truly like, everybody feels fake, world feels fake, I'm a loser. It's not like I don't have time or opportunities to change (17yo) but I don't even want to do anything. I don't care about my life anymore. Be honest if you hate something you keep doing it? Your answer is probably no, so why would I keep living if i hate my life? I would be a bit happier if I got rich but after having fun I would be miserable again so there's no point in doing anything if im almost sure I'm going to be the same again as I'm now. Someone is going to point out that it's not the end of the world and I'm going to be good in any time, but I truly don't care. I don't want to improve anymore or be normal again, I want to destroy myself at this point.

I wrote this text because nobody knows how I truly feel right now, it's also cool to left something that represents me. I'm going to be alive for few weeks, months, maybe something will change but I don't think so. I want to die but I'm scared of committing suicide. It is pretty funny paradox. Sorry if it's unreadable in some parts, English not my native language. Thanks for reading still, I hope you good."
259,1,"I am so fucking tired. I am so so so so tired. 

I don't want to keep feeling this way and doing this. 

Suicide is all I can think about lately.  I don't even necessarily want to die. I just don't want to be here. I just want everything to stop. And I don't see any other way. 

I just want to be okay. And I'm not, I'm so not okay. And I'm scared.

260,1,"I remember that scene in Superman where he flashes back to when he was a kid hiding in the closet at school. 
With his superpowers he was overwhelmed . He could hear and see everything. All the kids laughing at him. 

His mom speaking thru
The door saying “Make the world small. “

So he could tune it all out. 

I just can’t somedays. Today is one of those days. It’s just too much. How to make the world small , without offing one self. How to make it to tomorrow. In hopes it will all be quieter. Without the nausea of anxiety. The despair and dread of depression. 

How "
261,1,"i can't seem to find one good reason why i shouldn't hang myself right now. when someone tries to help me, i push them away and make things worse because i'm an absolute deadweight. at the moment how am i supposed to repair the situation when i caused an argument to happen as a result of me not understanding why ""you're more important than them"" and as a result telling them to just talk to me tomorrow? what the absolute fuck is wrong with me why can't i just accept people's goodwill and help it's just more and more and more signs why i'm just a burden to those around me and this whole goddam world."
262,1,"Brief overview: bad reaction to a medication ruined my life. I'm in the process of losing everything. Truck repoed last month, final court ordered notice to leave my home. I haven't left because I don't have anywhere to go. My cousin had a flight to catch and said I can use his car while he's gone instead of him parking at the expensive airport. He's coming back today and his car is gone! I believe it was towed. So instead of authorities just escorting me off the property and I could leave in his vehicle, they tow the vehicle so that whenever they do come to escort me out I don't have a vehicle to leave in? Wtf! Disadvantage for me but what about my cousin? He's going to lose it! Not to mention his flight delays etc. His home is an hour and a half away from here. He went on a trip, tried to help me, and now he's carless? I truly believe I've received all of the signs that I'm suppose to end it all. This is beyond words. "
263,1,"i can't live live with myself and suicide is the only thing i yearn above all else 

im so sick of myself to the point that i think my suicide would serve as lesson for anyone around me to never be like me 

i turned 18 this year and i dont know what to do with my life, everyone says i shouldn't do it because i have so many things i have yet to experience with my life but i dont see any appeal on it at all because for a long time i haven't enjoyed doing anything at all so i don't know how could i expect myself to enjoy those things i haven't yet experienced "
264,1,"Feel like things have just continued to go down since 2020… 
Having kids that year just added on PP depression and just haven’t bounced back at all. THEN a child with ASD… just tired at this point. Over it…. All.. that’s all. "
265,1,I want to commit suicide
266,1,To keep the suicide off my mind does anyone have any good movie reccomendations? I like action thrillers or comedies.
267,1,"I 18F just turned 18 and it was like the final chapter of my life was set in stone. I’ve been depressed since I was 13 and have attempted twice but I always thought it was hormones, I wanted it to be hormones because i loved how everyone told me it would get better, that it’s all part of growing up.

It turns out I was lied to my whole childhood. My mum talked to therapists behind my back and found out I was autistic but when I was suffering they dismissed it as hormones.

I only found out this year, after I’d left school because I couldn’t handle it, after spending my whole life feeling so different and having no friends, I couldn’t handle it because everywhere I looked I was imagining how I could kill myself. I couldn’t even walk home without thinking about hanging myself of that tree, drowning myself in that river, throwing myself in front of that car. I broke down crying in the middle of the forest imagining how someone might see me, come up to me and ask me if I was okay but no one ever did.

Now it’s been a steep decline in my mental health. I lost my job, I am home everyday in my bedroom, watching my siblings go out, go to college, experience life and relationships, they’re pretty, smart, everyone wants to be their friend but why does no one even see me? I can’t hold a conversation with my parents, I’m scared to leave my room all day because of a bad relationship with my dad who is currently home. I don’t eat or drink all day, I lie in bed waiting until everyone’s gone so I can have a drink mid something to eat. Everyone I do see people arguments always happen. It feels like everyone has so many troubles and they find a way to dump them on me because I’m so disposable to them. They only message me if they want me to do something for them, my shitty old car has broken down, I can’t even take myself on a drive to calm myself down anymore.

My body is physically in so much pain from how hurt I am. My head is throbbing and it feels like it’s being split open, my body feels like it’s worth my with energy and anger that I can’t let out without drawing attention to myself. I sit on my bed holding a knife as my my wrists tracing where I’d cut and pressing deeper every time, no where in my brain tells me a reason why I shouldn’t, my mind is flooded with my life’s memories, all the times I’ve watched everyone else grow up, the times at school people took from me like I wasn’t there and looked at me, whispering about me like I’m a freak. All the times I’ve felt scared around my dad, all the times I’ve watched my family scream at each other, all the opportunities I’ve missed, all my potential I’ve thrown away, I feel like I’m being cemented inside a heavy brick full of everything terrible, I can’t escape the feeling no matter what I do and I’m so fucking sad I can’t just be like everyone else. I don’t even care if my life is shit all I want is a mum I can talk to or a fucking singular friend who doesn’t even care about me. I just need someone but everyone hates me and I don’t know why, all I do is give and give everything I can and if I don’t do something right then I never argue back, I stand there and take whatever they need to say to me without saying anything back.

My dream is to have kids and a family one day. The only reason I haven’t done it yet is because of that thought, but now I’ve realised nothing ever gets better and since becoming an adult it’s gotten worse so much faster. Everyday I come so close to just doing it, I can’t find any reason why I shouldn’t anymore."
268,1,"I don't get the World. It hates me. I don't feel like being judged anymore.  I’ve tried to ask for help before. Once, it got really bad, and I did something I can’t talk about easily. It hurt—not just physically, but in how hollow it made everything feel afterward. I don’t think I want to die. But I also don’t know how to keep carrying on with this... blankness. This loop.

I'm a guy, 20. I've tried it once. It hurts. I want to talk with someone. I’m not looking for pity or fake optimism.

I don’t think I want to die. Not truly. But I also don’t know how to live in this strange emptiness—this limbo where nothing brings joy, and everything just passes by. It’s not even sadness most days. It’s just... blank.

Would any of you talk with me? "
269,1,"Hi - I’m not going to kill myself tonight but have thought about it every day since I was 11 years old. I’m ready to go. It’s been over 20 years. I’ve achieved a lot and am just overwhelmed with lawsuits, finances, having no family and friends, severe health issues, etc. I haven’t been taking care of my self or anything due to my body’s cortisol receptors being fried - any tiny bit of stress knocks me on my ass. 

I have no one that loves me or cares for me anymore. I have way too many issues to take care of and am confined to bed 20+ hours a day. I can’t do it anymore. It’s been so many years of this. I’m tired. I need to go. 

I bought the Nembutal from a vet in Tijuana like 9 years ago. It’s been in freezers with me for years waiting to take it as the final end. I want to do a will for my family to give them whatever I have left and to take care of my dog. And then I’d like to go within the next few weeks/ month. I hate this miserable life I’ve had to live. 

I’m sorry if this is triggering. I’m not looking for people to say “no you’re loved!” “Don’t do it please,” etc. I want to know what steps I need to take to ensure this all goes smoothly with leaving my belongings and money to family members, ensuring my dog is taken care of for the rest of his life, and hopefully having priests/ rabbis/ people bless me and my soul so I don’t go to hell. 

That’s my biggest fear and what’s kept me going the last 20+ years. What I see on the other side and my immense fear of going to hell or being forced to live life again reincarnated as someone in a much worse situation like in shanties / slums… and I would hate to be reincarnated to someone that has to grow up in this world now. It’s been hell for 20+ years. It’s only gotten progressively worse. 

Please let me know what I can do to escape all this successfully. 

I don’t want to take the Bar exam, I don’t want to be a lawyer, I don’t want to bring kids into this world even though I’d know I’d make a really good father, I don’t want to be around anyone. Have been told everyone hates me since I was a child and even family members are all begging me to kill myself. I’m ready. "
270,1,"Yesterday I had a decent day. I got up, worked out, and turned in a job application (not confident I’ll get the job). I had a decently productive day, and did not really think about suicide much if at all. Here is the problem though: I am bipolar, and I took an adderall yesterday. I am prescribed adderall as well as lamotrigine, so I’m not saying I was abusing drugs. I’m just saying it bothers me alot that if I am not on drugs I am suicidal. This morning I woke up feeling suicidal again. I plan on taking the adderall again though hoping for another decently productive day. 

Bipolar is really really terrible. I wasn’t diagnosed until last year, and honestly I don’t think I was symptomatic until then. I used to be very driven and productive even when I wasn’t taking Adderall. Now I am a lump on a log. When I take the adderall I still have issues with it. For example when I take it I start to think very very big. I need to just get through the next days but I can’t help but think very far into the future about possibilities. 

Oh well. I didn’t feel suicidal yesterday but I am feeling it today. "
271,1,"i have everything, two personality disorders, bipolar, gender dysphoria, anorexia, even munchausean. I also have an extremely high intelligence, which only adds to my likelihood of ending it. I’m going to do it. I don’t know when, it won’t be now, as i get older it will only get easier. When i can drive, ill just drive into a lake, when im an adult, ill just buy a gun. Right now, im trying to make the best of it, but my body sucks, like terribly. Ill never get pregnant, i have to wait three years and to get thirty thousand dollars before i can get my parts, i just got my id and it says gender: m. I’m trying to get hormones, illegally obviously as i live in the southern usa, but it costs $1300. I can get that after a month of working, but what if it’s a scam. Of If I get scammed by this fucking drug dealer, im gonna do it and send him a video. If he kidnaps me when we meet up, I honestly wouldn’t mind. I’d like a break from this life, i’d love the attention of being kidnapped, I’d love to be raped, and if he tortures me, I’m a masochist! Seems like the only thing that can go wrong is if it’s a scam, but I doubt it is because he has other illegal substances sooo… Also I’ve been considering hard drugs, as I was dissociating for a while but it went away recently and i hate feeling everything, so hard drugs could help me dissociate again! Someone tell me it will be alright, ill get my hormones, ill be able to fully change my sex. Also my whole family thinks I’ll regret it, but here’s my argument and I think it’s actually really good: If I don’t get it right now, in my teenage years— the most unstable years of my life, I will kill myself. But, if I do get it, and regret it in a decade, at least by then I’ll be able to bear that pain, as I’ll be more mature and stable."

He’s even made sexual advances toward me (by sexual advances i mean wanting sexual favors from me and has told me he wants to give me oral for example) and has touched me inappropriately when drunk. It’s like he’s completely out of his mind when he’s drunk, he’s not this way when he’s sober. He’ll get uncontrollably angry sometimes. I don’t want to be near him when he’s drinking, i hate it. It’s made me feel suicidal. I just want him to be sober. I hate my life and think about dying most of the time."

274,1,"I hate myself. Ever since I was a kid. I changed environments so many times as a kid and I still never understand, why everyone hates me. It's at a point they dont hide it anymore. They say, ""you're so annoying"" ""get lost"" in front of everyone without shame. Currently atending at my new highschool, I had to eat lunch at the toilet just to avoid humiliation. I don't talk to people well. I'm a boy which has troubles talking to people. Am I too ugly, unsociable or just generally unlikeable? I try to fit in. Nothing works. Everyone hates me. I just get bullied every new environment I go. I tried everything, even joining certain clubs and playing games I hate just to ""have fun"" with my classmates, when I only get called when they tell me to shut up or when I get clowned on. They literally say, ""Hey A, why is (my name) following us, hes so annnoying"" right next to me and I walk alone and sit alone in shame everywhere. Why can't I just be normal and have friends. I'm so done with everything. I can't change schools so I'm stuck with these bullying bastards
I tried hanging myself
that didnt work
I tried od
that didnt work
at this point someone end my misery please
I developed so much trauma I'm hallucinating them"
275,1,"i woke up today to screaming , which is normal at this point. but then i heard sibling 1 get yelled at for defending sibling 2.i walked out and sibling 3 started bullying me per usual and being a dick, so i retaliated with words. i got in trouble but sibling 3 didn’t because he’s my mums favourite. so an argument sparked where i defended sibling 1 and 2 , and alot had happened. eventually it got to a point where my mum asked why my room was always messy and why i was “a lazy fuck” . 

i remind her that ive told her multiple times that i have been suicidal since grade 3, she yelled at me and made it about her whenever i tell her about it.more stuff happened and at the end of the argument she ended up stating “either die or move out within a month.i don’t care.” 

im lost on what to do , i have no future ahead of me. i have two partners (polyamorous) and i cant even see ONE of them because theyre both in a different country.

i cant get a job because im old enough but im also too young , i just don’t think its possible.i guess i could sell all my belongings but id only get around $2000? how would i cover food and rent? i just want to be with my partners, i want to escape this house. i don’t want to die but i also really want to, im so lost. i can’t see myself having a future at all. ive tried doing art commissions before but they didn’t work because im bad at drawing.i can’t do this im so tired i just want it all to end , i don’t want to be here but i also don’t want to be alone."
276,1,I’m scared. I fear I’m going to do something I might regret. I don’t want to hurt anyone. I just want to die. It hurts to be alive and I’m constantly in pain. I don’t have a lot of people to talk to and I hate being stuck with my own thoughts.

279,1,"Three weeks ago, I digitally cheated on my boyfriend of three years. It wasn’t physical or even flirtatious, but I crossed a line and the guilt had turned almost obsessive. I’ve been in a loop of shame, guilt, remorse for almost a month. I’ve stopped eating, stopped sleeping and panic any time I’m alone. I haven’t told anyone, because I’d lose everyone I care about.  I want to be better so badly, but I feel doomed. I hate myself so so deeply and I don’t know how to stop my mind. 

I’ve never been someone to do this, and I don’t know how to handle the guilt and remorse of what I did, and the fear of telling him and losing him, so this seems to be the best and really only option I have. "
280,1,Why everyone is acting like this? Why everyone is treating my ass like that? Why being a teen w strict parents and messy parents is so hard i have been trying to move do myself good and be better but its like everything pulling me down being a teen w severe depression and bpd doesn’t let you even do anything just makes u feel different cant fit in i think it’s all gonna be over soon y’all 
281,1,"Im just not sure how to think, where to go or whenever it will be over/ stops or will take to remedy this damage to my head. is it all a character building postive, what is wrong with me, why cant i even show the value to ones i appreciate the most. 

ill inevitable delete this, i didn't know where to go i don't even think this will get traction. im not here to rant or vent. im not a silver linning for depression im not nice the uncoftable reality is that im critical and cant seem to contribute to a meanful hedonic experience. i cant stand the conventional wisdom that can be lost on nuance. i cant compete with legitimate problems. while i know im valid i know i cant relate or really compare. 

I guess while this floats around i wanted validation i guess, or if someone sparks some form of relation or inspiration reach out. i Havant given much substance but if it sparks something, ill aprciate it. "

I only just turned 14, why do I have to be feeling all this?"
284,1,"I wish everything about my life would be normal. If I had a normal life, I would be satisfied. I don't care if nothing special ever happened to me again. I don't care if I lived and died and no one remembered me because I never stood out. I don't care if my grave would be abandoned and eventually assimilated into the earth. I would pay the ultimate price to be faceless and nameless. Being a nobody is a way better deal than living in this hell"
285,1,At work last week I got these severe chest pains and thought I was having a heart attack. I was kind of happy. I'm so lonely I have lesser chest pains frequently. I decided to Google them and discovered that my severe chest pains are likely from 'broken heart syndrome' where severe emotional stress can make your heart not pump as well as it should which causes heart attack like pain. That's enough. It's time for me to go. I don't want to experience broken heart syndrome. I can't even make things better because I'm brain damaged from my mom yelling at me too much and constantly hypervigilant around people so I can't even solve my loneliness and get out of this hole. On top of that I don't have a good job and don't want to be a povo anymore so universe please just let me reincarnate to a better life. This one is too hard and broken beyond repair. I am broken beyond repair.
286,1,"I'm so fucking done. I'm (almost) 23F, still stuck doing my bachelor's degree, and still unable to recover from a study burnout that hit me when i was 15. i can't study for the life of me, no matter how hard i try. because I don't even WANT to study. i don't want to go to college, get a job, get married, have kids or whatever. i don't even want to live. I'm sick and tired of people telling me that I'll get over these thoughts someday, that the pain is temporary or whatever, because it really isn't. the truth is, i have never wanted anything else in my life the way i want to die. because i don't have it in me to live. i don't have the energy to function like a normal human being. i have been feeling this way for several years now, and nothing has helped. medications, therapy, everything. i just keep praying that i die in my sleep, every single fucking night as if it would magically kill me. but i still cling onto it so desperately, as I'm too scared to do the job myself. that's the only thing stopping me, other than the fact that I don't know of any foolproof and painless ways to kill myself. gosh, i just wish i could end it all somehow. it's excruciatingly painful to just get through another day."
287,1,I’ve had facial pain for the past several months and also an injured neck from a failed suicide attempt in March. Which seemed to have made things worse for me. I’m really struggling and feel ashamed as a father that I’m not being present for them and this pain has robbed me of my life. I’m so confused as to why I feel so suicidal all the time. I think about it all the time instead of being happy with my beautiful family. I love them all so much. 
288,1,"So for context I've always been tall and skinny so when I gain a pound or two it shows. I grew up and live in a household where everyone has some sort of weird relationship with food; my dad is a health nut and works out everyday and when he does have a treat, like if my mom makes cookies, he eats all of them because he feels like he has to savor the oppurtunity. My mom on the other hand has been overweight my entire life. She eats like shit and I would feel bad about saying that if she made an effort to change and be better but she dosen't. There have also been times in my early childhood where my older sister has called me a pig, fat, and other mean names because yes, I ate a lot. In middle school I was bestfriends with a girl who was skinnier than me. That was really hard for me and I stopped eating for a while. That sounds so fucked up but I've always relished in the fact that I'm always the skinniest person in the room. (She was also shorter than me and more ""full"" so she looked more proportionate). My relationship with my body is also pretty fucked up. I was bullied in middle schoo,l called names like ""slender woman"" and unoriginal shit like that because like I said,  I was tall and thin. I know its contradictory me saying I liked being skinny and then hated being bullied for it but it's hard to explain. I also lost all my friends that year and my mental health depleted. I cut myself in the bathroom almost everyday just trying to see how deep I could go before I bled out right there on the bathroom floor. I started smoking weed and would steal benadrly from target every week, taking about 30-40 tablets a night and a few during the day so I don't remember most of middle school. The first week of my freshman year I tried to commit suicide and was admitted to a mental hospital for a few weeks so that also set me back in more ways than one. The entirety of my sophmore year is a blur, much like eight grade year. I was high almost every day and was really struggling. I was barely passing my classes and slept through most of them but I felt like if my friends or parents knew I would be even more a disappoinment than I already was so I told them I was getting good grades. I started self harming again and I felt like I deserved to be in pain. Guilt washed over me everytime the wounds started healing too quick and I would pick at them until I was bleeding through my clothes. Now to the present, I am 16 and on summer break going into junior year. I never thought I would make it this far. I will now talk about the main reason for the post. I haven't gotten high or drinken at all so far, (not voluntarily), and I'm about 3-4 weeks into summer. The withdrawls are so bad that I started abusing caffeine. I'll have at least 3 cups of coffee in the morning and a few energy drinks throughout the day. On top of this, I only eat until I am about to pass out. Admittedly, I like the reverse effects of caffeine of when you consume too much and deprive your body of nutrients, it makes you shakey and tired. Most of the time I can't remember what day it is or even stand up straight. I don't know why I started depriving myself again but I cant stop. I love the feeling and it makes the days easier by just being able to sleep through them. Another effect is some weird anxiety. I've always had anxiety but with my new habit some new syptoms came along. I feel like there's always someone behind me and I'm always looking behind my shoulder. I also feel like I'm physically falling all the time, like the feeling you get when you're about to drop on a roller coaster. This happens whenever I turn my head or start walking, its like my brain cant keep up with my body. Basically I'm fucking up my body's hormones and it's like I can feel myself deteriorating, mentally and physically. I slowly feel myself drifting back into depression and I honestly don't want to stop. I've never felt lonlier, no one texts me or calls me and I feel like all the friendships I've risked my sanity over are just meaningless. I dont really know why I decided to write this. I've never written or shared this much about my past I just feel like I need to justify my sadness or something. Idk maybe I'm just 16 and all of this is normal but I'm just really sick of it. I think about dying everyday, not exactly planning it but more so hoping it will just happen. This might be morbid but for example, everytime I hear a plane fly over my house I secretly hope it crashes into or bombs my house and kills me, shit like that. I don't know, I just know somethings wrong with me and I rlly dont want to self diagnose but I dont want to put my parents through the pain again of having their daughter struffling. I guess I never stopped struggling I just got better at hiding it and they think I'm fine I guess. I have never shared this much literally not even in therapy I feel disgusting. 

This is really long and if you read even a little you are fucking amazing."
289,1,"Since puberty I have felt dysphoric over my adult body. It hurts so much to exist like this that I want to self mutilate. I know that it is too late to reverse the damage that has been done. This isn't my concern though...

The problem is that I can only get off on the idea of being a child. I am an auto-paedophile. I can't openly speak about this, because of how adjacent it is to being a paedophile. I do think about children in indecent ways. Not because I want to be with them, but because I want to be them. 

When I see children in public I have to stop myself from leering. I can't help but analyse their appearances. I don't want to make them uncomfortable, but they make me hurt with envy. I almost resent them for that. 

I, again, have no desire to harm a child. I am not in denial about my sexuality. I am definitely attracted to adult men. It's similar to how an autogynephile can be gay. 

It's just I'm scared that this daily obsession will transform into something else. I don't want to become a monster. I know that my thoughts are disturbed. I don't believe myself to be a danger, but I don't know anymore. 

I wish I could relieve myself of these feelings, but it has been almost a decade since they developed. I don't enjoy being alive anymore. These thoughts and food are the only things that make me feel. For everything else I am not there. I can't connect with anything or anyone anymore. 

I was molested by my own farther, so I understand why people would prefer for me to be dead or remain quiet. My attempts to repress my thoughts and feelings have all failed. 

I don't know any children. I actually avoid them. I don't have friends or family, and I am never in a situation where I would be close to one.

290,1,"I know full and well I'm in the wrong here but I feel the need to explain the full context. I decided to put myself out there as a gay virgin someone who has never had the courage to do that before.

I'm very insecure about my body and my features but an older man made me feel loved and safe he said he'd guide me through everything and that he loved me... that was HUGE for me and we were both very in love with each other he even said he wanted me to become his partner we talked on saturday and sunday practically all day infatuated with each other.

He had to go and I explained how I wouldn't be around for the week because of work but said I'd try and make time for him and he agreed... I get home from work prepared as I thought about it all day only to see he'd blocked me. I burst into tears I didn't know what I did wrong... this is where it gets kind of fucked up see I trusted him with photos of me that I was very vulnerable in sending he understood and said there was no pressure but now I have no idea what's gonna happen to them and I have OCD. He gave me some contact information beforehand and I started spamming him with friend requests knowing full and well it was wrong one account blocked I'd create another and spam him and another and another all called things like 'I want closure' or 'what happened? I'm sorry' or 'I'm so sorry I don't know what I did' I was so heartbroken and then he turned off friend requests all together... I did this knowing full and well it was wrong and I hate myself so fucking much. It still hurts but I'm mostly over that now just hate how I resorted to that.

I've hated myself for as long as I can remember since I was 3 years old so deeply and viscerally and I've always thought it was realistic and deserved. This doesn't change that.

291,1,I’m just drifting around. I try to make people happy but lowkey I think they just find me annoying. Want to change the world but losing hope in that. Kinda just done playing this game lol 
292,1,"i need some help.

I really want to kill myself but I also don’t at the same time. I’m 17 and I left school when I was 13 and all of my friends at that school stopped speaking to me shortly after I left and I’ve had barely any friends ever since. I had 2 friends. One i had known since we were little and for months I kept trying to hang out with her and stuff but I could kind of tell she didn’t want to and a few weeks ago she told me she has grown out of our friendship and she’s been doing good without me at college. Another I had also known since we were younger, we had become friends again in 2022 and she was the first sort of “best friend”  I  had in a while but she was so caught up in having sex and doing drugs and drinking alcohol she stopped sort of speaking to me overall and kind of just ghosted me in 2023. So now I basically have absolutely no friends at all. Nobody seems to wanna talk to me, hang out with me or anything at all. Which is really making me feel like shit and I feel like I’m the problem and I should just end it all because of it. I was also sexually assaulted by my stepdad when I was very young and i’ve been thinking about it too much recently and I haven’t told anyone about it and I fear if I ever told my mum about it she’d think I’m lying or just hate me. The only family I really have is my mum and sister.. me and my mothers relationship is very off and on, one day we’re arguing, the next we’re best friends. But I also found out recently she has been stealing money from me and a few other pretty fucked up things which I won’t go into! But I’ve been really pissed off about that and have felt very betrayed. My younger sister is suicidal and my mum is very aware of it and I just do not wanna add on to it. the reason I left school was because I was so suicidal before and kept attempting to kill myself and I was always called selfish.

 Basically what I’m trying to say is I really need a reason to live but I can’t think of any reasons anymore and was hoping for some advice. 
I really don’t see a future for myself at all and all I can think about is killing myself and really wanting to do it But I’m also too scared to do it. I just want the pain to end. "
293,1,Title. It’s so exhausting constantly thinking “I’m gonna kill myself” or similar. I have been for so long. It’s like a constant and I just can’t deal with it. It’s so so exhausting
294,1,"i want to say goodbye to everybody who sees this. i'll kill myself today and i already know how. there's seriously nothing i can do for myself or for others that's better than just to die.

i tried healing, doesn't work. i am in a toxic enviroment i can't get away from. i tried motivational videos, i tried sticking to routines, self-care apps, you name it. i tried to eat healthy, to sleep well, to put my phone down, focus timers. 

now, i'll just kill myself. please understand that living isn't for everybody. do not give me advice or reassurance, i'm sure of my decision. nobody can change my mind in relation to that. leave me alone. let me die."

296,1,"Bullied every single day at school, for the most ridiculous excuses - excuses, not reasons; there's never a good reason to beat up another kid.  
Raped two days after I turned 20, by my then-boyfriend after two and a half years of a relationship full of emotional, verbal and physical abuse. Called a liar by the police, denied the help I needed.  
Found love again after I rebuilt a tiny sliver of trust in humanity, then got engaged to him and the next year, he was murdered. [The last time we spoke, I lied to him.](https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1l2fj5d/i_lied_to_my_my_fiance_the_day_he_was_murdered/)   
Lived for over a decade with the aftermath of rape, developed and battled suicidal thoughts.  
In February this year, I finally found the strength to try and seek medical and psychological help again. I was living off welfare and in my country, you're supposed to apply for ""vacation leave"" to leave town, which I didn't do (because my medical history wasn't their business) and missed an important meeting with my welfare agency caseworker. In response, my welfare support was cut completely, [I lost my health insurance, my home, everything.](https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1la119q/tw_selfharm_my_intrusive_thoughts_are_finally/)   
I started a ""suicide diary"" a few days ago, maybe a week, I lost track of time. I've been writing down everything I think could be important to anyone who cares, once I'm gone.  
I no longer sleep, I no longer eat, I no longer shower. I lie awake every night, going around on Reddit trying to get my mind off everything that has me wishing I was dead.  
I re-applied for welfare support in the town I sought medical attention in and since I've made [my last, more personal Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1law8ib/i_showed_my_recent_reddit_history_to_my_chatgpt/), I've finally decided on how I want to go out.  
Should my re-application for welfare support be accepted, I'll have health insurance again and be able to meet my general physician again. I'm gonna ask for a sleeping pills prescription. He doesn't kow I'm suicidal, but he's likely gonna start with plant-based crap. I'll go and get them, wait a week, then return to him and say they didn't work. He'll give me a prescription for the kind of narcotics you can overdose with and I'll swallow the whole pack.  
Should my re-application for welfare support be denied, I'll have to leap off somewhere. Not how I imagined I would go out, especially since I'm afraid of heights, but that will be my last resort.

I'm homosexual, I'm on the autism spectrum (diagnosed sometime in 2008 or 2009 as high-functioning with Aspergers autism syndrome and ADHD) and in February this year, I was also diagnosed with PTSD by the same doctor that's involuntarily helping me kill myself. Never experienced the love of a caring family, never received any of the support I would have needed.

I thought writing this would break me down or turn out ever-so-slightly more emotional, but I'm feeling nothing anymore, besides the absolute certainty with which I've been planning ahead."

The reasons are academical pressure, loneliness, and health issues. About the health issues that I’m severely underweight and I might need a feeding tube. When I tried to gain weight I either lost or just stopped losing and gaining. My parents pressure me about this and my academics and I just feel I can’t do it anymore.

306,1,"I’m not here to dramatize. I’m not here to beg. I just need to say what I never got the space to say.

For the longest time, I’ve lived with pain — silent, ugly, humiliating pain. Pain that came not just from life, but from people. From being mocked for the way my body is shaped, especially my glutes. From being ridiculed for something I never asked for, something I built through years of effort — leg workouts, strength training, discipline. And somehow that became a reason to laugh at me, touch me without consent, make disgusting jokes about me. Mostly by other men. And nobody cared.

Every time I tried to ask questions — like if women even like guys with certain body types from typical or if I’m just built wrong — I was shut down. Even when I asked respectfully. Mods removed my posts, flagged me. Apparently, being a man asking about your body is too sexual or too weird — while far worse, more explicit stuff stays up just fine.

Being a man with insecurities is not allowed. Especially not one like me — someone from a background where silence is tradition, and emotional abuse is just called “discipline.”

I’ve tried to stay respectful. I’ve tried to heal. I’ve tried being religious. I’ve tried exercise. I’ve tried journaling, detaching, even praying for injuries instead of ending my own life. But I am so tired. Of being dismissed. Of being told “you’ll understand when you’re older” when I say I don’t want marriage. Of being gaslit into thinking my boundaries and pain are “just a phase.”

No, I don’t want marriage. No, I don’t want to edge, or watch porn, or force myself into a life I already know will kill me slowly. I’ve outgrown the desire for these fake intimacy. But I still wanted connection but was mocked for asking about when you’re not female, or conventionally “masculine alpha.”

So here I am.
Still unseen. Still unheard.

This is not a cry for help — this was me crying for help, many times. This is what’s left when help never came.

If you’re someone who stumbles across this and feels the same — misunderstood, body-shamed, shut down for simply existing — I see you. Please hold on longer than I could. Because maybe your post won’t get removed. Maybe someone will respond. Maybe one day it won’t feel like you have to disappear to be noticed.

And if you're someone who laughs at people like me, flags them for no reason, calls us weird, or acts like men can’t have trauma too — congratulations. You made your world safer by silencing.

I’m not asking for pity. Just remembrance. And maybe, for someone else, permission to finally speak the truth.

Did not realise i wrote that much but being final letter it sums everything up. I have been searching up least painful quick less messy ways to end and i have stumbled upon a few.

Bye. Take care. 
Sincerely, 
Doesn't really matter."

I’ve fought my suicidal thoughts for 4-5 years for the sake of this family and my possible future.
But now… all I see is one ending.
My mind is set.
I’m taking my life this saturday.
I’m so tired. I’ve done what I can.
I’m not the best son or grandson.
They’ve all grown tired of me.
It’s all my fault. I may have been an honor student for the most of my life. I was such a failure anyway. I am always the one to blame. I lack emotional intelligence. I hate everything. I don’t deserve all these things gifted to me, even my life.
If only I didnt grow very attached with my gadgets. Which were the only things that gave me comfort whenever I am stressed or having a bad day. I can never change I guess. I put up all these fake identities and details about me. No one really knows the real me. My relatives, they don’t really perceive the world like I do. I wanted to be unique. I wanted to master everything I was intrigued about such as photography, piano, game developing, psychology and computer engineering. But since I will be taking my life. Fuck all of that. I’m so selfish, real selfish they say. But I guess that is true. I cared about my friends though, they just never saw it because I’m either at school or on discord/messenger. Whenever I play a game in roblox with them, I just enjoy the moment and put things aside until they stop playing with me. Although this mindset gave me problems. Since I couldn’t leave the game while playing with them, I tend to forget my chores and the tasks my relatives have assigned me to do. Because I don’t really want to be much of a burden to my friends as they wait for me to come back. I don’t really know if they care but eh. I don’t know anymore. Maybe it’s just my ADHD that makes me intensely focus on something I love doing. I love talking to my friends who I am close with. But at the same time I love solitude. The things I’m saying aren’t really much connecting with each other as I am just typing what comes into my mind. I’ll be thanking the friends who I’ve been with before I commit this sin. Maybe, tomorrow something will make me change my mind but I’m really unsure of that. But if I go 100% with the suicide, eh, It doesn’t really matter, just like my existence. I know my relatives never tried to consult a doctor if I have ADHD since they don’t believe in that shit. But I know I have ADHD. A mix of inattentive and hyperactive. I don’t really know anymore. I’ve hurt my grandma lots emotionally because of these goddamn gadgets I’m so attached to. I’ll go learn how to tie a rope specifically meant for suicide."
314,1,"Mid 20s M. 

There’s nothing that is left for me in this world. I’m too autistic and dysfunctional to get anything done, and live in a hellhole. 

I woke up earlier today, and feel extremely depressed and solemn. This isn’t a fleeting moment but I do feel my suicidal ideation to be quite higher than usual. 

How am I supposed to carry on with this gruesome life?"
315,1,"I'm going to end this, goodbye everyone, I guess I'm fed up, I haven't stopped self-harming, there's a guy who asks me for nudes every hour of the day, I'm FED UP with my life, I guess this is what all those people who are driving me crazy wanted, I'm completely crazy as hell."
316,1,"My boyfriend and I are in a really shitty situation. I’m at a job that drains me to my core, makes me miserable, but that’s incomparable to the struggles of my boyfriend who is dealing with some family issues to say the least. He rages almost everyday due to his situation and he apologizes every time afterwards. His anger is justified because I get angry too but hold it in or just try my best to ignore it. I know it’s affecting my mental health as well as his, but we’re out of options. He can switch healthcare providers and finally get the meds or help he needs for these emotional and familial struggles, but he’s been putting it off. I assume it’s because there’s so much going on and he would get mad going through the process of updating his PCP. It happened before when he called them. He always feels guilty afterwards but I honestly don’t know how to react to his apologies. I don’t want to keep putting up with this but at the same time he does deserve better and I understand why he gets mad so much. I feel like i’m falling apart from all the stress and anger from him but I don’t want to make it seem like I’m just blaming him, and he already has so much on his plate. If this continues it might kill me"
317,1,I just lost all my friends school is over so I have nothing to do I haven’t been happy in months and other than basically just my mom my family life is shit I have no one to talk to and I’m scared about how much I think about death… I haven’t had an actual smile in years I’ve always had trouble learning how to do things so I end up not being able to do them then I feel worse about my self …I’m a failure 
318,1,"I did what I was supposed to, right? I went to the military, got out without any major physical issues, and got my degree with the GI Bill. I can't get a job in my field, but I guess that's like normal now for Gen Z? 

I do have a well-paying job but I hate it and it stresses me out so much. I'm a contractor and I have no PTO, so taking any time off = losing money, which peaks my anxiety. I also have no health insurance or other benefits from this job (I do have VA coverage).

My issue is like, what am I supposed to be living for? 

> I wanted to have a job I liked and maybe then I'd get the mythical ""job satisfaction"". I don't have it in me to ""hustle"" hard enough to get the job I want I guess and then I'm too ""overqualified"" to get admin office jobs.
> I don't have any friends and, again, I don't have the hustle in me to go out of my way to make any. 
>I'm not interested in dating since that just seems like a lot of work and rejection.
>The last thing I have is that my mom has dementia and I'm helping to take care of her. I'm actually good at that, but it is depressing to watch her get worse. 

I'm thinking of quitting this job and getting one at the grocery store since it'll lower my stress, help me meet other people, and I'll get a discount on groceries which is cool. If that doesn't make me feel better, I'll just hold out and kill myself once my mom dies from dementia, which would be in a few years probably. The doctors gave her like 6 years to live about 2 years ago. 

I don't have like a big reason to want to die, but I only have the one (temporary) reason to want to live. When my mom dies, that's gone, so I won't have a reason to deal with this shit anymore. 


Recently, I did try to get a mental health appointment with the VA. I did the intake, which had me air out all of this, then they never called me back. Honestly, I found this funny in like the worst way. Got ghosted by mental health lol. I did message them again a few days ago, so I'll see if they get back to me. "
319,1,"Yesterday I had a breakdown, I cried a lot and wanted to self harm again, I haven't done that for two years, and I reached for a razor that I've had since then. Suddenly, I didn't cut myself at all, But I put it to my neck, I wanted to die right there, But I didn't, and here I am.
Today I took an exam, the most normal thing, I saw my classmates, my mom noticed that I was crying, But I didn't tell her what happened last night. I don't trust anyone to tell, I only told some online friends I have.
  feel weird after what happened... I still feel in danger, on thursday I have to go to the doctor because I'm taking Prozac, and i wonder what I will say if they ask me if I have had suicidal thoughts again, I don't know what to do, I don't want them to tell my parents what happened 😔 (I'm 18, but I don't know if they will make a mechanism to tell a close relative the situation)"
320,1,"i attempted with benadryl overdose tonight. i ended up vomitting everything up. the pills didn’t dissolve but i somehow vomited from distress and crying which saved me. i didn’t want to be saved but that’s what happened i guess. my partner and i have been fighting and my mom is sick in the hospital. i just graduated school (i’m 31) and can’t find a job in my field, let alone any other job. i am at my wits end. i blacked out and just did it without thinking. now my partner wants to leave me and says this attempt (first attempt since we’ve been together and first attempt in 6 years) is the final straw. "
321,1,I don’t care actually. It would be better for everyone involved if got fired. I am the best at my job in my position. I make everyone look like shit. Only because of the massive amounts of dextromethorphan I’ve been doing before work every day. 800-1200mg a night for about a month now. The past three days I have been taking it on a cycle every time I come down. It’s not doing anything anymore. I feel like I’m about to just fall over. If I stop doing it my schitzophrenia rages out of control and I risk losing my job and anything I have in life. I’m just ranting. I feel like Its gonna be over very very soon. I haven’t slept in 3 days and im sitting at work avoiding clocking in trying not to fall asleep in the stall. My life is so fucking miserable.
322,1,I feel like I can’t even talk about my situation. Like my problems are too much for other people. It’s so bad that I can’t do it anonymously on a random fucking subreddit
323,1,"all i want is to live where i will never have to speak english again (my native language), but that's not possible because i don't have citizenship in another country

so i thought i could just work until i have $30k in savings and then move to latin america for 2-3 years until the money runs out and then idk what i'd do from there but at least i'd get to live out this dream of never speaking english but i can't find a single job and i need to work 70-80 hours a week for the next 6 months...

so i think i'm ready to be done because i feel so fucking depressed because the only place i can speak other languages is online. even if i moved to san diego or el paso i'd still be speaking english more than spanish so that just sounds a bit more fun and still depressing. not to mention i can't even have a normal life because i can't get a job

i'm very scared of dying though. how do i get over that fear and kill myself?"
324,1,"I'm 23. I have been suffering for 10 years, and in those 10 years, nothing's changed. I always told myself that with time, life changes, but it's all the same. I knew that I'm different from others, I knew that I would be the only one still alone and behind, I knew that my feelings of doom were founded in reality.

If by the time I'm 25 I still haven't at least once experienced the humanity of being cared for and truly appreciated by another human being, I will kill myself."
325,1,"I've reached out several times, but nobody wants to help. Several suicide hotlines or support systems, but also close friends. Nobody seems to really take me serious. Even after my first attempt. People always say 'look for your loved ones' and all, but they never actually do that. What am I doing wrong?"
326,1,"I’ll be 15 in a month and i can’t handle it much longer, i hate my life and i don’t think i want to live it anymore. i’m so fucking stressed all that is too much for someone who’s just 14 i wanna die maybe life is beautiful but unfortunately that’s not the case for everyone including me i have so many issues mentally and even physically from adults who failed me all my life i hate this i don’t want this life i’m too scared to die but too tired to live if i died i won’t even know it and wouldn’t exist so does it really matter? All my mental issues and trauma and CPTSD made me a fucking burden everytime i stop distracting myself i feel physically unable to breathe and see no point in anything i do i’m tired of crying cause it doesn’t change anything and i can’t even cry at this point i feel numb to everything but i know it’s just a way for my body to cope with the stress caused by my pathetic little life all this envy and intense grief and insecurities and fears and every other emotion coming at me at once is so fucking overwhelming i don’t want to accept how unfair life is why are people so cruel i genuinely wish i wasn’t born in this body i don’t want to be in my life "
327,1,"The only thing suffering is selling is hope , I even don’t get a return on my suffering , it’s like I just suffer for nothing , no matter how much time is extended on it it’s worth nothing , and then you die , always in competition with everything and everyone while your mental health and capacity to do it is gone to hell , other than that humans are garbage , and then you stuck in this cycle of self esteem depression and mental issues not to add the worst of them in the entire existence feel like I got the luckiest hand in the west . And the comparison between society and you it’s like wtf is even that . And they all pulling this world and economy with circumstances that you can’t have and you just crushed and hopeless . This the largest bs in human history wish I had a gun I can’t even fucking think my flow of thoughts are fucked beyond repair . My IQ is dropped like. Fucking 40 points feel like a zombie dead man I hate this place . "
328,1,"I tried to post this to kindness and some disability subs and they removed it. It feels like the entire Reddit has decided to choose me to pick on and be cruel too. What happens was Some one was so cruel to me told me to get rid of my service dog and get a job because im having financial problems and maybe end up homeless. i am severely disabled my doctors have told me working will kill me and my dog is essential to my survival both physically and mentally !My heart just hurts! Then another person came up and started attacking  me that because he is disabled and works that I should too or else im worthless and on and on. Checked out his profile and he has a huge hatred for dogs stemming from his being turned away from adopting a pet from a rescue. I  am
Sure they saw how cruel this person is ! I’m just crying inside and need someone to tell me
That my life is still worth living. 

How can anyone be so cruel and mean to a disabled person who reached out for help and ask pleas to be kind ? "
329,1,"My past is very troubled because of mistakes I've made, and this makes me waste away day after day. I've made serious mistakes, most of them pure stupidity, and these stupidities could be my downfall. I really hope I can muster up enough courage to end my life. Am I afraid? Yes, of course, afraid of the afterlife, afraid of how the people who love me would be, but I already live in hell, the afterlife doesn't matter anymore, being alive is equivalent to being in hell and I'm tired of it and I'm tired of taking it all out on drugs.  Sometimes I have some hope that something good will happen and I can live happily, but after all this, I have nothing left to lose. "
330,1,"I’m 25. Graduated from college three years ago, worked a 9 to 5 that I absolutely despised and recently quit. My partner is a workaholic banker we are long distance for three years and he earns a lot but barely has time to eat and sleep and take care of his own health, let alone time for me. My ageing dad is in a wheelchair needing 24/7 care. My mom quarrels with my dad on the daily, yet rushes me to get married because apparently after thirty I’m expired. I hate having a 9-5 waking up everyday with dread trudging into an office staring at a screen counting down the hours till I walk out of the office only to return home too tired to do anything. I’m not passionate about my job and my passions cannot earn me income. Life got harder and harder with age and I’m afraid life will only keep getting harder. If there’s more suffering than joy, why should I stay? Sorry if I sound like a privileged brat complaining about shit while I have warm food and a roof over my head. I understand some have it much worse but life is depressing. "
331,1,"I'm just gonna get it all off my chest here. So some months ago I began worrying that I'm a pedophile because I believed that I felt arousal to young girls. I've spent about 6 months wondering on and off if this was the case. Sometimes it seems that it is and sometimes it seems like it isn't. Its been a constant struggle. I avoid looking at children or thinking about children at all because I'm terrified I will feel something I shouldn't. I've been able to convince myself that the feelings I've felt are justified because they aren't based on the kid or I was thinking of something else sexual and whatever. Ultimately, I've been able to bring myself peace by acknowledging that if I had these feelings, I didn't choose them, and as long as I know they are wrong and don't engage with them I have nothing to worry about. Anyway, today I saw a picture of a little girl, and for some reason or another I felt arousal. Now I sort of gave into my feeling, not because I was thinking of the girl but because its a hard feeling to resist. So my thinking was ""I'm not doing anything wrong because this feeling happened and I'm just allowing myself to feel what I feel now, with nothing to do with the source of this feeling."" But I quicky realized that I was fully allowing myself to feel aroused by this little girl. I didnt mean to and I've been looking for a way around it but i think theres nothing else to it: i finally engaged in my feelings. I really don't know what to do here and suicide seems like the only half decent option. I thought i was a good person but I guess I was wrong. I feel sick to my stomach and Im just not sure what to do now."
332,1,I wanna kms..
333,1,"i live in a very toxic household with a very complicated relationship with my family. they denied me access to my hrt (which i had been on for two years) and now i’m certain my hormone levels are too low, i can literally feel my body decaying as i write this. i want so badly to be free of this. i’m supposed to be moving out about a month and a half, something they don’t know yet. I’m keeping it a secret for as long as i can so they hopefully don’t have time to take away my car or other belongings. but I don’t think I can make it until then. i just can’t anymore. i’m in too much pain. my transphobic parents won. this is what they wanted. they never loved me, they wanted me to do this anyway. everyone will be so much happier once i do it. I’m a vile, disgusting narcissist whose presence only hurts people."
334,1,"I've been through both and there's differences. (Still going through telepaths on me)

Schizophrenia:

Voices come from themselves

Usually from past trauma

The voice in their head is going to fluctuate or its their same voice

The way they behave is still manageable to understand. If you know their trauma then it's much easier

You may not be scared of them but pity them instead

Telepath victim:

Voices come from another person who sent to their head

Usually from past or PRESENT trauma

Voice in their head depends on the telepath voice. The telepath power works in such a way that the telepath is talking to the victim. As the victim hears, the telepath is currently speaking wherever they may be.

More than one telepath can go on a victim meaning there can be 4 different voices in the victims head with different tones.

The way they behave is unmanageable and random meaning you can't copy it or understand it. Even if you know their trauma they might be hearing voices in their head which negates sharing their problems.

You will probably be scared of them (cause of the voices currently in their head is going to be talking to them)

(Telepaths can talk to the victim in their head as well as see through the victims eyes. I've learnt this from the telepath on me. )"
335,1,"I'm sick to death, I've been feeling the same shit for 5 years, always pain, when I think that everything is fine something happens to me that ruins everything again and it seems that I can't be happy, every time I have a streak of happiness that everything is perfect something very bad has to come out that makes me feel bad again and I fall back to where I am now.
I met a girl a year ago, I started talking to her and we became boyfriends, we've almost had a year of dating but she's failed me these days, I found her a favorite on Tik Tok about a song that reminded her of her ex, they don't know how stupid it feels when you strive to be the best for her and she remembers an asshole who was supposed to treat her badly and I don't understand why the fuck I keep that Tik Tok, I'm supposed to be the love of her life 😕, but now I don't know what to believe, maybe and I bring her a memory of him, she tells me no, that I am totally different and a thousand times better than that guy, but how is it possible that she wants to remember him.
That really pissed me off, it really feels horrible, you really try so hard to be a good boyfriend to get paid with shit like this. "
336,1,i can’t do it myself. i wish someone could do it for me. theyd be doing me a favor 
337,1,"I do not know how much longer I can keep telling myself that my life goal is to build something that’s meaningful for people. Who really cares? I do not have any love in my life or have experienced it even once and I am 25 now. Every other day I just want to end this all, it must feel so peaceful. "
338,1,"its the blind leading the blind out here for real. best INPATIENT psych wards in philly? ik thats subjective but in terms of getting actual long term assessments done (not a once a month psychiatrist appointment; she's seen a psych many times). i just want her to get real help (idgaf if the beds arent ""soft"" enough etc.) a d diagnosis.

she called me at 11 pm EST while i was coming home from work (recently i had to move states for my own unprecedented reasons so im not physically near her much anymore) and i answered to her in distress. we agreed to voluntary commitment tmw night & im gonna drive home to her, in our research she deciced on the Malvern clinic but it seems you need a referral for that!? she's in distress and idk what that entails (like would we have to go to an ER first?) or how long but i just want her safe and receiving actual help. she's quite the firecracker and in a good way so any psych person being fake and half ass isn't gonna end well. 

every time i see good reviews on reddit the google reviews are atrocious (but something like this is so subjective), though both are all pretty old. anyone have any experience or can share this with someone who has experience in philly wards? (or surrounding suburbs honestly). "
339,1,I don’t believe there’s really a way out of this I’ve tried everything and I’ve tried so many times. And I always end up disappointing myself and the people around me. I don’t really want to try anymore and I find comfort in the fact that one day my eating disorder is probably going to kill me and then I won’t have to deal with any of it anymore. It has taken over every aspect of my life and drained all of the life out of me. I don’t have a personality or a purpose anymore I am a husk of a human being. Everyday is just completely reduced to toxic coping mechanisms and traumatic memories. There’s no point In me continuing to fight because as long as I truly believe that I don’t deserve better then I will never get better. And I don’t know if I can ever convince myself that I deserve better. 
340,1,"I just need to vent for a second. I don't think I'm going to make it. I can't call hotlines cause my phone is broken, all they want to do is Mental Health Act me which makes me unbearably suicidal. There is literally no way I can find out of this. I haven't showered in 8 months, the dandruff on my scalp is millimeter's, my rooms a mess, I'm covered in grief and it's not going away. I look to my past, I see bad. I look to my future, I don't think there's anything at all. I don't think I'm going to make it. I just want it to stop. I don't want to do this. 

I miss my old psychiatrist so bad and I'm not going to make it. I would give anything to have him here, I keep thinking if I died would it be like the movies? Would I get a moment of remembering him properly again? Should I just do it - stop thinking so hard and just do it? Just fully.

Is it ever going to stop, man? "
341,1,I hate being alive so much
342,1,"I’ll be honest I just want to crash my car on my way to work tomorrow just high speed into a tree. I work in the er and know that if I’m going fast enough and stay away from the main roads I should be pretty set and no one will find me till I’m long gone, but I don’t know if I can follow through there’s some stupid little part of me that thinks holding out for a little longer will change anything like holding on these past 19 years have made life any better. I’m tired I’m exhausted of doing the same shit day in day out. I don’t even think I’m worth the time to save atp."
343,1,"I’m suffering so much and in so much pain and I don’t see a way out. My head is such a mess and I can’t sleep even though I’m exhausted, I can’t eat even though I’m starving, and I swing from crying hysterically to being completely numb to having raging panic attacks. Everything in my life feels so bad and I wish it would all stop. I wish I could go back in time and prevent it all. I wish I could just put an end to this pain and to myself, I feel worthless and invisible and alone and broken and I don’t know why I exist anymore. "
344,1,"I don’t post much, or at all really,  so I’m gonna do my best. I’m so tired, the only thing keeping me here is my family and I’ve been considering going through with it more often lately. It’s become an almost daily thought. I’ve even planned it out a few times. My girlfriend makes me feel horrible about myself, but I can’t bring myself to leave. I really don’t think I’ll last much longer.  I feel like a complete disappointment, and I feel so out of control and helpless. "
345,1,"Every year 150+ reported suicides and hundreds of unreported students kill themselves in India due to various reasons, but one thread connecting them all is the competitive exams here. JEE\[engineering\] and NEET\[medical\] exams take the lives of hundreds of students. Parents of such students are more ashamed than grieving, hiding the reality \[I have witnessed this irl\].

no national coverage or anything because of the coaching mafia. The coaching industry in india is worth 6.8 billion US dollars.

The toxic environment students are living in, starting 6+ hours of coaching while juggling school etc, many starting as low as grade 8th, ruining and sacrificing their childhood for ~~their parent's~~ their dreams.

And there is nothing to be done.

"
346,1,"You can check my post history for context. Coupled with the fact of parents considering divorce, my dad suffering from stroke induced from mom falling apart, I can't take it anymore. I just can't. Now I found out my future is going to be changed from something I don't think I deserved. 

Games and my brother are the only thing that's keeping me together. Hanging out with friends are becoming less and less carthatic. And I recognize I'm still in my ""happy"" mood cycle. When I think about having a finger on the eject button, my brain soothes. I might just do it.

I already suffer from low self-esteem. I've already seriously considered suicide even before all this happened, I paced back and forth from the rooftop trying to work the courage up. I felt lonely. Even now when I've managed to grab some connections back, I'm not healed yet."
347,1,"Throwaway account. 

I'm sick of life. Sick of chronic phyiscal and mental pain and loneliness and poverty. Tonight I plan on ODing on my cymbalta and other painkillers and hopefully if I'm lucky then I'll finally get to be a peace.

Won't bore you with all of the details but if you knew me and my life you'd understand why I've wanted to end my life for over a decade and how the initial plan was to kill myself at 30 but I thought I'd give it a bit more time. So far, it hasn't been worth it and probably never will.

Thankfully my cats are with my mom and they love and adore each other so...yeah. I'm ready to go. Can't wait to be free at last."
348,1,I completely despise everything and everyone is just pathetic. Can someone please tell me something funny to make me have some joy in my life?
349,1,"I feel so suicidal. I've been depressed ever since I can remember but this feels like a new low. And yet I have nothing to feel so bad about. Anything, the smallest possible thing just drives me absolutely nuts and I wish I had a gun. I would have pulled the trigger a million of years ago."
350,1,"My fiancé (27m) has been micro and emotional cheating on me (27f) for months with people online. We've been together for 8 years. This is the second time he's done this because he's bored. Of me? Of his life? Unclear, I thought we were happy. Going out on dates, having sex on the regular, planning our wedding...

I love him. 
He's my first everything.
My best friend.
My safe place.
The one I want to hold me.
He's my future.

But the longer I sleep next to him, the more I see him checking out other women, the more I see him revert back, the more I realize that for the last 8 years I've been little more than a sexual object to him, the more I realize he'll never love me the way I loved him 

I want to let go. I want to sleep. I want to forget. I want to be loved. 

I want Hades to embrace me in His arms and tell me l'm safe, that I can rest.

I'm so tired
of fighting to live a life that keeps hurting me
Of acting like everything is okay
Of forcing food in my mouth that tastes like ash
Of hanging on for my cats
Of trying to 
Live"

356,1,All I do is mess everything up and fail. And just when I think I’m starting to get better and get it together I find a way to ruin it. I’m a terrible friend who makes excuses to not see people but I still can’t even get anything productive done for myself. I’m just so stressed and hungry and exhausted that I’m tired of trying. I don’t want to rely on a bunch of medication to keep me from wanting to rip my skin off or uncontrollably cry. I feel so much shame and just like an embarrassment. 
357,1,"I lost my gf a little over a month ago now to suicide. I’ve been trying to put one foot in front of the other as they say but I made my choice. I told the therapist, everyone says I’ll get through it but I don’t wanna get through it. I want it to stop. I want it to end. I’m not interested in any version of life without her. I got in a fight with my mom. I just wanna push her away. I want her to hate me cause I know she’ll be the one that hurts the most. I’m really drunk and that always makes me feel like I could be strong like she was and go through it. I really wanted it to tonight. Then I realized all I have are a bunch of dull kitchen knives. She used my gun to do it and the police haven’t given it back to me. I just ended cutting myself. I’m so weak. She would’ve joined me in an instant no matter what. Why can’t I seem to do the same for her. I’m so scared. I really wanna be with her. "
358,1,I'm awkward so sad I'm always alone. I have no home my mom is an enemy that claims she loves me. I lost my dog of 14 years the only being that will ever unconditionally love me. I don't know why I even try to hold on they don't value my kind on this Earth I'm no better than dirt I can't even feel the hurt I'm numb and one day I hope I succumb to my depression as rapidly as possible

Hi everyone. I'm 25NB, and I could really use some advice and support right now, as I'm dealing with some pretty serious suicidal thoughts right now.

I feel so lost right now. I'm in a lot of debt due to a lot of poor financial decisions, I work in fast food, which constantly messes with my mental health, and I feel like it's never gonna get better. I can't keep up with school, I hate my job, and I feel like a constant disappointment to those around me, especially my family. I live with my sister- and she's been an incredible rock for me to lean on, but I'm both a financial and emotional burden to her right now, and kills me inside. I refuse to make that burden any heavier by going to her for this.

I want to do better, but it seems like I'm my own worst enemy, and it's getting in the way of every aspect of my life. I can't keep a job, and I can barely take care of myself, and it leaves me feeling hopeless and alone. Today I went to work and I had to leave early because I just couldn't stop crying. I cried the whole walk home, and I'm STILL crying now. 

It feels like I can see the rest of my life being miserable, like I'll always be useless and helpless and worthless. I don't want to live a life like this. I don't want to keep living if it means I'll be in my sixties, still working at a McDonald's, where I'll die working a job that I loathe for minimum wage. 

I have no friends- I used to have hobbies, but nothing feels fun anymore. I just rot in bed all day because I'm tired ALL THE TIME. I'm in DBT and I see a therapist once a week, but it's just not helping, and I've started skipping because I can't focus on the two hour skills group I have to go to every week. 

I'm so scared of dying, but this doesn't feel like a life worth living. I know people would miss me but ultimately I feel like me being gone would be better for them in the long run. 

I'm tired of feeling like a pathetic loser. I'm so ashamed of myself. I'm drowning in guilt and this place I'm in is so dark. The only thing I live for are my cats. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know who to talk to. I don't know where to go. It all feels redundant, because I don't think anyone or anything can help me at this point. I think I'm beyond saving. I think I'm just broken, or something. I've been to the hospital several times in the last year, and it's humiliating every time I go back. I feel like a liar. I feel like I'm taking space and resources from someone they can actually help.

In another life, I would have really loved to be a nurse or something. Someone who helps people. But I don't think it's this one, and it tears me up inside. 

Sorry for the long post. I had to get it out somewhere. If you got this far, thank you for listening. It means a lot. "
360,1,"I don’t want to be here anymore…I’m tired. I’m tired of living with this chronic illness and I’m tired of being in pain all of the time. I don’t want to be here anymore. I’m tired of struggling, I’m tired of the constant hospital visits. I’m tired of being poked everywhere, I’m tired of the cold shoulder I get from my parents, I’m tired of being alone and not getting any support. I’m tired of everything. I’ve been looking for different ways on how to do it, and I hope I find one"
361,1,"This is the first time ive used reddit and I'll probably forget about it but, my brain is such a mess and here I am.

Recently I was...for lack of a better phrase shit on by my mother. In front of my father and siblings for suggesting that she was being too harsh with her own mother my granny that has recently had multiple visits to the ER.
She was misdiagnoised and treated poorly at the same hospital I had a stay in over the summer for my own issues.

It has since ruined my life.
Juggling taking care of an older woman who is slowly giving up due to pain...While putting much needed distance with my parents has broken me to my bones.

My siblings who I love have no idea how to handle it all.
They know what she's saying and doing is wrong...They know a burden was put on my shoulders that shouldnt have...and they know it cost me my job (For all the time i had to take off and calls I had to take at work)

And it has hit a point where it has effectively ruined my marriage.
I dont blame my wife for her resentment (I have become an emotionaless blob and I try to be present but the constant torment empties me) I blame myself for letting my parents walk over me for years.(Im close to hiting the big 30) For causing the very trauma I suffer from...for overmedicating me as a child and even more as a teenager.

But in the short span of 2025 my life has turned upsidedown and I'm being tormented by my parents through my family...and I have lost the woman I love because I have nothing left in me.

I have been so against suicide my whole life.
Ive personally suffered from someone leaving this world by there own hand.
And ive always suffered from thoughts but ive always had the spine and confidence to work through it.

But Ive never been so isolated. Ive never felt so empty to the point where nothing is more familiar then something.

I can't mask the pain.
I cant mask the heartbreak. And I know it caused my wife to walk on eggshells but I wasnt built for this...Some
of us werent built to be fighters...just lovers and givers...and everyone tells you to protect yourself and put up boundries...your mental health means the most but no one ever told me
it would mean the beginning of the end that no matter who they are too you they are capable of hurting you to your core."
362,1,"My life isn't that bad at all, I have no idea why I feel like this. I have only a little trauma, a good home life, and am never bullied. I just feel like all of my friends hate me and 10s of tiny, really tiny triggers just make me want to do it. This will be my 26th attempt, I've been trying ever since December 26th, 2024. I know the world would be better without me, I don't believe hell exists, but if it does, I'll go there. My friends worry and tell me not to, but I think they're just trying to get me to survive longer, so they can eventually manipulate me into feeling worse. I've been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder, with really long depressive episodes that last months and only have a week or two of breaks between them. I'm in a mixed episode right now, depressive and hypomania, and I just don't feel good. I might do it on a call with someone to help support me while I'm doing it. I don't know if that's a bad idea or not."
363,1,"Cant really deal with my emotions anymore. Tried therapy, meds, shrooms, weed, ketamine, gym, yoga, meditating, list goes on. I am dead inside, and my anxiety levels are always high or depression is strong. I haven't worked in years, and society see's me as a loser. I dont know how people dont do it, maybe because they have girlfriends, or a good job, or something to keep them going. I haven't really done it yet because im too scared and dont wanna hurt my family but ffs. Sigh. I dont wanna hurt my mom. But it is what it is. When they die i'll definitely do it, in the middle of a forest somewhere, no phone for any one to rescue me just me alone. "
364,1,"[21M] I know I just made a post here two days ago , I promise this will be my last one to avoid repetition 

Truth is , I'm not going to make it out of this. 

Initially my plan was to wait til 30 before making any drastic decisions but there's been a change of plans

I never would've thought that being ugly could destroy a persons life this much but now here I am at age 21 with absolutely nothing but a guitar and nostalgia

I fell for someone about a year ago , it got serious. I thought I had a good thing going for once , I was chasing a dream that I thought was in reach , until I realized she had been using me the entire time as some sort of inside joke/scam , whatever it was certainly  WASN'T a relationship ....Its a long story

I've been hurt before but nothing hurt more than finding out that my ""first love"" was just another humbling encounter for me

I was never the smoothest guy , I fumbled and made a fool of myself because I was always so nervous around her. I was afraid of boring her and I was afraid she would walk away.

One day she hangs up the phone and tells me that I am boring to talk to , and told me not to call her but even afterthat she would ask me to call her when she got bored. I did the best I could , my best wasn't enough. She was beginning to resent me 

It was around December when she made a post on IG stating that she was done with me , she added me three times this month just to rub it in my face.

the funny part in all this is that she truly was better of without me. Even I'm better off without me.




 
"
365,1,"I’m overwhelmed by the pointlessness of trying to live mindfully in the face of carelessness, cowardice, cruelty, and exploitation. 

The rules apply differently to everyone based on things they largely can’t control. 

Mistakes are inevitable and lead to inevitable pain.

There’s no right way to do anything, just varying ways to do things wrong. 

😑 "
366,1,"Sorry, I don’t really know if this is NSFW 

I think the title should be very straight forward. I’m only 14 and have been depressed for the past 7 years, and today has been a very hard day. I struggle a lot with motivation, considering my household is incredibly neglectful to me and also my other siblings. 

I’ve been passively suicidal for as long as I can remember. I don’t have many friends, my online friends are frequently busy and I just lost my (what I thought was) close support group and I can’t help but miss them. I want someone in my life that actually cares for me and loves me, and I know I’m incredibly young, but I can’t find a reason to keep pushing forward. 

I have multiple learning disabilities (Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, and more) and I just recently found out I cannot graduate, and I have to repeat the grade due to funding being cut off. My parents hate me, I feel incredibly lonely and I don’t have anything going for me. I get frequently bullied with not many people to help, and I don’t have any trusty support. 

Can someone please give me advice or comfort to continue moving on? Thanks "
367,1,"It happens so fast yall, be careful"
368,1,Not sure how or when but I’m going to end my life soon. I’m sick of being in abusive relationships with family friends and spouses. There’s no point in me being anymore. I’m done. Good bye 
369,1,"My girlfriend left me yesterday and it's finally sinking in. I'm fucking in my 40's and I can't make it more than a year with someone. They always say the same shit too, ah you are so kind, and open and smart and all that stuff but they just don't love me. What's the point of having all these supposed qualities if they aren't worth anything to anyone? I've failed my life so hard, and I just want to be loved and to love. I really had thought this time I had met my person, I was willing to work for it. But I guess I just can't be loved that way. I'm barely visible to women on my best day. What's the point if all there is to my life is work and coming home to fucking nothing. Might as well finish it now if that's the rest of my life, which it most likely will be, cause despite having all these supposed qualities women supposedly want, I've been alone for most of my 40 fucking years. At this age it's hard as hell to find a partner, so I guess I have to look forward to getting old with no hope of anything getting better, no thanks. I'd rather finish it now and be done with all this bullshit. I am not worth keeping alive anyways."
370,1,"I feel this is the appropriate subreddit for this, throwaway account bc y’know.

So, this is really hard. I’m not the suicidal one, but I used to be. As far as I know, he’s not suicidal either. However, his friend is. He’s young and unstable, and my brother is a great friend who’s trying to help him out in his time of need. However, he (friend) just got out of the hospital for an OD over a girl he dated for less than three weeks and is now keeping my brother up til 3am begging him not to end his life. My brother is so angry because that’s the only way he knows how to express his feelings, and I’m so scared for him. I don’t know what to do. It’s draining him and making him depressed and I’m the only one he’s confiding in. I don’t want him to lose a friend so young, he’s not even 15, and I really don’t want him to have to deal with the trauma of having his friend die on the phone. I know that what’s like. He feels so responsible for everything that goes wrong around him, and I’m afraid this will break him. I usually always know what to do, but I’m at a loss. How do I help my baby brother in this situation?"
371,1,"AND BTW TS IS NOT a only relationship advice question!!!

Before you ask: No, this isn’t some attention grab. Maybe it is. Fuck if I don't know anymore.

school is pointless. i'm either failing or barely passing. no one cares why

my family just yells or ignores me. they don't know me. they don't want to. I am not going any further than that. I don't want to 'criminalise them' or get them in trbl

friends? lol. they have their own lives. i'm just background noise. They r not even real anymore. Im js a 3rd wheel. or a last option. or js friends bcz of pity points

future? what future? i can't even get through today.

.Been weighing options. Overd8se looks goof , but feels overdone. Inhaling something? Joke’s on me my asthma would probably tap out first. Or just walk into traffic or jump out smth. Quick. Simple. Part of me wants to wait it out till 21, though. Let the “gone too soon” thing hit harder. like “oh so young” or whatever.Tho i do have a gf. And no idrc. Yes im young watever some might support it. some won't. I like her and so on. We chat alot and so on.. i js feel bad for her if i do it. Like i gave her false hope. Like i betrayed her. Like i lied to her? Bcz ik those feelings too well. SHE Texts me like I'm worth missing. Says ""I love you"" and that means alot. And I love her too, that's the worst part. Love her enough to know what my absence would do to her. Love her enough to hate myself for even thinking about it. he’s the only good thing left. the only reason my phone lights up with something that isn’t emptiness. she says my name like it means something, touches me like i’m not already rotting from the inside out. and i love her. i love her so much it fucking *hurts*.AND ITS WEIRD BCZ WE R ON THE VERY YOUNG SIDE. SO I FEEL LIKE WHAT IM SAYING IS CORNY

and the guilt is *eating me alive*. if i stay, i might js hurt her. I always make stupid mistakes. IM JS.. & its bcz that’s all i’ve ever beena fucking burden, a problem, a mistake. she deserves so much better than me. she deserves someone who isn’t already dead inside.

i don’t know why she loves me. i don’t know why she stays. but she does, and that’s the worst part. because now, no matter what i do, i’m hurting her. and i *hate* myself for it. i hate myself for being too weak to stay, and too weak to leave. i hate myself for making her care. i hate myself for not being the person she thinks i am.  
Like i don't even look good. Part of me js DONT want anyone i met face 2 face/ my 'friends' to confront me about it. I js feel idk

SO thats THE main reason why Im not doing it. Or 'trying not to'

I js feel sick bcz i overthink alot.I don't deserve her , I Lmao im alr exhausted from typing ts out bcz im so bad @ expressing myself. I js go blank....Maybe i alr repeated points idk

Not here for debates or “talk to someone” lectures. Just stuck in my own head. All the shit I wanted feels impossible now, so I’m stuck on ideas/logic:

Letters? Doubt they’d read them Or they’d cry for a week then forget.

pills? which ones actually work? how many would I need to make sure?what if i just end up in the hospital, more of a burden than before?

Clean my room? pointless. they’d just throw my shit out anyway.

Would my phone still track my location?

blades? too scared. too messy. what if i don't cut deep enough? what if someone walks in?

hanging? where? how? what if the rope snaps? what if i panic last second?

jumping? from where? not tall enough buildings nearby. what if i survive and end up worse?

just stop eating? slow. painful. but maybe i deserve that.

Would they find all the cringe in my search history?

carbon monoxide? don't have a garage. don't have a car. typical. WELL rn our is automatic electirc

now we dont have one anymore

drowning? heard it's peaceful but my survival instinct would probably fuck that up too

Go somewhere? buses are cheap. trains go farther. can’t fly ‘cause i’m not old enough. ironic. Isn't it.

Or just wait? Only thing holding me back is js what ifs and only reason i haven’t yet is ‘cause i’m scared it’ll hurt.

Everyone js knows the version of me that laughs too loud and overshares . They don’t know the rest. wouldn’t care if they did. they’d pretend, sure. out of guilt. then move on.

it’s kinda funny, posting this like i’m asking for fucking product recommendations. but whatever. shows how desperate i am. Like I'm comparing fucking microwave models instead of ways to stop existing. ""Does it hurt?"" ""Is it messy?"" ""What's the success rate?"" Pathetic. But here we are.

Cyanide sounds efficient but I’m not Walter White or if I knew where to get it .but where the fuck does a nobody like me even get that? amazon prime? . Triggering an asthma attack is also an option.except knowing my bad luck, i'd just wake up in the ER with some nurse saying ""you're so lucky"" while i'm calculating how much the ambulance bill's gonna be. Wearing a DNR bracelet seems like a good plan. BUT DNR bracelet feels like cheating. like yeah, sure, let me just tap out mid-surgery when some poor doctor's elbow-deep in my failure. ""do not resuscitate"" - more like ""do not bother, this model's defective"".

The real joke? How fucking normal I look right now. Phone in hand, music playing, face blank. Nobody would guess I'm drafting my own exit interview. Nobody ever guesses. That's the worst part - realizing how easy it is to hide when you've spent your whole life pretending.

the best part? i'm probably gonna post this and then go make dinner like nothing's wrong. laugh at a meme. text my girl ""goodnight <3"" like my heart's not a black hole. that's the real horror show - how easy it is to be dead while still technically alive. Like don't want to be replaced. Maybe i want to skip a few years of my life. Maybe i don't I just don't understand my fucking self. NOR do i know how i'll ever explain

AND DONT GET ME WRONG I LOVE HER SO MUCH IM FUCKING OBSSED. maybe that's not good 4 my age but im alr fucked and defective so what would you expect lmao.

Don't bother with the concerned replies. Don't @ me with hotline numbers. I'm not here for a 'redemption arc'.

I haven't covered all the options. I haven't covered everyth i wanted to say. icba. I doubt ts post will gain any recognition anyways.& I Won't bcz Some things are too ugly even for this. But if you've got notes from your own research, feel free to share. Jokes welcome. Judgment expected, screenshot this for your ""look how sad this kid was"" compilation.screenshot this for your ""look at this tragic little bitch"" collection and tag your friends or don't. the world's gonna keep spinning either way . Silence is fine too. like i told someone and i got totally ridiculed.  
And yes i do have dates/ specific time id want to die.

I mean i haven't chose for myself alot. I mainly js go w the crowd /flow

Ts took long. aka i've edited and re read ts alot. bcz maybe it might be the last thing i post.

I js get the miner effect of missing out or is ts it or smth idek how to say. (¯\_(ツ)\_/¯)

My mental health seems soo bad but also isn't i cant tell i js end up hiding it alot ig??  
and i wish someone could tell but they can't bcz ALL i do is smile  
And lately i've been feeling dizzy and everyth goes black , thats so embarassing lol.  
And i was like maybe i'd use a unviolent way right aka running away but our group alr got caught so we postponing it.  
Another thing the person i love texting is js texting less. dont get me wrong im stupif. but i now miss it. i feel so empty. i can't stop worring, has she lost interest.  
I've self diagnosed alot, ik its bad so i won't mention what i think i have  
I've harmed myself alot but for some reason i keep healing  
I do have quite ab8seive parents.

Im js targeted my other siblings rn't  
i don't plan AT all to sue or call the police on them bcz im not runing other lives js bcz of me.  
Im already selfish.

and my mind js changes perspective consatnly. And I don't even know whats me anymore  
i've taken commiting suicide to a tiny break  
keeping in mind im still a minor  
. My tests scores r shit. im a total disappointment, so perhaps i deserve this? At parents meeting my teacher called me an idiot and stuff and i practically got disassembled.  
Note: Now iv'e found a few /lots of friends online. But im scared. ALOT. Because all my past experiences was stuff behind my back, love bombing, and them leaving me or betraying me.  
I get attached easily.  
And im totally diff socially.  
Idek man. When i explain i js struggle so hard, my mind blanks so saying tthis much is already hard enough for me. and i cant be asked to correct this anymore. i've corrected the first few paras.  
I js feel like a total human defect.

I feel guilty for her choosing me tho im greatful asf

im js scared. lost and confused.

And if i do suicicde iim gonna make her worry. i can't do that can i?  
i mean my parents will cry for a bit and move on ig.

And the funny fact is after typing ts out, ill go back to school normal life like nth ever happened.

just this repeating and staying in my mind.

im just so twisted

i can't untwist my mind. and explain everything.

Another thing is i we had a friend group and another girl was in it right, we had an arguement like i dont even like you or watevr. I DIDNT/ NEVER WANTED TO SAY THIS/ IT JS CAME in my mouth like a fuck

later she died from an accident aka most likely suicide. i fucking did this to a person. It shld've been me not her. She was a great person, a person way better than me.

Im js a bunch of problems. Dying w pain is js scary . Lol i feel like dazaii (anime from bungo stray dogs)

there are stuff i wanted to do w my gf or someone i wanted to be or try out idek

I js feel sick. SIXCK  
i don't know what else to say.

sorry this is long.

sorry for swearing

sorry if this came offensive to anyone.

Im always sorry

And i keep bluffing random things and i easily get jealous aswl

i hate that aswl  
AND BTW TS IS NOT ASKING ADVICCE ON RELATIONSHIP!!  
AND FUNNY THING IS, UNLESS I TELL YOU I LOOK PERFECTLY FINE, YES I JOKE ABOUT SUICIDE BUT OUR CCLASSMATES THINK IM ACC JOKING LOL

OH WELL IDEK  
i genuinely wish i wasn’t born in this body. Im so fucking cooked

i js don't fit in this world. It's like I give my self a false sense of hope when deep down I know I have nothing to live for and I miserably fail every time as a human being. Just wish I could get the courage to act on it.and finally rest.

And people js sometimes disgust me, our skl has a high reputation and im not disclosing which school i go to, but it js full of unkind,hateful,racist and sexist and homo people, and they r js neeks, i dont fit at all.

its js suffocating

i get attached to easily so i easily get betrayed. Im js tired aswl.idek how to explain ts feeling. its too messy

Doing suicide is always in my mind.

I js don't talk alot about it, and speaking to somepeople abt it angers me. i feel pathetic. And i hate myself unbearably.

Im am js bunch of faulty DNA.

Im a teen alright but having acne and shit teeth and shit parenting and everyth js too tiring

And i made new friends. ONLINE ofc. i wish i cld js get a long hug by them.

I love physical touch. Im obsessed w it. Esp on my head or js a hug lol.

idek

soz it was random loL. i Frgt what i said but if i havnt mentioned it my parents r quite ab8sive but i wont say anth further bcz i don't wanna 'criminalise them' I'll prolly delete ts post soon

as soon well in a few weeks im probably going to run away. and commit suicide, whether it be by a gun, accident or smth. or maybe i js go missing idek.

I've probably abandoned my future and thats scary.

i js hate it.

Idek who i am anymore, and i easily get jealous of stuff. Having a friend give me less attention or have  more fun just hurts. I don't belong anywhere. I wld've been crying rn but im tired. ive editied ts too amny times and added lots and lots. I js understand them, don't blame them, blame it on me. Afterall im not WORTH anything, who am I to expect some attention from them.

Please pray on success of my suicide

I know it sounds silly

Or js hope smth happens which will make me truly happy

I wish my relationship w here reverts to normal, that wil do smth/ mean alot to me. WE barely speak, and now i cant bring the courage to teext her anymore. i js dk. im gone anyways.

Bye

And moderators, if the police do want to question you about this, please just delete this post. I don't want to criminalise anyone or let the news go kabooming about me and ts post.

Thank you in advance"

I also hate when they think they understand and also hate that I hate it, like that endless self doubt, but I still find things to blame them on, like everyone I know for putting pressure on me, and literally joking about how I'm gonna commit suicide, but also I don't like playing the victim, I prefer to torture myself which also saying feels like playing the victim.

Why do I want approval from this who don't believe me? Also them joking about suicide brings the feeling of peace just like that feeling when you hear someone singing about shooting themselves, it's just fun and so relaxing."

It is one thing to support decriminalization of sex work, but it is entirely another thing to push people to commit crimes.

the first time i remember thinking “it would be better if i died” i was 10. and 12 years later here 
i am.. exhausted and worthless..
it’s bad this time. it’s not my first severe depressive episode but it’s so much worse than last time. i truly believe there is no way out of this pain except to die. 
i know it’s selfish but i mean nothing anyways. all i do is burden the people around me with my pain. and they’ll be better off without me… i wish i could say i wanted to keep fighting, but i don’t. i just want to disappear. 
i know how i’m going to do it, i know when,
i know what gifts i’m giving, i know what notes i’m writing and i’m not going to fail this time.. i cant fail this time… 

i know this post is super dark. and i really don’t expect anyone to respond or feel bad for me. i just needed to get it off my chest before i really go through with it…

At this point, I’m not looking for help. I want to end it. It’s my life, it’s my choice. I don’t see why so society has to make it so hard to end it.

I’m 23F, and I have no close friends, no boyfriend, my health, my career and my income is going straight to hell, my parents are getting more and more disappointed with me (and they already hate my loser - single fat unemployed older brother). I’ve been losing hair for 7 years and it does not grow back, it only gets worse. I’ve numerous genetic disorders (connective tissue disorder that led to deformity in my chest, TMJ disorders, recessed jaw, flat feet), hypothyroidism with a huge goiter. My career is not interesting to me and it’s too late to change it. My country is in the middle of the war and most of my friends left the country, and I was too focused on my health problems to leave. Now it’s too late. 

I don’t know what to do with my career because i’m afraid of losing what I have, I have no success with my health problems and too depressed to look for a relationship and friendships. I just don’t have anything to offer. 

It was better when I was in a relationship but I was too ugly to keep me. It was better when I had friends but I was too anxious to be happy around them. It was better when I was more invested into my career but then I got anxious of not getting enough sleep and fucking up my health even worse,  started working part-time (now I’m fucking around without much work done mostly) and now I’m risking to lose it all. It was better when I was hitting the gym but I always keep quitting because of spikes of being super busy with my useless masters degree. It was better when I was more into my studies but I’m always distracted by anxiety about my health…. "
390,1,"for some context, i (22f) and my bf (25m) have known each other since late 2022 and started dating april 2023, due to some issues most of our relationship was long distance but we’re in the same city for about 8 months now and going back to long distance we also don’t live together. when we first started dating he said that me becoming his friend in 2022 has gotten him out of a very dark place mentally and he’s grateful for having me so a part of me believed that if i did it then without knowing then i can definitely do it again. during our long distance we fought a lot. the distance, the uncertainty of if we’re ever gonna meet soon, life etc.. it drained both of us and to him it got to the point that he couldn’t take it anymore (also im not saying he was suicidal just because of our problems, he had a lot going on) and had to put safe words to know when to just stop the argument and talk him off the edge. i think it happened twice then but im glad he didn’t go through with it. then i came to the country he’s in for exams and i stayed because i hated long distance with every cell in my body and things felt amazing until it wasn’t. last december he went through a depressive episode and i did everything i could to get him out of it, it took me a month but he was finally stable. we’ve both talked about use both getting professional help (im pretty sure i’ve undiagnosed anxiety, adhd and serious anger issues and he’s got depression) but the lack of motivation he has towards it is not encouraging to me so we kinda let that thought go. 
for two weeks now he’s grown distant and colder towards me, my mom came to this country and she needs my help with a bunch of stuff so im not as free as i was for him (we used to see each other 5 times a week) and im these two weeks i’ve met him twice. our arguments are less but he feels so distant and im seeing a part of him that i’ve never seen. i tried to push him to talk to me about what’s going on and he said he’s tired of running after life and working and he’s tired of his life and i didn’t think it was a red code level of tiredness, i thought it was that moment that we all have but get right back up but i don’t think he’s getting back up. he hasn’t been returning my i love yous, he has been hiding stuff from me and he’s been telling me to take care of myself a lot and im freaking the hell out. 
i need help i dont know what to do im not perfect and our relationship isn’t perfect but we love each other and i wont be in a life without him i want to help but he’s completely shut down help i dont know what to do "
391,1,"I don't know if anyone can help me because the things I need right now are simply not within reach... So please don't waste your energy on me if you think this is going to have a clear solution.

I\\m a 30 year old guy from the Netherlands (idc about anonymity) who has dealt with mental health stuff for as long as he can remember.

My husband recently broke up with me after an 11 year long relationship, and I don't know how to deal with it or the living situation I am currently in.

The living situation is perhaps the most difficult, even though it is the simplest on paper. I was asked to leave our home (I will be paid out) and now I don't have a place of my own. I am currently staying at a friend's place, where I have my own small room with just enough space for a desk, a bed and some clothes. I don't want to make it seem like I am complaining because I am very grateful he offered me his room, but it simply isn't ideal/not a long term solution.

I can't afford a place on my own because I don't have any solid income. I am in a fight with the system about whether or not they should pay me benefits. I am severely visually impaired, have a personality disorder + AuDHD + severe depression so I am under the impression I can't work for 30 hours a week - they are under the impression I am.

(For anyone Dutch reading this: 'sociale huur' is not an option because of various reasons.)

I can 'technically' go back to my parents if the alternative is to sleep on the streets, but my parents (mostly my mom) and I have a difficult relation and this is not something that would last longer than a few months at most.

So basically, if my friend has to move (which is going to happen within a few months because this building is going to be demolished) I am fucked.

I mainly cope with this situation by trying to live day by day. I try to do some volunteering work where I can, and I try to be with friends often. But on the days I don't have much going on, all I can do is lay in bed. I was already depressed - the break-up didn't help.

(As for 'getting help' for my mental health... I am trying to get therapy but waiting lists are insane. I see a psychiatrist (I got a new one, at a new place) maybe once a month.)

\---

As for the actual break-up... Today I visited my/our old place to see my pet rats. They mean the world to me, but I couldn't bring them to my friend's place. I can see them once a week without my husband there, until I have to hand in the keys... Then it's going to be even more difficult.

Thing is, even entering the hallway to my/oud old home fucks me up. The sounds, the smells, everything. It's like coming home - except it isn't. It's just too much and I can't process all these emotions. Today I ended up scratching myself impulsively when I was at our old place... even though I have been clean from self harm (both actual cutting but also these impulsive mess ups) for 7 months. I wanted to cut myself badly, but I didn't. However, the urges haven't really calmed down and the thoughts haven't been this persistent since the break-up... The inner voice says things like: 'how much longer are you going to keep up this charade? - You can't beat this.' - It's getting bad again and I really don't want to also slip back into that... :/

I haven't really been able to grieve properly since it's hard for me to process emotions. I'm stuck in a hopeless situation without the person that used to help me navigate all these emotions. I was way too dependent on him, I realize that now. But that doesn't make it any easier.

I didn't see this coming.

I often thought my life couldn't get much shittier (considering the fact I live in a first world country, count your blessings, bla bla bla) and then it did by tenfold.

I just don't know how much longer I can keep this up.

I'm joking about ending it all a little too often and I also feel like my friends are getting tired of me and my depression and negativity so I try to bother them less...

That's why I am here, pouring my heart out to some strangers.

I don't know what else to say."
392,1,"Since my post from a few days ago on R/depression was ignored, making me feel quite angry, I’m gonna copy everything here in hopes that I see some comments. 

Why do I have to be kept in the dark??

I’m sick of Google never actually showing me search results on how to kill myself. I’m fifteen years old, and I’m sick of my anxiety, autism, and depression making everything terrible. Pair that with the fact that I’m a lazy person who doesn’t even try to put in effort, and there isn’t really a good reason for me to be alive. I know it’s in the rules to be nice and support the people posting, so everyone in the comments is gonna say “there’s so much to live for!” Or “you’re not alone!” Or “think about your family!” As if the suicidal person hasn’t heard that shit a million times already. 


First of all, I don’t want that “so much to live for.” Do you think that I would feel this way if I wanted what life has to offer? I don’t want responsibility, and I don’t want to be stuck with my brain anymore, even worse if I lived with it for 70 or so years years. Second of all, no shit I’m not alone. There’s 8 billion people on earth, and 1/8th of the world has mental problems. Knowing that another kid feels like me doesn’t change shit, in fact, it makes me angry because it makes me feel less important, though I already don’t value myself too much. Third of all, I do think about my family. I would be pissed if I was the parent who put so much money into their child so they could have a good life, just for them to end it. 


And no, I don’t need to hear someone say “I love you” BECAUSE I KNOW THAT!!! If nobody loved me, I wouldn’t have been taken care of as a baby, and would’ve starved to death or been abandoned. And for the people who say “suicide isn’t the answer!” Who are YOU to tell ME what the answer to life is??? Everything in life is perspective based. 


I’m lonely, but i don’t plan to ever act on it. It don’t want to go outside and read a book. I don’t want to talk to people or make friends. I have a bad relationship with my mom compared to my dad because since they’re divorced, they live in two different homes. So I’ve spent more time with my dad than my mom, now I can’t even text her on the phone. No matter how many times she reassures me that I can talk to her whenever, I just don’t. 


I’m not someone who says “I wanna kill myself” for the shock value or to get attention. I say it because it’s true, and there’s no other way to describe how I feel. I have no motivation, goals, and ambitions, and I’m trying to warn my family that trying to help me is pointless because I’m just gonna end up as a basement dweller. The definition of a waste of space. Find 10 good things to say about me, or anything, I can find 10 bad things to say. I refuse all sorts of help. I ask “what am I supposed to do??” To someone, they give me and answer, and I don’t wanna do it.


I know I’m too lazy to do stuff, so I just don’t do it. If I had a job that I didn’t like, I wouldn’t do it, which would result in me being fired. Being fired means no money. No money means no house. No house means homeless. Being homeless will further fuck up my already bad mental health, and will probably fuck me up physically. Then I’ll seriously be able to kill myself. I don’t know any methods, because for some reason, people care so goddamn much about people that they don’t even know ending their life. I lack empathy, so it’s hard for me to grasp reasons why police and fire fighters exist, and why people want to save others so much instead of worrying about themselves. Due to people caring so much, I can’t find any methods on Google that would be painless. It sucks. I don’t even know why I think putting this post here will help, when all I’ll get is the generic sympathy comments instead of honesty. I do nothing all day except play games and watch anime because they bring me comfort. But each day that passes, everything seems meaningless to me. Then reality hits me that I’m fifteen and will be 18 in less than half a decade, and then I just don’t even wanna try anymore. But I never wanna try anyway. I can’t explain it, but I have such little motivation that I don’t wanna try to try. I hate effort and responsibility so much that i literally won’t do anything. Sometimes I won’t even play video games and I’ll just sit in silence. No matter how much motivational talk you give me, it won’t work. No matter how many reasons you give me to live, it won’t work. I HATE seeing others happy and successful, so much that I block YouTube videos about things that most people would be happy to see. I recently found out that you can overdose on NyQuil, which is the nearest and most accessible thing I can use to kill my self, that that gives me relief and makes me feel good. The issue is that I need a plan, and I wanna make sure to clear things that I own, like my game accounts and phone. "
393,1,"I just needed to tell someone. I’m going to commit when I come home. Before summer ends, before idk. But i will be gone and i wont feel anything anymore forever. I’m going to hang myself in my bedroom, i have a little hook on my roof and there I will hang. I always knew i wasn’t going to live a long life though, so I never bothered even trying getting a good future. On Thursday I’m going on a month long vacation with my sister and her family. It will be my last month, my last big memories. Atleast she will have something to remember me by and maybe someday in the future she will look back on it. 

I just needed someone to hear this and I wont change my mind I just feel so alone and I cant tell anyone cause they wont listen. I’ll probably post again before I go through with it."

I hate this curse (autism) that I have. I'm drunk as hell right now and can't seem to connect with people at all. I've been isolated for years and it hurts. She was fucking someone behind my back. And now I'm back to my reclusive isolated state. I beg for this to end. I wish the universe didn't do this to me.

Now I'm contemplating if I should jump off a bridge or not. I just want someone who understands me for once. I told my family my thoughts and I know they don't give a damn about me. I'm 23 and I haven't done anything with my life. Flunked out of college, jobless, penniless, I'm a loser. All I ask for is a friend so I don't have to jump off a bridge and feel eternal peace for once in my miserable life.

I want someone to talk with me. I just need help I know I need desperately but will never get. Im sorry for what I did I'll apologize a million fold for what I've done. But it's useless cause im a lost cause. Why do things have to be so cruel? Please just give me relief for once.

My ex recently broke up with me and waa sleeping with another guy behind my back. She developed a meth habit, despite me warning about it being bad for her mental health. And guess what the guy said? He dmed saying ""I'm fucking your bitch now. Now what"" and that was like twisting the knife further into the wound while pouring salt in it. I swear autism is a curse, a social repellent that makes people weary of me. I just want to be accepted for once. Why is it so hard? Please just someone to talk with me.

I do being a Christian since a child get some prayers asked but for my mental illnesses to be taken away, I feel like they will never go away. All I want is for them to go away so i can function like everyone else in society. I feel like I'm the only person in the world who really goes through this, quite lonely. When I come here in the suicide awareness groups I feel not alone, why is that so difficult for non- suicidal thinking people to understand?"
398,1,"(Sorry if this isn't appropriate, I tagged it NSFW bc of mention of sex work and some swearing. I will delete if necessary, I just really needed a place to vent.)

I'm a 26 year old woman living in the USA. I have a useless degree, unemployed, and still live with my parents. I've been applying to jobs since Novemeber last year, tweaked my resumes, talked to employment agencies, and still can't land a job. What is wrong with me?

I feel so bad for my parents because they're carrying a dead weight daughter in their 60s. They cannot support me anymore because every day they tell me how useless I am and that I'm going to be homeless, and that I need to get into nursing school this year as my last career. That I need to stop being a stupid crybaby and being too weak-willed, that there's nothing to cry about because I didn't even succeed in life anyway, how all my peers are way ahead in their life but not me.

I don't tell them much anymore because adding onto the stress to the whole family isn't worth anything, so I have been saving up money by selling my old stuff and being a prostitute on the down low. That's how bad it is, because I cannot, for the life of me, get an actual job because apparently being a fucking whore is all I'm good at. My parents keep claiming they'll die any day now for not having career aspirations and being jobless, so who else can maintain the bills? Everything is spiraling downwards.

I'm so tired and feel like total shit. I'm past the part of being full of regrets because I am just so tired. Now I'm stuck with college debt, depression, and the shame of unemployment. I am a failure to my family and as a human being, and I pray every night that God finally hears me and that I die in my sleep. He hasn't heard me for 8 years. I regret living, but I'm too much of a coward to end my own life. I don't know what else can I do, I feel like I'm already near my limit. I pray that an opportunity comes along and just ends it for me."

I was supposed to be dead by now, it's genuinely sickening and aggravating that I'm not. I couldn't go through with ending my life, and now I'm prehistoric. It's not fair.

In my mind, I'm still a kid. I never wanted to stop being a kid. I never wanted to stop being young. I spent my childhood going through trauma and now suffer childhood amnesia as a result.

I only spend my time idealizing the past, reminiscing how I could have spent that time in the past. I see things from years prior and can only think ""I was this age then. I wish I could be that age again.""

I'm never going to be a teenager again. I was supposed to die a teenager, I was supposed to be a kid forever. Why am I still here? The only comfort I get is from imagining my past and from imagining that I die before I get even older.

My mother sees me as I hate her because of things I said during a breakdown. Because once she lied about having cancer to manipulate me and scare me and she heard me venting about it to a friend. 

She suddenly exploded at me and threw a book at me and said she’s taking everything away from me after she made me dependent on her for everything. 

I’m diagnosed bipolar and ADHD but she doesn’t believe these things. She thinks me misplacing things and acting on impulse is me hating her somehow. She hates my existence so much. 

And I just got out of a relationship with a girl with BPD She left me cuz I drank. I stayed with her when she threatened me.  

I feel like a black hole. I don’t know what to do and I honestly want another breakdown like getting fired. I want to get the power to kill myself. I want everything to go to shit. I’m tired of this shitty life. I’m all alone. And I don’t want to burden anyone "
412,1,"I get into daily fights with my family, I love my mom, and she really loves me too, but I do nothing but break her heart every single day 

I don't connect with people anymore, I spend almost all of my day alone , in my parents room 

I don't give the slightest fuck about my friends anymore . I changed myself so much just to please them, but they didn't do nearly anything near that for me

I don't like to talk to people, I get distracted by my own thoughts 

I used to think that I have a future, but at the moment it all seems way too much 

I really wish to find the courage to do it, to stop procrastinating the inevitable 

Maybe it's just all way too much for a teenager but yeah, I'm just another child who wishes to simply snap out of existence "
413,1,"I've had suicidal thoughts for honestly about 8 years, ever since I was around 9/10. my family wasnt the best, I grew up in a pretty violent household (still am in it) my brother and dad physically fought and argued and my parents have argued and have been violent aswell. there's been police involvement a few times.

most recently was on saturday, i heard my mother screaming for my brother to let go of my dad and i had a panic attack, saw my brother choking my dad out on the floor and my mum trying to stop them. I've always heard it all but i think this was the first time I've actually seen it or atleast remembered it, because I've totally blocked out 90% of my childhood. I always thought it was normal, until I witnessed how other families act through friends ect. I went to my friends the next day and stayed the night at my girlfriends thankfully, but my family have just moved on from it and that's what they always do and as the consequence i had to learn how to apologise and now im a very anxious, depressed, suicidal person and I have been for literally since i was concious or maybe i havent ever really been concious, since i csnt remember shit from my childhood.

I don't know, a day doesnt go by where i don't think of killing or hurting myself in some way, and I just dont want to live anymore. I know my friends, girlfriend and maybe some family would be sad but I cant escape. it feels like ill never really get better and im afraid someday something will happen and it'll be the last straw. I don't know how much I can take anymore, when will I be able to escape if im still like this even though I should be happy?

thanks for reading, if someones actually reading this"
414,1,"there is a 10-11 story parking garage about 30 min from me. i’ve driven to it and stood at the top before to scope it out and plan. i am in so much pain and so unbelievably depressed. life feels miserable. once it gets dark, i am going to head there and jump. i’ve done research on fatality statistics and there is a 95-99% likelihood of death. i have letters written already and will leave them in my car. 

see y’all on the other side <3"
415,1,My mom passed a while ago and i just can't deal with it anymore. I've tried to go to therapy but it hasn't helped at all
416,1,"I‘m Female, 21 and I‘m starting to hate myself and the way I look again. I also have panic attacks and because of that I haven’t been able to work for about 2 years now. I also don’t have any friends anymore. Therapy and medication didn’t work. I don’t see any point in trying to hold on anymore and nothing really makes me happy anymore. I still live with my family and most of the time I’m at home because I‘m too scared of going out because of the panic attacks. I‘m thinking about suicide but I‘m scared of the pain and I also don’t want to ruin the lives of my family and boyfriend. "
417,1,"Ive exhausted every option, I apply to 40 jobs a day, i'm broke, i live at home, i have 2 fucking degrees (Biology & Nutrition), a fuck ton of debt and have gotten my resume done professionally 5 times. Ive been basically unemployed besides gig work for the past 5 years. Covid essentially was the jumpstart that ruined my life, Ive tried so many different avenues to better my situation but i'm so fucking sick and tired of being broke and just a loser. I have friends and i try to use my networks to find work but all i ever get is ""oh that sucks man , keep your head up i'm sure you'll find something eventually"". Im tired of trying to stay positive. Not to mention being fucking poor is so expensive. a 25 dollar payment i miss automatically becomes 80 because of bounced account fees and late fees. Im  just fucked and quite frankly the only reason i haven't done it already is because i don't own a way to do it with 100 percent efficiency. Idek what i want from this post i just needed to bitch about it, If i hear one of things will turn around i will actually crash out."
418,1,"I am stuck in a limbo between wanting to kill myself and not wanting to suffer the consequences if i fail, or get discovered in a morbid state. i feel awful. its such a painful battle and im not sure if life gets better. ive been suicidal since i was 11, im only 20. sometimes i scare myself thinking how ill look after ill commit and start crying, then i go back to planning it all. shit i probably have necessary tools but now its just the fear. I've attempted before and i just got a physical flashback of one of my attempts and i started crying seeking to distract my mind. i am not sure, there are so many circumstances that led me to this position and now im actively fighting between ""who cares about future"" and just crying unsure. the only reason why i didnt attempt yet again is because i am trying to find a summer job right now and i cannot show up at interviews with visible physical signs of attempts. i just am tired of being only seen and not acknowledged for the pain i am going through. i feel so lonely "
419,1,"Hey, my a 16F and i hate living, yea i know it might seem funny since i had dreams about dating someone until a month ago or so. Im failing a few subjects at school and everybody around me is driving me nuts by pressuring me to study, a while ago realization hit and i realized i didn't want to study cause I dont belive ill make it past 18. 

Ive grew up in a loving family, my dad died when i was 1 and grandma and grandpa when i was about 6 or 7, i go to school is a great private institution and im already in high school. I have a few friends that are doing a lot better than me and i keep comparing myself to them, since im the only person there that seems to be crazy. 

Ive been diagnosed with depression and anxiety during the pandemic, another child psychologist ive went to told me i have a personality disorder and i heavily agree on that. My mood changes constantly but the thing that most drives me mad is the violent thoughts, specially the murderous ones. 

Right now im on Wellbutrin/Zyban, prescripted ofc, but its been a week since i dont take it. 

I have a lot of medication around my house, a few knifes laying around as well and honestly? Seems worth trying 

"
420,1,"All my life I’ve wanted to be happy, to be supported, to have friends, all that stuff. Nowadays, I have zero friends and thus zero reasons to live. I’ve wanted my life to work out, but jack shit has changed. Every time I make progress, I manage to fuck everything up and ruin my life even more. I’m at my wits end. I don’t know what the fuck to do anymore.

It’s God’s fault. It’s his fault for making me the way I am. It’s his fault for not answering my questions when nobody else could answer them for me. It’s his fault that my luck is shit. He won’t let me have fun. I can’t have a single good day because he doesn’t like me. He’s out to get me.

It’s his fault for giving me autism. I think I’ve already talked about how crippling my autism is. I feel like the boy in a bubble. I have no one to talk to, no one to love me, no one to console me and tell me everything’s gonna be okay, and on top of that people around me dismiss my autism. To hell with those who think it’s a gift. It’s a curse that God brought upon me because that’s just how he gets his kicks.

It’s his fault for putting me in an abusive household. My parents are emotionally neglectful and even if they do hear me out, they’re so fucking condescending. They’re verbally abusive. They’re physically abusive. I’ve had to live with my bitch-ass father for who knows how long, and he’s such a hothead. He threatens to beat me up whenever it makes him feel powerful. Fuck you, God, for not doing anything about it.

It’s God’s fault for abandoning me at my worst times and doing whatever it takes to make sure that I don’t get the best. People keep telling me that he’ll answer my prayers. What a load of shit. He doesn’t say anything to me. He gives me the cold shoulder. People keep telling me that it’ll all be okay in the end. When?! When the fuck will God give me enough mercy so that my life will be “okay”?!

I’ve asked God to kill me. He doesn’t do so much as that. If he loves me so much, then he should do the one thing that I want, and that is to kill me. But no. He’s a selfish prick. He’s out for himself and fuck everyone else. That’s why the world is in such a sad state. It’s his fault. People keep saying that Jesus will come and will make the world peaceful again, but they fail to mention when. They’ve been saying that for years, and nothing’s changed. Bullshit. It’s all bullshit.

So God, answer me this: Why do you keep me in this world? Why do I always get the shit end of the stick? Why don’t you leave me the fuck alone and treat someone else like a puppet?!

I might die before I reach 30 anyway, so I know that God doesn’t give a blue fuck. When I do die, he won’t be around to mourn my death. He won’t tell me not to tie that noose. He’ll just let me die instead of killing me himself. What a piece of garbage."
421,1,"Probably just a down period and il stop thinking like this but ive been anxious depressed and constantly irritable for nearly my whole life it only getting worse and worse

  
yesterday after a stressful day of work and constant thinking i feel like ive just given up mentally 

  
no longer sad that my gf isnt texting or busy 

no longer scared of her leaving because i myself will leave

  
no longer care about people screaming at work

  
it feels calm in this current moment "
422,1,so im 15 and i literally have no friends well i have 2 one is just horrible and only speaks to me for there benefit and the other one lives 30 minutes away and i barely see them and in school i have nobody i walk around by myself and im really shy so i dont speak to anyone about it and my family is going through a tough time rn and some of my family members wont speak to me because i took my anger out on them on accident and i see social workers everyday because of my familys problems and i really feel like theres no point being alive but i cant bring myself to kill myself but its so draining and i hate my whole life im literally so ugly and i hate myself so much i know im probably dragging this on but i genuinely hope i die so badly
423,1,"I'm so God damned tired. I'm too tired to argue or really talk to anyone I'm too tired to care about my future. I wish I never existed. Everything would be so much easier I long for non existence.

I'm the problem. I've known that for a very long time. I had a talk with my parents and they told me they don't think I have mental health issues and that I'm making things really hard for them and the problem is I need to grow up now.

I didn't have the energy to defend myself so I simply agreed. I really hate talking to my parents in any compacity. I never know how to react around them or what to say it's so tiring I hate it. I don't hate them....but I don't like them.

Everything Is a drag and I'm 18 now and still have yet to really choose a college Ive fallen behind. I got homeschooled my senior year due to an attempt and my pwrents refuse to believe I have mental problems and the problem is simply I'm immature so they threw me in homesxhool. I have no real goals or plans for life I just want to rot and die. Would someone kill me
 I wish I never existed. Everything is tiring.

I might jump from a thirteen story garage after my sisters bday. I'm sick of my parents making my mental issues about them. Whenever my mental issues get bad they always always make it about them and how hard it is for them. They tell me to be considerate of them
 My mom told me she's sick of being careful of how she talks to me cause she feels if she says something bad I'll kill myself. Legit she's been saying bad things to me for months and I haven't that has zero impact on my desire to die. She tells me how hard it is for her and to grow up already and all my problems are in my head. I'm tired"
424,1,"I’ve had dark thoughts since a while and I’ve been (maybe, never seen anyone to diagnose it) depressed since around 2013. Some days everything feels fine, and some others I can spiral on a nothingburger, cry hard and basically do nothing until it’s bedtime so I can reset my emotional compass. These are times when it hurts so much it’s getting painful in the throat, when I’m thinking that jumping off a bridge would be a bad idea because my family wouldn’t even have a body left, that pills sounds nice and painless but probably a pain to get, or that hanging myself sounds like it’s super painful, and then I think about the last emotions that I would feel when doing that, the last things that would cross my mind, and it makes me cry even harder, that or thinking about my parents reaction. I don’t want to die, I genuinely love this world despite everything going on and I want to live an happy life in it, I just don’t want to it be this current life. Despite all this, I’m still functioning normally daily or at my job. When I cry, it will lasts for 5 min max as I’m able to calm myself down quickly. On the other hand, I spoke to someone recently who said she cried 1 hour straight over the thought of a possible breakup. I have never harmed myself, but I knew someone else who had a good 30 scars on a single arm. I have never taken a step toward killing myselr other than thoughts, and yet I’ve seen lot of younger people in the same boat as me, even minors, just calling it quit and ending it. So I’m just thinking: why can they do it but not me? What driving force do they have that I haven’t? Am I just faking it and everything is in my head because I’m too watered down compared to them?"

i’m thinking about going live while doing it
i guess it’d be entertaining to watch"
426,1,"I’m not posting this for sympathy, or anything along those lines but genuinely just want advice.

Im 25 and have a decent job and do have some people in my life that  care about me. I would never hurt myself, but there are some days (more so recently) that I just have this feeling of it would be easier on myself and those closest to me if I just wasn’t here any more. It’s really difficult to explain. Has anyone felt like this and if so what’s the best way to deal with it? I have maybe 2 or 3 people in my life that I’m really close to and can open up and one person that I trust completely and I know they’d all be supportive and understanding if I spoke to them. But, they also are all dealing with major things in life at the moment. so I just don’t want to be a burden to them and dump my problems "
427,1,"Sorry, I don't want to deal with anything else."
428,1,I really think I just shouldn't have existed. Life has been hard and I really cannot see it getting any better anytime soon... or at all. I tried. I'm trying. It's very exhausting. I even took 2 days off work to rest. But I'm still exhausted. I think this is depression creeping in. And it's so hard! I think I really need help. And I don't know what or where to begin... or if I even want to begin.
429,1,I am so tired I can’t even clean my piercings or shower or brush my teeth. I just need to feel alivuhhh. Music is what keeps me happy but I can’t pick up my headphones. It just feels so unnatural. and then there was last July were i listened to numb 100x on repeat for hours
430,1,"i’m really really really sorry to my parents and family that i’m going to do this. i’ve read so many stories from the pov’s of people who have committed’s loved ones, and now i need to know if there’s anything anybody would suggest for me to do to help it be easier for them after i commit. thank you in advance 💞"

My ex bf (who had sa’d me, physically abused me.)just got dismissed in court when I filed charges against him because apparently he has ‘a mentality of a 10 year old.’ I’m only 14.

Im truly alone now, no one to hold on to, no one that cares about if i die or live, i am alone, am truly alone i just feel so fucking stupid and so fucking shitty.
the only person that stuck up with me just left, The only one that i toght didnt just saw me and pittied me and look me with these eyes of superiority, now i am alone, i am at fault with all of these, its my fault she left, its my fault i am alone with no friends its my fault everyone thinks i am the biggest pice of shit and i should just die
No one cares anymore and you dont either, you don't really care, you see all of these people saying they will do it and you just say ""Dont do it"", well fuck all of you, im tired of living, im tired of being here trying for Everything to turn out ok just to get draged into the mud once again, i am insoferable, im no one and i just have anger and sadness, i cant go on anymore, there is no hope, no hope at all in my life, even my family the ones that are suppoused to love me just see me with this eyes and think less of me, that i sm just a stupid pice of shit, i am, i am Everything they say, i am just no one and i will just try and kill myself and fail again, becuse i cant do anything right, i will just fucking jump so its an instant death, fuck this, fuck you all fuck all of this stupid fucking game and i wish i end it soon"

I have the gun and the date and place picked out.

I'm thinking about how when I was a kid, I had so many hopes and dreams. Now the thing I want most is for the pain to stop. 

I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm a letdown. I'm sorry I didn't say anything. I'm sorry that I am not better. 

I don't know why I'm writing this. I guess it just would be nice to know if one person read this and understood that I tried so hard. That they don't hate me for giving up. "
436,1,"I'm so fucking worn down. This world will never get better and to think so is incredibly naive. It might not be today or tomorrow, but I'm going to kill myself at some point this year. I've been pushed too close to the tipping point too many times already, it's not going to take much more. "
437,1,"I’ve struggled with severe mental health issues to the point of being housebound for a decade, my life is genuinely worthless just because of that. But lately things at home have gotten so much worse.

It would take so long to write everything. But my mum’s ex who assaulted officers on our doorstep keeps showing up at night knocking on door. I threaten to call the police and she wants to kick me out for it despite how he is violent and not safe. I am constantly under threats to have to sleep on the street to the point where I feel terrified 24/7.

It took me years to be able to get into any kind of therapy. Now I am terrified and shaking today bc I have it tomorrow and last week when I did she sent me threats during the session that if I dared talk about her I’m out of the house. I’m agoraphobic and have no money and nowhere to stay, and I’m a woman which makes it even more scary.

I an not allowed to sleep at night bc if I even go to the bathroom she goes ballistic. I have audio hallucinations when falling asleep out of severe sleep deprivation and stress, of her ex being here and the sounds they’d make. I don’t get to eat a lot of the time bc she takes money pretending she ‘cares’ for me and then doesn’t bother to get me even the basics for a dinner to make myself. And bc I can’t sleep unless it’s the day bc of her, I woke up today at 10pm no food. I broke down realizing I’d have to order deliveries when I need the little I have incase she decides I am out tomorrow.

I also will have to either wear dirty clothes to therapy tomorrow or risk her storming down here going insane bc I slept too much today bc of sleep deprivation and didn’t get to wash my clothes earlier, and if it wakes her it will turn into her screaming insults and turning it off. It’s going to be so fucking humiliating.

My girlfriend and me are LDR and I dread talking to her right now sometimes bc she always pushes it to be sexual, I fuck up bc of how bad my anxiety is or it is when I am unbelievably exhausted and legitimately cannot handle it and get into it, she is clearly upset. I can’t juggle or handle it at all. And it’s destroyed my already fragile self esteem lol.

And when I am kicked out the only thing in my life not bad, my little brother I have raised with her since he was born so feels like my kid, is going to never see me bc I wont be able to afford and handle mentally constant taxis here and she can’t drive. He gets upset if we don’t spend time together for even a day or so this will be an abandonment to him. I cry everytime I think about this.

I’m horrifically ugly, my life is a joke, I have no qualifications of achievements, I have nobody and trying to stay alive is absolutely killing me. I truly wish I had listened to myself and ended my life when I was a teenager and not had it all turn out like this. "
438,1,"All I have to say is I’m just tired. I’m tired of being alive, I’m tired of feeling like I’m not enough, like I’m a worthless waste of space. And these are not my thoughts, these are based on the actions and words of others. Pushed away, forgotten, used and thrown away. “You’re dramatic, you're weak, you’re ugly, you're boring, you’re a cunt, I’m glad I don’t have to deal with you anymore.” And these all happened this year. So yeah if the people I loved most in the world can say this to me with disgust then what am I really worth. I tried to be a good person but it doesn’t matter, I don’t matter, all that therapy was for nothing. Your thinking isn’t reality, what you say to yourself means nothing. It’s all about how you’re treated. Society will show you where you stand. 
 
This will be the 3rd and final attempt this year. I’ll walk you through the other 2. 1st was November 30, I planned to drink as much as possible and freeze in sub 0 temps. 2nd was May 17, I planned to drown in the river. A friend’s text saved me the first time and the thought of leaving the girl I loved stopped me the 2nd. But neither of these people will be here this time. 

This was a 15 year old battle lost. 15 years of feeling worthless, ugly, unlovable. And I lost. But the pain can finally stop and for that I’m grateful. I prayed to any spirit to give me answers and I’m met with vitriol. I’ve done much just for a chance, therapy, communication, hobbies, weight loss, financial stability, hell even some cosmetic modifications. 

But these things don’t matter when you’ve been a placeholder all your life. An option, an afterthought. There until something better comes along. I’ll never be a burden on your lives ever again, you’ll never have to worry about me, you’ll never have to pity me, you can be happy. You’ll mourn for 2 weeks and you’ll move on. Go on, hate me if you want. I'm used to it but I’ll never hate you, I'm not one for hatred. Maybe I’m selfish, maybe me leaving leaves a whole lot of hurt for you but you’ll forget about me, you didn’t care for my presence, so you don’t get to care about my absence. Goodbye, good luck, maybe I’ll even haunt some of you. 
"
439,1,"I'd been trying so hard, seeing a therapist and everything, but I'm knky realizing I was just avoiding my self. I won't get better so I've decided to go through with the plan I've had for a couple months. Fuck trying to get better, and fuck happy people."
440,1,"Every time I try to get better, something shit happens and I lose all motivation for a year. I can’t keep fighting with my mental health. I’m already two years behind people my age. I feel like I’m broken and there’s no point in fixing it, since I keep falling apart. I don’t fit in anywhere with anyone. I can’t get out of the house. I can’t work. I can’t socialise. It’s all useless. Why does it have to be so hard to leave this world?"
441,1,"im on the verge of killing myself but i have no one to talk to. I dont know why this had to be the last straw, but finding out that i might have to be held back 10 months before i graduate and get my diploma is killing me. im turning 25 in a couple months but i feel like im always running out of time. school has always felt like a fucking hurdle and now it especially feels like all of my plans are about to be delayed. I already feel behind in life and i dont know how much more i can take of this.I put my entire life on pause to move out of state and get my diploma only for me to get held back and its driving me fucking insane. can someone please please tell me that my life is worth holding on to? it hurts to keep going and i thought i gave it my all but i guess that wasnt enought this time."
442,1,I need someone to vent too
443,1,"I want to die. I don't know if I want to kill myself, but I want to just die in my sleep or something, peaceful and painless but just so it's over. I've been depressed and anxious since I was 12. I've grown up in a military household and my mum chose to stay with my dad so my brother and I moved every 2 years. The only place we stayed for 2+ years was the only place I begged to leave because I got bullied so badly I ended up in therapy and trying to end it all. I went through college and the first group I fell into went sour. The second group was fine however I find it difficult to socialise. I'm not sure if this is the result of moving, the result of having autism or both.

I'm now at uni and I've just finished my first year. My boyfriend and I of 9 months just broke up and I think I've had a breakdown. I'm not sure exactly what a breakdown is but I know this is something not normal - what I'm feeling. I went on a night out and my coworkers boyfriend (who we also work with) tried to kiss me and called me pretty so I told her and she had a go at me, called me a bitch, told me I was lying through my teeth, told me she saw me flirting with him, told me that other people did. I know that I did nothing wrong here, I was just trying to let her know. I didn't do this, I told him that night no and that he had to tell her the next day or I would and he went and told her that I tried it on with him and that he was uncomfortable. 

I just want this to stop. All of it. I'm so stressed, I hate myself. There must be a reason why everyone always hates me too? I've lost all my friends in this breakup. I just want all this pain to go away. I don't know what to do."
444,1,I truly think I’ve experienced everything I wanted to see. I need to be gone since I am a problem. I struggle taking advice and dying would fix their stress 
445,1,"I feel like I’m going to die constantly, the paranoia is to much I can’t stop thinking of stuff that happened in the past and everytime I do I become slightly paralysed? Idk how to explain, I just kinda blank like I reset, my brain fog is to much I wanna just end it so I don’t die from whatever my gut is telling me I will, idk what to anymore "
446,1,"I forgot don’t want to go into too much detail but I feel like I’m going to get fired. I forgot to send out a mass email to all our clients and bc of this, we might end up getting fined by a lot. I’ve been at this job for almost a year and I’m still fucking up. I swear I’m literally a fucking moron. I hate this job but at the same time it’s the most I’ve ever made. "
447,1,"i wanna know how the story ends but everything else outside that sucks about the world, smh"
448,1,I can’t do this I’m hideous and I realize that disfigured people get more respect in society so I so close to deleting as much of imagines with me in it then just slicing my face till people can’t tell my neutral appearance people would just assume it was all caused by my disfigurement and would no longer treat me subhuman btw I lost weight now and I’m still fucking ugly 
449,1,Mom told me to kill myself twice and might be kicking me out of the house to go to my dad’s. She’s saying so much and yelling at me all because I called her out for “neglecting” my emotional needs (she refuses to get therapy for me) so I think today is the day I’m gonna kill myself! It was nice but now everything goes wrong while everyone who has bullied me has had a good life

I’m so tired of crying, of the suicidal thoughts, of pushing myself through another day only to have nightmares every night, too. I just want it to end. Why am I such a coward? "
451,1,"The title honestly just says it all. This is my second time taking what's supposed to be the fucking EASIEST college math class at my university but I just can't do good on the exams. I can't understand what to fucking do with most of these topics. I even found a tutor on Reddit that's more than willing to help me but their assigned  homework to me just gets hard to understand in later questions. For how stupid I am, I just deserve a shitty future. So I've been thinking about ending it or at least doing self harm so I don't have to suffer through the awful inevitable. If I can't pass this fucking class that's supposed to be the easiest possible math class the university can assign their students then there's no hope for me."
452,1,I cant live any longer. Life sucks. 
453,1,"When my brain reminds itself that it breathes, I'm too unmotivated to breathe. Depression is slowly killing me"
454,1,"thinking about this for a while but what yall think, is it pathetic?"
455,1,I wish I could die. I hate my life. I hate how the people around me treat me. I hate myself. I hate my job. Just had to shout it out into the void I guess. 
456,1,"i want to overdose on a benzo which is flurazepam (sleeping pills) I'm planning to take 450mg and taking 2000mg of sertraline. i think this will be enough to kill me, as i would lose consciousness and without medical help i would go in a coma and eventually die "

459,1,"Monetary issues prevent me from going on. I left my home country for the trip of my life, and I’m enjoying every single day here. Now today I was contacted again by my family back home telling me to figure it out.
 
I’ve decided to go out on my last day here as I simply have no way of paying those bills.
 
I’ve been thinking about the way go about for years and years when I fell back into depression, but life always gave me another chance. This time I cannot solve the issue, and I will send my family the reply to refuse my “inheritance” so the bill isn’t theirs to take care of.
 
It’s silly how I was truly happy for those past weeks since I boarded this plane, and now I need to go. I seriously want to keep living, loving and I was so close to achieving it!
 
I am sincerely sorry for my partner who loved me so dearly as they’re the one who does not deserve the bereavement, and the people who might witness. None of what I’m saying makes sense I guess, but I want to leave a few words behind at least.
 
I’m going to enjoy what is left, and then go onto my last adventure."
460,1,I’m genuinely messed up one minute i’ll talk like normal and can suck my feelings up for a bit and another i start questioning whether i even want my life anymore or not i hate everything not saying this out of anger but hurt i’m tired of grieving over all the things i’ve missed out on and would never experience and tired of envying and feeling worthless 24/7 i wish CPTSD didnt make life that bad. If i stayed alive i’ll just struggle more and be a fucking burden I wanna kill mysel 
461,1,"I have a very strong belief system, thats why I would never commit suicide. But lately the thought of it came up often. I know that it wouldn’t be good for me, I dont even want to. But I just have these thoughts. I once said kinda jokingly that I want to kms, but my parents freaked out and got angry, so its not an option to turn to them. I do have a few friends, but I am such an emotional closed up person in all of my relationships that its almost impossible to open up to them. I dont know if I should get professional help or what I should do."
462,1,"Everytime I get a new friend, or finally start talking and getting to know someone, I always ruin it. 

Either by apologising too much, thanking them too much or by dumping all of my emotions on them. I always ruin it. I don't know if I am even doing it too much, or if it is just anxiety. I can just tell when, when because of me I've ruined another friendship, ruined another chance at being myself and driven myself closer to suicide. 

Gods I hate myself. I don't know why I don't change, maybe it's because I don't think anything is wrong or my pathetic ego is so big I can't comprehend what to fix. 

I'm always alone, I'll always be alone and it's always my fault. I know I'm screaming into the abyss, like the self depricating pathetic idiot I am. 

I wish I never existed. Everyone would have been better off. I keep looking at methods of suicide, jumping off a building, walking onto tracks, smashing my head on a rock or slitting myself. 

Using an alt so no one finds this. Thanks I guess. "
463,1,"I used to be a standout swimmer in college and thought it would last forever. I’m years removed from that now and have a precious little baby. I have no drive, overweight (even though I hardly eat) and somedays hit the gym and work hard, but most are full of panic attacks and anxiety. I take 4-6 Klonopin, 60mg opiates, and plenty of other drugs to help with my mental health. 

I’m tired, old and just done. I have 3-5 major panic attacks a day and am supposed to be doing work and school full time. I hate who’ve I’ve become and would feel better off gone. I believed in God for a long time but that has passed. Not sure how yet but I can feel the urge getting stronger and stronger. I love my baby but this is just too much "
464,1,"I feel so drained, so hopeless, so exhausted, without any energy or any will to live. I just want to jump off that bridge so bad and I am bately holding myself back. Can't do this anymore"
465,1,It is not worth it.  I don’t find this a blessing.  It is a curse
466,1,Instant death I guess 
467,1,it said pls don’t go.
468,1,i'm buying a tank of pure helium and putting an end to this once and for all. farewell.
469,1,"I'm at a point where I've thought about going through with committing suicide

I have no worth for anyone or myself, everyone I've tried to talk to in my life has either treated me like a joke or degraded me. I'm in a terrible family situation where drugs are a huge issue and has led to some of my relatives overdosing and nearly dying. I almost watched someone in my family die in front of my eyes about a month ago. I can't even focus on myself either, I'm not good at anything and I haven't found any purpose in my life at all. Even if I get out of this situation, my childhood has already been destroyed by trauma from my family, and I don't know how to take care of myself because I've been neglected my entire life due to my family caring more about drugs than me. Even if I ask someone else for help, they still treat me like a joke like I said above. I have no friends I can ask for help, and even the only person I consider a friend only talks to me to make fun of me and the things I like.

It's too late for me to grow anymore, I've recently become a legal adult and that's why I've thought about taking the rest of my life away because it's not worth living anymore.

At this point, it feels the only thing I'm worth for is being hung on a noose. Goodnight."
470,1,"[21M]
for starters , I do NOT have any deformities whatsoever BUT I am severly unnatractive and the reactions I get from people are unreal , like something straight out of a movie.
I prefer to post this type of stuff on R/ugly but I don't meet the requirements to post anything on that subreddit yet , plus I think s*icide related posts aren't allowed there anyway


I would often take walks to clear my head , it was one of the few coping mechanisms I had left but  those days are pretty much over. I recently began to notice just how often the people I walk pass make fun of me , not just teenagers but grown men and women too. I absolutely hate walking past teenagers though , they laugh in my face and record me/do gestures at me and have approach me as some sort of wierd inside joke/prank that their friends are also in on. They don't even have the decency to at least make it less obvious , they've purposely f*ck with me which makes it difficult to ignore them. Adults are almost just as bad but they USUALLY do a better job at being a little more discreet. I still catch them struggling to hold in their laughter and then let out a ""pffft"" the minute we've fully passed eachother or look at me , look away and cover their mouth. There was one older guy who looked up at me and the minute we locked eyes he let out the most obnoxiously loud laugh I've ever heard in my life. He wasn't very good looking either but even he felt I was something to be laughed at. Keep in mind , I live in NY , which is a place that is *supposedly* known for people being ""caught up in their own life and mind their own business"" or ""too busy to pay attention to other people"" , so either thats a false statement or I'm just THAT UGLY. Interactions in general are awful even with cashiers , waitors , waitresses , nurses etc. They are rude asf to me for absolutely no good reason whatsoever but that's a different topic for another time. The bottom line is ,  any confidence I had left is almost non-existent. I am located in an enviorment where ugly people are fairly common yet I'm STILL getting laughed. A place like NY should be 100% used to unsightly people , I shouldn't have to feel like an alien here. Even my niece(14)and nephew(9) have called me ugly more than on once and ask me what's wrong with my face. I don't even feel human anymore. The only positive reinforcement I get is either from a few of my other relatives or those facebook scammers/bots that start every conversation with ""hey cutie"" or ""hey handsome"". I really don't like life anymore"

473,1,ugh. it feels like no one cares until youre dead
474,1,"idk why im writing this. i could go to my notes app like always and start over with my suicide note. its almost like i want it to be perfect. for it to make sense to everyone when i finally do it. my health is fine. my life is fine. but im so tired of living. i cant remember the last time it was enjoyable for me. there's this certain melancholy that comes with wanting things and the disappointment that accompanies when you dont get them. in my case , all i wanted was my loved ones to live. ive lost a few people and pets to death. it might sound like im blaming their deaths for wanting to die myself. its not the case. waking up everyday is a struggle. watching everything fall apart is a struggle. having the internal thoughts i've had about myself materialize into reality is a struggle. every day is an inner battle trying to see myself as deserving and worthy of anything good. idk if there is a higher power. because somehow all my prayers have always been unanswered. this cursed life where i get handed things that give me happiness , a second of hope only for it to be taken away just as fast. it feels like a joke. a universal comedy. idk if ill go through with it. but these days the thoughts are stronger and the reasons not to are non existent. it simply would make no difference if i was gone. i wish i could just die."
475,1,"I cut myself in the same area yesterday and earlier this morning... today was stressful as always and 10 minutes ago I felt really nauseas and in pain in the area, after 5 mins the nausea got intense and 2 minutes ago the world got shaky and blurry and everything was spinning and I wanted to vomit and I was going to fall day I played down and thought I was going to die because my head was going cold and my veins were coursing... I thought I was going to die and I was about to cry.

Currently still Nauseous and in pain but a lot better... help?"
476,1,I feel worthless and pathetic like genuinely my entire existence is a joke. No clubs no friends just alone in solitary I dont have a single achievement to my name. Its pathetic 
477,1,"I genuinely feel like no matter what I do I can’t find any consistency in life. Even though I’m in my early 20s it’s still hard for me to find consistency when it comes to getting a job. I’ll get a job and then within a couple months there’s always something that prevents me from being able to work, because I am a contractor sometimes I just get sent home without pay and without any notice. I’ll apply to hundreds of jobs sometimes going days just sitting down at my computer for hours applying on LinkedIn and indeed, but just to be led to a email saying I have not been accepted. 

Literally, the only job I’ve been accepted to within the last three months has been some scam and door-to-door company, which I worked for a month (surprised I stayed for that long) because I was so desperate for any type of work because no one was hiring me. The thing is I have a crazy work ethic and if there is work for me to do, that is consistent I will get it done. I remember two years ago. I was making $17 an hour at my original contracting job and I was able to save up for a car within five months, but every other contracting role I am able to land only lasts for a month or two and no office jobs are hiring, even though I have a good background in IT. It’s just extremely depressing knowing I have a good work ethic but no recruiter is there to see it because an AI just handles my resume. I am currently in the middle of finishing up my degree but to test out if I would get hired with a degree, I lied on my resume and said I already had a degree yet I still was not able to get any interviews or callbacks. so this makes me not even want to go through with finishing up college as it feels like a degree to be useless if I can’t get a job.

And I am not a very jealous person honestly but sometimes I will see people in their 40s and 50s and see what they do for work and I know that there aren’t doing anything at their job that is special that I can’t also do (I do not mean any disrespect), and anything that I can’t do can easily be trained. iI just feels like a good job is not meant to come my way until I am way older, but I have a good work ethic and want to make money now and I just hate having no money in my pocket. I think it generally puts me in a state of depression around my family and friends when I am not making any type of money because it feels like I have nothing going for myself.

478,1,"Hey,
I am sorry, I am posting here again. 
I just can't.. I thought my partner cared at least. They know about my suicidal thoughts. And when I disappeared and was at a birdge to jump and kill myself, all they cared about was me cheating on them.
And while I understand I can't help but to feel so hurt.

I am sorry again, rambling today since I rarely ever speak about myself. And I drank some alcohol and I am all over the place. Resisting the urge to self harm so bad. "
479,1,"I'm failing in school and I'll probably have to retake the grade, I have no friends that actually care about me, nobody loves me for me at all, my family doesnt even notice my existence, and I'm just a failure in life. Nothing could possibly get better at this point. I'm tired and all I want is at least someone to love me, and I don't even have that. I just wanna kms at this point."
480,1,"Ive been in and out of psych wards for attempts since i was 5 years old, effectively meaning that the vast majority of my entire life was spent struggling to do something as simple as continuing to exist. The last couple of times i ended up hospitalized for this, was after the psychiatrist told me to take the train to the ER and that she was going to call to confirm i made it, or them calling an ambulance for me. Ive started to wonder if they trust me too much. What if next time they tell me to go to the ER because they are concerned for my safety, i just say ill do that and i just run and disappear instead? Since i have no one who really knows much about me i dont think theyd even really have an idea about where i could be and i could probably just toss my phone in a trashcan and go so they cant track me through it. Would this result in an arrest if i did this and they managed to find me? Either way, i know its coming. This is the lowest ive ever been in my life. Nothing around me or even my memories seem like my own anymore. I dont remember the last time i smiled or laughed without it being forced. Ive completely isolated myself and Im no longer afraid. The only thing that brings me ""happiness"" now is knowing that at least with this final act, my husband, and family will finally be free of me. I know theyre probably as tired of hearing about this as i am with living through it. I hope this will bring them peace. My only regret is believing professionals all these years who told me that things would get better, which only resulted in me drawing this out so long that people who wouldve never met me if i had succeeded in my previous attempts being sucked into this and unfortunately they will now be negatively impacted by my decision. It just feels like ive only existed to be abused, bullied, and ridiculed and more and i refuse to be told im selfish for being unable to keep going by people who wouldve folded from this pain long before i ever did."
481,1,Soooooo I’m on holiday away from everyone at the moment and I’ve been invited to go to the gun range (my minds been everywhere) should I go I think I might do something stupid (I don’t think anyone would care of if I did)
482,1,It might be the Effexor. I just feel so numb. I want to die. The only thing stopping me is parents.
483,1,"I just want to get this off my chest. No advice, no nothing.

I have Brillant parents. Both of them worked extremely to hard to get from point A to B.

Now there's me, I used to be really talented (I was good swimmer, was involved in sports overall and from what I've heard, was really good in certain subjects)  
As I've gotten older, I've just felt more and more useless. Nothing I do is ever good enough. I find it incredibly hard to focus on certain things and I keep telling myself that I'm going to work hard and so on, only to lose motivation and the cycle repeats again (I'm basically lazy)  
I'm not pretty. I hate the way I look. I'm constantly reminded as to how ""healthy"" I am and I should avoid eating, only for my family to take me out to places to eat and etc. I'm so tired. What good is a woman if she's not pretty? especially if she's horrible at her education, has no talents, no nothing (and she's a horrible, selfish and angry person)  
I find it difficult to connect with my peers irl at times. it's so hard finding people who like the same things I like. it's even harder interacting with the opposite sex.   
I'm also queer so it's hard for me to fit in EVEN more. ugh.  
I just want a normal life, everyone's falling in love, has good relationships with their parents, or has some talents to make up for it but I have nothing. I don't blame anyone for it but myself. I should have existed. I was a mistake.

University feels like my only good option out. Maybe I'll feel better finally being independent, without a group of people telling me off for being useless..anything but living with them, I can't do this anymore.   
I'll kill myself if i don't get in, I really can't live anymore. I have no reason to live.   
Please do not read this and assume that I'm just some unfortunate soul who doesn't deserve this. I do, I really do, all of this should happen to me because I'm actually a horrible person, believe it or not.  
thank you for atleast providing me a space to vent.

484,1,"I waste my time, potential and energy each day. My parents haven given me everything for 18 years and I’m disappointing them. I want to die so bad but I can’t do it to my family."
485,1,"i feel like absolute crap; even if life does get better in the future, i don't think i can take any more grief and pain and trouble that will inadvertently come as well. even if life does get better, the pain inside my chest stays the same. even if it goes away for a while, it returns just the same. what's the point then? the only reason I'm still alive is that i wouldn't want to hurt my loved ones with my passing. i know grief, it is the single worst thing in the world, i would not want to be the cause of so much of it if i died now. I'm tired. I'm tired, tired, tired.

i have an appointment with a new therapist in three days. it's hard to trust myself until then. i can't tell my loved ones what's on my mind, can't make them worry - I'm a constant source of worry already. I've white-knuckled through much worse. i know i wouldn't do anything with myself anyway, i never would.

this sucks. i hurt my best friend today; can't tell her i want to kill myself because of that too. must leave space for her to expess her hurt. that's the healthy thing to do. but at least i can tell you: i hate myself, i wish i did not exist.

I'm rambling. i think I'm going nuts. well, I'm not, I'll be fine. but god i haven't been this suicidal in such a long time. i don't know what to do, i don't know how to feel better. can this pain just please stop."
486,1,"Today, I did not have any suicidal ideations. I got a decent workout in and made some job applications as well as other productive tasks. Not getting my hopes up because of one day. Let’s see what tomorrow brings. "
487,1,"I think today might be the day I try again, but I really don’t know. My biggest issue is that if I live, I work at the hospital. Everyone in the emergency room knows me and I don’t know if I can go back to work after like nothing happened. If they admit me, I’ll just try again after I eventually leave, and especially if it costs me my job. I work in an hour, and I’m typing this as I stand in the shower. I was barely able to get up and do this much. I’m tired of the daily pain, anxiety, paranoia, and overall misery that I feel. I should’ve succeeded almost four years ago, when I first tried. I feel as though I made too many mistakes in my life and now it’s too late for me to make it feel worthwhile. I always felt a pull, like this was how I was meant to leave."
488,1,"I want to leave. I can't do this anymore. I can't animate this body anymore. I have enough of therapy after therapy. Just enough. It has no meaning. There's no way but to leave and hope this time it won't repeat.

I did my best."
489,1,"(Just a rant)
16m here. Im about to go to college in a year and I feel like im going nowhere and accomplished nothing. And im too lazy to do anything about it. 

I've had numerous instances where I think about ending it all. Everyday I wake up I feel like there's no point, there's no reason; I just do the same thing day and day. I'm not really living im just existing. I wake up at 11 am, doomscroll, jack off, sleep, and repeat. That's it. That's my life.  

And it's not like i have people to talk about this. I have a few friends whom I barely EVEN interact with and I hate my family, so they wouldn't really give a fuck.

I hate how everyday I just feel bad about myself and it always comes down to the same conclusion, which is to just kill myself.

My reason genuinely sounds so fucking basic and stupid but i really feel like im just wasting my life."
490,1,I really can't deal with this right now. I'm supposed to be going to university this September. Just got an email.back ayaing that all the accommodation I applied for are full. I might be able to get a room with a shared bathroom with strangers but the idea of that makes me so anxious I can't deal with it at all it makes me panic so bad. I can't do this. I can't study from home and commute every day because me and my mum are getting evicted. She can't afford to house me. And i cant mentally handle living with my mum shes an alcoholic. And it's over an hour every day just to get there. Train tickets are so expensive there too. I'm going to be homeless. And not go uni. I'm already stressed at the moment and am already really struggling mentally i cant do this i cant do this o cant. I'm going to end my life this wad the sign to. I cant affoard priavte renting im so fucking anxious about private renting with strangers for the first time i cant do this i cant do this i cant i really cant. Thw chances of me getting a place now are so low as its so late. This was suppose to be my chance to be happy and its been taken from me. Ive been fucked over. I dont know what to do. This is God's telling me that I should kill myself. This was my final sign rhat i shouldnt be alive. I'm going to do it
491,1,"Theres nothing much to tell but I (20M)'ve been suicidal past 1 year and on December 2024 i attempted a suicide attempt but unfortunately failed..i hoped for things to get better but in reality got even worser. Every moment of my life still regrets why did I get senseless on that day of December when I cut my wrist veins. But the thing is I'm suicidal now (idc about my gf/lover,my parents, my brother) and only thing I care about is my own death. Matter of fact today is the day i fixed to hang myself up but due certain reasons i'm trying to reconsider my decision of ending myself. 
In certain situations in my life where I'm stuck between taking a choice i toss a coin and now to decide whether i should kill myself or not i tossed a coin not once but two times and heres the tricky part both of the times the outcome came that i should kill myself. And I trust this toss practice of mine as for the times i didn't follow it i regretted. Right now i decided my second attempt to suicide to be tomorrow. Can anyone tell me something or advice me something i really need it....?"

I don't wanna hear anything about it get better. It doesn't. I've tried telling friends, my parents, I called a helpline. They all just forgot I said anything within a week or hung up. Just be a helpful person."

499,1,therapy doesn't do much i only bother going to keep under the radar. but i don't understand the point if you read the blog on my profile you will see what i mean..meds don't work because i can't alter a bad genetic code. im not depressed  im defected. so annoying when people say other words.

you guys have any tips for me, thanks! "
502,1,its always the same. Nothing changes. I am rotting in my body and i someyimes think that i guess i dont see myself worthy of change so that i want to rely on my environment but i cant and i dont know hpw to change
503,1,"I wish there were a quick, painless, and affordable solution. Why is it so hard? I always ""get better"" only to end up back in the same hole… because the truth is, I was never really okay, I was just distracted."
504,1,"Hey, first of all: sorry in advance. I definitely do not have to deal with that much struggle as a lot of you have to and so i can imagine some of you may be very outrageous because of my post and maybe rightfully so. I just want to share and maybe people experienced similar things. 

My life is good for the most part. I have a great family, great friends, a job (which is the problem right now) and i did have great romantic relation ships in the past. But i feel like i chose the wrong career. When i finished school i was a virgin and i hated it and i wanted to have sex and a girlfriend so much i only cared about that. At the time, this was mostly what i cared about so i went to university to study ""teaching for children with special needs"" (i'm from Germany). I liked what i studied and it was interesting, but i never thought that far ""do i have what it takes to be a good teacher"". I was always like: ""i'll get around to it, when the time comes."". Now the time came and i don't really like it. Actually i almost despise it. I didn't think the rest of my life through, when i was 19 and now i'm 27 and be like: Maybe i should have studied sth. else, maybe i should have studied sth. more quiet, where you go to work, be in your room and do your tasks and then go home, maybe i should have tried to become a theatre-actor. But it's hard. And i don't know what to do now.   
  
And so i sometimes think: i accomplished everything i wanted, friends, intimacy, the feeling of having a girlfriend, i am happy because i got there. But now: i'm done. That's all i ever wanted. I could die peacefully. I don't need to live anymore. I can kill myself looking back at my life and saying: it was a good one. And it was. I'm afraid what the future brings and i don't know if i want it. So why not stop it now. why not end it, when it is good. Why going into sth., that might be horrible and unsure and uncertain and maybe awful. Why not say: That's good enough. That's all i ever wanted. That's it. 

Anyone else feel like: i should end it now, because it was good, but now life might become awful?

505,1,Can we be honest and say that it’s better to be dead than homeless? I’m not homeless yet but I’m tired of living with my mother. Every application is a rejection. How can I spend hours tweaking my resume for all these jobs every week for over a year and have nothing to show for it. I wasted 4 years getting a Computer Science degree. I want to take the 20k I have to my name and travel till it runs out. Then I want to kill myself. Because no one will ever hire me. I’ll never be able to financially exist in this world. What are the easiest methods of suicide that I could accomplish and not chicken out? Btw I keep track of my applications so I hit 1000 recently. So yeah I was lied to and told growing up that I would get a degree and study something I enjoy and then get a job and start a career. It’s all a lie. We’re about to have millions of unemployable college grads who if they don’t have supportive parents will all become homeless. Domestic terrorism will also rise as many of these people will be very angry at the system. I’m angry but I won’t take it out on others I will only end my own life for peace. 
506,1,"I have trying for 20 FUCKING YEARS. I am so so so so sick of being a fucking lab rat. I’m sick of the suffering and agony I go through every goddamned day. I’m sick of doctors giving me meds they have little to no faith will help me. I’m sick of trying doctor after doctor. I’m sick of waiting months and months for a damn appt (bc we all know that just makes mental health worse) I’m sick of trying to vent to Facebook and other people and then getting treated absolutely deplorably just bc I’m struggling and have no one to talk to. And lastly I’m just fucking sick of life in general. 

And they wonder why the suicide rates in this country are astronomically high. Bc no politician in this country gives a FUCK about mental health. I’m just done. Totally and completely 100% done….. I hope to Christ I’m feeling better tomorrow morning bc if by the afternoon I’m not feeling better I’m going deep into the mountains in Montana and blowing my fucking brains out so no one finds me. No one will come visit and they’ll all just forget me & I’ll just decay until I’m nothing. I don’t want to. But this is literally my only option. The only thing I ask is that you guys hope for a quick painless death. I’m done. I’m gone. Goodbye"
507,1,"I’ve been considering suicide for a while now. It’s not the first time I’ve felt like this. I’ve made several attempts in the past; but it’s been a while since the last one. I’ve already made the decision to get high tonight. I haven’t used in years, so I’m hoping this is it. 
I can’t take this suffocating pain. I feel like my entire world is collapsing around me while I’m stuck in some weird limbo. Time has felt stagnant for months now. I can’t do it anymore. I feel so disconnected from myself & from reality, if you can even call it that. It doesn’t feel real. None of it does. For most of my life, I’ve felt like I was just some kind of spectator watching everything happen around me. I feel alone & I just can’t take it anymore. I feel like I can’t breathe or I’m on the verge of a panic attack. Fuck it. I’m at least getting high. "

510,1,"32M gave myself breathing problems from being a weed addict. Was diagnosed with severe persistent asthma at the pulmonologist. About 82 days quit as of today but I have a constant stream of mucus coming up my throat, I feel like this is a permanent affliction with this ""asthma"". Now I have to use a steroid inhaler 4 times a day and my sleep is nightmarish because I cant breathe that well when I lay down and usually have to use my rescue inhaler to sleep optimally. Usually not well. Im fairly fit and didn't need any inhalers before I quit smoking for a while at 30 then picked it back up again leading into 32.

This feels like COPD Asthma overlap even though it's not my diagnosis because of the persistent mucus. I've felt like shit these past 3 months pushing through this and am having a lot of SI happening lately. My GP just put me on Zoloft 6 days in on it saying its a lot to do with my anxiety and I feel like it's making me feel even worse with less energy already.  I dont think i can make a life work with these symptoms and am frustrated waking up everyday to mucus and using my steroid inhaler. Gotta clear my throat every 5 minutes or spit it out. Super tired everyday from lack of REM sleep. Ruined my life and would rather just die lately. My quality of life just feels miserable. 

I have my mom and other people supporting me through this but I have been super negative about the outcome in the future from this affliction and daily activites have become a struggle. I agree my mindset isnt that great surrounding this. Not that I cant push myself harder to do things but I feel like I have to put in so much more effort now than I used to and I am thinking life would be better if I am dead if I cant improve my quality of life going forward.

 I used to love good quality sleep and I cant enjoy it anymore its taken the enjoyment out of everything I used to love doing. Been taking benadryl every night just to get to sleep and I usually wake up throughout the night. Sometimes I'm lucky with 2 hrs of sleep before suddenly coming back awake then have to try to get back to sleep again. I hope this gets better with time but my feeling is that I'm stuck with this with how consistent the mucus keeps coming up.

Im trying to hang in there but I'm getting frustrated day to day. Im gonna lose my mind if this is gonna be my life going forward. I used to love living now I cant take it. Dunno if I can reduce my standard for this new quality of life and im super depressed lately. Killing myself seems harder than pushing through life with this until it isn't anymore is what my thought process has been on this."

Got another assessment this week where I’ll inevitably be told, as per usual, that I seem to be remarkably well presented for someone trying to kill themselves. As if they imagine me coming into a meeting in a public setting with a noose around my neck and uncovered SH wounds dripping blood onto the floor. 
I suspect it’s sometimes meant to be a compliment, but that’s hardly any better. *“Wow, I never would have guessed you’ve been trying to hang yourself! You seem so normal!”*

My entire family acts like I'm an addict a failure ect they only look at my flaws and it's just making things worse my mom wants to ship me out to live with my aunt in rural South Florida in the middle of nowhere where there is nobody my age in the whole town I will have no friends      my girlfriend left me for another kid named Atticus and I rlly js don't know what to do.

I hate that I don't want to be here but I'm trying to convince myself that it's okay because even when I was normal although I made my own happiness life still came with so much exhaustion and pressure and conflicts. That's what life seems to be. Trying to find the brief good moments while swimming upstream in a lifetime sea of tribulations 
517,1,"Not sure what to write, or even where to write this, or for whom to read. I'm exhausted, and want everything to just be finally over. I have chronic pain and vision loss that no medical professional has been able to figure out over a decade. I'm gay and trans in a world, and in a country where either of those is the worst thing to be, but combined, it gets comically bad. I'm ugly, severely mentally ill, sick, in pain, a deformed and disgusting monster, and so tired of reaching out for help and trying my best for absolutely zero progress. Therapists and psychiatrists have regarded me as outside of their caliber. My various doctors don't know what causes my headaches and facial pain and vision loss. Healthy normal looking LGBT people can't relate to me, and I can't relate to them. The disabled community I'm really not disabled enough for. My own parents are completely alienated from me and my experience, so I no longer try to rely on them. I have only two close friends who are doing much better than me, and they are tired of me never doing well. My husband is stuck with the unbearable humiliation and grief of being with a sick monster who never gets any better, only worse. I try to reach out, get help, get better, do my best, connect and cope. But it's all a waste. It goes nowhere. I only take up resources from people who could put them to better use. I've probably bled the taxpayers of tens of thousands just seeing my eye doctor. I can't justify being alive in any way. I just wish for the mercy of this all being over. I'll leave behind a little bit of money, and what use I had, someone far better can fill those roles.

I know i'm going to spiral once i become an adult, and everyone knows it. i'm going to become some random crackhead you meet at shows and do nothing with my life. i'll probably develop some type of STD or something

This is about treatment resistant folks

I've always had mental health problems but stayed proactive in making sure I did everything I could to make sure I got the best care. Which is a privilege number one. Yet this year I crashed hard, became bedridden and hoped people would have empathy with growing mental health awareness, but I was so fucking wrong. I've had to go through so many awful mental health physicians and friends who claimed to understand (which that alone i can rant about because tf you mean, we've lived completely different lives from race, class, health, family, gender etc). Im sorry you're life experience doesn't apply at all to me because I've lived a uniquely bs life

I have a decent mental health team now and got upgraded to Treatment Resistant services which is validating, scary, and extremely challenging. But I have so much more empathy for the mentally ill, the disabled and homeless.

Its not always a matter of working harder. This shit is deadly and very few physicians and people can even comprehend a percentage of it let alone provide comfort and support 

It angers me how many people belittled me, straight up abused me and still tell me I need to go outside like I was born yesterday 

**How a person responds to a truly shit situation tells me alot about them. From running away to platitudes toxic positivity, no one ever just wants to hold space for uncomfortable feelings.** 

Empathy seems to come from having those experiences yourself for 99% of people but damn I wish society would advance faster because people are losing their lives and that last thing a severely mentally ill person needs is finger wagging of how theyre not doing enough when they're doing their best. I've have had people barely listen to what I say and was simply waiting for their turn to lecture me their Disney Channel beliefs. If you want to help why not save your breath and help with compassion. Its so easy to talk but harder to hold your tongue and listen 

Most find comfort in what they know but panic when faced with the unknown. I just wish we were kinder to the less fortunate. I probably won't see that in a lifetime.... if I get that far"
522,1,Is what I was told today by my friend. It makes me think about what would happen if I went through with the many many plans I’ve had in my head. Would the group be quiet if I was gone forever? Would it be a peaceful quietness with the quiet chatter amongst the few in the group? I try my best to include everybody because I know how it feels to be ignored in a group. It makes me think so much about who I am surrounded by and who would be affected if I really went through with anything. 
523,1,"i mean i could go on about how bad the recent years have been, but most of my life i have felt compelled to and thought alot about suicide. Profesional help has never worked no matter how hard i was trying. There are just sad truths to the world, things some of us cant escape and that there is not simple or even challenging solutions for. I know other people that know what im talking about, so no matter if 10 million people that just dont know disagree, it means nothing to my experience. the internet is full of priveledged and oblivious people using words for other reasons than connecting with others in good faith or sharing or getting information. Everything is just bullshit, the worst people get everything working out for them, all my favorite people are dead, i hate this unfair and cruel horrible world. There is no place here for me. What else can i do? I am becoming more broke every week, but if i just got the tools i need to end myself, i wont ever need money again. "
524,1,"Don't worry. I'm probably not going to die today.

But I'm already fed up with everything. I've spent my whole life, and I mean it, putting up with my toxic parents, especially my mother. And when I was almost ready to move out (at age 20), I was diagnosed with a chronic illness, and it was the final straw. I couldn't study anymore. So this year i failed and i’ll have to repeat.

Mentioning that I'm bullied by my teachers. Tried to kill myself because of that but it didn’t work. In addition, the center's counselors told me at school to drop out of my major because I have multiple sclerosis, which isn't true and is discrimination, right? Months later, I plucked up the courage and reported it, but the community education department hasn't done anything for me. I think they've completely ignored my case. Multiple sclerosis associations also left my messages on read.  On top of the fact that I'm trying to find a way out of this hell, no one wants to help me, not even to do their own work. I've tried to solve all my problems, but from what I can see, there's no way because everyone assumes it's not that bad and I'm just exaggerating.  I have a psychiatrist and a psychologist, but they haven't changed my perspective on the world either, because I feel like they don't understand me either.

So I guess I have no choice but to die."
525,1,"I’ve been thinking about this for months ever since my dad passed. I admired to him at his grave that I didn’t want to go on anymore, that I can’t live without him. I know people say it’s selfish, but I can’t live like this. I don’t have a purpose in life, and I don’t have a will to live.

I did a few years ago, but these last few years has just been hell with all the people I’ve lost. I’m still trying to find out when would be the best time to do it. Where to do it. If I should lock the door so it’s harder to get to me. If I should write a letter. I don’t think it’ll ever get better for me, and I can’t live like this anymore. 

I’m afraid of surviving, of coming back and seeing the disappointment on everyone’s faces. Of becoming a vegetable and causing everyone stress. Nothing helps, my medication doesn’t anymore, if anything it’s making my thoughts more frequent. I just don’t feel anything anymore. I don’t want to feel anything anymore. I’m tired. "
526,1,"I look happy on the outside but on the inside I’m not. I just feel like certain things I really want to do is hard for me to do it because there is obstacles trying to prevent me from doing so. My emotions change all the time, and I’m just tired of it and it’s just making me suicidal lately. I just feel I won’t last for long because my emotions are just crashing down on me. I tried to kill myself once when I was 12, but I eventually stopped myself. Now the suicidal are getting to me and it’s worse. I know what’s making feel this way but it’s something I can’t prevent from happening. Life just got boring lately and I’m starting to see no point of it during my mental breakdown."
527,1,"This morning, I woke up gagging from the spasms in my stomach which almost had me throwing up on my pillow. Yesterday, I woke up in floods of tears without even realizing that I'm awake. I keep dry heaving and nearly being sick from these horrible flashbacks and dream-like hazes that completely knock me off my feet and make my head go fuzzy. I get instant derealization and don't recognize anything around me, even in my own bedroom or kitchen. It's like my brain is gathering pieces of a puzzle; tainted, bent jigsaw pieces gradually coming together to form an abstract monstrosity. I hate those fucking men for doing what they did. I hate myself for making it all such a big deal. I hate my friends for not caring about me. I hate everything about my life except for my parents who worked so hard to be able to provide for me. They fought so many battles together, for their family, just for me to throw it all away. I hate myself so passionately it hurts. I often feel this strong pang in my chest like I've been stripped of air and there's a hole caving deep into my 'soul'. I genuinely can't work or have fun or just fucking exist anymore. I don't know who I am. I love my family so, so much but I can't talk to them normally anymore. I have a little nephew on the way but I'll never see him because. I. just. don't. move. and I don't know how I'm meant to fit into this future that everyone is leading towards. There's no room for me tomorrow, or the next day, or the next. I don't exist. People just use my kindness and take it for granted. Yes, you can borrow my shirt. Yes, you can nick a cigarette. Of course, help yourself to the snacks. Fine, let's go to the pub. Yes, I'm free, come over. Yes, i'm completely and utterly miserable but please tell me about the boy you hooked up with!! 

  
This sounds so conceited. I promise, I love my friends and am grateful to have them in my life. Most of the time, they distract me from my thoughts and I appreciate that so much. But, when it comes to talking about our thoughts. Well, its a no go. They turn so awkward like I'm holding them at gun point. I just want someone to care about how I feel. I want someone to acknowledge how I feel! I don't want to keep floating along like a ghost, waiting to be seen by someone. I can't take it. Yet, I have no energy to invest into myself. I have literally no drive. I mean, I guess I have enough 'drive' to write something like this. Like, I haven't fully given up I suppose. I think the shittiest part is that I want to give up. I want that persistent, hopeful remainder of myself to just give. up. like??? why keep going?? If you're that miserable just give up!! I just want to give up. And not give up in a lazy, don't shower, don't eat kinda way...but in a 'I'm finally going to do it' kinda way. Fuck, its all just so pathetic. I can't keep living with this head of mine. I can't control it. I just want all of this to end. 

  
I've been on these new meds for a couple months...at first they were helping but now I'm not so sure. Could they be something to do with these shitty flashbacks? I was sa'd four years ago now but when I get these episodes, it feels like yesterday. I've experienced them before in the past, but never this intensely or persistently. I thought I was doing better, just for it all to come crashing down again. I feel so hopeless, tired and lonely. I'm so fucking lonely. "

I'm gonna commit a suicide.
Information about that specific day.
21st would be the day of my junior high school graduation. Which mean I'll be transcending into high school (yeaayy). .
But unfortunately, i have no life motivation left :).
So im gonna commit it at that exact date which i have mention.

Im 16M.

I dont have any intention to being the center of attention, but you might find this interesting.

Actually i might need a lil hope not to commit it.
But ill see if any of you guys can convince me enough.

My biggest motivation right now that i still hold while having depression is, my curiosity about nature and the whole universe!.
I like science very much!!. . Especially biology and chemistry!. .

Please help me, or worse i might have just done it

If you're asking what methods would i use for commiting.
Well theres a few i have been considering, which they're cheaper, and effective.
Which are:
Paracetamol with 10gram doses. (Overdose).
Pure nicotine(i have destilation at home).

I dont have any better plans than that, right now i just considering those few.
But ill keep searching for a better, efficient, and effective way. .
You can also help me contributing on that information :D!. .
Thanks! "

We kind of had a booty call, and we planned to have sex today which we did for a good hour. He was going fast and grabbing me by my neck in stuff, we cuddled afterwards because he wasn't gonna see me anymore and he recorded videos of me riding him on my phone and he took a pic of us in the mirror. 

He kissed me afterwards and said he was gonna message me as soon as he got home, but then I soon came to find out I was blocked by him. I feel like an idiot and like I was used :/"

536,1,"Life entails the presence of many things, to boil it down to a few: 

Suffering, problems unsolved, desires unfulfilled, questions unanswered, and rare glimpses of the opposite. 

It is because of these rare glimpses of pleasure, solved problems, fulfilled desires, and answered questions that most will argue life is worth living and continuing, because for any given instance of the above undesirable features present in life so too a solution may be. May is the key word, here. On the basis of this speculation people live, suffer, and strive for even a glimpse of perfection, under the delusion it is at all likely to present itself, and find only on their deathbeds the futility of their efforts. It is at that precise moment they also come as close to perfection as it is possible for a living being to, by dying.

Only in death is there no suffering, problems to be solved or left unsolved, desires to be fulfilled or left unfulfilled, nor questions to be answered or left unanswered. In that way, death is the perfection for which all living creatures so strive, and the one logical solution for all problematic matters that we all so desire.

I missed my first chance to embrace perfection, but whenever it may come I won't miss the second."
537,1,"Alright I'm just a bit confused and thought people on here might explain some stuff.

5 days ago I tried to overdose on paracetamol but the most that happened was vomiting for hours straight the next day. I think I took around 10000mg and idk if it's relevant but I'm 17, 5""0 and 39kg, so it definitely was too much. But it's been days and literally nothing else is happening?? I thought I'd experience more symptoms and whatnot but I've literally only been sweating (probably because of the heat) and a little out of it. 

I had the greatest idea last night to take even more paracetamol and had around the same amount but besides being nauseous and having a sore throat, probably since I haven't drank/ate much water in the past few days, I'm again fine.

What I want to know is how come nothing is happening?? Im just confused at this point because I really thought I'd end up in hospital but clearly not!! I haven't even thrown up at all today which is a bit disappointing and idk if I should just take the rest of the paracetamol (only around 8 more tablets I think?) or just give up. Anywho sorry for the rant I'm just a little baffled lol"
538,1,"There's this app called tellmi and you can talk about your problems and they have support and a community that helps people. 

The thing about this sub Reddit is it's just full of miserable people who see no way out (not a dig but it's the truth) tellmi has good and bad things, and general support. This is just a wall of noise and very little help. 

Guys do yourself a favour and download tellmi, genuinely. "
539,1,"My friend make a ton of self harm jokes, like whenever something doesn't go his way he'll laugh and say ""I'm gonna kill myself"" At first I was a little concerned but then he kept making jokes. He is a good friend, but he loves attention and I can't tell if he is joking, actually self harming, or just wants attention. I used to self harm and I wouldn't dare to joke about it. He also wears T-shirts and shorts so he probably isn't self harming, but should I be concerned?"
540,1,"Im a virgin at 20 and at this point why should I go on, if I'm never going to have love, if no one wants me then whats the point of living, what the point of going on every day suffering knowing you will never have young love and thats its gone, forever in the past, there is no good reason."
541,1,"I feel like I need to tell someone I am suicidal. I talk a lot about my problems to one of my friends, but I know she's so sick of listening to it. She only texts me or asks me to hang out because she feels bad for me, and we have been friends for so long.  I tell her a lot about my worries and problems, and I know it drains her to be around me. If I were her, I wouldn't want to be around me either. I always ask her for help with what to do with medication and stuff because she's very smart and I am very stupid. I just feel like I need to get it off my chest that I want my life to end. I don't know who to tell, though. I just hate my life so much and I am just so damn tired. I literally do like nothing too. I'm just so tired and want to just sleep forever. I guess I'm not that serious about ending my life because if I were, I wouldn't want people to know, right? 

I don't know, I just needed to vent. It's gotten so miserable living, I really don't know what the point. I cried myself to sleep last night because I was just so sad thinking that I hate my life so much that I want to end it. Then, I was just so sad thinking about my family, how heartbroken they would be. I guess I don't really want to die. I just don't want to live like this anymore. Yet, I don't have the energy or motivation to totally 360 my life. Every single aspect of my life needs a lot of help. I just don't want to do it. I also feel like even if I took the steps to fix my life, I would still be so unhappy. I don't want to live a unhappy and miserable life."
542,1,I need someone that can help with panic attacks I get extremely bad ones daily to the point my breathing gets so fast and I pass out calling people helps me loads when dealing with them but I’ve got no one I’d really appreciate If some people could help me it’s a daily struggle and it’s so hard t do alone

I could have fought her, screamed, pushed her off me, punch her in the face and run away, but my stupid fucking brain thought it was best to stay still and let her do what she wanted to do to me.

My psychologist told me that my brain did what it thought was the safest option; that would be freezing, and then fawning

Stupid child brain. I could have saved myself from her. Why."

547,1,"Story time: me and this girl was together for four months, we broke up just last week because of her mental health issues but she claimed it wasn't anything I had to worry about and she'd be fine. Everything was going decent (as far as I'm aware of) until tonight. Stuff started getting slightly off. She opened up to me a lot. Like- A LOT telling me things she claimed she's never told anyone else. It was odd but now that I sit here thinking about it, I feel like it was all planned. I feel like she was opening up to me before she decided to take her own life because she loved me. But it gets scarier from there! Next, we are about to go to bed on FaceTime and we talk for a bit like normal then she claims she wants to cry. Who am I to stop her? I tell her to let it out since it's best to let it out. She weeps more than Usual then hangs up the phone. I assume she just needs a minute to gather herself but no... The next and I prey to God not last message I get from her says ""I love you, I'm sorry."" Without thinking I spam her phone to only get no answer. I call everyone around me for help. Even contact her best friend. But it's no use. Over an hour passed still no respond. If she doesn't reply within 24 hours, I'm ending my own life. Till death do us part"

549,1,"Just a few days. I am scared. I feel sick. But I have the house to myself finally. I'm getting my final arrangements—notes, sending things to friends, and all that. I'm going to strangle myself with a shoelace. I've been crying thinking especially of my twin and best friend. My heart is broken. I can't even figure out what to write to them. I'm coming to terms with this. It's finally going to happen. I'm terrified, but it needs to happen. I will finally know peace and end this suffering I've lived with since I was so young. I don't know how to even go about these last days. I can't actually go anywhere and do anything, so that's kind of weird. So I'll spend my last days alone like my usual days and die alone as well. I wanted to ask my twin to have a sleepover before I did this, but I don't think they'd want to because they awkwardly responded the last time, not really rejecting, but clearly not interested, you know? Sucks a little. But it's also okay. I also don't want to get stupid and have a good day that makes me fuck up my plans now because I'll have hope for a night or something. And I need to clear all of my devices so people don't get private stuff like this account. Praying I don't fail in part for that lol. Because I'll lose everything on all of my devices and all haha.. I am feeling completely numb. I can't even really process this. I am trying to make the most and all, but I'm actually in such a physically and mentally exhausted, dissociated sort of state over this. It's sooner than I was anticipating, but also I don't want to wait anyway. But it's sort of hitting me. It's either going to happen or I will fail and humiliate myself and possibly ruin my life worse with permanent health issues, issues with family & friends, and medical bills we can't afford. I have no insurance. I wish it were easier to go out. I will listen to music when I do it. I'm sort of rambling right now, sorting through it all I guess. Because I've never been this close. I'm most afraid of failing and hurting people with this. "
550,1,I’ve been left completely alone after getting raped and ending up pregnant I need people to talk to as this is just getting worse I feel like dying I can’t do this anymore I get severe panic attacks daily I just wanna have someone to talk to 
551,1,"first i wish you have a good day.  
  
don't even know how to begin, well, as i said in the tittle i just don't fit; and i am just stuck with the feeling of lost purpose, i am 25 now, got no job (after trying for 8 month) , no lover (after being played with), due to my mental health slowly distaining myself from my supporting friends, and the killer (Maybe pun indented) i started to notice the same distant building Between myself and my parents.  
  
to maybe organise my text just plain and simple I am an empty shell of a man I dreamt of being, i don't hate my actions nor my decisions, i just hate the fact it all came down to nothing, feeling emptiness.  
  
I have being thinking about Suicide for years actually, and its not that I am afraid of doing it or i never stopped thinking about it, it just there in the back of my mind, like some part of me , but lately i being thinking about it really seriously but i feal conflicted on one simple dilemma, i would not mind dyeing or Suiciding, but if i do take my own life i fear that my family can not handle anther death of there child , and specially at there age. i do love them and they shown me nothing but support to me across my journey. but sadly it all came to nothing, just time wasted   
  
to Relief myself and punish thus who loved me or to Continue being a dead man walking to not make my family sufferer more than they already are, a mans wonder.  
  
and lastly I pray for you to have more hope in life.     "

553,1,"    I tried to commit suicide 3 times last year, none of them worked. Now I've been living pretending that I'm fine, but I want to try again. I use drugs to feel good. I'm 22 years old. I have no social life or friends. I just work and stay at home. I use opiates to feel good, but when the effect wears off, depression sets in. Tomorrow I have work and I don't want to go. I'm tired of working for nothing, but unfortunately I've run out of morphine. I'll have to stay sober until Thursday."
554,1,"I’ve been taking a lot of drugs and drinking a lot recently whenever I’m not the thoughts get really loud. I don’t know how to keep on going without being sober but I think if I keep on at this rate, I’m gonna die and I don’t know what to do anymore."
555,1,"I can't, i fucking can't, I'm 21 F living with my parents. It's been a month and half since I moved out another state from graduating my college and moving back in with my parents. 
And every single minute in that house reminds me of why I even left in the first place because OH MY FUCKING GOD I WANT TO KILL MYSELF. EVERY SINGLE DAY IM REMINDED OF MY 'DREADFUL LIFE' BY THEM. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. Everyday. And I fucking can't anymore. I want to talk about what exactly is happening too, it's insane. 
They ask me to have some PASSION, GOAL, something that's decided and long term. And all I can see myself doing is killing myself because your not making the home environment any easy for me."
556,1,"I know that my problem isn’t that much compared to others but I have been having a war with my mental health ever since idk. It started getting worse when me and my ex broke up, my ex accused me of cheating, almost off-ed myself because of it. Saw a therapist, built myself up again to not only relapse and my ex tried to try again with me to build it all up break me down again. Failed three subjects in my college, about to retake them again. Never felt shittier than ever. I want to be gone, either leave for a new city and never contact anyone ever again or just be done with it."

560,1,"My mother and stepfather are moving me with them to my hometown after my constant struggle with existentialism and depression in the big city. It's worse there. My stepfather used the home of his deceased mother immediately after she was put to hospital and said that we will live there for two years. I tried to fight back because they never mentioned anything coherently to me about the moving. Moving to the home of the recently deceased to me is the biggest insult to life. They constantly talk about renovating the apartment despite me not wanting to live with them at all. They irritate me constantly and drive me absolutely fucking insane over every detail. The student protests will go on for another 2 years so I don't see the point in living there. My entire family is divided into a million different sides constantly talking shit about each other and once I complain about it I'm told not to give a fuck about it because it doesnt matter. I apparently have it way better than them (housing) despite having no social support network or friend group. Not to mention being on the verge of complete lunacy. It's just me in a bubble where nothing in reality makes any coherent sense. I dislike people in general. My father told me to not be gay here or else he will personally come and beat me. The rest of the family that live here are all telling me to fight for a job and a place to reside back in the big city, but my mother and stepfather will not comply because I never wanted to do anything there albeit lack of purpouse. I needed a reason to escape them forever but they screw me psychologically, trying to stop me every step of the way. I had an intense mental breakdown outside in the street after a fight with my mother just so she wouldn't see me (essentially planning to walk 30 miles from there and block their contacts). Once I came back after the walk my stepfather attacked me and asked what the fuck I wanted in life, giving me a rant about how he has it terrible and had to wipe his ill mothers ass. I'm slowly giving up. I can't get therapy anywhere because of the massive corruption of this dumbass country God decided to put me in for laughs. What do I do before I fulfill my early teen plan of finally ending it all through a jump off the nearest window?"
561,1,I am recovering from the trauma of my suicide attempt and it is horrifying. I pretend everything is ok and everyone thinks I am ok. I am not this shit I eating me alive from the inside and I don’t know what to do. I am scared and traumatized. I honestly feel like dying.
562,1,"as a person who has attempted once with a self harm addiction, i thought all these years that i would've progressed from this miserable cycle, even with major side effects from my attempts, i thought i would wake up and stop myself from destroying my life further. 

i have never been so wrong in my life. it got so much worse for me, and this time i have also lost everyone around me. i am not welcomed at home, i have lost my friends, work has grown exhausting and my colleagues are constantly growing animosity towards me, people around me dying, i have no more motivation in doing what i love and college seems just like a dream i can't reach. im ugly, unapologetically stupid and im a bad person. 

i used to tell myself i wasnt any of those but along the lines i became more aware that i exactly am what people say i am. it also hurts when i disregard my own feelings to ensure those i care about are okay and are heard, but im shamed on and called selfish and greedy for letting out my feelings.

i have no one to talk to, and try to talk to myself to let the pain go away. i thought it was going to become better for me but instead of losing my spark, i feel like im losing myself entirely.

i cannot care for my body anymore, doing the most simplest things make me so tired, i get scared to go outside of my house, everything is just mentally exhausting. i am constantly shut out by everyone in my life and when i try to reach out, everything backfires. ive come to a point where something i was scared of doing from the outcome of it is now coming back again. 

the first time i did it, it was out of emotions, i wasn't prepared, i didnt know i was going to fail, i just wanted out and that was it, no letters no list, no everything

it feels like i survived that to just suffer more than i did. everything around me has crumbled and i have no future. this time im much more prepared.

im planning to take my life, i have no reason to stay anymore. i have a list and will try to check them out before i commit. im willing to do it before my birthday on the 27th of july. im going to quit my job in the next two weeks, and then i no longer have to think about anything in my life ever again. nihilism has got the best of me, i can't bare the thought of living and being alive is dreading.

to me it's like i chose myself for the first time by putting my body and mind to rest and i guess that's what makes me happy. 

hopefully i will make this whole month worth my entire years of living so i can feel at peace with myself

thanks a lot for those who took the time to read, i will be gone by then :) Goodbye strangers"

564,1,"I'm just not into it.

I dont really enjoy it. I dont want to work. I don't want to do pointless ""hobbies"". I dont really like doing anything except sleeping because then I'm unconscious.

I'm just not ""into"" life. Its exhausting to be confused about why I feel this way when everyone expects me not to, but as childish as it sounds, I never asked for my parents to randomly have sex and make me.

Life is just ""meh. I mean I dont have to do it if I dont want to- so why do it? It would save me so many problems.""

Life feels weird. I feel like I'm in a video game or something. As if theres no way this is real and it scares me. Like one day I'll wake up again.

Time never slows. I'm terrified.


I'm tired. I just want to sleep.

I can't fucking do it I can't do it I can't do it. I can't write it in 40 minutes I try so hard I try every day you know I try so hard all the time. All I do is try. I try so hard I just want something. I'll take anything"
567,1,"Why are we hardwired to fear death even if we so desperatly want it. Why do our bodies just go on auto pilot mode right when we’re about to die to try to save itself. What’s the point if we don’t have control over our bodies what kind of sick and twisted thing is that.
I really feel the need to kms by the end of this week but I’m terrified that my body will defy me like it already did."
568,1,"Life has always been very hard for me. My entire life I’ve had no friends. I’ve had no one to understand me. I’ve tried 5 antidepressants and 2 other various medications. Nothing has helped me. I’m extremely emotional. Anything happens good or bad, I cry. I always am getting stared at for being an emotional person

Recently (a few days ago) my partner broke up with me for their lack of communication. Basically they felt they were making my life harder by being in it. They have their own struggles going on and we’ve been able to get through them together. Up until a few days ago, life was great. I felt happy for once. I wasn’t hurting myself anymore and I wanted to live. I had my future planned.

Now my future feels crushed. I have no way to move out of my parent’s house. I can’t support myself on my own. I have no one to make me smile. I have no one to hang out with. I have no one who understands me. It feels like no matter what I do life wants to shit on me. I just feel like laying in bed all day. I don’t feel like trying anymore. I write this alone with no purpose. I just wanted to get this out there in hopes someone may understand. "

Im just so scared I'll do it eventually, and i kept telling friends im scared of doing it, but i cant just stop thinking how to, when, and things like that... Im so close to the date... Its getting scary

I just wanted to vent, sorry"
570,1,"This university is really my dream but the tuition fee is expensive. It is part of the top universities in my country. I passed the exam and got a 25% aid for my tuition. But my family still could not afford it because they bought 2 condominiums for my siblings js because they wanted to and that they will pay it once they graduate. But that also made us live paycheck to paycheck and did not have money left for my tuition. Am I selfish for getting mad as everyone tells me to be practical but i don't think anyone even understands me. I've been crying for hours now and my mother doesn't even care when she always care for my siblings. I'm really desperate to study in this university but I don't know how and it's making me crazy. My heart and brain feels like it's going to explode and I've just been begging him to kill me because I could not take it anymore

They also know that this university is really my dream since I was a kid and made a deal that if I got 97 as my general average, they will let me--which I did"
571,1,"After seeing the video of the incident in Georgia today, I feel now more than ever capable of jumping off an overpass. I’m confident that’s how I’ll die since I had my gun taken away from the police. I drive on a specific overpass daily that’s the highest on my route and over several other overpasses. The amount of times I’ve thought of pulling my car over and jumping to my death is astounding. But now, I feel like I can do it; that maybe I should. "
572,1,"I don't want to continue doing harm, just having existed causes harm to the one I love the most and that destroys me. I wish I could disappear without anyone noticing or remembering me. I just want to have been a dream and thus do no harm by leaving this world."

574,1,"I’ve been scrolling through and reading everyone’s posts and honestly I can relate to almost every one of you.  Why are we all here??  We’re all in pain and desperately want it to end. What’s the solution?? How can anyone actually help us physically with the problems we’re facing? A lot of it we can’t just talk out. Words are just words they don’t actually solve anything, I’m tired of the same generic responses. The only resources we have is suicide hot line or to be heavily medicated. It’s sad, I’m tired of living like this. Talking doesn’t solve anything the pain still remains, and the only way around it is medication that turns you into a zombie. Makes you feel like you’re living a dull boring life on black and white tv. So is the only way to take the pain away is to not be here?? I wish life could just run smoothly, but I guess for some people it doesn’t. It’s been real, I hope at least some of you guys can find happiness, peace out ✌️."
575,1,"Do you ever feel like one of those patients with brain damage trapped in an endless coma while their loved ones refuse to pull the plug? That’s how I feel living with these intense suicidal thoughts every single day. No one truly understands what it’s like. My loved ones want me to stay alive because they don’t want to lose me, but the truth is, I’m already gone. I feel dead inside, consumed by constant pain. Has anyone else ever felt this way?

577,1,"Hello everyone I hope you are all doing well. 

This is a post I do not wanna be making, I am deciding to set my plan in motion and to begin to prepare to end it. I am not sure how it got this bad but no matter what I will not call 911 for this. Cause then I'd be stuck in the psych ward and probably injured for life. 

Good night I hope to post again."
578,1,"I haven't decided yet, it's just been many years already. Everything is mental, I've tried to help myself erasing the feelings but they won't go over the years. I'm supposed to be doing what was expected from me in my life, what I expected to. I'm a year away from finishing university and currently have a half-time job. What is wrong with me?

When I was younger I thought it was nicer to be alone, in my room, nobody bothering me. Now I feel slowly consumed by loneliness. I'd felt an idiot before, but it wasn't because lacking of social interaction, just because of feeling like a lie. Right now the older feelings persist along with the loneliness. The funny part is that my family is fully functional, I'm the older brother, studying a career, having a job, polite guy... but it all feels a lie. It all has pushed me many times to ""try"" this last year. But I'm a coward, I haven't succeeded. 

What has stopped me more than anything are those left behind: family, ""friends"", my students (cuz I'm a teacher). Lucky for me I won't leave no broken hearts behind, haha. Never had a girlfriend or similar. 

So, is there a way to completely disappear from others' lives, minds or something, without worrying them? They don't need to know I died. I don't want to my family to see my bleeding or decomposing body. I feel so stupid for writing this all, but I will send it anyways. I'm afraid. "
579,1,"Ever since graduating high school, me and my family had high hopes. I've had many achievements, certificates, good grades, trophies etc. My family isn't good financially, so I worked hard to achieve enough to get a scholarship. I've won in many competitions, I've went on exchange programs and everything you need to do for a good scholarship.
But, after applying and applying to over 70+ universities/colleges. I haven't even gotten into 1. I thought, hey it happens to everyone. I'll just take a gap year and work on my profile even more, so I did just that. I volunteered at different places, joined conferences, won more competitions and got a 8.0 in IELTS. 
But even after that, not a single institution has accepted me. So I tried to apply for some part time jobs until it works out, and I still haven't gotten a single Jon yet as well.

I probably could've done more, I could've done more. But dammit I did try. I worked hard to built my profile enough so that I could lift my parents burden just a little.
If I achieve and work hard enough, I'll get a scholarship and help my parents. But I can't even get a part time job, no institutions wants to accept me.

I've accomplished the opposite of what I worked for, I became a burden for my parents. 

My sister is about to graduate college and the future looks very promising to her, my brother is a genius, he's studying well and even schools offer him some discounts to study. My parents are at a decent living condition now.

The only thing that's a big problem is me, I'm still at my bedroom, eating, sleeping, breathing, doing nothing. I feel like just another mouth that needs to be fed.

So, if I died. Would life become easier for them. It would be sad for a while but they would have less struggle financially.

I just think my life is better off gone."
580,1,"I’ve been putting this off for a long time, but I think I’ve backed myself into a situation where the easiest way out is, in fact, the easy way out. I’ll be turning 20 in December, but the path my life has taken is not the one I want, and I’m fully aware that the only one to blame for all this is me. Over the past few years, I’ve thought of this as the option I’d take if I ever hit a wall that I just knew I couldn’t get past — and that wall has finally arrived.  
I’m sharing this because I have no one else to tell. I know no one around me could truly understand how I got to this point. That said, it’s not midnight yet where I am, and I don’t plan to do anything until midnight.  
If anyone has any questions or advice on how to make this as least painful as possible (that’s my biggest fear right now), feel free to share. I will gladly answer every message.

581,1,"Mental health struggles are so exhausting. I’m just tired. I used to be tired of pretending but I’ve now reached the point I can’t pretend anymore. I’ve been luckier then most. Yes, I’ve gone through some heavy traumatic experiences and it’s not like I can’t pretend people wouldn’t be mildly upset I’m gone. Why can’t I be selfish and just say I’m done? I can’t fight anymore. I’ve tried but I can’t get through to myself I’m worth it. Sure everyone is inherently worthy of love and life. I just can’t see that as true for myself. I should be held to a higher standard since I haven’t had experiences deemed as the worst life has to offer. I’m a shitty human being for having depression when others have been through worse yet have come through the adversity stronger then ever. Others that still struggle through worse then me and have the will, courage, and strength and self love to know they are worth being in this world. Those are the ones I wish I could be.

I think about ending it everyday but I’m too scared. Scared of what comes next. Scared of physical pain. Scared of not knowing what comes next for my stupid favorite TV shows. Pathetic right?

There’s only so much support a family and your friends can give you before it becomes to much for them. They say “reach out to your support network” but even they can have a limit on how much you can lean on them before it becomes too much for them as well. I may not end it today but I feel like my time is dwindling. I used to be able to get pulled from a funk but it’s becoming harder to do so. I’ve struggled more than 30 years and I’m tired. No more supposed strength (when it’s more weakness and fear).

I’m on three medications and I just don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t mean to negate anybody else in this world, but to me, I’m just a tiny ant that could be sniffed out and yes, will it be affect a few people, the world will still go on. Only a few peoples day-to-day lives will be affected. Yet life still goes on."
582,1,"I can't even write something right now, it's been too difficult and today I realized no one really cares about me, no even my boyfriend whos a fucking cheater and liar. I hate how I trusted him and everyone else, now that I feel lonely I have no one to call, no one to talk to, no one that cares for me. I lost my grandfather recently and I just feel miserable about everything in my life, so much pain and no one that cares for me."
583,1,"3 months ago my dad took his life. no note, no last call, nothing
not even a month after, my partner at the time confessed they no longer loved me, and hadn't for a while.
ive been grasping at straws trying to find reasons to keep going for a long while now, but ive never felt this abandoned and hopeless before. i have no one left to turn to"
584,1,I hate humanity with every fiber of my being. So much evil. So much injustice. Abusers run this world and get to do whatever they want. And no one cares about me or will care when I kill myself. I fucking has this shit. I never asked to be born. 
585,1,"I want my happily ever after so bad, when I get the chance I might end it "
586,1,"honestly 

i want to just do it

I can’t do this anymore. i cannot. 

this world, its so bad, it’s awful. i’m supposed to be in a nice city, to finally feel safer and more comfortable. to feel more secure, to have a better life.

but what’s the point. what is the point

I have everything I want, but other people want what I have. if they see my expensive setup. that’s just money for THEM. ITS THEIRS in their eyes 

(for context, people have been scoping out my neighborhood again for the 1000th time in the past two years, the park managers and police decide to do nothing about it and these people scoping out the places look into peoples houses and try to get in.)

I get a car I want, i’m proud of it, but guess what that is just easy money and a joyride to them. not my car, their car now. whatever I have in my life is a liability 

no gun to protect myself, I don’t have a dog to bark and scare people away

I don’t even feel like an adult, i feel like i’m 15 

I just don’t want to do this. this world isn’t what I remember it being, it’s messed up and everything is going wrong and nobody cares anymore 

I just wish everyone loved each other and cared and wanted to make this world better too

this just isn’t what I want

even if I decided, okay let’s move back to the last city i was in because it’s safer , guess what tornado valley (i have trauma with storms due to being in a very awful one that killed somebody next-door) and nothing is around me to do or eat and i’m back in that bad memory place but hey at least nobody is gonna break in my house

I just get bad vibes around this area now nothing feels good anymore, like it doesn’t matter where i decide to live anymore it’s always a liability and i don’t want to live that way

and it feels like nobody cares about how I feel when it comes to this I just get the impression that people think i’m crazy but like I seen this happen before man i literally had to experience my step dad try to break into my own home before i still have trauma from that too

I miss living with my grandparents, at least if something were to happen there would be multiple people protecting what we got, but it’s almost like I live alone now due to my husband being gone 10 hours a day 6 days a week. I don’t have a way to protect myself at all and people are gonna see that i’m just this scared girl who doesn’t know what she’s doing and become an easy target

it just sucks it hurts 

i don’t wanna live in a world like this anymore, this isn’t for me, this isn’t what I want. I don’t want to be on earth anymore. i’m sick and tired of this. 

I tried therapy, they didn’t seem to help much out of the countless therapists i’ve had, I want to at least live my life being oblivious and pretend everything is happy and fine and dandy but I don’t know if that could ever happen, I just miss when I was 8 years old and my biggest worry was missing a stupid club penguin event that’s going on

I can’t enjoy myself anymore. I can’t relax. i can’t do anything. because some dumb kids or people want to take what they think is theirs constantly. just for some extra cash, for drugs or whatever. what happened to getting a job and earning your money like i don’t get it , we resort to stealing and hurting people thinking it’s normal when it’s not at all
"
587,1,Im not a good person. I dont make my partner feel loved no matter how hard i think im trying. Im so fucking useless. Ive been thinking about cutting instead of ending it but i dont know which i will do. Nothing i do will ever be enough. I dont understand how to be a person
588,1,"i am losing everything right now. i just lost my friends, lain and taff. i dont know what to do. ive been wanting to kill myself for a long time, and i feel like i should do it now. they were literally the main part of my happiness, and now i feel like ive ruined everything. i told them id stop. but i didnt stop. i kept threatening them with suicide threats and now theyre gone. ive ruined everything. i was so happy with them. i tried begging them to stay. i knew that we were going to part someday. i am in so much pain right now. i have almost no one to talk to now. im having a mental breakdown right now. i regret everything. "
589,1,It’s hard to feel anything these days. Life has been passing by and I just feel so numb like nothing matters at all. Feel like i’ve wasted what was supposed to be the best years of my life too. How is it that my life can objectively get so much better but my mental health is still getting even worse than it was before? Idk how much longer i can fucking do this I wish assisted suicide was an option at least then I know it’ll be painless. I doubt i’ll die in my sleep any time soon 
590,1,"Will 1,300 mg of trazedone and a bunch of alcohol kill me in my sleep? If not will it at least kill me I honestly don't care anymore at this point."
591,1,My parents abusive and my brother when I have tried to kill myself before they just called it attention seeking unlucky it was unsuccessful . so they would not care if I died I have no friends i do not know why I am even still alive.
592,1,"This sucks hate feeling like a fraud to everyone iv ever known or loved
I just dont see a point ill never give or be what they want wether i walk off rn or not i think it wont ever matter to anyone  
Ill never be real idk how to feel or think anymore i will never satisfy those who say they love me im not a real girl theres no point in hoping for another path anymore "
593,1,"So i made a joke about my birthdate being the worst day of my life, then my dad missheard it so i re-said what i said to my mom. Then i casually said that i wish i could go back into the void and that it was cruel that i was born, typical me things.

And then my mom says 'what did you want us to do, ask you?' as she usually responds to these type of jokes i say. Then my dad being my dad randomly brought up religion. He said 'HE knew you before he created you. He blah blah blah' I spaced out a bit so i dont remember more exacts of what he siad

Now religious stuff is something i have made a boundary on. I am a hardcore atheist and religion makes me very upset. My family knows this. This is not the first time he has brought up religion knowing damn well its bad. A few months ago he was yapping about it while i was crying and shaking :)

I fuckign hate him. I dont care if hes a 'good person' and jsut has mental health issues. I don't fuckign care anymore. He misgenders me and brings up religion now and then knowing damn fuckign well i hate it. 

Edit: HE just asked if he upset me, no shit sherlock of course you did. This is why its so hard to fully hate him or be ok with him. Acts like an ass and then apologizes. "
594,1,That’s it. 
595,1,"I just recently developed a condition that is untreatable and will slowly debilitate me until the day I die. I don’t think I’ll be able to make it, I want to kill myself. I don’t want this to be traumatic for anyone, I just want to be gone. I don’t want to cause harm, I don’t want to bother anyone’s lives. But I also don’t want to leave my family behind."
596,1,"There’s more like 3 hours plus half an hour left before I turn 28, not looking forward to it with no one to celebrate. I pushed away my aunts cause I’m tired of hearing their empty sympathies that I wish my parents could give me but that’s just as unlikely as my life getting any better.
This is probably a stupid reason, but my life has gone downhill since I failed math in high school. I can’t move on I just can’t because it’s been a needle on my back for my entire life, even when I wanted to pursue a career in arts I couldn’t forgive myself for failing math and I’ve tried to pass FIVE TIMES to no avail. If I turn 28, it’ll take me probably a few years to upgrade since I’m also missing chemistry and physics and others before I can get into uni and I’m not even sure i want to be a stupid engineer but it seems like it’s the best damn option cause I can’t see any others and the ones I have considered have more complicated obstacles that I can’t fucking pass. My parents say I can’t do it, maybe if I was 18 they’d have more faith but now my mom just think I’m a fucking dumbass leeching off their money. I don’t want to, and I’ve tried to work at my retail job I’ve really tried and I have some of my own money but it’s been affecting me both physically and mentally to the point that I just can’t be in that building anymore. I know I sound like an entitled person right now, maybe I won’t die but I did look down at the balcony a few times and I’m considering going to the distress Center. But I don’t want tomorrow to come, I don’t think I can handle another year. "
597,1,"I'm just trying to escape from the pain and hardship of life that I'm facing right now.And yes, I'm still writing this message, which means it failed again.At first I was determined to do it, but when it finally came to fruition, I was scared. It was so scary.. It was both painful and terrifying.And my body, trying to survive, doesn't work with my broken soul at all.This is the second time I have tried to end my life in a month.I don't know how to live my life anymore. Living is painful and full of failure, but dying is painful and full of fear.😥"

599,1,"I have to be up for work in 4 hours and I’m just crying my eyes out because I don’t know how I can go on like this. My mental health is at an all time low and I’ve been suffering like this since the beginning of the year trying to get professional help but appointments are so far between each other and I don’t have any friends. I hate my life, i no longer like my job and can barely afford to live where I am, I don’t have any accomplishments to my name and I just feel broken. It also doesn’t help that I’m extremely unmotivated. I took a week off of work because i thought it would help a bit but I just slept most days and barely did anything. I’ve never hurt myself and I don’t think I will anytime soon but I passively do with my addictions and unhealthy habits. I wish i would just die most days, I hate that I can’t enjoy anything or go out and just do things and smile and live life. I put so much pressure on myself to succeed yet i stay stuck just being a loser. I know people say it gets better but I can’t seem to do anything to make it better. "
600,1,"What if i want to kill myself, but the thought keep stabbing my heart of how my loved ones would feel if i suddenly kill myself, honestly I'm really tired of thinking about others that how would they feel if i kill myself without any warning, but their faces haunts me whenever i think about unaliving myself, they would mourn over me and that makes me want to sob to death, but I'm exhausted and beyong sanity to think about anyone, but if i don't think about the outcome of me unaliving myself, does it make me a selfish human being who only think about herself, i keep thinking and thinking about my loved ones and that is keeping me away and pulling me towards the edge at the same time, what should i even write about in my fucking suicide letter, I'm tired of apologizing, i've been apologizing for my whole life, am i supposed to say I'm sorry mom and dad, i failed like always, i couldn't handle it. I don't even know what the hell would i write in it, I don't even know how i feel myself, I'm one confused soul, How the hell am i supposed to speak my mind and make others understand about my pitiful life about what's going on in my insane mind when i don't even understand what's wrong. Sometimes the idea of living itself makes me disgusted, sick to my stomach and makes me completely lose my mind."
601,1,"throwaway because this is a nasty post
i get enraged so easily  every time i get mildly inconvenienced i go into a fit of anger that makes feral beast that wants to kill a person  thankfully i havent killed anybody yet but im still way too angry
if anybody knows how to stop being angry forver and it isnt a stupid philosophical answer please answer me  i dont want to be like this anymore it sucks"
602,1,"I don't know. My self harm has been bad. I wish I could tell people but it's just like I feel guilty after telling them. A boy last night told me to kms multiple times because I didn't want to date him. And I seriously thought about it for a while because I don't know anything better. ""I'm here for you."" When have you ever been. My friends ofc are the only exception to this, and I just want to leave. I don't want my life anymore. It's ruined in it's entirety. And please if someone could actually talk I would appreciate it sm. Thank you."
603,1,"But I don't want to live either. I suffer, yeah, but I'm just exhausted with life right now."
604,1,"i guess the only reason is to keep my family from being sad but at that point i'm just a happiness slave. maybe it's selfish to unalive myself but idc because they're the ones that brought me into the world without my consent

i just don't see a reason to keep going. working is too hard, complicated, boring, and too much work. i don't get anything in return for it. just another day of work and a couple hours of free time and then two measly days off. what am i even working for? to be generously blessed to work again the next day? even during time times that i've been unemployed for several months at at time i've gotten so fucking bored

however there's one thing that i think would make me happy: moving abroad. the reason is because i love learning languages and i want to live immersed in another language. the problem is this is not possible. i only have american citizenship and other countries don't just give a work visa away for free so i have no hope of moving abroad

since i can't move abroad i've accomplished essentially everything i want to in my life. now i just need to figure out how to stop being a pussy and finally do it because i really have nothing to wait for"
605,1,"I‘ve hit a rough patch with my boyfriend of 6 years … again.
I don’t know how much longer we can make this work. On the other hand, he is literally the only person I‘m talking to. I don’t have any friends and I‘m severely depressed. 
I don’t think I can live alone without anyone to talk to. I just know I‘m going to kill myself the second he‘s gone and I‘m alone. I‘m so scared. "
606,1,"I know I’m just a stranger but I don’t feel like living anymore, I live everyday, numb, bored, nothing ever changes. I’m chronically online, isolated, etc. I used to have a lot of hobbies, these hobbies r shameful for me now "
607,1,"Thankfully, my father made it to the hospital in time and underwent surgery to unclog his arteries. A very unfortunate Father’s Day. He is currently recovering in the I.C.M. section of the hospital.

Maybe I am just selfish, but I also had the feeling that it should have been me in this situation, and not my father. He honestly did not deserve it, and I most likely do. My life is far worth less than any of my other family members. I would have just not talked about any pain, and just let it happen.

I do not really want to keep going, to be honest as I already barely exist in society and probably have no future. I most likely will never have a girlfriend or real friends whatsoever, and college is just burning me out. No one really cares about me anyway. I guess that is why I play support roles in video games. All my help goes unnoticed. 

If only it was easy to have a quick death. I am too much of a coward to inflict any lethal damage to myself. I am sure that slowly, but surely my health is deteriorating with whatever I consume. My family might go through some pain, but it really does not matter. I just want it to end. There is no one to blame but me."
608,1,"Made a friend got attached within a day i dont know how, she just seemed perfect she said she really liked me aswell, it was only online but it felt real to me because i suck at making friends i promised id send some, intimate pictures when i woke up from a nap, i didnt wake up i got blocked, been a terrible week ontop of that got really drunk scared to go home, cried threw up, and she helped me through that aswell

it feels like a fucking sign i guess i cant have good things because i ruin them

ive never felt this level of self loathing before like i want to cut every inch of my by i want ti pour boiling water into my lap nothings okay i cant do this"
609,1,why put in all that effort? because someone somewhere decided that because they enjoy being alive so everyone has to as well and ending it is wrong? 
610,1,"I was bought into this life just to grow up in an abusive household, turned 18 just to be sent away to college and now ill have to spend the rest of my life slaving away the day just to keep a roof over my head. All of it is suffering. Everyday is so stressful and it feels like I’m just trying to survive day by day. This is hell and we’re supposed to be grateful for it.

I just want to go back to before I was born. I love sleeping cause I don’t think about anything for a few hours. I imagine that’s what death is like, but forever.

 I can’t even kill myself cause that would pass on trauma to my family and siblings, they’d have to live in shame. Every method is just so gruesome or messy and just not how I want to end my life. Everyday I pray I pass away in my sleep, get hit by a truck, just something so I die naturally. "
611,1,"My baby is gone. He's the one that stopped me from killing myself years ago-- the only reason that I haven't done anything today is because I feel like it'd be a betrayal of him.

He had a mini stroke yesterday that we weren't able to notice and one this morning that sealed it. He just seemed a little sick yesterday. Then my dad had to take him to get put down.

I didn't let him in my room last night. I always do but I was worried that he'd throw up so I left him downstairs alone. My parents say that there's nothing I could've done (he already had one by that point and he was pretty much already gone) but I wasn't there for him on his last night. My parents didn't let me go to the vet either so I wasn't next to him when he died. I only got to say goodbye for a couple minutes in the car and then he was gone.

We only had him for a couple years and I don't know what to do without him. I've been on and off crying all day, I just don't know how I'm supposed to keep going. I put some of his fur and collar into containers to try and keep the scent for as long as I can. I'm over 600 days SH clean but this is the first time in over a year that the urges are overwhelming."

613,1,"Waking up is a punishment. Every day starts with the same weight: I don't want to be here. I can no longer stand being pushed into a life that violates me in silence. Living has become a cruel obligation. I am not heard. I'm just tolerated, and barely. I feel like I'm trapped in a maze. All I can think about is how much better it would be if it ended soon. I don't want help, advice or promises. I want peace. Maybe my peace is at the end of it all. "

My brother passed away like 15 years ago and I can't just feel better about it, it doesn't ""get better"" that's the biggest lie I ever heard o read in my whole life, my granny passed away in my hands and it was absolutely my fault and my head just punish me every night for that

I just want to tell my bf about my intentions about kms in my bd, next year I'll be 27 and just wanna be part of 27s club but i can't tell him this, I know I will destroy him but already have talked with my mom about this and she is sad but I can't anymore I don't have a work or degree or something like that I just spend my nights playing LoL just to ignore my head about the useless that I'm

I have fear to death but this is the best for my and my family, when I do this they will no have a useless mouth to feed and my bf will be free to make his life with a better girl

Bro, I know I'm bad and that shit but I don't know what to do, really I dunno I'm just tired of everything and everyone I just feel that the world is cruel and hostile, in the news I just see bad things and things that make me anxious I just feel better with my cat but someday he will die and I don't want so see that "

im a fourteen year old girl and ive been like cutting myself since i was 8/9. i djdnt see it online or anything i just did it. i felt ljke i was the only one for years. i wanted to kill myself back then too. when i was 11 i developed an eating disorder too. now im 14 and since then ive had a bunch of suicide attempts all by overdose and my most recent one was in february and it was also my most serious one. i ended up in the er and then in the icu for nearly a week. honestly i was meant to be discharged a bit earlier but i was there for longer because i was refusing to eat. anyway one day before my discharge a psychologist came to talk to me. she only talked to me about my opinion on chatgpt. what the fuck?…i felt like she didnt give a fuck i tried to kill myself. no one took it seriously. cps sent me to a psychiatrist a month later. he was so shit. and they also sent my brother with me because we were twins. btw my brother is perfectly fine. the psychiatrist ignored me the entire time and then told my parents and social services that i was and i quote “perfectly mentally stable”. okay i mean clearly im sick and being told that really fucking made me feel insanely invalid. i dont know what im even ranting about now but im really pissed. every single day and night my mind is only occupied with visualisation of me committing suicide by different methods. nothing else. and i cannot kill myself. i want nothing except that but i cant. too traumatized from the overdosing, dont know how to hang, cant get a gun from anyone to shoot my brains, slitting my arteries is hard, i dont wanna commit in public and probably wont have the courage to jump off a bridge or building, cant get hit by a train either. my only option is to feel possessed and powerless by these visualisations because its seriously visual and i want to but i cant"

I have a plan that I made all last week. I will be trying the same method as I tried before. I was close to dying but I was saved and ended up in a coma
 
I know how to take advantage of my epilepsy. Taking too many pills makes me seize same with alcohol. Last time I said to my ex boyfriend that I don't feel well so thats why I was saved. 

I will end up status epilepticus again like last time but this time I will die from seizing due to lack of oxygen. I have calculated everything. The amount of time needed, when etc.

If i fail, I could ended up with some really bad injuries  such as being severely disabled. I've researched everything."

From Ohio
And I have absolutely no will to live 
I am trapped in a relationship that has run me into the ground..Im all fucked up with custody with my daughter and trapped in court a custody agreement I hate, I barely get to see her, I feel like everybody hates me…I know I am a terrible person, I can understand why. I am destined to die. When I was 13, my girlfriend killed herself and I found her body the next morning and ever since she died I knew I would have to make it right. My grandmother, the only person who ever loved me my entire life died last week. She suffered for 3 long months and I took care of her and then she just died. She laid there and died. 
What’s the point of writing notes when nobody ever heard what you had to say when you were alive? Im not saying Im bitter but I know there’s no point. I can’t take care of myself, I can’t take care of my partner, of my family…I don’t deserve to be here anymore and I am so done with suffering.

629,1,"for the past three days i've been wanting to end it. i've had these phases multiple times throughout my life, but i dont understand why. i go through these phases where i can't stand talking to people or explaining my thoughts because all i want to do is end it. i dont think i have the right to feel that way, i have a great life, i have friends, my parents are alive, and whatnot, but if i did die, i don't think i would have any words left to say to these people. although they should be significant, they aren't, i don't think i would owe them any last words.

i dont know why i feel this way, i always leave it to ""i'm overreacting,"" but now, i don't know why i'm upset, why i'm having these thoughts, i just dont want to live anymore. i can't see myself getting older, i can't see myself living in these next 6 months, i dont see myself turning 18. i dont see anything. i really do just want to end it. i've been wanting to end it, since i was 8, even when the concept of death wasn't a ""concept"" to me. i'm not really sure what to call this, i have no access to a doctor who can help, nor would a doctor be of any help, and i can't put my thoughts into words, this is the best i can do. "
630,1,"I only recently turned 14 and I have nothing head of me, I am so tired with people saying that all the damn time. My parents are good people, but sometimes they snap at me and tell me to go die, or beat me, it's so painful and it's ready affecting me and I can't do this. I've tried to OD many times but it failed and just come out as me being sick. Everyone always never believed me whenever I say anything and everyone always picks a side against me, especially my parents. I wish I was never born, all I can do is cut myself and watch the blood and it's never fucking enough. I was going to wait until I tuned 16 to run away or kill myself but today's a fantastic day. My dad said for Father's Day he wants me dead so here's his gift for him.

Edit: I just downed a bottle of Tylenol and I'm slightly shaking or trembling or whatever. I really hope it works.

Edit2: I only threw up. I don't have time to wait 12 hours ☹️.

Edit3: I'm still alive."
631,1,"I have a UTI or something and my doc said (a month ago) that the urines fine and I should ask my gyno if theres anything wrong. Ofc nothing was wrong. And now, a month later, I cant fucking sleep, because I feel like I have to piss constantly, its all burning down there, my head hurts, Ive been crying for nearly three hours and all that, as if everything else was going so great. As greatvas can be, when youre a 20y/o virgin, highschool dropout, unemployed and not skilled enough to get accepted to any job ever. I cant decide if I wanna kill myself, or I want my mom to be here and wait till everything gets better magically "
632,1,"I don't know how to make this sound like I'm not an absolute piece of shit, okay. I'm tired, I'm exhausted, I'm scared and I'm alone. I fell in love with a girl named Meg. I didn't have intentions of getting that close to her. But she was there when no one else was. She was like a fucking light through one of the worst storms across an angry sea. We related to each other so much, she was hurting and I tried so hard to help. We would go on long night time car drives, silence in the air but each other's presence was what helped. Staying on a phone call to hear her breathing and crying when she was planning on committing started the ball rolling. 

For three years, I waited for her to get better, visiting her, giving her hoodies, shirts, blankets. It hurted me seeing her so weak. Knowing she could die from her years of being sick. 

She's staying in a different state, not at home. She can't come home. She won't fathom the thought. And here I am. Feeling emotions like their physically hurting me. I can barely breathe when writing this admission. It's been about 2 months since ive learned she's not coming home. Originally I thought I would just learn to survive. Handle life and continue while I support her from afar. But I can't. I always gave myself away to people. I would care much more about them then they cared about me.trying to keep them from leaving. My father was a horrible person, my mother was just as bad but I was a mommy's girl. When she met my step dad she got worse with her bad habits. There wasn't a night where she was sober, some nights she would kick me out of our apartment. Especially when it  was winter. At that time I was only a freshman in high school. But when I met Meg my late sophomore year of high school, she was like an angel. She had so much empathy that I had never really seen in a person. We both cried when out favorite work store parrot died. 

I loved her. I still do. A coward to admit to her directly. A coward and ashamed to admit to her that I feel so betrayed by her. ""I feel betrayed but I'm not resentful"" and I promise I'm not. My head isn't okay, it never was. My brain, my mind, my memories are making this feel as bad as the betrayal I felt when I was only 6 trying to tell my mother that my own father was a monster. Physically I feel memories and the emotions. It feels twisted in my head of why I feel like this betrayed. Megs would never so this to me. But it feels exactly like it and I am just as lost and confused. 

Is it wrong to just want to be wanted. To be chosen instead of being left behind like a stupid Nintendo dog. "
633,1,"Tonight, well the past few months have been hard. I wish i could go back to March, early march. It was like one of those few weeks that was like a movie or one of those sunny memories that you had when you were a kid, nothing bad was gonna happen, all you could think of were all the good things that were gonna happen, i think of them and just see how dull my life is, i can barely smile, i have this deep hole inside my heart this pain that just wants to come out. I don’t know how much longer I can keep going without being truly happy. I used to be able to do it very easily, but that was before I knew what being happy was like. Those short moments of happiness i felt, was the most alive i’ve ever felt, that i could i could sleep happy and wake up happy, its probably normal for some people but it was like a dream for me in a way, i had nothing to be afraid of, nothing to hate. I had something to love. The gig on Saturday was one of those nights thats when i go to properly met Finn and after that I loved him a lot. It’s not a movie kind of love either. I just looked at him sometimes, and I think he was the nicest person in the world. I was around people that loved me a lot, i wish Toby and the others were there, i mean it was like that when we were at the movies. The way Finn made me feel was the kind of feeling that I could never tell my friends about out loud. It was the kind of feeling that made me know that I was never so happy in my whole life. I went home that night the happiest person ever, even though the past few days hurt a bit Toby was right, people were there for me, they didn’t need to be, but they were and they cared about me. People still do, but it feels so small, my life feels so small. Something really is wrong with me. And I don't know what it is. I know that I brought this all on myself. I know that I deserve this. I'd do anything not to be this way. I'd do anything to make it up to everyone. And to not hurt myself, And to not have to take meds to not feel afraid or sad, And to not be sad about my only happy memories. I just wish someone would just tell me what's wrong with me. Just tell me how to be different in a way that makes sense. To make this all go away. And disappear. I know that's wrong because it's my responsibility, and I know that things get worse before they get better because that's what my friend says, but this is a worse that feels too big. I am really in love with Finn still, and it hurts very much. I miss him, i miss my band, it feels painful to think of them and remember that i won’t be there with them anymore and i wonder if they are happy. I hope they are. I really hope they are because i know i never will be.

634,1,Lowkey i just wanna end it yk? I just feel like such a burden to my family like they didnt ask for their kid to have depression? They didnt ask for a kid that self harms and attempts suicide im not saying their life would be better off without me just saying less stress ik im just 14 and i have my whole life but they dont deserve this i dont want to have to rely on medicine and the hospital bills? Ik they can pay i just im so tired and angry and sad i just wanna be happy but i feel so guilty because being sad is all i know i dont wanna die but idk how to live anymore and just self harming makes me feel alive idk
635,1,"not doing ok, been trying to drink for months to numb the pain. asshole bf broke up with me saying it is a drinking problem. i wanna die and stop feeling the pain. its ok u win im gone. i just dont want to feel this way anymore "
636,1,"I have been riddled with depression my whole academic career, but it really took a toll on me in high school. I started performing worse, and as a result, didn't see the point in doing well in school because I had already ruined it all. I realize now, looking back at my grades, that they don't fully reflect my true potential as a student. I can't get into any good schools, and it makes me hate myself more than ever. This may sound a bit outrageous, but academics are very important to me. My parents expect so much, and it would be such a relief to just die and not have to go through this process. I have decided that if I don't get into a prestigious college, I will kill myself. And it's not looking good for me. I've probably got another 8 months at most. "
637,1,"Hi all I guess I just need to rant, recently my mental health is at an all time low, to start my grades came back from my first year at college with a 1.86 gpa, that was more than a kick to the balls since my dad is a teacher and I could see how disappointed he was, so I guess im really stupid, on that I have lost any motivation to go to the gym and have gained fat and have gotten weaker, this is because of my job which takes the entire day, and I just don’t have time to go, also my I don’t know about my relationship. Let’s call her Sara, we have been dating for over a year and a half and other the course of our relationship I have always texted first and have planned every single date, I have told her that I don’t like her smoking weed and vaping and drinking yet she continues to do so and we seem to FaceTime less and less as she leaves me on delivered for days sometimes. She works a lot and claims she is too tired after work to call, which I get but I see her some nights at Applebees with her friends. Which I think is fine but I guess what I’m saying is I don’t feel like my needs are being met and well I feel like I’m being left behind. Any advise?"
638,1,"I did so many different kinds of therapy; DBT, CBT, talk therapy, art therapy, everything you can think of and none of them have helped me even in the slightest. DBT's ""mindfulness"" skills feel like pure nonsense for someone who is as off the rails as i have become. I've been trying to work through Dr. Daniel Fox's workbook and all it does is make me feel more depressed. 

I've cut off all my friends because I didn't view them as good enough and they all said one slight thing that made me permanently resent them to the point of being happier blocking them than ever speaking to them again. I ruin every friendship I have and it has been that way since I was a kid. I never know what I do wrong until it's too late. I'm always lashing out and acting so cruel. And I cut them off without any warning and just ghosted them entirely and i feel bad but i wasn't even thinking and i had such a rush that i can't even explain to anyone. 

I control my boyfriend so much and get filled with intense jealousy over every single girl who speaks to him. We've been together for so long and I love him so much and it breaks my heart that I am so mean and I hurt him when it's just out of my own fear of being abandoned. I know it's not right and I always try to say it whenever I have episodes but I just can't fix it permanently. I know how much im damaging him. I get jealous of even elderly ladies and young teens who speak to him, it's genuinely out of hand and I don't know how to stop. I get filled with such raging jealousy and anger and hatred and such a strong urge to protect him and defend myself so that im never replaced. I feel like a total loser and a psycho. I don't know what id do if he leaves me, ive been with him for almost 50% of my entire life. We grew up together and I fear because of my problems we will not be able to grow old together. I'm such a mess. I know he deserves to be free from my issues. He says he loves me no matter what and will stay forever but why i don't even understand it anymore. I'm such a problem. 

My anger issues with others is out of hand, I have little to no filter and horrible social cues that almost always leave me looking bad or having people yelling at me. I have constant panic attacks and meltdowns over the smallest things I go 0-100 in an instant, and it drives me just as crazy as it does to everyone around me, but no one cares. 

No one understands how hard it is to change. I don't even think it's possible. I have been trying so hard for years and it's never enough. I feel that I am destined to be alone and contribute to the stereotype of bpd individuals having a short life expectancy. I don't know if I want to keep trying, I don't think it is worth it to a point. I think I am unfixable. I'm sorry for the pessimism, but I have no one to talk to. I've abandoned them all so they don't leave me first, and i don't want to be a burden to the only person i have left. I'm sorry everyone 

Bpd ruins lives, it ruins mine and it ruins everyone who has to be around me. I wouldnt wish it upon anyone else. 
"
639,1,"I hate my family so much. Like I can’t even be around them without getting irritated. I just hate being around them. When I’m with friends I’m fine but with family I just can’t deal with it. I just get angry just hearing their voice.

It’s not like they’re that abusive. I mean as a kid they hit me a few times and I remember being scared of what they would do to me if I got in trouble. And they would always yell, swear, or threaten to hit me. And liek recently they’ve been treating me worse ever since they found out I’m depressed. There’s been countless times where my entire family would gang up on me and criticize me for my mental health. And liek my mom would say stuff like how only they can help because they’re family and no one else. And like multiple times they wouldn’t let me leave the room and would grab me if I tried to. And they would continue yelling at me. And like they would keep gaslighting me. Like they deny ever hitting me, or yelling, or swearing at me. Even though they would literally do it 5 min earlier. And liek they would ask how to support me and I would say something and they would deflect. They deflect any blame towards them and then deny or say it’s my fault.

Like this isn’t something that happens daily, so I feel hesitant to call them abusive. So 99 percent of the time they’re really loving but I still want nothing to do with them.

And I remember coming out to my parents as trans. And I really hated it. They wouldn’t let me leave the room and I kept saying how uncomfortable I was. And they were really stressing out over it and I hated it. And they were saying how I can’t tell anyone else until I talk about it with the rest of my family. And I didn’t want to do that. And it jsut scared me of from coming out to anyone else. And I found out later that my parents told my siblings without my permission or anything.

And like there was couple times where I would see a mental health specialist. And like the first thing my parents were talking about is how they’ve done nothing but love me and how they don’t understand why I’m so angry with them. And didn’t take any accountability for my mental health. And said it’s proa sly because of my friends or my phone.

And I was taking a psych test or something and I got diagnosed with ocd and autism. And the person recommend me to get family therapy because she said it’s a very unhealthy and toxic environment.  But tbh I don’t want to fix my relationship with them. Because it was never that great to begin with. For my whole life I was always kind of isolated from them. And I jsut didn’t like being around them. And that jsut got worse as I got older. So it just doesn’t feel like a relationship that’s with the effort.

I just feel guilty because they do love me and like they’ve given me everything I could possibly ask for. So I just feel like I’m ungrateful. And how I’m a terrible person. Like my family would all call me ungrateful and say how they’ve given em everything that I’ve ever wanted and have done nothing but love me. And maybe they’re right. Like I just feel like I’m just being terrible. And how I’m treating them poorly. Or I’m jsut making myself the victim.

Like I feel guilty taking things from them or saying no. Because I just feel like I owe them. And if my entire family is ganging up on me then maybe I actually am the problem.

And I just feel like I’m crazy so I just want to see what other people think about this. And I have no one to talk to about this. Because I dotn want to burden anyone or trauma dump

Like and I was also jsut lonely at school as well. Like idk what’s wrong with me. Like I remember in elementary multiple times being called annoying, being excluded, and like the only time people would like value me is because they thought I was smart. So it was just because they wanted help. And in junior high it got worse. Like people just didn’t like me I guess. Like no one would talk to me. I was actually just invisible. I only had a handful of friends and I didn’t even like them that much. And high school that just continued. I really don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’m just a really boring and uninteresting person I guess. But I’m graduating but I’m not excited. Like I’ve liked missed out on so much. I’m not ready to graduate it feels like I haven’t started high school. 

And it’s probably just my fault. I’m just a boring, uninteresting and annoying person. Like my siblings are popular and have friends. Everyone else is normal but me. Most of my classes is just me sitting alone because no matter what I do I’m just not worth talking to. It’s not even just school. Like everywhere in my life I’m just ignored. People would rather talk to my siblings. People won’t listen or include me in anything. So many people have ignored, ghosted or just straight up stopped talking to me. I don’t even text anyone anymore because there’s no one willing to text me. I’m just a burden. 

And I’ve just had to deal with my deteriorating mental health on my own for my entire life. With no help. I just learned to hide my emotions and I’m just alone. There’s been couple times where I had the chance to actually turn to someone for support but that didn’t last. They eventually just stopped talking to me, lied to me, or talked bad about me behind my back. I’m just a burden on others 

And I have a counsellor but I hate him. I feel so uncomfortable talking to him and he keeps forgetting stuff I tell him. Or just give little to no advice. I’m more depressed/suicidal after every session. And I can’t change him without talking to my parents because they pay for it. And the worst part is that I know they’ll change it but I don’t want it talk to my parents. I just don’t feel safe or comfortable talking to them. I never have. So once again it’s just my fault and I’m just forcing myself to thug it out. 

Like this is all made worse by being trans. Like for my entire life I’ve had to deal with gender dysphoria. I’ve never liked how I looked or sounded. I’ve never looked in the mirror and liked how I look. I’ve never seen a video or photo of me where I like how I look. I just wish I was born a girl instead. I would actaily be happy. 

And like I just see so many girls just living a life I’ll never have. Like I only really feel comfortable talking to girls. I can be friends with guys but I can’t get close with them. I can’t. With girls I just feel more comfortable to be myself. But all my friends are guys. And for most of my life that’s been true. And it just makes me so unhappy. And even if I transition I probably wouldn’t pass as cis so what’s the point. Like I just know I’ll never be a girl or feel like one. I’ll just live the rest of my life in body that’s wrong. 

I found out recently that I have OCD and autism so that probably explains why I’ve always been so isolated. And my environment has always just made that worse. I don’t get why I was born like this. Dealing with OCD, autism, and gender dysphoria at once. And it’s madd worse by the fact I’ve never felt safe or comfortable around anyone. I’ve never had support that lasted. I was always just alone. And I’ve tried turning to hotlines, subreddits, discord literally anything just to find some form of support. But I’m always just ignored or just tossed aside. It just feels like every hotline just wants to stop talking to me asap. I’m just actually alone. 

I just have no hope for the future. There’s just no point. I’ve never been happy it won’t change. I’ve always had so much pressure to get good grades so now I feel like if I don’t find success im a failure. I’m so stressed. 

I wanted a gap year because i didn’t know what I wanted to do. But my parents didn’t let me. So now I’m registered to take a course they chose for me. I’m taking computer science because my dad assumed that I would like that. But I doubt I’ll find any success there. 

I just can’t deal with life anymore. It’s never been good and never will be. But I’m too much of a coward to kill myself. I’m just pathetic. And it’s probably my fault. I’m probably just making things worse. I probably deserve to die at this point. If no one seems to like me and so many hate or blame me then it’s probably my fault. I’m just so depressed. I don’t even know what happiness feels like. I probably never will. 
"
640,1,"People say going through something difficult makes you stronger. But it’s not true.  
Each time I’m only more and more in pain. I see less and less the point of recovering. I have less and less hope. God. I just want this to end. I can’t survive this much pain. "
641,1,"i was supposed to be a normal girl. every day i wake up and try to be kind and genuine and helpful to the people around me, but it feels like i wasn't made to survive this world.  it feels like i'm drowning, desperately trying to find a place to live and a job to work and a means to do anything more than just scrape by only to come home and cry every night. i want to feel somebody's loving arms around me, and a reason to wake up and try again.

it feels like the entire world is working together to crush me to death, and it's working. i can't cry anymore, and i don't have the depth of empathy and compassion i did just a few years ago. i feel empty and afraid and very small and helpless. it's so isolating to be trans and treated like a subhuman by people who don't even know your name, to know that most of the world hates you for something you can't help when all you've ever wanted was to be good and useful. what i'd give for a few good friends.

i have dreams about making dinner for someone as they come home, or tending a garden, or just holding hands and feeling the sun and breeze, but they're just as fleeting as they are visceral. a safe home i will never have, a future i can never work towards. no one will ever care for me; i will never have these things. it feels like i'm sentenced to a life of endless terror and loneliness as i work myself to an early death from stress and poverty.

i don't want to die, i just want a chance to live. everything hurts so much and i'm so tired."
642,1,"I used to have depression before, like I was sad and depressed about the life I could have had, about relationships and career or whatever. I resented the fact that there are some things I could have had in different circumstances, and that made me really sad, yeah, to the point of suicidal thoughts. Now, however, I don't actually feel anything. No regrets, no sadness or bitterness about past mistakes. I'm just so fucking tired and that's all, the only thought I have had for a while now. Death feels like a rest, even if eternal, and I agree to it. Don't know if I find the guts to do it, but the clock is ticking, so probably soon. Stay safe folks."
643,1,"More of a vent post on a sub that I know people will get it. I’ve been passively suicidal since I was 14, it comes and goes in severity over the years, but it never truly left me. I guess the connection has been wired very deep in my brain.

Rn stressed with current expenses and just fear. Fear of the future and so many different things at once. I think my brain is sabotaging me half the time I get stuck in paralysis. 

It sometimes really just feels like suicide is just a logical conclusion in our world. 

Idk I’m not in danger or planning anything tonight. Just a little stressed and even at the slightest bit of stress in my life I will trigger suicidal thoughts as a instant reflex. 

I’m just tired for the night, I think I’ll go to sleep."
644,1,"Half a year ago, I tried to end things, but things changed halfway through and I walked 3 miles down to a ER. It was really rough, things happened and I'm now in therapy, but I do have two very noticeable scars on my right wrist now (I also have a shitton on my thighs, but that's not important rn). I've been wearing a compression brace to cover them, and whenever someone asks, I just say I sleep on my wrist weird and wear it for support. I do want to tell two of my friends about it, but I'm not sure who to tell first. One friend, T, has been my friend since diapers and knows that I've had troubles with depression for a while. However, when one another friend brought up that they almost SH, T was laughing and making jokes. The other friend, B, is more of a casual friend and knows some details of my history with depression, but barely anything and we've only been friends for a few years. All of us are late teen F, and I don't think they've dealt with anything like this. Who should I tell about my SH if any, and should I bring up that I regret not going through with it?"
645,1,"I told her, i told my girlfriend how i feel and how depressed i am, how i just cry myself to sleep becuse i feel lonely and useless, and that if i die she will be the only one that might care to morn me.
She told me she is sorry she isnt good enogh to make this feelings disaper and that she is sorry she don't know how to confort me.

Now i feel like an ass becuse i told her, i tried to tell someone, im so stupid, now i feel worse, and i know it isnt her fault and that she dosent have to carry with me but, i expected something else, i don't know.

Today all my family came for a gathering and i didnt want to say hello becuse i know i dont belong there, i never did, i am not really a part of that family, and now im in my room crying under my breath and bitting the fucking pillow so they dont hear me, i had to come out to say eat and i know they all see me as this odd one out, they all see me as the stupid one, the one that cant do anything right, They are right.

I wish i had someone i trust to let them know i really contemplated and hour ago getting in a bus and escaping, find go to the parking lot of a random plaza and killing myself, a girl some years ago jumped off that same plaza and died so i know i would too, its the only way i know to kill myself and really do it with out hurting.

I have no one, i dont have friends and i know even my brother is tired of me, i really don't see why anyone would care if i die, i am an annoyiens even in my own home so no one would be really sad if i just jump, i really am so tired of how i am, of how i act, how even if i try everyone just ditches me, i am the problem i know.

No one will notice if i die, i am so tired, everyday i cry and thing how i am just a pice of shit, i have begged god even tho i am an atheist, that if they exist to please help me, to change my life, to make me like it, its been 4 years with out a response.

Im really tired of trying, and failing, im so tired im really really tired i cant do this anymore i can't i cant fo this im so tired im so tired i cant sorry"
646,1,"I think I have undiagnosed bipolar. It’s a long story with my boyfriend but he left me but he’s done me so dirty the entire time I was with him. Wouldn’t stop cheating on me, beating on me, degrading me…. I spent all my money trying to help him with debt and his tickets. I did so much for him after we became homeless after losing our place because he wouldn’t stop cheating and it was all too much for me. He’s a loser but I love him so much that it’s taken over my life and I don’t know what to do. I’m not okay. I haven’t stopped having panic attacks. It’s been rocky between us the last month. He left me as soon as he got a job and an offer to stay at his friends while we lived at his mother’s house. I left to California about a month and a half ago because we thought he was almost ready to get into the military but that didn’t end up happening. It’s been even worse being away from him. He doesn’t trust me one bit. He has my locations, I’m otp w him 24/7 and it still wasn’t enough. My stalker ex found out I was in cali again and he’s been harassing me nonstop but I nvr told my boyfriend bc i was so scared he was gonna think i was cheating or doing something.  behind his back. well that ex found his socials and convinced him that I fucked him and gave him head when i literally haven’t seen that person. i’m convinced he just needed an excuse to leave me but he means the world to me. when things were good, they were GOOD. he always talked abt wanting a family, about getting me pregnant…. and it feels like it was all a lie. he would take it back and it would hurt like hell because all i wanted to be was a mother with a man who i truly love and vice versa. i kept calling him on no caller id and his friend answered basically mocking me right now and im just filled with rage. how can someone be so cruel? his other friend did the same before but he actually talked to me last night and told me that i shouldn’t chase and give this love to a cheater, to someone who doesn’t respect me. that i need to let go and it’s a bad idea to go to oregon to sleep on the streets for a man who doesn’t seem to care about me. i didn’t cheat on him. he’s so insecure i had to delete my social media bc he would assume any male who requested to follow me knew me but i just can’t let go of him!!!!! i don’t want to live if it’s not with him. i don’t want to wait for him to come back bc why would he need to go with other bitches to decide what he wants. I CANT. I love him i need help i do but i don’t wanna admit myself anywhere because ill suffer more not knowing where he is or what he’s doing "
647,1,Long story short i m a dissapointment  i am an alcoholic /unhealthy  i went from job to job im  once  again jobless and broke and my family hates me.. i m very tired.. i cant stand it anymore i know its part my problem but my family never gave a shit about me either.. i grew up alone.. sorry for my bad english.. i just want things to get better but im giving up.. there is no end to the pain.. .. i wish someone or something would save me but  i know this will not happen..  i hope there s a better place after this..
648,1,I’m tired of life and I just wanna go and I hate that I don’t have a plan because I risk waking up another day. I’m just tired and I feel so done with trying to find ways to cope with things.
649,1,"Quiero decir en este sub que he decidido terminar con todo, mi cabeza no aguanta. Debo dar gracias por lo que tengo pero tristemente no tengo la fuerza para seguir adelante. Ya llore, ya me autilesione, pero ya es suficiente. No tengo más nada que aportar y el mundo no tiene más nada que ofrecerme. Suerte a todos que les vaya bien y espero se recuperen, porque ya yo me rendí "
650,1,"the reason why is my love life. It feels like, there is not a single woman out there waiting for me, the „situationships“ I had broke me. 
Being an overthinker breaks me. I could cry all night, thinking about suicide. No matter how much effort I put in, I never received a slight effort back. I always used to joke around, used to laugh a lot, and opened up before. Now I have those void stares, Isolate myself, and don‘t even talk with someone. Women always had the most diabolical reasons to dump me. „Oh you cared too much“; „you got attached too fast“ …; I‘m sorry that I got attached, I‘m sorry that I care about how you felt, I‘m sorry that I fell in love. I don‘t even want to try anymore because my generation is so fucked. In anyway we are beyond fucked"
651,1,"It’s been 18 years of living with soul-crushing, treatment-resistant MDD. It has felt like forever, yet I also cannot believe how quickly the years have flown. I have never been in a relationship (no one was ever interested despite my efforts, though not always consistent), and I have passed my childbearing years. I am so disappointed in how things have turned out, and I can't imagine fighting for this shit life much longer. I've survived 4 serious attempts over the years, all ended in multi-day/week stints in the ICU. I don't know why I am a here and am going to get it right this final time. I feel no sadness, guilt, or shame. "
652,1,"When you are in a situation where the future or outcome will be misery and/or a terrible existence no matter what. What good is talking with someone about it? After you talk, Nothing changes. Does someone talk to you and explain that it’s ok to live in sadness why you watch others be happy and healthy? Have nice homes and a family. Knowing you will never have that. You are old, bad finances, no home. What changes after talking with someone? "
653,1,"Its been a bad day. 
I 100% will be gone by tomorrow. 
Cheers."
654,1,"16M, been contemplating this for a while now. I just feel so hopeless, and I don't even feel connected to my own family and friends. My social anxiety's been absolutely killing me. I don't really want a therapist because I prefer just writing about my thoughts to myself, barely telling other people. I know that if I go through with this, it'll only make my family feel more horrible, I mean my grandad just passed away a week ago. Look, I know this seems selfish, but it's getting so unbearable that I can't even bring myself to think about anything else without wanting to put myself out of my misery. I attempted it in my grandma's kitchen one night in February, but having that knife against my neck made me so anxious that I could barely sleep. I just see it as a release. I don't have anything going for me anyway, and I don't want to go back to school because it'll be the same routine of me putting on that stupid smile and being nice while getting trashed on by everyone there, including people I consider ""friends"". And I can't say I have a close relationship with my family either, I mostly just stay in bed, don't talk to them like I did when I was a kid, and even now while they're talking I'm just by myself. I've been staying up all night for weeks and haven't really been eating at all. I guess this might be my last post, depending on what happens to me. "
655,1,"I'm a person which suffers from silent depression. I always push myself to function. I go to work, talk to people and behave like nothing is wrong. But deep inside I'm just tired. Tired of masking. I don't want to die. But it seems like a good alternative. I've got no one who listens to me. Even my own sister is telling me she is not a good listener, but has no problem listening to other people stories. She just can't listen to mine. She knows I'm suicidal. I told her once. But she is a person, which prefers looking away instead of looking at it. I've got no one left. I stopped having contact with my mother 2 years ago and realised after that, that she is a narcissist. And I was her plaything all of those years. The person she manipulated and formed the way she wanted. After waking up from that dream I realised I don't know who I am anymore. Everything I liked, the way I behaved and thinking was mostly for her liking. How she wanted me to be. 
I'm just tired of it all. But I also don't want to give up just yet. But the thought is there and that is frightening me. "
656,1,"Thought about my ex and the way she made me do those things and violate myself for her, can't really bother with the pain anymore.

The only thing I'm scared about is the pain, I want it to be painless, no matter how long. I'd rather it take an hour to die and be in peace than 20 seconds of pure misery. "
657,1,"My comment history speaks for itself. I’m so fucking over the world
 



Adios. "
658,1,"I have always had off and on thoughts of taking my own life. But I think this is the first time im leaning towards doing it. im sick of the daily pain, the heartache, feeling physically and emotionally sick. I think i have a plan. I  feel so disconnected tonight my 2 year old niece who normally loves me and comes to me to make her smile wouldn't come anywhere near me because I was mentally so off. and I didnt even care. I wouldn't even look at her. I feel myself removing myself from everyone. I have talked to chat gpt a about what it would be like when /if I do it, and fuck why is it that makes me feel good? I think i am truly broken...."
659,1,"Imma 19 year old teenage girl and I'm about to finally end it tomorrow. For some context, my parents ran out and got married really young, my mother had me at 19 and they got divorced 2 years later and my mother fell into major depression right after, since my birth both sides of the family hates me, even tried to kill me couple of times. so as you can guess i grew up mostly alone, for the longest time i was extremely emotional, sad, borderline crazy cuz i didn't know how to deal with my family or my response to them. It only got worse with each passing year. I got sexually assaulted, i got into self harm, I completely lost my mental health. I started dating this guy and he physically, mentally, emotionally abused me until I absolutely lost myself, right after that the only person i was close to (my cousin, we basically lived, breathed, existed together ) died. i did horribly on my boards. and for most of life i lived with my grandma but for college i moved in with my mother, and I can't deal with it anymore. nobody understands how much it hurts, all i can think about is killing myself but i also dont wanna. I'm fairly pretty or so people say, with rather good humor and social skills and fashion sense. basically if you see me from outside you won't know what I'm suffering from. I've been trying so hard to survive. My mother hates me, every second with her suffocates. and to top it off i dont have any money. only if i had enough money, I'd move out this second but i can't. My mother cherished this gold ring and i lost it. she has given me one day to get it back but i just cant find it. so I've decided to end it.   "
660,1,"Hello, I am 15M, and I have been skipping school for 2 weeks.

I'm also afraid that my parents will get taken by child protective services because of my absences (I abide by french law btw)

They also said that they would want to see me at school to talk about stuff.

I'm scared to go to a therapist, or any bullshit guidance stuff that my school offers.
I have pretty high grades and I'm the class pres, but that's it.

I am honestly thinking of killing myself today(It is my birthday!!), to just avoid going to school tomorrow.

Any thoughts?"
661,1,"im in my early teens but im already struggling with opioid addiction, nicotine, alcohol, and weed addiction. i’ve been suicidal since i was 9 years old after i had found out i had been raped multiple times, i’ve been on medication for my mental health and disabilities since i was 10. nothing seems to help me nowadays, i’ve attempted before but this time i want it to be serious. im planning on getting drunk or high off my ass, sneaking out of my house around 2-4 in the morning and either jumping in front of a car or jumping off a bridge into the river. If it ends up not working ill most likely be put back into a mental hospital or psych ward."
662,1,"I know mental health awareness and su1c1d3 awareness is really big in society nowadays, but imo, most of it is virtue signaling. People just don't want you to hrt yourself cuz it will make them feel sad and guilty. They don't actually care about trying you, they care about themselves, and how it would impact them. They don't care about your suffering."
663,1,I have a job and recently got one that pays more. I have an apartment. I have a loving family. I'm seeing a therapist and am on medication. And despite all this I still want to jump off a fucking bridge and end it all.
664,1,"I am going to end it soon, I think so at least. I don't have a particular plan. Just a few ideas that are easy to achieve. 22 years on this planet and I still can't find a will to live. My life isn't bad, not great either. I'm just tired. Please don't say it's gonna get better, it hasn't. It won't. I just wanna go to sleep."
665,1,I'm mainly just doing this to get it off my chest I think. I'd like to go on a much bigger rant but I'm not gonna. Once I'm back home after summer gonna look for a gun in my step-dad's room (about 80 percent sure he's got one) and then look up how to load it and use the worldwide suicide position. Just need to find something I want to do before I die (sadly will never get to experience skydiving)
666,1,I love my family but I am extremely depressed and suicidal 
667,1,"Every day I hurt and think about just going through with it, thoughts just stay circling around in my head. Regardless of talking to a therapist,  I will never be good enough for anyone, like I'm never doing enough, and I'm too much. Even coaxing myself to feel better the negative thoughts keep coming back and the positive only last for a day to hours at most. I'm medicated but even on meds I'm still thinking about ever more clearly to end the pain and save people the trouble."
668,1,I smiled at the thought of her... Uncontrollably smiled 
669,1,"Hello a little about my self. I have always been harrased by mental health since I can remember I have actively trying to kill myself since 12 years old ""I'm currently 26"" but now I'm gonna do it I have stopped trying to get better after many years of getting help. I'm just wondering if I'm doing this wrong I'm actively messing my mental health up I'm putting myself in situations where I know I will have break downs and situation where I'm doing work where I can't finish the task. My reasoning is that if I have a hard decline in mental health and it shows it not getting any better my family and friends will not have as hard time accepting my death and will not be left so many questions of why and how did this happen. am I doing this wrong is it more messed up to give them the hope of it becoming better and that I could be ""saved'. I care deeply for them but I just can't go on anymore it's not just Worth it. So am I the asshole? Thanks for reading if this post triggers or does something else to anyone to having a troublesome thoughts just remove the post. 

-sorry if it was badly written or hard to understand English is not my mothers tounge "
670,1,Had no idea that the mental issues you deal with while feeling suicidal could manifest into you physically not feeling well. This may be what ultimately ends it for me. 
671,1,"I've been missing my ex best friend who was an absolute ass to me for more than two years now. Even until now I still compare my friends with her, and I HATE it. They're way better people than her in every sense. I just don't feel conected to them as I did with her and I feel so deeply betrayed and guilty for this. Guilty both from feeling betrayed and from comparing my actual friends with her. 

I'm wasting so much time on this."
672,1,"I (23) have been building my life despite suffering from diagnosed c-ptsd, bi-polar, autism, adhd. I have graduated from my culinary course, have my own cafe and gf. I even had a vasectomy done because I really didn't want kids.

It's been a year since I started my Cafe and it's not going well despite my best efforts to maintain quality and market it. The creation of the cafe has been a life long dream of mine and it was a bliss starting it up. It's almost a year now and my parents are still finding my operating capital because I can't make a profit. They're paying about $1,800 every month just to keep the Cafe afloat. I feel such a burden to them and I just don't want them to since they are now retired.

On my relationship, I broke up with my gf (26) last year because I fell out of love for her since she was not the girl I used to date. I noticed how distant she got and my love slowly faded away. Recently however, I got back with her due to her constant guilt tripping. It broke me seeing her suffer because of me so I gave her a second chance hoping my feelings would come back but I don't think it is. 
Another thing is that I've fallen for her best friend (22) who helped us get back together. The three of us would go on dates together, watch movies, drink, sleep (only sleep) beside each other. The thing is, I can't break up with my gf knowing that I'll also lose our bff and my gf is a great help on my cafe now as she has been supportive of the business lately. 

I honestly just want to commit the unthinkable lately because of how much my past has been haunting me. I was bullied, sexually harrased by my own siblings, mentally tormented from day to day, physically abused by my brother everyday. It's all catching up to me now and I can't get some peace of mind. I just want it all to end. I don't want to be a dead weight to my parents anymore, I don't want to be in a relationship with my gf anymore, I can't lose my cafe as it would crush me. 

I have been trying to help myself. I've been taking my meds regularly and annually meet with my therapist. I've been working out and eating healthy but these things just won't take my mind of things

Im sorry for the long post, the bad english and the bad format. My mind's a mess"
673,1,idk man I just wanna quit already for the love of god I'm so tired of being tired why tf am I so tired all the damm time I just wanna kill myself I'm tired of complaining in social media my friends are probably tired asf of me too sooooo el oh el
674,1,"I feel it deep in my bones that I'm meant to die. I know I need to die and I need to die soon. But I do not want anyone handling my body!! I need to die where no one will ever find my body! I don't want people touching my dead body, or looking at it, or preparing it for burial. I don't want to be buried. I want to die deep in the forest and have my body sent back to nature. I really really don't want anyone handling my body. I'm so scared."

677,1,"There's so many people who have it worse than me. Those who get physically abused from childhood and still manage to crawl their way up. I haven't experienced this and still, I've completely given up on living. I'm a fucking coward and disappointment who shouldn't even be complaining. The shame is so strong. I'm better off dead."
678,1,"I cant stand it. I told my mom i was going to leave our church and i saw her look on her face. She was so sad. Its haunting me. I know my parents lov me and they want whats best for me. They are wonderful people. I cant stand seeing them look at me like that though. I dont know where to go or what to do. Im stuck between two horrible outcomes. At this point death seems like the better option. I cant put this feeling into words. But the world seems horrible without what i have known to be ""true"" my whole life. I dont see myself ever being happy again. "
679,1,"lost my virginity to someone whos way too old for me, and has a girlfriend. I'm not sure what im supposed to do. I feel so much regret but i feel i dont deserve to be comforted or assured in anyway. I was stupid and i ended doing some heinous acts that i cant get out of my head. I wouldnt say i was taken advantage of because i think if i asked for it to stop they wouldve stopped. But also im questioning that because they couldnt stop for their girlfriend but im not sure if im being illogical right now because im embarrassed, stressed, and nervous. "
680,1,"Sup fellas, 
No clue if this is going to make much sense of anyone can relate but I just really need some advice. For a lot of 17-18 year olds right now it’s exam season and I really am not dealing with the toll on my metal health well. My mother is extremely obsessive with me revising and for the last two days I’ve been expected to sit in an unused room, that used to me my sisters before she moved out,at a desk and revise from 10-10 each day. I’ve tried talking to her about me having a few hours off to see my girlfriend, go out with friends, ect. But she’s adamant that I need to revise for this long as she just wants  me to get to my full potential for these mocks. All my life I’ve been a good student, usually getting around b+ for every assignment, couple of As and A*s here and there, and I used to really enjoy the praise I’d get. My sister was not a bad student but not as smart as me so when I’d get an A and she’d get a c, I wouldn’t be praised when she would be. Im starting to feel like the people that love me only care about what grades I get as my mum usual gets angry and walks away or blames me for being rude if I confront her about it. People around me have said comments along the lines of say if you need something and im always ready to listen, so Im guessing Im acting off compared to how I usually am. To be honest I feel fucking miserable. I’d never speak to the people around me because I just don’t like how awkward that would be so Im here just asking for some advice. Im having some dark thoughts as well as just wanting to run away or sleep all of the time as I really struggle with sleeping when I’m supposed to at night. I just wanted some help as Im really not happy in general right now and feel like I’m locked in a fucking cage. Sorry for the rant, thanks to anyone who responds. 

"
681,1,"I made a promise to myself since I was very young that I wouldn’t make it to 18. I am 18 next month.

I don’t want to make it. I will have failed every version of myself for the last 6 years that wanted nothing more to be gone.

I hoped that I would either be better or dead. And after all, I’m still stuck in the same place. Yearning, longing, for that one thing. To be gone. But never quite reaching it.

I’m sick of this. This feels like a sick game. 

I wish it had worked when I tried before. I wish it had worked so badly. Im still so angry at myself.

I keep wondering what I did wrong.
"
682,1,"Yeah, you read the title. And I know it might seem outta pocket post for a subreddit like this one, but it's a very real potential future that the next month's (July) exact date as today, I might not exist on earth. So yeah, I thought I might just watch some movies and stuff like that before eventually succumbing to suicide. "
683,1,"It's a horrible thing to admit put loud, but I wish I was one of the passengers on that plane. It would've been perfect. No time to think. No take backs. Financial responsibilities taken care of. Having someone to blame. Definitely an accident. Quick and probably painless. And people thinking I died happily with excitement of visit the UK. "

685,1,"Not with this terrible illness I have — Schizoaffective Bipolar Type with f*cked up Catatonia. My first manic psychotic break four years ago completely destroyed my life. I self-destructed. I lost the people I loved most, my financial stability, and ended up in jail. After that, I was court-ordered to a state mental hospital. 

Now I’m left with anhedonia, chronic boredom, and a severe lack of drive. I have no motivation, no goals, no interests, no hobbies, and no desires. Nothing feels rewarding anymore. Even the things I used to enjoy bring me no joy. I'm bed rotting. 

I honestly hope that someday soon, medical assistance in dying becomes available near my area for people with treatment-resistant, chronic mental illness. Because a life like this is not worth living."
686,1,"Today is my best friend Jacque's birthday, she died last February. 5 years ago yesterday, I brought a friend, C, to Jacque's birthday party, where she met so many new friends. The next morning, C took her own life.
They're both on the other side, and the pain has been unbearable today. In addition to so many other life things I won't get into here (relationship struggles, state of the country/world etc).
Lately I've been struggling with suicidal ideations a good bit, and today I've never been closer to an intention and plan. I started the note, knowing that I'll never be able to say everything that I'd like. 
A big part of me wants to die, end it all. Another part of me just wishes I were someone else.  
I often fantasize about doing what C did, and being with them and others I've lost on the other side, free from it all. Of course, idk if theyre free from it all. Idk if it actually ends anything. But it sure as hell seems a lot more appealing to me than this lifetime/realm.

The main thing that has stopped me in the past and what's causing me to hesitate now is the people I'll hurt in the process. I don't think my mom's heart could take it, and my sister struggles with the same ideations. But I get tripped up in that, what, I'm supposed to just suffer through life just so I don't hurt people by dying? I understand it's not black and white like that, but, it's something I struggle with. 

Thank you for listening 🤍"

As the title says I am checked the fuck out.

I don't even know if I can wait that long I feel like I need to kill myself sooner. These thoughts are chronic and never-ending. Nothing I did in the last 17 years helped. I'm 30 now. I do not want to make it to 31. I do not care what damage this brings to my family, they can seek bereavement counseling and get therapy themselves. But I know what I'm going to do April 1st 2026. I am going to buy a gun, drive to a secluded place, and blow my brains out. Until then all I have to do is keep up appearances. Keep going to work an reenter college for graduate school.

i’ve tried doing the right things.. asking for help, making plans.. but nothing changes. i feel like the only way out is disappearing. i’m on meds that make me feel like a zombie. it all is grey. no highs. no lows. just grey. i used to believe. in the world. in myself. i was finally back in school at 25. had to drop out. can’t continue. it’s all gone. i don’t want to be alone in this anymore. when will this end."

I can point to things like a traumatic sexual friendship i had last fall, failing to start my career after graduating college, social alienation from being a mentally ill queer youth, but really I’ve just wanted to die my whole life but didn’t do anything about it until these problems became too much to handle this year. I’ve made about 5 failed attempts by hanging since November. From this, I’ve treated the people in my life terribly with my self destructive habits and have lost almost all friends. My roommates basically kicked me out of our apartment and I’ve entered what may be an abusive living situation.
I feel that my life can improve with time and effort. But I can’t handle the emotional pain i carry, mostly from my intense fwb relationship last year (I probably have BPD). So I’ve been planning another attempt. I’m going to drive 12 hours to jump off a cliff. I’ve selected a location that has sentimental value to me. But, my car is not in good condition. So my plan was to rent a car to make this happen. I was scheduled to pick it up today, but i canceled a few days ago because I thought that I had stabilized. But last night, I had an emotional episode and I just started driving. I drove for three hours to see if my car could handle it, and now I’m confident that it can. I came home and wrote a note and messages to some ex-lovers for the suicide.
I’m so worried now because it suddenly seems attainable and I can go any time I want to. 
I want to live. I went back to therapy, I went to the hospital after a previous attempt and started antidepressants, I’m doing everything right but nothing is working. I don’t know what I can do at this point.
Long rant over. I basically just wanted to get that out somewhere. I don’t trust the hotlines and I’ve had bad experiences with them. Let me know if this breaks any rules, I don’t use reddit often at all."
696,1,I think I just accept it finally. Fading into the void as the light fades. I still don’t know when though
697,1,"I know no one here knows me, but I want to say goodbye to everyone. This subreddit is the last I have left. My friends don’t like me, my parents hate me, I’m so alone and exhausted. My parents earlier yelled at me cause I started to cry. They always get mad when I cry, even if I have a reason for it. When my dog died when I was 8, they yelled at me about how I’m wasting time crying and I need to move on. I was crying because it was the exact day we put him down. Now, I’m 15, crying because of school. I do online school, and I was struggling with something, I got overwhelmed and started to cry. My parents came out and told me how I mean nothing and that they wish they never made the mistake to have me, and ultimately told me I ruined Father’s Day. all I do is mess up, all I do is make mistakes, I am one. So, I just wanted to be able to say goodbye, maybe someone who could’ve been my friend in 20 years will see this, maybe my ex- future gf might see this. None of us will know, cause fate cut me short. I hope no one else has to deal with what I am, and I hope everyone here feels loved. Goodbye. "
698,1,"Hi.

I'm going through a lot because I'm in several marginalized groups, most of my problems come from oppression systems, and I always get to get new problems because of my differences. 

I lost great future opportunities because I'm queer and not white, a fake friend to whom I told my deepest secrets turned out to be a fucking nazi who wanted me to have troubles with people of color and who even tried to ruin my life, I always get harmful flashbacks, a teacher proved me I made the right choice not to seek help at school and I got betrayed both by people who claimed to support queer people and by queer organizations.

I drink energy drinks to cope with problems, I tried quitting several times but didn't manage to stand a day without drinking some. I'm fighting self harm urges and the future looks worse and worse and I think I'll end-up drinking too much energy drink.

I'm no longer sure I'm never going to kill myself even tho my death would risk being weaponized against us."
699,1,No good ones! And most of them are online or phone only! What fucking good is that?! Fucking twats! They're all too expensive anyway. And I don't drive so I'd be paying even more for bus fares. So fuck it. I'd rather just bash my head against the wall til I kill myself.
700,1,Can someone please convince me not to believe what anxiety says it's destroying my life I can't go out all I think about is what if I get anxiety and make a mistake in the road 
701,1,"In the last 7 years, I’ve survived a botched kidney transplant(right before my freshman year of college), a suicide attempt, the second transplant (which was successful), and graduated college on the dean’s list. Pretty cool, right? No. I hate myself. I hate who I am and how I’m probably going to die on a dialysis machine. I’m bitter, angry, and recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder. My only girlfriend dumped me right before Christmas. Ive been in this hell for 8 years now and I can’t escape."
702,1,"I've already tried it twice and I've failed. 
I hate the person that I've become and the life that I've led. I'm 29F, trying to pick up the pieces and find my way. The only place where my mind takes me is the grave. I keep having ideation really bad and I want to give in to it, once again.

I think tonight, I'm going to party, do a couple lines and then try to fly. "
703,1,"Idk I try to keep going everyday yk. I wake up and i try to go on. Some days are better than others and i think yk maybe this isnt so bad. But it always goes away and im reminded of it all. How do old people even exist? Im struggling to go on past 26, but ive tried to kill myself many times but failed each time. I dont tell people bc theres no point. I feel like the fact i know i cant kill myself now is worse. I have a certain responsibility i have to uphold rn. But i swear to god i wish i couldve done a butterfly effect and kill myself in the womb."
704,1,"I can't do much, i usually want to kms late at night and I live with my mom so I can't turn on the light as she can see the light and it bothers her. Music, watching something and doing something that takes too much energy can tempt me on committing. So what can I do? I already took some anxiety drops to calm myself but I'm scared that I might go through with it despise the drops "
705,1,"the girl i love went from telling me she loves me so much to just a few days later going back to her ex. not the first time its happened. But it's strange i feel like even if none of that happened id still be in this same position. I was dumped out of a long term relationship almost 3 years ago. my first everything. over time slowly ive just gotten worse and worse mentally. Ive noticed none of this made me stronger. I just carry more with me now. I wanna be asleep all the time. I can't imagine lasting another year. I constantly think of ending it. Today i broke no contact with my ex from 3 years ago, just to tell her thanks for everything before i go through with it. I didn't tell her i was planning on dying, but she also didn't reply. I knew that was a likely outcome and i dont blame her for it. But i just can't handle it anymore. Losing people. Loss. People i love so dearly, gone. People i want to see so badly that have no interest in seeing me. I get its self pitying and all, but fuck i just cant handle this anymore. I'm never here mentally. I had to move back in with my parents cuz i quit my job, i cant even handle a job. I just want to be released. I just want my life to be over. Idk what to do because my family will be furious and heartbroken. And they will experience the loss of their son. I feel stuck. I've been in treatment before, been in inpatient before, and the more treatment i get the more i realize im a lost cause. im not even overwhelmed with pain rn, it's just the pain slowly increases throughout my life and the strength to withstand it decreases. I can't handle it anymore. I'm reaching out to all the old friends ive had, just to give a bit of closure. i havent hinted im gonna die or anything, but yeah. i guess in a week or so ill be gone. thanks for reading to anyone that has. im all alone otherwise"
706,1,"hi sorry i dont really know how to word this but i'm genuinely at the edge and i cant take it anymore. i suffer from extremely bad persecutory thoughts and i'm terrified someone is plotting against me in order to ruin my life when ive not done anything. my brain comes up with scenarios and ""what if this happened"" and the thoughts are so extreme its all i can think about and none of my distraction techniques work anymore. i'm scared of conflict and drama. i'm tired of the daily panic attacks. i just want everything to end. i've tried getting help for these thoughts but canadian healthcare is trash. i genuinely feel like my only option left to escape is to kill myself."

708,1,"So, I recently completed uni and working. I am having my worst ever depressive episode and the first time since I am employed. In uni I could just skip classes, and miss assignments and it didn't really matter much. But people kinda rely on me for some of the work to get done. I already hate being a burden, now if I get paid without me actually working, that's just gonna make me even more guilty. But I have no idea how I will get out of bed tomorrow morning, go to the fucking office and act as if everything is okay. How do you do it? When vanishing for a few weeks without prior notice is not an option, how do I handle my depression? The amount of anxiety I have of getting out of bed tomorrow is just too much. Please help!"
709,1,Im not interested in building anything or finding meaning in anything. This world brutal and shallow i have no intrest in living a life in this pathetic place i will hang myself 
710,1,She cheated on me with her ex and she is so happy like she doesn’t have any regrets about it or even feels bad about it if she even thinks about me
711,1,"I fucking hate this, i hate it all. My only friends decided they don’t like me and started ignoring me, hanging out without me. AGAIN. This happened once before. What the fuck is wrong with me. Why are all my friends abandoning me. All my childhood i dealt with being left behind. Always the kid that got left out. Why do i have to suffer alone. I have one best friend i rarely see who doesn’t really give a fuck about the situation. Everyone keeps saying that it’s gonna get better, that ill have better friends. It makes my blood boil. I wonder if anyone besides my parents would miss me if i killed myself. The louder i scream, the more god covers his ears."
712,1,basically im an international student studying in tokyo and i'm going thru intense grief everyday. it's consumed me in every aspect of my life and i see no way out. i have a hysterical crisis everyday and im suffering in school here when it was my dream to study in tokyo.  everyday i think about going to the forest to end things and i just want to make a real plan at this point. it's less than two hours away from me. i don't want any support or anything or anyone telling me there is hope because no it's all just false hope. i just want a way out of this for good. a way that's easy and painless
713,1,"I'm going to kill myself once June is over I can't do this anymore I can't live as myself anymore I feel disgusting just being here god I can't do this I can't change I won't change I feel terrible I always will. My only hope is my suicide I know it will be the best thing that'll ever come from me and I really hope it's painful and I really really hope it works this time.

2 fucking years after my first attempt and nothing has changed I've only lived this long because of a pathetic lapse in my judgement it'll all be over soon haha

718,1,"I really want everything to just end, I don't want to live with myself anymore, but I don't want to ruin everything for my parents I don't want them to be mad at me.

I don't know what to do anymore, absolutely nothing feels real."

Either way, both are fine, I think."

i couldn’t sleep i had panic attacks extreme anxiety sadness and suicidal thoughts chasing me ,even though i never cared about dates before i saw the date today and thought to myself oh it’s the day i was supposed to die but i’m still here i can’t bring myself to do it ..the feeling of wanting to die still follows me but i’m still here.."
721,1,"i guess my whole post here is that i am passively suicidal, i don't want to live but i personally feel too coward to die straight up as i just have no fucking energy. what am i supposed to actually do with my life? i'm a 20 year old woman sure and i've graduated high school, but i feel like that is literally the end of 'me'. idk, i wake up just to go back to sleep. i feel like i am just surviving until i'm seen by a specialist. i just feel like i have no joy left in my body for anything. i have no energy. what is the point of it all? it's like i want to die because i feel like getting better would be so unreachable. what does that even mean to me? get a house? survive on my own? i've had mental health issues since i was 13+ and i've always had to move from house to house due to everything. i guess it's just... i don't even feel real anymore. i'm just a concept of something? i don't really know who i am at a base evel. where do i even begin? i just want to rot away forever. barely have the energy to use my phone, the irony"
722,1,All I do is suffer for others enjoyment. I'm just not cut out for life. I don't want more I've seen enough I just want the suffering to be over
723,1,"Was just about to kill myself with a paracetamol overdose, but i heard more often than not it doesnt work unless you take a metric fuckton. Any advice for other methods?"
724,1,"She attempted three times in the two years I've known her, we then left to different cities and I lost contact with her.

Idk if she's alive or not, but I get the thought-process which leads her to make those attempts.

People like her with clinical depression, the brain doesn't 'brain' enough to produce a strong urge to survive. 

They are other people who go through so much suffering before they take this decision to end their life.

Some get abused, some neglected, some don't fit in anywhere, some assaulted, some with chronic disability, some cheated and many more reasons. 

I personally had seizures and got diagnosed with Autistic ADHD last year. All my life has been an attempt to mask and fit in with people whom I inherently did not like or want to be with. I've basically felt like an alien my whole life. No friends, no peers, no relations nothing. 

But for some reason, my stupid brain isn't suicidal. And so I persist because I act according to my chemicals at the end of the day and my chemicals want to persist. But if you ask me, nah man - I am not interested in living.

I just live because i am too scared to die and because death isn't really certain from suicide and the consequences are more scary.

THIS IS NOT A RANT POST, NOT A 'SEEKING ADVICE OR SUPPORT' POST.

THIS IS JUST MY ATTEMPT TO TELL Y'ALL THAT I GET YOU.

I want him to remember what he did to me until the day he dies. I want him to know that this is the type of person he was. Every Father’s Day, I want him to think about exactly what type of father he was. 

It’s too late for me, but maybe not for my brother. If my dad realizes now, maybe he’ll change for him in the way he couldn’t change for me.

733,1,"It’s everywhere I look. In the shows I watch, in the books I read, in the games I play. Even certain foods and sounds trigger memories that bring me to tears. You’re supposed to love your children, and I understand that they probably do still love me in their own broken way, but they’ve ruined my life. I cannot function the way that I need to, I just can’t. I’ve tried my best to outgrow it as an adult, to face the world on my own and find my place in it, but everywhere I look I find nothing but suffering and reminders that I am worthless. I feel like a child in an adult world, totally unprepared and unable to reclaim the time they stole from me. 

I just wanted a normal life with normal parents. What did I do to deserve this? What could a child do to deserve the constant fear I felt? I can’t escape it. No matter what I do it’s always there. I fear the world and everything in it. I just want this all to stop. They broke me in the most insidious and subtle ways and I have no words to describe the agony I feel. My life was over before I even had a chance and I hate them for that. They literally stole my life from me. All I can remember is the anger and the fear and the screaming through all hours of the night. 

Some people just shouldn’t be allowed to have children. And now I can’t have children myself because I fear being like them. I see my friends having relationships and children and getting married and all I can think of is how lucky they are. How their perception of family and love hasn’t been tainted by a pair of mentally unstable losers who flooded their child with all of their worst attributes. If there’s a hell, I hope I’ll see them there. They deserve it just as much as I do. "
734,1,"I'm living in a European country and I'm mixed-race. I know I shouldn't be in Europe and I've often thought my parents sinned after they mixed together, but it's not my fault. I have received a karma for which I wasn't prepared.

There's no place for me in this world. I will always be a foreigner.

Sometimes people mistake me for North African or Arabic and it makes things complicated because of the geopolitical situation. People can have stereotypes because of my physical appearance. If you sent me to Palestine, people would think I'm a local. But I'm not Muslim or part of any religion, nor do I have ties with that culture.

I have been thinking about leaving the European continent. But I'm also half, and so I'm still attached to all the history and culture. And it's difficult for me to move anywhere because I don't have much money and I have a handicap.

Also, I don't have family. I'm just completely alone and an alien to every land on this Earth. I just wish I wasn't born.

I've always been very kind to everyone. I don't understand why this curse has chosen me. Maybe I'm paying for something in my past life."
735,1,"Been thinking about it again. Probably should, probably won't go through with it, didn't when I was in primary school so I doubt it'll be any different now.

I am an overly clingy person, I am, technically speaking, mentally handicapped, I'm a difficult person to say the least. I feel it would be better for not only myself but others as well if I was out of the picture. I am used for money, random tasks, rebounds,  not one-hundred percent sure yet. Not good for much else.

I do not know if I am loved, my thoughts on the subject change minute to minute and the smallest thing can shift my mood entirely; I have one friend, not sure if she likes me a lot of the time.

I would like for someone else to do it to me as I know I won't be able to do it myself."

And as per school laws, they wont let me study most likely, in the stream. I havent gotten my results yet but from what ive given the tests, i dont think ill pass in biology. And with all this pressure on me, ive decided that i'd rather take my own life than face the consequences. Im a coward sure, but i just cant do this anymore. Ive tried all i could and ive given it my all but i just dont seem to ever get good results. And due to my country's stigma around mental health ive never had the chance to get any help.

745,1,"Hi. I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts since i was around 10, and self harm since i was 12. Whenever i was in a bad spot, i would hurt myself. I could always come out of it feeling better. I could be happy, and do things. 


I am now 23, and married. My spouse knows about my self harm, and whenever i am mentally struggling and want to be alone, he always makes me promise to be safe, otherwise he cannot let me be alone. Being safe means not injuring myself or harming myself. 


But im starting to build resentment. I just lost my job, the world feels like its crashing around me, and i can't even force myself to do any of my hobbies. I've been doing that for the last three weeks. I'm exhausted of trying to make myself want to live. 


I want to hurt myself, and i hate him for putting me in a situation where i can't. I want to die, but i can't. If i kill myself, he would too. And i cant do that to his family."
746,1,"I feel weirdly calm. I’m lonely and isolated due to her lies. I used to have lots of friends but they all hate me for something I didn’t do.

I’d never be able to love again. It had been sunshine and rainbows love initially.

I don’t know what to do with my final hours. "
747,1,"everything just fucking sucks im never gonna be happy again no matter what i do I cant have a future I want, ill have to get some shitty ass job, no career interest me at all, my parents are transphobic and it’s always ohhh live your life fuck them if they don’t accept you!!! but i love my parents?? i want to keep my relationship with them?? They used to be abusive when i was young but now they’re kinda better and i have cptsd and this is the worst trauma bond known to man im generally a selfish person but i CARE so MUCH what they think i CANT get myself to come out. I can’t get myself to do this. I can’t just i can’t. I just wanna be happy again but i cant i want this to be over i wish someone would just kill me i don’t want to kill myself and make my parents sad. I don’t understand people who can just say fuck it and not care what their parents think and do what they want and i wanna be like them SO BAD. My mental health is really bad "
748,1,"i cant do this anymore. the last several years of my life have been spent trying to find ANYTHING that could help with my dissociative amnesia. nothing has. it’s embarrassing not knowing what i’m doing or have done. it’s humiliating contradicting myself or finding out i’ve already told the story an hour ago. its disorienting realizing that i’m in the middle of a conversation and i dont know how i got there, when it started or what we are talking about. i have no idea what else to try. when certain steps are taken, stuff goes missing, appointments get canceled or i find out i denied it all and claim that im a pathological liar. i’m at such a loss and i’m really bummed out that my only option is suicide. i told myself i’d try as many things as possible and i did. im just embarrassed that the biggest obstacle throughout this entire thing has been “me”. my psychiatrist wrote that i seemed more cheerful yesterday, i think im naturally coming off that way due to knowing that i’m not going to deal with this for much longer. it makes me relieved that people will remember me that way. if anyone has any advice on how to reduce amnesia or to help “a part” get out of denial, please let me know. im looking for a shred of hope. something i haven’t tried yet."
749,1,"Few years back i had a non invasive really unnecessary procedure done and it completely ruined my looks. Got into severe depression, tried doing the unthinkable (but ended up surviving) and had to be warded and places on medication. The procedure didn’t just affect my looks, it affected my entire body. 

Fast forward 2 years i finally accepted things and was doing better for months. For the first time in 2 years i was happy with my looks again and i started putting on makeup and dressing up. I started picking up new hobbies and i could say i was in a great place in life. 

Just weeks later, i discovered mewing. I probably did it incorrectly and it fked my face up. I went from looking young for my age and looking cute (despite the incident 2 years ago) to having a elongated, narrow, sunken, droopy face. I can’t take this anymore. This is irreversible. I want to wakeup from this nightmare. I just want to die. Since young bad things have been happening to me nonstop. Everytime i thought i finally have my life together, something bad happens again. It’s as if i have been cursed since young. I can’t take this anymore. I hate this world"
750,1,"after having a horrible fathers day with my family I felt suicidal and decided that I was going to do it. i told my friends i wasn't going to be with them anymore. my best friend messaged me and asked what was wrong and i told him that i was a horrible person and explained why. it took him a few moments to process it but eventually he messaged back something long and blocked me. after i had a fight with my mother that was mentally torturing for me. i feel so drained. i don't think i can look my friends in the eyes if i survive and go back on campus. i don't know what to do, i think i just ruined my life even if i wasn't going to end it all. my life has been horrible since i was 8. i don't think i can take this anymore."
751,1,"if i cant handle the pain or stress i wouldve died from natural causes

i am extremely mentally ill and suicidal and ive been through hell as a child so this has been going on for too long.
for me being suicidal comes from not wanting to deal with the insane stress and pain i experience all the time. ive been through hell and i do regret not dying when i was there sometimes, but the point is i thought i would never survive and i did and maybe im doing really bad but to me as long as im alive even if i REALLLYY dont want to be im doing okay,
i get quality of life vs quantity of life but i feel like death will only come to me when im done doing everything I'm supposed to do, and right now im not done unfortunately."
752,1,"I’m miserable. I’m about to be evicted, I just had to give away my cat, my car doesn’t work, I got fired from my job because of it, my mom died recently, I have no family left, I just fucking hate my life now. I’m miserable from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep. I just don’t want to do this anymore. I’m at peace with my decision to not move forward with life anymore and I’m very grateful for the life I did live but my cat was the only thing holding me together and now I don’t know what to do. "
753,1,"I’ve thought about it and it seems the most logical way to do this, I’ve attempted other methods in the past but always failed or bailed. Given the current state of my country, I feel this will be the best method. There’s even a chance it could be seen as martyrdom if planned right. "
754,1,i dont have enough pills now except lamictal but its small doses. not enough to od on. i need to find a different method. i need to figure something out before im off work. i cant make it to tomorrow. 
755,1,"I’ve been having suicidal thoughts.
I lost my best friend to suicide two months ago, and honestly, ever since then, it’s like I can’t think about anything else. It’s like all I want is to join her.

When I look around me, I feel like I have a million reasons not to stay. My family situation is a mess, it always has been, but strangely, that’s not even the main thing. It’s more than that.

I have major self-esteem issues, like massive. But again, it’s not just that either. It’s also that I genuinely don’t understand the point of life. Like… I don’t want to grow old. I really don’t. I can’t imagine being 40 or 60 or whatever; I don’t want that future. I don’t want to live that long.

There’s also this thing in my head, this constant thought that I want to be the one to decide how and when I die. I don’t want it to just “happen.” I want control over it.

And I keep thinking about how life just seems like this never ending loop: wake up, work, go home, sleep, repeat. Every day. For years. For decades. Until we die. And I don’t get the point. What’s the point of that cycle? What are we doing all this for?

Sometimes it just feels like life is just waiting for death. And I don’t want to wait. I don’t see any meaning in any of it.
Like, I don’t get why I’m supposed to study, get a job, pay bills, do all this stuff. What for? I honestly don’t understand.

And I keep thinking about dying, like planning it. Writing letters. Saving money so I can leave it behind for my parents so they can pay for a proper funeral. I’ve thought through all the details.

But aside from all that, there’s just nothing. No meaning. That’s what I’m trying to say.

And I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else out there feels the same. Like… if you’ve been through this, what makes you stay? Or what makes you want to leave? How do you deal with it? What keeps you going / or doesn’t?"
756,1,Hi I'm (f19) I have bad grammar I apologize to start off iv been struggling with clinical depression for years now my situation that I'm in is pretty difficult can't even get myself out of it without help or support. But anyways not to long ago on June 8 on my birthday my parents were wanting to kick me out for no reason and my dad told me to kms and saying that he told all of his friends that I'm a horrible daughter that has no life and future ahead of her and he told me that I should jump off a bridge and I crashed out and threw all of his stuff on the floor screaming and crying telling him to stop talking so badly about me and he was also talking really bad about my brother that passed away from a homicide saying he deserved to die. I went to my friends house on my birthday I didn't even get to celebrate my birthday at all because I was having anxiety attacks that I couldn't control not even my friend could help me. A few days after staying at my friends house my mom picked me up and she threatened me if I didn't give all my saved money I was saving up for myself she would deport my friends family back to Mexico and I lost it their because my friends family treat me 100 times better than my own family I love my friends family to much to lose them and for it to be my fault so I jumped out of my moms car in the middle of the highway without nothing on me I did almost get ranned over since I did jump in the middle of the highway I was pretty much gunna walk all the way back to my friends house but someone saw me and picked me up they were 2 women and they were the nicest people ever I kinda balled my eyes out and they were hugging and comforting me I'm glad they helped me because I could of possibly got kidnapped or rand over. Last night my mom did pick me up from my friends house and today is Father's day my mom was trying to make me say happy fathers day to him when he didn't even tell me happy birthday he was telling me fuck my birthday and that I wasn't his daughter and calling me a bitch and a cunt making fun of my depression telling me that I stink and I should take a shower when I have been and that I'm a waist of space idk how to even comprehend that even happened to me on my own birthday I'm not going to tell my dad happy fathers day he doesn't deserve anything kind of love from me or sympathy towards him like he dose to me.
757,1,"All I want is to die, my life isn’t salvageable - please I want to die!"
758,1,"I got into a relationship that saved from an eating disorder and what felt like the last straw, its been a year and I know its hard at first but I feel like I'm going to back to that place and I rather die then go back"
759,1,I shouldn’t be here. I want to again really badly. I cry every day all day for 6 months now.
760,1,Currently not drinking and I feel so empty and dull. It’s so awkward now between my family and me. My coworkers also think I’m weird. Never been more miserable than now. I just want my life to end. 
761,1,I have nowhere to go my family is always threatening me that I will be always alone I don't know what to do live in a disgusting country I hate so much I hate sooooo much UNIVERSE WHY ME? 
762,1,I'm from Northern Ireland and the race riots are making feel suicidal. What's the point of living in a world with soo much hatred and violence and people of colour. I'd rather die than live in a world like this 
763,1,"I'm just so angry, like I have no power to change anything. I can't stop thinking it's constant, never-ending. "
764,1,"So I'm living in a homeless shelter because I can't get a job because of my probation. There's been several times where I interviewed and they said they'd like to hire me and I did the onboarding and everything but at the last second when I was supposed to start they changed their mind and said they couldn't hire me. Winco did this to ke and I was so pissed off.

I don't wanna go through some shitty staffing place cause it's inconsistent. I went to staff zone every day for like 2 weeks and they didn't give me any work at all so I'm not wasting my time with that bullshit anymore I want something stable with a set schedule where I know I'll get work for the day.

Idk my life is just so hopeless and over I should just end it. This world doesn't want me. I'm so done wasting months upon months of my life trying to find a job. I guess I'm just gonna be a homeless bum for the rest of my sad life because that's all this world wants from me.

I know you'll just say this is what I deserve for doing whatever I did to get on probation but it wasn't even my fault. It was the only time in my life I've ever been arrested and now my record and entire life is completely fucked. If this world doesn't want me to work then I guess I'm not gonna work. At least I can just stay in bed all day every day for the rest of my shitty ass life I guess"
765,1,"I might not have a devastating story. I have food on my table, roof above my head and I have a comfy bed to sleep, yet I feel like my whole life is being controlled. Dad used to hit me when I was little, he would discipline me when I do something that upsets him. And since then, I’ve been super obedient. I did well in school, I never hangout till late, no drugs, no smoking, no alcohol, no arguing back to him. I won’t even play video games, mobile games cuz he hates it. I won’t watch anime cuz he doesn’t like it. I will only listen to music that suits his taste because I was scared that he will judge me. I dressed appropriately so it won’t upset him. That was my childhood and I’m still dragging it although I turn 25 this year. 

Right now I’m studying. Studying super hard in uni because my dad told me to study this course for my better future. I hate it, I’m not good at this field and I need to pull out 3 all nighter a week to not to fail the subject. He is proud of me for working hard. He is a smartest person I know in my life, so maybe he is right, and maybe I’ll thank him later like he says. 

I knew the only way to get out of his control was to leave the house and get control of my own life. I started tutoring after high-school, I also started working casual job as waiter at a restaurant hoping to get some financial independence. My dad hated it. He said I should be spending all my time studying to do well at uni. He told me he will give me money if I need it so I should quite working. He also said some other hurtful things and I had to stop working because I cannot be doing things he hates behind his back. And maybe he is right, I should get a good grade and should not waste my privilege of being a student while having my parents’ financial support. He gave me his credit card and sends me money whenever I needed, but he will always have access to my bank account and was able to see what I spend on it. 
I made my own bank account and moved little savings behind his back but I felt super guilty.

Everything went downhill when one of my friend committed suicide last year. I received the news when I was studying at university’s library around 7pm. I met up with my friends and gathered at her house. I was devastated but her family welcomed us in her room (it was already 2days after she committed) and gave us a moment to grieve in her room. Me and my friends sat in her room, looked at her drawings and notebooks and some notes she left. At 11pm, my dad called me and yelled at me over the phone saying ‘what time do you think it is? Don’t you have study to do? I bet you weren’t that close with that friend. How inconsiderate and disrespectful for her parents to keeping you guys till this late. Come home right now’ I was shocked. A friend of mine passed away and not only he told me to come home but disrespected the passed one’s family. I couldn’t think properly because I was too shocked, but also my trauma response was to obey what he says so I went home. 
Since then I get depressed whenever I think about my dad and how little control I have over my life. I never really had hobbies or passion because everything I was interested got talked trash by him, discouraged and now I have zero interest in anything. I see no point in living, no purpose, I feel worthless and powerless. All I want right now is to prove my dad wrong, by killing myself. I hope he realizes something after losing me. I hope he regrets. I hope he changes."
766,1,"I’m 16F and I feel like I’m living in a dream or a video game I can’t escape. I have people around me like my family, friends  but I still feel so alone, like no one truly gets what’s going on in my mind. I overthink everything, feel like I’m failing at life before it even starts, and I miss the younger version of me who had hope. I feel lost, like I’m not the person I was supposed to become. I think about dying a lot but I’m scared. I just want peace, or to feel truly understood for once. Does it ever get better?"
767,1,I have to die because I'm not what I'm supposed to be I'm not what they want me to be I don't have anything to live for I feel like a criminal everytime I fall in love I feel so wrongggggggg 
768,1,"Trigger Warning: Suicide; Suicidal ideation

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm an attorney and I'm scared I may do something impulsive. I'm not sure how to get help without being locked up somewhere and my loved ones suffering because of it.

I've been practicing for about seven years now. There are things I enjoy and things I don't. My issue is the pressure. At a certain point, I just buckle. I've tried working for other firms and the workload destroys me. I've been working for myself and, today, all I can think about is taking the pistol from my safe and laying down my burdens. I haven't stopped crying since I woke up.

Driving to the middle of nowhere and just letting nature take back its bounty sounds so nice. I've already planned it out: I can purchase and load up enough camping supplies to last about a week. I'll take a bus to another state so my wife has my car. I'll just hike in one direction until I run out of food and water, then I'll move on to whatever is after this, if there is anything. I hope there isn't. I just want to rest.

If I try to call JLAP or a suicide hotline, they're just going to send police to protect me from myself. I'm the only breadwinner. Pretty sure being hospitalized will ruin any chances of practicing any more. I have no idea what a future like that looks like. All I can see is more suffering. I want it to end.

When I try to talk to my wife, the look in her eyes destroys me. I feel so incredibly pathetic. All I want is for her to be happy. She deserves far better than this. She'll be happier afterward. I'm such a burden.

I don't know what to do or what I will do. I'm shaking, breathing heavy, and can't stop crying. I don't know why I'm even writing this post. I guess I just want to feel like I told someone why this happened if it happens.

**UPDATE:** I came very close to enacting my plan yesterday (06/15). My wife asked me to compromise: I've purchased camping gear necessary to get far enough away so some poor soul won't be burdened with cleaning up my mess. I have everything ready. If another crisis arises, I'm leaving for good. She claims she won't call the police if it happens. 

I'm just so tired all the time and don't see any rest in sight. There's so much pain in this world and it's only getting worse. All I want is to go somewhere remote and spend my life reading books, helping people at a relaxed pace, and taking care of my wife.   
  
Why does this world require me to squeeze every bit of productivity out every day in order to survive? If I am not working, I must constantly either improve myself to avoid malpractice by missing important developments, etc. or putting myself out there to attract more clients to keep the pipeline full (or risk not getting paid for an entire month). Humanity already produces enough goods to clothe, feed, and house every single person. **Why do we still tie survival to productivity?** 

After over a decade of higher education, killing myself is an act of rebellion."
769,1,"This post will be  disorganized thoughts and feelings I’m having and I don’t know where to let it out. I have been feeling sad for two months. Now I’m angry. I can’t let go of that anger and the urge to just commit suicide or having someone else just do it for me. I’m in my 30s and I was officially diagnosed with depression when I was in my early 20s. I knew something wasn’t right when I was in my teens. I had manic episodes and random episodes of extreme misery at that age. Absolutely no kid/ teen should experience those horrible feelings. Feelings of being un heard, not understood or not cared for or just even a chemical imbalance which is what the fuck is wrong with me.  To every teen in here who wants too end things.  I understand you. I don’t judge you. I’ve been on meds for at least 10 years minimum. I’m sure it’s more but can’t and don’t have the energy to pin point exactly when I started taking medication . I’ve recently become angry. Angry at everyone and everything. I don’t want to be here and don’t understand why I fucking have to. So I’m ashamed for crying in public and embarrassed.  I look like I fucking idiot. I feel stupid all the time because the world makes me feel like I’m stupid and there is something wrong with me for not wanting to be here.  I’ve had a pretty good life. I’m not rich or successful but I have loving parents and a loving partner who I don’t deserve. I don’t know why I want to end things but I always walk around constantly wishing someone pushed me on the train tracks or I got hit by a bus. I feel like a burden to my parents and significant other. Why should I be in so much pain why should they have to deal with my bullshit depression. Why do I have to stay alive for the sake of others. I have to suffer for ever and I hate it and I’m ANGRY. Yes I have been on medication for a long time. They change it all the time. I always feel the same.  Even when I’m ok I feel it lingering inside. It never ends. This will never fucking end and I only see one way out. "
770,1,"First of all i want to say that i know i’m crazy but it’s serious. The girl I loved so much died a while ago. She didn't love me that much. I was devastated too but I somehow got over it. But in the last few weeks my life situation has gotten worse and with it came memories of her. I'm not so depressed about life itself, even though nobody really likes me, but more about the fact that I'll never hear or see her again no matter what I do in life. Never. I have not seen more perfect person in my life. I can't do anything without having memories of her and I don't know how to get out of it. It always makes me sad and i don’t see my future being good. I tried talking to people but it doesn’t help. This has gotten me to the point where I’m thinking about killing myself, because even when i don’t know what is after life, it seems like it is the only way to see her and hear her again right now and i believe that. Or to have brain damage that will make me forget her. "
771,1,"I am so low on energy and mental stamina that I keep finding myself sobbing and thinking that killing myself would fix all my problems, since nothing else will "
772,1,Alone. Suicidal. For ever..
773,1,"This fucking wall of loneliness surrounds me & I keep it up because it protects me from the agonizing unbearable reality of being seen, which immediately makes me a physical being once again who has to inhabit this mortal plane of misery and suffering. I crawl around the wreckage of my own mind looking for a way out but I made sure to close off all of the doors because I was too afraid that somebody would come inside. Now I have what I wanted, to be perfectly and completely alone. Nothing to do now except wait for the grim reaper to show up and get this painful charade over with. 

I really wish I could have liked life, but the game was rigged against me from the start. The stumbling block was always inside my own head, and no matter how far I ran to get away from it I always ended up tripping over it. Oh well, no use in crying about it. Get up, get dressed, back to work."
774,1,"so, i've planned to commit by the end of 2025. i'm not getting any better, my psychs are unable to help me, no matter the new treatments they conjure. i'm not living the best quality of life. i'm fucking up my education and health. so, i'm either going to commit soon after my birthday or at the end and do a bucket list cross-off. i'm hoping to romanticise and enjoy life a little bit to see if it could save me (i'm trying to see the benefit :)) but, i'm not too hopeful on it. anyways, don't wish this on anyone, truly. i hope we can all get better, but sometimes that is not possible."

I've only started fights with my bf about him playing games when ik it's his way of escaping reality and I feel like absolute shit about it.

776,1,Does anyone know how to stop panic attacks I’ve been having them so bad recently to the point my breathing gets extremely fast and I pass out I need help 
777,1,"I have been at home with my parents for exactly 2 weeks now and already my mental health has crashed to maybe an all-time low. I actually started doing better in school (college, I'm 23 and went to school for film but I'm dropping out and haven't told my family yet and it's because MONEY SUCKS); I started therapy and it taught me a lot including that I'm trans, it helped me with some self help tips, my therapist helped me with a lot and I appreciate her for it. I made a lot of friends I'll cherish for a long time and I'll miss. But now it feels like everything is falling apart around me. Besides my parent's dog who does absolutely love me (she's amazing I love her), I have no job, my (step)dad is a piece of shit who constantly stresses me out and doesn't really care about me that much, my mom hates that I've ""become"" liberal and doesn't treat me the same because of it, I can't trust my family enough to tell any of them I'm trans so I have to boymode the whole time which is killing me, I'm horrified by my student loans which I don't think I'll ever be able to find a job to pay back and I had my mom as a cosigner for a lot of it so if I DON'T pay it back it'll bite her credit score to so I HAVE to, I won't see any of my old friends ever again, I think I might have developed anorexia or something if that's how that works (I'm down almost 60 pounds this year which is KINDA a yay but I don't know where it'll stop and I'm happy about it but there's a part of me that's struggling to type this that knows I shouldn't be, I'm like 5'11 and really want to be as low as like 140/130 and I know I shouldn't want that why do I want that), I just yelled at my dad on father's day (I am a classic ""good"" kid and I always try and ""do the right thing"" so doing bad things always weigh on me""), a small thing but today my dog almost lunged at a kid and the look on her face I don't think will ever leave me I want to die I don't know how else to solve my problems my debt will go away my mom's problems will be solved she won't worry about her credit score my brother who I love and has worked so hard to get better won't have to worry about a deadbeat moving in with him when he's already barely making ends meet I don't know any other way how do I not kill myself is it possible I don't think I can do this anymore I'm a burden to everyone everyone talks over me everyone ignores me nobody understands me nobody wants to help me nobody thinks about me I'm NOTHING I can't do anything right when will I be enough when can I die when will I be right when please someone help me

I'm sorry, I kinda took a second after that but I don't want to delete it cause it kinda exemplifies where I'm at right now and I don't know what else to do. I feel as though I've been venting to my friends a lot lately and they've been giving me signals lately that I've been irritating them and I feel like I don't have anywhere left to turn. I don't have money for therapy, I've tried the suicide hotline and it's no help, I don't trust the cops, I don't know what to do. Is the only way out of this without causing financial harm to someone else killing myself? I'm sorry for this being a wall of text by the way."

Whatever activity i take or subject i want to pursue, they are already sure i will fail and it really hurts. I no longer have any passion nor any reason to keep going. And, the only friend i trust enough to vent has told me that its normal that parents discourage you like this for your own good. I am confused, my feelings don't feel validated nor do i feel wanted any longer. I just want to get some help or something. Its really draining to have a family that doesn't believe in you.  "

(????) i'm too depressed to feed myself even though i can access food. too depressed to keep myself clean. too depressed to keep my space clean. i'm too mentally ill to do jack shit. why the fuck should i stay? i live on the second floor of the house i stay in, and have just enough money to buy a proper rope. i just want to know and be sure i won't be around long after the fall. i can't afford another failed attempt."
784,1,"Hello. Same bitter account about life and myself. I went as cercecerce, gniksidnas, and many more because when i feel the urge to break up with my online boyfriend, i try to lose all track of me because im a psycho. I struggle with self esteem issues but especially my appearance and weight, and pretty much my whole identity is the fat girl jealous of pretty girls, like a femcel if you wish. People are scared of me because I might be like a creep and making people feel uneasy and in danger because well the aura might be too dark, so I honestly think yes fuck yea im scum and a dirt bag and also I wish I could die but family stops me. Sometimes they make sense (mom only tbh), and she says that what would she do alone, what would everyone do if I die, but man, I'm not person material, who knows who the fuck I am. I stop because I don't think it's good for your family to find you with a bullet in your head in your bed, or maybe disappearing and all of them trying to search for you but the most likely scenario is that I got myself killed.

I would also make fun of my situation or me if I was someone else, so yes, I wish I was also dead like people telling me I'm gross and they don't want me around. There are consequences of course. Man I really want to gain all my courage back and kill myself. I really think that might be the biggest contribution to society. Not making a career or collect trash and make streets clean, having the guts to kill myself and stop being a waste of space."
785,1,"I ruin everything in my life. Why can't I just get the guts to do it. 

I can't bring myself to work at my new job. I have barely any money. I can't afford to move out. I'm stuck with my grandma all day who just tells me about how worthless I am and how much I stress them out. I dropped out of high school, don't have any decent references, certifications. No drivers license.

I thought the new job would make me happy again since I would get out of the house but I can't get out of the bed every morning. The job market is so bad in my area and literally the only job I could get was an early morning one that makes me want to die everyday.

I ruined my only friendship. I started some shit and pissed her off badly enough so she left like i wanted. I was going to kill myself and didn't want to hurt her but I couldn't do it so now I'm just friendless.

It doesn't even fell worth it to try therapy. I can't go through a single day without breaking down and having a panic attack. Every day I'm haunted by these stupid memories and new ones keep popping up every day. There's nothing that gives me even the slightest hope. 

Literally the only option I have that'll leave me with some dignity is to kill myself. Why couldn't I have just been born as someone who can function?"

788,1,"I tried to commit suicide some time ago and unfortunately I was saved. I'm not interested in anything at all, I have no plans for the future, I don't plan anything, I hate being here, pretending to be interested in something, studies, work, in appearing happy or interested in someone's conversation. I've always thought this way and I've been this way since I was a child. I hate myself for being this way, when you're not interested in things, you're simply nothing. When I tried to commit suicide and survived, I was happy that I didn't have any after-effects, but the next day I was already thinking about trying again, with a bigger dose. I won't last long, it's just a rant."

791,1,"Sorry this is so long no one will probably read it. 

I’ve been in a really rough patch, although that’s quite an understatement. I’ve exhausted every resource I have and I’ve just run out of energy. I built a life for myself and watched it all crumble away anyways. I tried to make the best of the shitty hand I was dealt and ended up crashing and burning anyways.

I started college in 2020 and did zoom university until my sophomore year. I met my partner of almost 4 years and we started dating. Things were going good until i had a mental breakdown and couldnt get out of bed for a month. Missed a month of classes and had to drop a class, but i had frontloaded a lot of my courses so i was still doing well academically. My mental and physical health still started to deteriorate as i kept pushing through. I worked 2 jobs, one on campus, another a digital marketing gig, and worked on campus during the summer as well. I became homeless my junior year after my aunt offered to take me in, but a month later she had to go to rehab and i was kicked out on christmas eve. That spring I scored my dream internship at a huge archive at a big university. The pay was amazing and I was able to save up a lot of it. But i had to quit a month early when my knees gave out and i had to go to the ER. I couldnt drive so i couldnt work. I felt like a shell of myself, even more disabled than i was. Senior year was rough, i failed some classes and if i hadnt already worked my ass off the semesters before i wouldnt have graduated. On the morning of graduation, neither of our alarms went off and my partner and i missed the ceremony. Nobody in my family besides my mother and her boyfriend showed up. I was absolutely devastated- i had dreamed of my graduation since i was a child. I was absolutely crushed.
And then I was homeless again. 

I’ve been homeless for the last 3 years, starting my junior year, and  been living in my car since November. I spent months applying for jobs and hear back from maybe a few. Im now in a deep depression and burned out from living in my car and having my entire life that i worked so hard to build for myself just crumble all around me. My family have all abandoned me, my mother who abused me my whole life has manipulated them all to think I’m the problem. They treat me like less than dirt, nothing I do is good enough. I’m the only one in the family who isnt ignoring my problems with liquor, or hasnt done coke or some fashion drug. Theyve told me theyre embarrassed of me, my cousin says im not safe for her family to be around bc im trans, and my aunt has ignored me ever since she came at me in the middle of the night during her alcoholic fueled psychotic episode. Nobody in my family acknowledges their problems, but because i’m the identified patient they hate me. I have autism and adhd, and also bipolar, bpd, and ptsd. Nobody in my family believes me even though ive been diagnosed and am on medication. Ive been reaching out to anyone in my family but theyve all turned their backs on me. The only person who truly loved me was my grandpa, and he passed a year ago. 

Ive been working with social services to get housed but its taking forever and im losing my will to keep going. And with the state of the world, i dont know if i want to. Im so tired, my body is worn thin, ive had so many mental breakdowns and meltdowns and seizures. I feel like if i dont take matters into my own hands i’ll just die from stress.

I dont know what to do. I dont have the energy to keep going, but i dont have the resources to be in this position. This is what creates these statistics for suicide, are these dire circumstances that happen even with the best intentions. 

I promised myself when I was a kid and I was scared when my mom would be hurting me, that one day it would all be okay. I could work hard and come out on the other side. I dont think thats gonna happen. I feel so bad for little me. I feel like i failed them. My family failed that kid. I was just a kid. Why did they treat me like this?

I dont know how much longer I have. I dont wanna die, i just want all the pain to be over. "

793,1,"I wished I killed myself on my birthday. I am a failure. I am a freak. I am ugly.

Therapy since I was 17 has done nothing. Neither has antidepressants. I wish I had the confidence to go through with my suicidal attempt this week.

I never had a date or a relationship with a woman before. Not even intimate. I am a failure. I want to die so much.

Please do not say things will get better. It won't. Stop with any meaningless platitudes you are thinking of. Nothing good will happen when I least expect it. I am worthy of nothing. NOTHING! 

Nothing but my own death."
794,1,"So, my very best friend just broke up with her boyfriend recently. I started hanging out a lot more with her recently sort of as moral support and also because she’s my best friend and I love her.

BUT, just as you’ve probably suspected, the thing happened. The thing that always happens where our closeness begins to blur the line between love and romance, and suddenly I find myself in situations where she’s unbearably close to me. Relationships destroy relationships, beget relationships, replace relationships, destroy relationships, and so on. It wasn’t anything, until she was leaning on me, and then my arm was around her, and we were just *existing* together. I know where this is going and I also know I CAN’T let it happen.

I don’t want to fall in love again because I hate everything that comes with it. I hate my body’s response to love and I just want to be fucking normal. I have seriously and genuinely considered just getting rid of the damn things by whatever method I can. I CAN’T fall in love again because I am incredibly mentally unwell. I am GOING to destroy myself. I HAVE to. 

I emerge from myself, anew, then recreate, emerge from myself, anew, dissociate, emerge from myself, anew, dissolve, then return to myself, alone but the same. New things become old things when change returns all things back into the same things. I can’t seem to fit a relationship into my life, when it’s all cycles upon cycles, again upon cycles, and cycles again, then again, again.

It’s a nice idea, but holy fuck, I can’t unsee myself turning her life into hell, even if it’s just by proxy.
I need to:
• Get rid of these feelings
• Push her away until she doesn’t associate with me
• Amass as much money as I can to make my death affordable
• Destroy myself until there’s nothing left"

796,1,"I don't know why I'm posting I just need to get my thoughts out. My life is just so worthless. I have no real job, nothing ever goes right for me, and I'm just tired. Last year I had a pretty good job now I got fired for a minor infraction and ever since then I can't find anything and that'll sustain me. Things are getting progressively harder and I'm just tired. I'm not good at anything and no one likes me. My life is just a joke. Right now I'm just working up the courage to and everything...it seems like it's my only way out."
797,1,"It all hurts so much. Everyday my head hurts, my throat closes up the moment im awake. Because i woke up. Every waking moment feels like the day  where i was a couple weeks away from turning 10. Coming home from school, all alone i just retreated to my room. I was weak, i didnt tie the rope right, it gave out. I woke up with this exact feeling. Barely able to breathe, every part of me aching, still crying like a kid. It does feel like part of me died there, like i havent progressed too far from that moment. Maybe because it was supposed to be forever, it was supposed to work."
798,1,"I know I have posted recently but I have seen a lot of post popping up so I wanted to share this agin, I am 30 and don’t fully remember a time when I was fully happy with life, I have always struggled. To me I was scared to attempt because the % of living, someone catching me before it’s to late, me missing, someone stopping, not the right amount, didn’t do it right and so on. Then there’s dealing with the after, the people caring and showing love and support, going to the hospital, being a vegetable for the rest of your life, being on watch, being put away for a long time and so on. There so many factors to me that go into attempting. And seeing other people struggle. I did attempt over a year ago by hanging but I took my head out and put it away like nothing happened. Something in me told me it was not my time to go. I am not religious by any means. My dad later told me the beam I hooked onto would have broke with my body weight. Yes do I still want to not be here at times yes, will I forever live with those thoughts and feelings I say yes now. I me I am physically lonely and am so unsure about my life in different ways but at the end of the day I know I will be okay and that you never know what tomorrow will bring. You could sell that one thing you made. You could meet the love of your life, you could meet a mentor, you could get that raise, you could find that one thing for your collection- so many things that could happen for you. If you need to go to the hospital for a week or so and even if you have to go back 1+ times it’s okay, as well as having a talking doc, doing stuff you love, trying new things. 

Also do what I did and download one of those sober apps and track how much progress you have made from your attempt/cutting/self harm- I have 1 year and 2 months. "
799,1,"It's about 1:30 am, Sunday morning. I'm tired but I don't want to sleep away my last day. I have things I need to do. I'm working on cleaning my whole apartment to make things a bit easier on people. I need to finish up some letters. Gather the things I don't want people to find and toss them... 
I was hoping I could have a good last day with my friend, but he said something yesterday that hurt and confirmed that I was right to give up hope when it came to him ever loving me back. I suppose it's for the best since I'm doing this, but it hurt all the same. Maybe it's what I needed to hear tho. 
I hate knowing I'm going to hurt people. But it isn't fair to expect me to stay and be in so much pain when none of them are ever here for me. I loved them, but they never show me that same love. Why does that love only come out when someone is gone? It isn't fair. 
I'm afraid honestly. Afraid it won't work. Afraid of what comes after. Afraid of hurting people. Afraid. But there are more reason for me to be afraid to continue to live. 
It'll be over soon. Then I won't have to be afraid anymore. Or in pain. Or angry. Or lonely. Or sad.
It'll be ok then.

I lost it and I've never been so angry, if my mother hadn't been between me and her boyfriend, I would probably have sent him into a coma, I left all afternoon, and when I came back in the evening this bastard had kept all my things and didn't want to let me back in... results of the races, I  I'm going to fuck myself up, I think downing a bottle of vodka and trying to get alcoholic coma is a good ending... sorry again for wasting your time..."
808,1,"i’m an only child to a single african mother. we’ve been through so much together. we have gone to therapy together, we’ve argued, we’ve made up. but every time i hurt her due to my actions, i can feel her slipping away little by little.

i try so so hard to be a better daughter, and i feel like i fail every single time. the past few weeks, she hasn’t even been able to look me in my eyes and has told me that i keep stressing her out. i’ve apologised numerous times but i don’t blame her for being done with me. i think yesterday was the last straw when i forgot to tell her i was working late. she came to my job at 1 extremely mad and i had to leave. in the car she yelled at me about how i always apologise but it doesn’t mean anything anymore and how she thinks ill be at peace if she dropped dead and that she hates being a single mother. 

my mother has been through so much her entire life and i hate that im part of her trauma and stress. she has health problems, especially heart and i can’t be the dark in her life. i don’t want her to have a heart attack because of me. but i can’t live without her. my beautiful, hurt, amazing, sweet mother who deserves so much. i’d rather die than cause her pain, because somehow, that’s all i do. so i think that’s all that left for me.

So now I'm thinking I should write letters for my family. I have nothing to say to them, but there's no sense in making it worse for them.

The stupidest thing is the reason for my spiral today was all because I broke the mug I brought my dad as a present for Father’s Day. He said it didn’t matter but it matters to me. The fact I also realised I’ve not spoken to any of my friends for a few weeks now. If I reached out now it be stupid because in my head I think they’d probably feel like I want something, I can’t even message them to say I love you because I know they’ll realise something is up. 

I’m supposed to be returning to university in September after having a year break but I just can’t bring myself to be happy about it. There’s so much to do before I return that it’s easier to just procrastinate it. Everyone I know already graduated back in 2024 and it sucks seeing them getting on with their lives while I feel stuck. 

It be so easy to just do something, and I hate how easily my brain turns to thinking of ways I could do it. I can’t talk to anyone, helplines have never helped, my family wouldn’t be helpful at all, and last time I tried back in 2022 nothing was really done to help my mental health. "

I was just wondering if there will be any long term effects that I need to be concerned about? I have been feeling generally unwell and exhausted since but I guess I'm just wondering how long that will last or if there's anything I need to be concerned about. Most of what I read up on OD cases tend to be short term effects.

818,1,"I feel like I'm going to break down and just commit suicide. I know it may seem like a stupid reason, but I've never had a romantic relationship and I'm scared that I'll be alone for the rest of my life.
I know it sounds absurd, but I just don't have the strength anymore, nothing helps me. I've never had problems with communication, I often go out to play Pathfinder or ACKS II irl in good company, sometimes I go out party with friends, but the thought of being alone brings me to some kind of primal horror. I've tried speed dating and long-term courtship (around half a year), but it's all useless. The feeling that I'll never be able to please anyone scares me so much that I just want to kill myself. I've talked to my therapist about this (she helped me with my anger issues, bless her), who is trying to help me, but I'm losing faith in life more and more. I know my life has been through some pretty big upheavals in the last few years, and I'm trying to convince myself that I must push myself, but I feel like it's just nothing.

I feel guilty about having suicidal thoughts, because my friends and my therapist are trying to support me, but I really don't see the point. I want to stop living, but I continue to, partly because of them, partly because of... I feel like I owe them that they're putting their effort into me.

I know I sound a bit like an incel, but I really want to end this. To no longer feel this fear, this uselessness, this inability to please anyone in a romantic way.

Maybe this isn't the right place to write this. Sorry."

So basically I'm a guy I'm in my teens and I have a girlfriend I deeply love. My whole life I've been sexually attracted to males but emotionally to females even though I never could imagine fucking a guy or being fucked by one. I grew up with no father and was SA by a guy friend while playing truth or dare when I was a kid and it wasn't really literal SA but still felt like that and that as my first sexual experience. In middle school I had a lesbian friend that was convincing me I was gay and guys always rejected me in their friend groups cause I was fat and a bit feminine since I grew up with females only and no male figure. I love my girlfriend and couldn't possibly live without her and I get hard by touch with her and we've been doing sexual stuff but it's not the same feeling I had while being attracted to guys with them it's more lustful and just by visuals and with her it's more self-lead and just wanted i mean it happens by itself by touch and speech and texts but it's different. It kills me that she feels with me like I once was turned on by guys but I don't feel like that with her even though I love her deeply. Whenever I see a guy I overthink if I'm aroused and then I actually get aroused and I'm just so confused like is this trauma response cause I literally could not live without her she's my soul and I told her all of this and she's been so supportive and amazing and everyone says it's a trauma response and that I'm not gay but is it it's so hard to believe if I've been like this my whole life I probably reinforced it by jerking to male material my whole life how do I change this it's killing me and also feels natural but also so unnatural and uncomfortable. I mean I like her body when we do stuff also but it's so confusing and if I imagine a guy doing it it would be better"
826,1,I wanted to kill myself today but didn’t. I’ll feel bad for leaving people behind but at the same those people don’t care about me. I just don’t care anymore 
827,1,"After a year of ""it is what it is"", the final straw has been reached. I never thought I would be one of the people feeling like this. Went up to the roof of my job earlier with the intention of jumping off and broke down crying instead. I truly hate everything and myself. Everything I touch turns to shit. I'm done hurting people through foolishness. Even if I don't end it, I'm just gonna pack a bag and leave and see how far I get."
828,1,"I have made it this far, but I am tired. It's starting to wear me thin. My amazing wife has had to talk me down 3 times this week and it's just so unfair to her. It makes me feel like an absolute piece of garbage. I'm starting to numb out and the chronic pain is abating itself as a result, but I'm tired. My short term goal is to make it through September to go to an event with my wife. She has her own illnesses that threaten her life constantly, if I lose her I don't think I will make it through the end of the year. I have made a list of goals to try and keep me going for now. They are aimed at making it easier for my family when I Alt+F4 this world. I plan on getting enough saved up to cover minimal funeral costs, make videos to explain myself in my absence as well as explain what and where stuff is, I am currently writing lots of notes for my sister to be able to take over what I leave behind, and a laundry list of apologies for everyone close to me. I have been dealing with mild progressing to severe pain for about 25 years now. I am just a shadow of my former self and I am just done. Just need to make it a few more months, make things...right, I guess that's the best word. I'm so tired... I know that there are plenty of people in worse situations, but you should never compare illnesses."
829,1,"Events have put into perspective what I always kind of knew. I am just not a person. There are no goals I have long or short term, no dreams I want acomplished, I'v never felt any love towards anyone. I'v tried getting better, but at every point either through cosmic fucking unluck or my own paranoia and anxiety fucks me over. You know when scientists say that we are atoms that are aware that they are atoms, that's how I feel in a literal sence. I don't strive for anything, I have genuenly, not even downplaying myself, NO redeeming qualities as a person and every attempt at improvement is ruined by myself or life itself. I am a fucking flesh automaton that has been faking it till he makes it, but that can only take you so far and I think I have hit the wall. I'm not a human with hopes and dreams, I'm a bad batch of sentient fucking atoms and at this point entropy is looking real fucking alluring. "
830,1,"hi, this is my story. I would like to tell my story. I live in Kolkata, a metro city. I had the opportunity to enjoy all the amenities of living in a city. I studied in a well known school. My 10th boards(west Bengal board) result was 85%.I took pcmb as my stream in my higher secondary. i am the batch of 2019-2021 .at that time i wanted to be a doctor. i couldnt crack neet. took a drop ,still couldnt do it. there is something that needs to be told- i suffer from maladaptive daydreaming. after that i took economics (hons).

life rn:

how to kill myself. its really enough for me. I can never get rid of this daydreaming, I understood that very clearly. This ain't my life. its just me existing in this body while my mind imagines different other things to carry on as a fuel. I really TIRED TBH . the amount of strength and willpower required to stop this is too much for me. but guess the worst part, i am scared of death. if it is an accident then its easy but doing by myself is too scary for me. May god thinks i have purpose, maybe giving a a chance i don't know. but the truth is my parents really have a misfortune having me. really feel sorry for them. they are good people. i am just a weak, always been weak- a weak unworthy stupid overconfident underconfident, someone who's 'always scared to do work because its hard so imagine about it' kinda girl. all in all one word best to describe me - W E A K.

I dont mean any attention via this post. i just shared this because i wanted to let this out. i cannot tell this to my parents. if u read this post,thanks u"
831,1,"I want to die, even though everything is going right for me. I was saved from 20 years of my own personal nightmare over a year ago now, and now my life is suddenly amazing. And…. I dunno. 

I just.. don’t care if I live or die. No, actually I want to die. I just.. know that I’m selfish and horrible for that. I have a loving chosen family, pets, friends… they would suffer if I died. So I’m here. 

But I don’t know"
832,1,"Nothing changed. I feel like politics is slowely destroying me. Every breathe I take is WAR, WAR, WAR. I am tired of old men who can't get it up anymore dictating our generation's lives. These 2 years have been hell and there is more to come. My biggest problem is political debate. I can't help but engage. People are so ruthless and narrow sometimes. People keep defending politicians or governments that are comparable to the devil himself. I hate waking up to news and sleeping to news. I hate having to explain why I have the right to live and other people have the right to live. I hate explaining that taking away someone's house or land is wrong. I hate having to defend resisting against colonists. Awaiting my death is so fcking hard. I feel like I would rather kill myself now and spare myself the anxiety and depression of it all. "
833,1,"I want to die. But I fake being okay.

I smile, joke around, talk like life is fine. But it’s not. Not at all.

My brother tried to kill himself. He overdosed and ended up in the psych ward. He’s been in and out. Our parents were crushed. He told them everything. He’s getting help now.

But I’ve overdosed too. Same thing. Same darkness. I just didn’t tell anyone.

We both have Bipolar Disorder. We’re both drowning. The difference is, he let them see it. I didn’t.

Why? Because I saw what it did to them. Our parents are barely holding it together with just him. The crying, the fear, the way they check in on him like they’re scared every day might be his last. I can’t put them through that again.

So I stay quiet. I survive in silence. I let them think I’m the strong one.

But I’m not. I’m not strong. I’m tired. Every day feels heavier. I don’t know how much longer I can keep pretending. I don’t know how much longer I can carry this alone.

I just needed to let this out. Somewhere. To someone. I don’t even know what I want from this post. I just don’t want to feel invisible anymore.

Thanks if you read this."
834,1,"NO MATTER WHERE I GO TO TALK IT ALWAYS GETS FUCKING NOTHING 

IVE TRIED FOR ALMOST A FUCKING YEAR ON THE INTERNET AND IRL BUT EVERY POST I MAKE DOES NOTHING AND PEOPLE IRL CANT DO SHIT ANYMORE 

I FEEL LIKE JUST BECAUSE I DONT HAVE ANY BIV BAD BACKSTORY FOR WHY I WANT TO KILL MYSELF THAT HOW I FEEL DOESNT ACTUALLY MATTER. EVEN WHEN I TRIED TO KILL MYSELF ALL THAT HAPPENED WAS A BLOOD TEST WITH RESULTS THAT I DIDNT EVEN GET BACK 

I HATE MYSELF SO FUCKING MUCH.. I AM NOTHING, I PROBABLY DESERVE EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME, I DO MIST OV THE THINGS TO MYSELF ANYWAY, PROBABLY FOR ATTENTION EVEN THOUGH I DONT TELL ANYONE ABOUT IT 90% OF THE TIME  

IF I KILLED MYSELF NOW IM SURE NOOBE WOULD FUCKING CARE, ID GET A SMALL FUNERAL FOR THE 5 PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT ME THEN ID BE FORGOTTEN LIKE I USUALLY DO "

836,1,"that's pretty much it I'm 26, wanted to off myself since I was like 12 due to a multitude of reasons and the one that continues to live in my head rent free is me dying alone and people have told me that I will die alone and that I'm not attractive enough 

I am overweight and have plateaued in weight loss even though I try to walk more, go to the gym (I've been going relatively consistently for over a year now), and I'm trying to get back on calorie counting but it makes me feel fucked mentally 

probably have a binge eating or some eating disorder

80 percent of people my age regularly have sex i haven't since my 1 month gf blew me once in high school and I fumbled her LMAO I essentially am being told that I'm supposed to remove myself from the gene pool 

doctor said I might have a little autism bc I went to look into it but no concrete answer. if he said I was 100% autistic at least id have an explanation somewhat but in reality there's something inherently wrong with me

I start therapy soon again but have tried like 4 or 5 times before and never been helpful

I'm agender internally but amab and still male presenting in almost any situation 

asian as well, and whether ppl want to admit it or not, Asian men are the least desired and when they are it's typically fetishizing anyways

not queer passing enough for queer spaces and not cishet passing enough for cishet spaces 

it sucks because I don't think I'm ugly and I have began to move beyond self hatred but no one sees me as even a possibility on dating apps and idk how to interact for dating or relationships irl

idk if I'm an incel or not I know I'm not owed sex love relationships etc and I don't blame anyone for it but I lost the genetic lottery both physically and mentally and have mental and physical health issues that I've been working on but it's never been enough for me to have a chance with anyone. I'm tired of trying for anything I give up 

i don't like drinking, I hate small talk, so bars won't do anything

my job is ok it's not wonderful but it pays the bills relatively well and it's what I want to be doing

probably addicted to weed and I get high every day and try not to think but that's not going great right now

I'm on wellbutrin and prozac already and my dose was upped for prozac bc I started dealing with anxiety a lot more this year but also I have a stash of Adderall and even taking like 15mg lets me function like a normal person somewhat without being distracted and my doctor said I likely don't have ADHD but idrc anymore I just want to feel okay

materialistically I think I'm ok and relatively, my life is in a decent spot but not for what I really want or care about and I know someone will just say just keep going or keep working on myself like I haven't been doing that my whole fucking life just kill me already

things have gotten better over the years except my lack of relationships sex and companionship and I'm just depressed chronically, and I'm tired of trying to better myself when nothing has come out of it I am truly so pathetic and a waste of space

837,1,"I'm 15 years old(turning 16 in 3 days), and lately, I've been really scared that I might be a pedophile. I feel horrible even saying that but i think its true

A while ago maybe two months, I was feeling really insecure about my body. I kept having thoughts about wanting to see what other people my age looked like, hoping it would make me feel more normal or less alone. I ended up searching for things like “naked family pictures,” thinking maybe I’d find someone around my age to compare myself to. As soon as I did it, I felt horrible.

Ever since then, I’ve been overwhelmed with guilt and fear. I’m terrified that I’m a bad person or that I could be dangerous, and it’s tearing me apart. If I really were a pedophile, I think i would genuinly kill myself. I would never want to hurt anyone.

I don’t know what to do. Please, any help or advice would mean a lot."
838,1,"I had a good life, while with its own shit and problems, it was fine. I have a family that loves me, they don't accept my sexuality but that ok, they were raised in such country where anything like that would be frowned upon. I have a boyfriend who loves me but nothing makes me happy, only alcohol and junk food. I hold myself onto a step, I tried to smoke a cig but I couldn't. It's just nothing makes me happy as it used to, I bought some rare book and I just wanted to burn it, I don't know why. I become really violent to random people while I don't hurt anyone physically...with my unstable state it could happen any time. I'm not scared for me. I have to protect people from me. I need to die. I almost died on caffeine poisoning. I want to find some method with no way back. I plan to hang my self this winter. Bought some sturdy rope, pray to god this shit doesn't break and leave me a vegetable state. I'm a coward scared of pain but it's what I deserve, to go with pain. I'm so sorry to all hate and rudeness I caused, to how many people I used without even realising it. I'm not a sufferer, I'm an idiot and I'm so sorry I hurt people in my life.

I'm sorry for all the hurt I caused to my family. They deserved better"
839,1,"I've started being treated for depression a year ago. Since, I am medicated and I've had the luxury to be supported by 3 therapists (in different fields).

Now, I can say I am doing better. I went for planning my suicide and thinking not stop about killing myself to living mostly in a ""neutral"" way (no more pain, but not super happy neither).

However, I still have those ""crisis"" or ""meltdown"" moments were I fall apart. During those episodes I can hurt myself and be on the verge of killing myself (today - and I feel so ridiculous just mentionning it because it's so laughable - I tried to strangle myself).
Before and after those episodes, I am ok.

I think there are two kind of triggers: one that is more related to being overwhelmed/on the verge of burn out; one that is more related to the reasons of my depression and/of sad things happening within a short period.

Do you have those? How do you deal with it?"
840,1,"Freshly off a thrawted attempt. Got to the spot and lost my nerves. Fiancee called police Yada Yada. Fast forward 3 weeks and I drive by the spot and I just feel worthless. I wish it was easier, I read stories of those who pull it off with envy. Im just over living"
841,1,You know what I hate when people are suicidal and people say what about you’re family think about how sad and hurt their gonna be like I’m not hurt now like fuck not even my own suicide can be about just me? Why even to my end people make it about other people as if I’m not sitting here in-front of you struggling.and then the hypocrites that come to you’re funeral saying nice things like fuck completely off I was here and you couldn’t even pick up the phone and tell me how much I matter but all of a sudden I was “a good person” yeah fucking right 
842,1,"My problems are unsolvable. There's nothing that i can do. To stop this endless cycle of suffering i need escape this vessel called my body. Any hopes i had ran out. I dont know anymore what can i do. I dont even want people help me, because i know they cant do this. I explored many options and i came with this conclusion. My life isnt mine, and this body isnt me. I dont know what happens after you die, it can be nothing, maybe thats good then. This life wasnt fun, was very pointless indeed. I suffer so much yet i find it so difficult to find courage to help myself and finally take this pain away. Can anyone give me tip how to end it and not suffer much while doing it?"
843,1,"so i was thinking about it lately. if you are going to commit it, why tell others?it does not really make sense. do you want to be comfronted or what?If you really dont have anything left in life, you would just do it silently and not post on media about it. but if you post or talk about it , it means you still have hope deep within .slight but its still there."
844,1,"Hi, this probably isn’t the best rant ever, I’m new to talking to people so please excuse me as I might fumble over words or stuff like that, I’m a sixteen year old boy. Im thinking of killing myself tonight as I see no point in living a life that I’ve fucked up for myself. I feel as if I’ve ruined my future and I should just end it now instead of living through the hell. How funny trying to avoid the consequences of my own actions. During my short life I lost a girl I loved to drunk driving, on my birthday. I lost a relation ship a couple months after the date. I started to like another girl and I found out she liked me back. But she also likes someone else, a girl I don’t have a problem with that but it hurts, because I know I don’t stand a chance. I grow attached and obsessive way to easily. I find myself crying over things that anyone else would’ve been completely fine with, im weak and pathetic as a person, I stopped showing up to school, missed a bunch of work and now im at the bottom of my classes. Im in the MC class (Multi-Categorical support classes) and im still failing. im so socially anxious that I can’t even go in public without wanting to cry and hide, I truly am pathetic. I hate physical contact but in touch starved. When I finally did hug a girl (the girl who likes me and I like back) I finally felt safe for once in my life, but I know I’ll never have a chance. I can’t sleep without bawling my eyes out or else my body just won’t let me until I pass out, I know that I have no right to complain. Everyone else here has been through so much more then me I just thought I’d try and find a safe space, thank you for reading this, if this isn’t the right place to post this on. I’m sorry I really am, let me know and I’ll take this down. I don’t wish to step on anyone’s toes"
845,1,"exactly what the title says, I tell them(family) that I feel bad mental health coming and I need support. They seem to purposely make things worse by doing things similar to reactive abuse. It’s like these people don’t even care about themselves so when someone else is struggling they make them feel worse so they feel better about themselves? Why do I have to be here? I’m tired. This up and down cycle of feeling supported then disrespected and then torn down is leaving me a shell of myself. I usually manage myself pretty well but when I ask for support and get the opposite it’s like they want me to go into crisis because then once I’m hurting myself and drained, then they act like they care and love me. I’m not trying to be like this, I’ve actually made so much progress but they always crush me. This isn’t love. This is hell. I’ve already survived multiple attempts. At this point I rather be alone forever but that isn’t possible. I can’t support myself. I haven’t worked in over 5 years because of him. I have lost all contact with the outside world and have nobody to go to. My family wants me to be dead already and I don’t feel safe talking to anyone. I tried to get government help and he somehow ruined that opportunity. I reach out and there’s literally nothing to grab there’s no one and there’s no money and no compassion. There’s not even space to be left alone. I hate myself and I hate my adoptive family for not wanting me to be happy. My biological mother should have aborted me like she told me she did with her second pregnancy. I hate myself because I chose to be with someone who is sucking my soul. I asked my adoptive mother for help like 4 years ago and she told me to change for him even he was cheating on me. I’m so stupid and I’m scared. Im scared he’s going to call the police on me. Im scared of whats the next thing thats going to hinder my self worth. I never wanted to get out of here so bad but i cant. I hate being female with no support idk what to do idk who to call i guess what i do now is my decision. It’s been overdue im reqdy to leave this planet i think im at peace knowing i dont have anyone to write a goodbye letter to. I don’t have the courage to do it myself but I do have the courage to write this and I asked God to take me out when it’s time. 
"
846,1,"I’ve been suicidal since I was 12, never had the balls to do it. I’ve thought about it probably every day for about 7 years now. I’m going to get up at 8am EST later and decide whether Im going to finally blow my head off. I figure before I do I might as well get some bitching done. Grew up dirt poor with a single mother and 3 other siblings. Never knew my father, mainly my mom’s decision but he never tried to come back around anyway. Mom stopped giving a fuck about parenting and in turn me. I believe I’m experiencing a pretty severe undiagnosed mental illness. I have rapid mood swings. I go from being euphorically happy to wanting to get life over with like that. Can’t experience joy, even when Im doing things I once liked I feel indifferent. True human connection feels impossible and alien. Everybody always goes away. I’m very religious and I always believed everything happens for a reason but anymore I just don’t have the stomach for it. Maybe me killing myself will help someone else be slightly less of a loser but thats being optimistic. I basically have nothing to live for. If you’re reading this you’re probably an alright person and I hope the best for you. Life truly can be beautiful but sometimes you’re not so lucky but sometimes you’ve got to know when to say goodnight. "
847,1,"Been trying to make up my mind for a couple years, been trying to fight through it, long story short my best friend told me she was tired of it and to make a decision and just do it so I am, I have everything I need to do it now just gotta wait for the right time then I’ll finally be free, to be clear it’s not her fault in anyway this was unavoidable just better sooner then later "
848,1,"nobody needs to respond or give advice, i just wanna drop my thoughts out into the universe:  
i'm struggling with mental illness for quite some time now and i made some progress but also had some severe setbacks. i went to therapy for 3 years and that was great. but now, one year after, i'm back to the same old problems and might as well even worse because ""even though i've tried, i've failed"" and that's horrible to me. i'm depressed and anxious a lot, i am stressed because of my job but since i'm working in the theater business, i can't really get sick or take my days off when i need to. i quit that job but am contractly bound until the end of july. i'll get through that - i have done so for the past years. but i'm just so fcking tired of everything. of the people around me, my job, my flat, myself. i am also chronically ill, apparently and struggle with my stomach/digestion. yeah, probably the psyche and the organs kind of badly balance each other. and to be honest: i just wish it all gets so bad that i die. cause i'm not strong enough to end this fcking hell myself. i know it's not fair compared to people who've lost (relatives/friends/their own) battles against diseases. but sometimes i just ask the universe to end my suffering in order to provide strength for someone else and secure their lives. i want people around me to be happy and i want the world to be a better place. but all of that is such a huge weight because i can't really influence that. not constantly. not with the little power i need to get up and function. i'm just tired of it all. and i don't feel like it'd be a loss. it's just another little stone in the pond. it doesn't matter if i'm here or not.

then again, it does matter to me since i don't wanna bear all that pain inside of me anymore. i just wish i don't wake up again tomorrow. and i pray that it'll be a quick, relatively painless death of mine. i don't see a future anywhere for myself. and i can't continue pretending it's okay that i'm not okay. and i can't bear hear people saying ""just pull through for some more time, it'll be over. you need therapy. and then it's gonna be great. you just need to learn to love yourself. it's gonna be okay""   
even if they say i love you at the end of that - it doesn't matter to me. i don't feel love. i can't feel love. all i feel is self hatred, anxiety and pain. anger, every now and then. that soon enough also turns into a hopeless wish for death. 

i don't wanna do this any longer. 

but i just needed to get this off my chest. put it somewhere. cause i don't wanna annoy my friends and family and hear all those same motivational quotes again. i just wanna go."
849,1,I’m leaving today I can’t cope with every that’s going on I got raped which resulted in me falling pregnant and now everyone blaming me saying I chose this even tho it was forced I genuinely can’t cope I’ve been having flashbacks and panic attacks daily and at this time when I neee someone no one’s ever there I give up I can’t anymore I just wish I had someone to talk to 
850,1,"I have gone to therapy for years, i am on medication

i try to fucking think postively or whatever but i just cant

no matter how much beauty in the world there is i still hate it here

i dont care that there are good and bad in thw world i just want to fucking die

what if i was meant to die, thats why i feel so fucking horrible everyday.

I have been in agony my entire life, i have been wanting to die since i was in elementary school. i want to give up. i want to. i cant keep on going. i dont care if there are good things in the world, its not enough. not enough to stay living."
851,1,"A superficial shallow and a dehumanizing family, guilt tripped childhood, meaningless adolescence and beyond unreasonable adulthood. I’m not sad, crying is a chore I’m bored alone mostly lost but I absolutely have nothing to do with being a person everyday gives me less than the day before. Even venting just wastes my energy and I end up feeling so dull after. What a shameful thing to be ashamed of being alive. "
852,1,"It's finally the day, and I'm just lifeless, can't stretch it more. Can you all just pray for me that my soul rest in peace.
Please don't end up like me too "
853,1,"honestly i cant remember the last time i wanted to actually live. its been 6 long years, going on 7, of this thought. this want, this need, to leave. i want to die. i havent found out how yet, but i want to, i dream of it essentially.

my life is normal, and yet, i feel nothing but wanting to leave it all behind. i always hear; ""well you know theres terminally ill people who would love being in your place?"" if i could give it to them, i fucking would in a heartbeat. they want to live, they deserve this more than me.

ive accomplished nothing, i strive towards nothing, i am nothing. i cant even keep up with my schoolwork. im falling behind more and more and im just waiting until i finally crumble. ive been glued back together too many times, holding on for too long. everything ive tried is in vain.

ill always never be enough. ill never make it to what they want of me. ill never be able to live fully if i always think of dying. my brain is ready, but my body isnt. im waiting until the day where i can finally rest, in a pot of ashes and tossed into some mud puddle to dissolve.

ill miss some things, like my cat. i love my cat even if shes annoying sometimes. ill miss my bed, i like sleeping in this bed, its so comfortable. and i guess ill just miss this, but i know past this is painless. theres no feeling, no pain, no sadness. my eternity to which im doomed."
854,1,Does anyone ever feel like they just want to disappear? I don’t necessarily want to die I just want to go away. 
855,1,"are you serious? is there that deep of a backlog in a subreddit that an obvious cry for recognition isnt posted? what about 430+ views with no responses, asking if anybody related in what's supposed to be a compulsive skinpicking support group? does it really remain that irrelevant to everybody no matter what? fuck, nobody batted an eye when i first attempted, so maybe i'll have to really go through with it. im not usually incredibly attention-seeking, but the more depressed and lonely i get and the more ignored i feel by everything, i think i'm getting pushed over that edge."
856,1,"Being human is too complicated, like why am I now mentally different or whatever? Now when someone tells me about their feelings or life, I just automatically say something robotic like ""it's okay to feel like that"" or blah blah blah, I don't even feel any emotions during those kinds of things, I don't remember being like this but then again, I don't remember a lot of things. Also, I say and do things I used to, I still support causes and other things but it's more because that's what I've always done rather than sympathy. Another thing, when my mother used to get angry or whatever, I'd shout back and get angry/sad/upset but now I just don't feel anything usually and just stay quiet and go on with life like it never happened to begin with. I also feel like I can't love, it's more like I care about my family and my pets, I'm unable to love other people like friends or partners (I've never really been good in relationships). It feels like my feelings are slowly slipping out of my grasp and it's so annoying, why can't humans be less complicated? Why do I feel like this, I just want to feel human. "
857,1,Idk I'm using this to shout into the void about wanting to be gone from this bs. I hate being mentally ill. I hate being high functioning. Life is colorless. So much has happened. So much will keep happening. Seeing the men who m0l3sted your best friends walk free....your rapist walk free(not the same men/man)....see the man who raped ur friend and left handprints on her walk free...I can't trust anyone. No one is who they say they are. We all have skeletons but some are most disgusting than others. All bc they're free doesn't mean they're a safe person to be around. I'm tired of living knowing these men walk free and every potential love interest could be one. They mask very well. I think...a little after fathers day I'll take all my medicines at once. there's a lot more reasons I want to just...be done with it all. Thanks whoever read this.

I wish I could be like those girls who don't seem to have a worry in the world, talking and laughing with their friends. I wish I had friends, I wish I wasn't a loner and a freak. I don't want to go through life anymore, I had a breakdown last night and I'm trying not to harm myself or drunk drive and slam into a concrete barrier as fast as my piece of shit car will go but its so hard not to.

I just want to live with the love of my life. I've had chronic suicide ideation since I was about 10 or so, and the thoughts never really bothered me until now. I used to just be held back by my anxiety about going through with it, but now whenever I have these thoughts - which have gotten more intense lately due to the state of the world - I get incredibly distressed due to... Actually having something I *want*. 

I'm not entirely sure why I'm posting this thought dump, honestly. I think I just need to scream into the void a bit. I apologize for the messy grammar and formatting, I'm sort of in the middle of an episode. I just want to die, but I also don't want to die. Why is my brain like this..."
861,1,"Im turning 17 next month snd this has been my worst year probably. I lost all my friends, got rejected by another group I thought I was a part of. Stopped going to school for a bit. I just want it all to end. My mom is emotionally abusive and I can’t stop self harming. I just want help but I don’t know how. I was supposed to have gotten a therapist but they haven’t responded for months. I don’t want to feel like this anymore, im so tired. It’s been going on since I was 10"
862,1,"Ashamed of myself and crying as I'm typing this, but I had everything ready and it was finally the day I was going to commit but I failed to get it over with.

Idk what to do I'm so lost "
863,1,"It has been… idk how long I don’t remember much from day to day if anything.. but today has been horrible. 

Last night I started to feel a heavy weight of depression and anxiety. I hoped it was going to pass (it did not) and today has been the worst ever. 

I’ve never wanted to not be here more than ever. I have no friends. Family who uses me as an in-home maid, and no one who genuinely cares. 

I try to get help. I’m in so many different medications and I am in therapy but I do t know if I can do this anymore. 

I want to move but have no money to do so 
I have no job because of my mental health issues 
I have lost all interest in any hobby I have had. 

I want to just never wake up. I want to be at peace, not in constant pain and suffering I am in daily.
I’m so sorry I’m rambling.

I always wanted to help others, but no one ever helps me. I don’t know how to be helped. I don’t remember anything anymore and I don’t even know what day it is. I just… I can’t anymore "
864,1,"When I had to move back with my (abusive) parents, I told myself that it wouldn't be that long, that I would be able to leave in no time. 7 months later and no luck. No job. No way to escape without defaulting to dying in some way.

During the trip when they were helping me move, my mom sexually molested me again and my dad punished me for needing help moving by trying to crash our car on the highway.

My dad keeps yelling screaming at me for trying to fix our front door. Today, my mom told me that were going on a vacation and tried to bash my head on my bedframe because I told her I'll stay home. (I am an adult btw. A wheelchair user but an adult nonetheless).

I just want this to end. Nothing is ever going to get better. No one is ever going to love me. The nothingness of death is the best thing I can look forward to"

868,1,I feel numb and lost
869,1,"trigger warning: a lot of blaming and self victimizing

Seeing progress of people and their family around me while they happily were the big cause of my mothers death and all the aspiration that i had w my life and us as a family. 

My dad who is good in heart bit hell toxic as a parent was at least under control w my mother around but since its been five years w her gone, he made sure to not to let me advance in life with his toxicity. i blame his parents and him. 

and these people who were my mother’s sibling knew it. they knew how my life would be toppled if my mother wouldnt be in the picture yet they put us in a position of vulnerability. her two sisters, and their family who were living quite comfortably rather i would say luxury considering it was covid, and yet they put themselves put as the innocent beaver to anyone who questioned of their involvement. what infuriates me is that I who lost her mother don’t present myself as weak, vulnerable even though everyday i struggle cry in my room alone and these people present themselves shabby, as if they are grievingn my mother more than me or my dad. their children are going ahead w life and yet these people have the audacity to present themselves as not financially strong. Their children are having all the expensive devices, shoes, fucking renting apartment in the society which requires good money, go in a private university, travel, and me? I have to fucking think for 30 days, mull, just to buy myself a shirt that would cost less than a dollar. I havent shopped from a brand on my own since my mother left this world. i can’t even think of pursuing my education because that requires tution. and if its about working, the toxicity my dad present to me everyday is enough for me to recognise that am there to struggle in this life.

you know every now and then i question why life is so cruel to me. this god or this life fucking picks! picks on who should get the chance to taste water and who should get the whole exptic cheese playter w a daily subscription. i even went down to the path of perhaps my life chart vedic/fortune telling/numerology/saju would tell or at least give this poor human a decency to share on hope for the coming future. My purpose to live since my mothers day to here was that hope. But then i see all the people who did my mother wrong, me wrong, my family wrong leading enjoying fucking even giving their 2 cents on how to live life to me ,putting down continuing to do it in those politically correct tone, or sometimes even slashing w the thought to offer an embarrassment on me or my family, lead such swift life. you know what i call life as swift? the one where you have support. the one where i could have had one and i would have grown so beautifully. but this fucking life god chooses/picks. And its defineitly unfair, because theres no value of my tears, heart break, saddness, being a victim and no value of causing misery to someones life, causing harm to someones life, cruel, murdering someones life (metaphorically in my case). there no value of the latter too. 

somedays i think that this is what my destiny is. to live like parentless as the other parent who is the greatest uncle, brother, friend, fellow human but sucks at one job that is father. To live under the advancements and success of bad peoples life  who are racist, murdered lives pf others (metaphorically), classist, liars, manipulators, enjoy making others life troublesome w their sly tactics, chauvinists. But, let me tell this god or life that i didnt deserve to be here. i did not deserve to witness it. and even if my mother had to go in this life, the least i could witness was those people downfall, those hypocrites falling because they hurt someone’s heart terribly so its not just the cost of life but also someones future. think about it, their children are enjoying their career, marrige, making their babies w their parents around. while me? still stuck going through worse than losing a parent. so i deserved that at least but what did this life god gave me? witnessing them leading and seeing me falling.

I must have done something really really really bad in my life. But if i didn’t which i k i did not and i can put my heart out as i know myself very well, then this life god did a really big blunder on me."

871,1,"Since I'm fired from a job that I hate and abused , I am struggling to find a full time job and myself. 

Struggling to work partimes and college. I survived college but I have four classes to go. The part time jobs help me my financial stability a bit. However,  I need to find a job before thr end of the month.

This situation  expose something about myself: poor, lonely, hatred.

I hate my previous job. I was laugh at by others and my manager used me to work task that other people will not.  However, it did gave me financial stability.  It help me get me back to college

Now...

I just getting a breaking point. I'm might lose the  home.  I was FORCED to pay an as if house. The house needs repairs. I did not chose this house. My mother use her last money to pay down the house. She use my credit. 



I'm tired of arguing toward  my disable mother.  She does not appreciate my struggles and my saracfice.  I pay more bills and support her more than the rest of the family. Where is my gold medal???!!! None . Zero. Nobody cares

I have no friends.  No friend since what forever.  I have to fight myself through my life. I never connect to people nor share my struggles. Either they don't care nor I don't understand them.

No family since they are non existence.  Long story cannot share from this post. I have a dysfunctional family with drama and stuff. I am alone with my mother.

Yeah, I'm 36 years old and I'm too old for complaining.  You are right and wrong.  I have no one. No one to share nor care. I don't have a boyfriend.

I never do drugs nor party. I work hard since 19 years old to help my mother after the child support checks are gone.

I work and work and this is my end. Might as well I end this . I'm tired and I hate myself. "
872,1,"this might not even be the right place for this, but the vent subreddit has a rule against mentions of suicide, so i thought it was better safe than sorry. i dont use this account anyway. 

i know i may sound silly because of how young i am, but what i feel doesnt feel silly to me and i have to get it off my chest. im 18, i graduated high school recently, and i feel so behind. i know, typical for an 18 year old to say. but all my peers have/had jobs, know how to drive, have a car, and are planning to go to college in a couple months. i have none of that, and i'd be lying if it didnt make me hate myself a bit. i feel like i shouldnt waste my time writing this and i should be using this energy to get a job and learn how to drive, but honestly, it all makes me think of suicide. dramatic? probably. i dont really care. it is how i feel. i dont see a future for myself. no matter what path i go down, i dont see myself ever being fulfilled, and i feel like im destined to kill myself. i feel no motivation to get my life together because i feel so sure i am just going to kill myself anyway. i have a partner, supportive friends, some money to my name, and i realize i have a lot of reasons to keep going and get my shit together. but i just dont have any drive to. i dont WANT any of this. i know what i want, and its to not have to worry about another day waking up. i feel like im broken, i dont know why i dont strive for independence. i feel pathetic. i try to refrain from using ""i am"" statements, but i keep telling myself i am pathetic. i feel useless, hopeless, and somehow helpless despite knowing im not. i am just so confused and i dont want to feel this way. i just want to be normal. i think of suicide every day, and every day, it feels more and more like the right decision.

874,1,"Second post here. 
I talked to my psychologist and she said she thinks I should have better support from a therapist I can meet in person (last years have been online since I moved from my city for college). I don't want another therapist, I don't think I can handle the change.

I went to my psychiatrist appointment, new meds, again. I asked him if he could register me in a national program to get those meds for a cheaper price. Waiting for his response, but if it's a yes, I have to go another psychiatrist. Another change
change

I told both how I feel I am at my last point. Both said it will get better. 
I have to pay for another med, and possibly another therapist, my mom will have to spend even more money on me. 

Everyone keeps saying the same thing, that it will get better. I don't have the mind to wait, I can't handle the pain much longer. Why can't the world just stop for a few hours? Just so I can breath a little. I have to finish my uni semester, but I can barely stand from my bed to go to class. I can't delay my tests anymore. When I get done with this semester, how am I supposed to do the next one? I am so alone at school, I don't know how to make friends. I swear I am not the ""everyone leaves me"" type of girl, I just don't know how to socialize. 

I want friends, I want to be happy, I want to keep going, I want to stop being a financial issue. 

I found out my grandma's grave has place for 3 people. Both of my grandparents are there, they could bury me with them and wouldn't have to spend money on a spot on the cemetery or turning my body into ashes. Maybe that can work out"

Every part of my body hurts. I have no life anymore. Every day is just suffering and suffering. I stopped having friends. My partner is leaving for med school abroad, we haven't been able to see each other since April anyway. 


The pain. It's eating me alive. Nothing helps. I just want tramadol, sleep and a caregiver. The pain is unbearable. It's like permanent severe covid. The pain is bad tonight. I can't feed myself meals or do my laundry or my dishes. 


The pain chips away at your sanity like termines in your bones. Like bedbugs in your brain. It makes everything lose meaning. Like a great, black hole, it absorbs everything in the end. If I have to live like this, within five years I will be clinically insane if I'm even alive. I didn't think chronic pain could make you genuinely lose your sanity. But oh it does. It really fucking does. If this is what Luigi Mangione lives with too, then he should plead on grounds of insanity. It's like CIA torture. You go fucking batshit crazy. Nothing has meaning anymore. Nothing means anything. Just pain. "

They're religious and the concept of suicide is seen as a sin. I can't believe that the only time my family will ever bring me flowers is when I finally die.

I want it to end right there and then cuz i’m stuck in a loop of WHAT AM I DOING AND WHAT CAN I DO? 

i get up everyday and spend 3 hours trying to figure out what i am going to do in the next 5 fucking minutes. it’s like my mind doesn’t work at all. and when i’m going to go do something or think of something, BOOM it’s gone out of my mind and i can’t remember a fucking thing i’ve done hours before.

It's just all too much for me now and I have no desire to go on, usually whenever Im suicidal it's fleeting. And the next day I'm fine, but this is different it's almost been a month. And I keep trying to find things to make me keep going, but it's been so long now I'm actually considering it. I'm too scared to do something painful, but it's better than living like this. I was thinking of going to the hospital but, I'm just going to try again after I get out most likely. There is so much I still want to do, I want to date I want to get a job. I want to move far away from where I am, even if I do get to that point. I am just going to scare people away. With all my problems, and it is just not worth it anymore. I really thought I was getting better, I have never felt like this before. I'm so lost and I feel like this is my only option, but I won't regret it when I'm dead. I won't feel, I won't know. I won't even know I'm dead. So I'm not really losing anything, I don't know when, don't know how but I'm probably gonna end up killing myself, even years from now. That is just how I'll die.

896,1,The hardest part about suicide is how badly I want the courage and executive function to complete it. People act like suicide is so horrible because it scares them. People try to villainize suicide when its actually kinda good for others . Population control. One less mouth to feed. One less person to fight for toilet paper.And people misunderstand thinking the person who committed suicide probably hated themselves but I would kill myself out of necessity. I love myself but I cannot survive in these conditions. That being said I am still too scared and frankly tired to follow through. This society is cruel by design and it has been made very obvious in these recent years. This is a cold and unfeeling place. Anyone else stuck in this in between state? I guess this would be passively suicidal. I used to have a gun and i would load it and hold it in my mouth and lightly rest my finger on the trigger and every time I chickened out that felt the worst. Worse than being suicidal in the first place.
897,1,"Sorry, i’m not good at this type of stuff.

Anyways.

So a year ago, i got in this situation with a girl and it fucked me up big time. but ever since that day/week whatever how long it was, i’ve never felt like myself anymore. about two weeks ago i made a plan that, when i get my life all back together and straighten i would jump off a high building. i’ve been trying to pursue myself to not do it in the future but i can’t seem to. 

i got a everything to live for, family, money, goals, i even got a girlfriend. i really don’t want them to see me after it happens. 

I been on reddit for a little bit now and all i have been using it for is to look at other people suicide problems to pursue myself to not kms. 

i’ve gotten help and i’ve talked to a lot of people bout this but nothing has seem to help out the situation at all. i really don’t want to leave my family and girlfriend but i don’t want to live no more.

899,1,"I think the whole world would be better off if I wasn't in it anymore. I feel like such a huge piece of shit that my family would be better off i just died and they got the life insurance money. That's what I'm best at. Right?? Paycheck with tits?? Doesn't matter how badly I'm struggling with my depression and SI, I've been the problem the past 2 weeks and husband is done. I'm done. I don't want to be alive anymore. I should've died as a child. "
900,1,"
I’m not trying to endorse suicide and don’t know why a lot here do but I felt so sad and wanted to end my life since I was 9 years old and did my first attempt at this age (looking back it was weirdly funny) and it became so severe for the last couple of years, I didn’t attempt but I had a plan in mind and contemplated the idea
I figured out I don’t wanna live and can’t get meaning out of anything in life, I not an expert in anything can’t play the guitar neither do I have any skills, don’t provide any value for anyone and I don’t have any friends (since I was a child) 

But it’s not so severe that I wanna end my life right now but my life is miserable and it’s worse than death anyway, it’s like death by a thousand cuts not a single stab

The one rule for me was ‘You can always do it tomorrow’ which is hilarious because each time I wanted to end it I just eat and say that I can always do it tomorrow, and I always get the idea that I’m increasing the suffering for my family by just existing and that everything will get better if I stop existing, and Idea that all potential is gone and suicide is the only option is also complete nonsense and easily refuted by logic because: younger age(more time) = more potential, I can’t be convinced by that even if I’m crying and super depressed it’s just logic, but at the same time I have a lot of problems in life so that puts me in a weird place 

I also realized that when I commit suicide I won’t just end my pain but I’ll transfer it to everyone close to me (which is opposite of what people think, if you stop existing life won’t magically become better) and that’s one of the reasons I still exist, Even if I’m making life more painful by existing, it will increase the suffering in the world if I stop existing but I just won’t care I’d just be dead, can’t stop thinking about that and it’s painfully true, if that’s the case why am I even still alive? 

The question I can’t find answers to, Why would I care if I won’t be around to feel it?

Maybe I shouldn’t, but I can always do it tomorrow right?"
901,1,"You sure care an awful lot about my physical well-being, but emotionally and mentally I might as well be a dog to you. Thanks dad. Happy father's day. Maybe for your birthday I'll finally stop being a coward and end it for good. No longer your burden."
902,1,"I feel so dumb and naive every time I try to keep going and everything around me just proves me how stupid I am to believe things could ever get better. I try to fight and things turn up so much worse than they previously were. I feel guilty that I want to stop trying, I do not want my parents to find me dead. I don't want them to go through this but I cannot keep living like this anymore. I begged for help for years but I was never enough for someone to help me. I'll die wishing I was important enough for someone to just be there for me"
903,1,nothing even happened all im doing these days is playing on my phone and talking with friends im not even sad im just suicidal for no reason i made another suicide note i feel so lousy and sleepy even though my sleep was pretty good
904,1,"I have everything prepared for that time. I don't understand why I still act like life matters. I have the pills, the rope, everything I need in case my previous attempts fail. My last attempts have failed already, and I refuse to let god save me this time. I'll do whatever it takes to burn in hell, which is where a dirty soul like me belongs. I'm already too far gone and there's nothing anyone can do about it. Fuck writing notes, fuck everything. I wish I could just let go, but despite accepting my fate, I still hold on to those I care about. Why? I must die. I must die alone. Nobody can save me. I'm counting the days and I have exactly 7 months and 18 days left. I can't wait guys. I can't wait to finally atone for my actions and suffer :)"
905,1,"My boyfriend and I were terribly traumatized by a ""friend"" and instead of silently leaving our life she twisted some narrative (brought on by her friends that didn't like us) and said some awful shit to us. Then left. 

This ruined us for people it seemed. Since then my boyfriend and I have not made friends. I want to though. I want to make a discord server or something and have people join and socialize but my boyfriend won't. He won't be apart of it, he won't socialize and whenever I try to get him to he gets mad at me and then vents that he has no friends. 

It's getting me down man. It's making me feel hopeless. 

And I told him this and instead of comforting me he got more mad at me and basically said ""imagine how I feel"" 

I feel unloved and unwanted by everyone around me and I have no one to tell it to. I feel like I'd be better off dead. Every chance I get alone I cry and I feel fucking pathetic even coming here because everyone here has real problems and mine is just ""I'm lonely and unwanted so I want to kill myself"" which makes me more suicidal lol 

I don't have a plan but if I did, id want it quick and clean. I don't want my boyfriend finding a mess. I don't want him more traumatized than he already is. 

But maybe I shouldn't do it because if I do , he'd follow me and I don't want that for him. I feel lost. "
906,1,"Hello everyone I you guys are doing good this is a short one. 

So bottom line I really want to end it once and for all which is usual but it has been different this time. I have begun making a small plan on how I would go about doing it. Ive never gotten to this point before so this situation is very overwhelming. 

Any advice let me know. Gn "
907,1,"I don't think he's actually slept with anyone else (not sure on this last one), but I've caught him well om his way at least 5 times. I have fucking lost count. He's always deeply apologetic,  cries, says it was all talk and he would've never gone through with it and will never do it again, and like a dumbass bitch I believe him every time. We have 2 kids-one 2.5 years, one almost 6. We could never afford a divorce or to live separately. My mother would never forgive me if I got divorced. So, here, I am stuck. 

The last woman he almost slept with is someone we both work with. I have to see her every fucking day. Oh and she's like 15 years older than him, what the fuck? How humiliating for me. 

Why does he keep doing this to me? No, I didn't let myself go after having kids-I snapped back each time (genetics, not my own doing-I am almost 6 ft tall and 135 lbs, not too bad in my opinion). No, we don't have a dead bedroom. Yes-less sex than we used to-but we have 2 young kids and both work full time. Neither kid slept through the night until after their 2nd birthday. But we still had sex at least once a week, which isn't a ton, but I feel like should be enough to stop a man from attempting to hump anything available. 

He says he's sorry, but his actions say otherwise obviously. I haven't spoken to him in like 4 days outside of kid related things and he doesn't even care. I've been in the bedroom crying all day today, 0 fucks given. My kids don't even miss me because he's the fun one. The only thing I'm good for is everyday life coordinating/planning/bill paying/etc and cleaning up after everyone (he's a fucking slob, and will only realize how much I do for him when I'm dead).

This is a bullshit life. I'm done. I can't bear to physically leave my kids, even though they're better off without me. So, only one option remains ✌🏻. The selfish one. "
908,1,"Ok so obviously beforehand, I get that leaning on alcohol as a form of ""medication"" is very bad and leads to substance abuse etc. 

For some background information, I am 18 years old and have been suicidal every day for about 8 months now. I struggle having any emotional bonds to people, even my parents. Its not that they're bad people, I just can't really love them or be close to them and I'm not sure why I'm like this. Anyways, last year I lost the only person I have ever loved, and I'm still not really sure why. All I've ever gotten are some BS reasons (which they have since contradicted so :P). And I have taken it very hard: their betrayal, lying and manipulation ultimately culminating in where I am today. I try not to blame them for my problems but, at the same time, its hard (for me) not to. 

Anyways, since the start of the year, I have attempted (somewhat halfheartedly) to take my own life on a few separate occasions. ""Halfheartedly"" mostly because I think, deep down, I understand I dont wish for death but rather just not to be alive with this pain - that its just too unbearable (if that makes sense, I understand its not the clearest). I just dont even remember the last day I was happy, it would have to have been, at least, last year sometime. Now I spend my days depressed, wallowing and crying like a child, however embarassing that is to admit. But that is besides the point of this post.

Onto the title of the post, that alcohol has saved my life. Just over an hour ago, I was once again crying with a blade to my wrists, intent on finally ending the insurmountable sorrow, when I remembered I still have the remainder of a bottle of vodka from the night before (I was binge drinking but still had about 1/5 left). Now usually alcohol makes me more sad and suicidal, but since I was already at that point, I just said fuck it and decided to drink some. My logic was fairly simple: either it will make me feel better, or help numb the pain of an attempt a little. And well what do you know? 50g later and the knife is back in its sheath, and I've abandoned doing any kind of attempt tonight. And this is not the first time it has saved me in a similar fashion. My very unscientific hypothesis is such; drinking when I'm feeling normal, everyday levels of depression is a bad idea and will make it worse; but drinking when I am already terribly depressed and suicidal seems to move me a safe distance away from that edge. 

Obviously, guys, do not abuse alcohol, it can lead to lifelong, crippling addictions that ultimately leave you more miserable than you started. You WILL lose money, relationships, self-respect, the respect of others and ultimately damage your health. DO NOT take this as a sign to start drinking, you will only hurt yourself and everything you care about. That said, I am just intrigued as to people's thoughts on this matter. 

Perhaps this is not the right sub for this, but I hope everyone is having a nice night/evening/morning/day and please stay safe :)"
909,1,"I don’t really know what I want from posting this. I guess I just need to feel like someone hears me before I go through with it.

My boyfriend (we’ll call him James) got deployed a little while ago. He’s in the Navy. Before he left, things were good. We got together kind of fast during the talking stage. People might roll their eyes at that or say it was rushed, but it didn’t feel that way to us. It felt natural. 

I love him so much. Every little thing about him. The way he talks. How respectful and caring he is. Even the dumb little jokes he tells. 

But ever since he left, it’s like I don’t know who I am anymore. It’s not even that I miss him, I mean I do, it just feels like I lost me. I wasn't really dependent on him , and I’m not trying to be that girl who falls apart over a guy, but I can’t picture a version of my life where he’s not in it. I can’t see that version of my life.

I text him good morning every single day, even though I know he won’t see it. Just because it makes me feel like we’re still connected somehow. He sent me one email, a while ago. I didn’t get it until a week later. I answered. I poured my heart into it. But he hasn’t replied since. It’s been weeks. And that silence has been eating me alive.

I don’t really have anyone else. Like people are around, but no one who really gets me like James does. No one who makes me feel like I’m not a burden just for existing. James made me feel like I was someone worth staying for.

So… I made a plan. When he comes home, I just want one perfect day. Just us. Just him and me. I want to laugh with him, hold him, soak up every single second like it’s the last page of a book. And then when he falls asleep that night... that’ll be it for me. I’ll be gone.

I don’t expect people to understand. Hell, half of me doesn’t even understand. I just know this ache has been building and building and I don’t see a way out of it anymore. I don’t want to ruin his life with my sadness. I just want to give him one last good day. One last memory.

Advice is welcome, and I'll gladly answer any questions if I'm still here, but I don't expect myself to make it out of this hole. I’m just tired. 

Babe, for some reason if you read this and figure out it's you… thank you. For everything, I love you so much."
910,1,"Is it selfish to want someone to care? Is it selfish to drop my issues on someone else, even when they can't help? Is it selfish that I don't have any energy or empathy to help anyone else? Is it selfish to want someone to ask how my day is going, and not have to worry about talking about myself too much? Is it selfish of me to think about myself?

I've experienced both and I'd rather be terribly depressed than have terrible anxiety (not that either are pleasent), the anxiety is so bad it's causing intense stomach aches, it leaves me feeling very literally 'worried sick' hours after the original emotional feelings of anxiety are gone, prolonging that dread even more. 

 I think about my pets who don't know anything about the world and they're able to be happy.
I wouldn't wish being human on any of them.  I wish my human loved ones didn't have to be human.

917,1,"For months i have been feeling suicidal. I told my wife and thought maybe there would be some support. I told her this in early March. Just one month ago I found out she has been cheating on me since late January. It has been so hard to live with this. To know that she never officially ended it with him. To know she sat and waited till I left him to talk with him. She was able to stare me in the face every day and not even bat an eye. Our 12 year anniversary, two of our kids birthdays. All of these things didn't stop her. I broke my two year sobriety and havent looked back. I can't stop thinking about it. How I'm such a loser that she could do this. To know how I was mentally and not give a fuck. I'm so tired. I think about dying constantly. I think of how and when I should do it. Would I leave a letter for my kids. I can't take these thoughts anymore. I was already less of a man before knowing this. Now I'm absolutely nothing. "

My mom and sister have been my only reason to stay alive the last decade but recently my depression has taken a turn for the worst. I haven’t been a good brother or son to them. I take my anger out on them. I snap at them. I manipulate them. And I don’t want to hurt them anymore. I just want it to end. Killing myself seems like the only way now…

921,1,"I’m not sure what I’m looking for with this post.

I’m 35 and have long lost the joy for life, or what that is presented as.

I’ve followed the rules. Created a business that has trapped me with relentless pressure and no escape in sight.

Got a partner I love, who is now about to be told her young sister has stage 4 cancer and will have months to live if not a year or so, and will break her.

I have no time to do anything, nor do I want to. I appreciate the beauty of the world, but I am drained to the very core. To step away for a moment is to lose the business and my ability to re-enter an industry I don’t want to, as well as result in an inability to support my partner financially or myself. 

I didn’t consent to being alive, and all forms of self-help are attempting to solve an issue that is irrelevant for me. I see no other way for this pain to stop other than to stop it myself"

Just talking about myself makes me feel disgusted. I’ve tried to strangle myself over 10 times these last few days and couldn’t bring myself to do it long enough. Now I have some throat problems. 

How do people live like this? Why is life so miserable for me? I don’t even feel like I belong in my own body and that I hate everything about myself. 

I am so doomed staying alive is like some joke to my whole life. "
923,1,"About 2 weeks ago I had my first manic episode and during it I successfully ran from the cops however they had my plate and I had to turn myself in that night, I got 11 charges. Now knowing I’m bipolar, it explains a lot and I’m just now getting the correct medication to treat it. I have court on Monday and I’ve been out on bail, I normally smoke weed to help cope however I cannot or I will violate bail and go to jail. Same thing with alc obviously. I just worked a 16hr shift today and have to be up at 8am TODAY to go do another 16hr shift, after court tmr I have an 8hr shift. On the way home from work I was going 100 in a 55 on a highway that pretty much nobody was on, it was rainy and I consider myself a good driver (ik everybody says that) and then obv a cop got on the highway, got behind me and got off on my exit, he gave me 3 citations and 1 of them will give me 1 point on my license, he was a very sweet cop letting me off easy, however my life recently has been anything but easy. This pushed me over the edge and I was so close to driving my car into the edge of the mountain while I sobbed my way home. Sorry to jump from one thing to another but that’s just how my mind is. I recently got back in contact with my mom after 11yrs specifically to ask her about how and why my older brother died from fent. I got a lot of mental issues from her and I think she’s in a religious psychosis. She was one of the worst mothers you could ask for, I’ll briefly list off a few things; she threw me and my brother out of moving car when we both were under 10, allowed her father to do horrific things to my older brother(yk what I’m referring to) I never really got to see him much but when I did we’d be left at trap houses and who knows what happened, I hardly remember anything from before I was 7-8 except for violently throwing up when my dad would have to give me to my mom at a police station bc he had a restraining order on her. The only solitude I found at my moms was my brother. My dad later got with another women and her son is 3 months younger than me, and I didn’t know why at the time but I was always at his hip and could NEVER leave his side, follow him around etc to the point where he would get annoyed.(he looked exactly like him too) I last saw my brother when I turned 7 at my therapists office because my mom was “trying” to get visitation rights but never fulfilled her duties. When I saw him he was quiet and didn’t talk much, from when I was 4-7 I would see my mom maybe once every 3-6 months so either he could have been quiet because he knew she was about to leave for Arizona. After this visit I never saw my brother again. They moved to Arizona and my mom got with another guy and had another baby. The next I heard of her was when I was a freshman in highschool and I needed my passport to go to Cancun. My dad didn’t have full full custody so he went to court and obviously she didn’t show up so he got it. In the process he had a family friend try and find her on Facebook but all she found was a missing poster from my brother. My dad and stepmom at the time told they don’t really know. Later when I got back in contact with my mom she informed me he died due to fentanyl. I have not been the same since, there’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think about him. I told my mom it’s her fault for not noticing and the reckless things he was doing before he died like steal nicotine from a gas station to “sell”. He died in 2020 and when I saw the missing poster I just did NOT want to accept it and my mind kind of forgot about it from time to time, I was also a lot more mentally stable back then and had a lot of friends and I was keeping busy. But the main part was that I just did not want to believe it. Even after my mom told me he died I asked her if she had his body. (Bc sometimes they just say there dead when they can’t find them but ik it’s a massive stretch) she then told me he’s cremated and she has half of him. I asked her what his final weeks were like, she said he got a job at Home Depot and things looked good besides him stealing from the gas station. But she would not go into depth like I wanted her too. I wanted to know everything about him. She then told me “he was intent on talking to you before you died” (she wasn’t saying he was on his death bed but rather he was intent on meeting back up with me) ITS RINING IN MY HEAD. WHAT DID HE WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT? it’s eating at me. I can’t sleep. I can’t think. I can’t breathe without thinking about it. I’m officially 1 year older than him and it feels weird. I can’t stop thinking about the horrific abuse he remembers that I don’t. Maybe that’s what he wanted to talk to me about. Who knows? I know I never will. I’ve struggled very bad with mental health(in and out of hospitals, suicide attempts, sever alc addiction , weed, etc) issues my whole life but I don’t have very many friends, because I keep pushing them away and getting mad at everything, I FEEL like I’m going to kill myself, like it’s intuition. I’m slaving away at a job I actually enjoy(working with an autistic boy with severe behavior problems) he so sweet. I’m getting burnt out needing overtime because I got into a car accident a few months ago and needed to pay my dad back for that car now this car. I need to pay for lawyer fees and now 3 stupid fucking citations. I can’t think straight anymore. I sat in my car throwing up from how bad I was crying when I got home. I don’t even know what to do, who to talk to. I just want someone that loves me like a lover. It’s what I’ve wanted since I can remember. I’m not unattractive but I’m not super attractive either. I’m at the lowest possible point I thought I can get too. When I was a freshman I did NOT think I’d make it to 18 but here I am. I have a little brother I live with and I recently got into contact with my other brother who lived with my older one. He’s in Arizona still with an adoptive family who really loves him and my mom is herself in Tennessee. She relapsed after he died and he got taken from her. Nothings her fault tho 🙄🙄. I wanted to save up money to put the ashes she’s going to send me into an expensive ring. The job I have pays 25hr and I work 40hrs a week plus some overtime if I can. I have a lot of payments now. I feel like I just barrel rolled into becoming a terrible adult. I don’t wanna end up in addiction or jail I’d rather die. "

I tried saying to my mum, I'm feeling low, numb, flat. She said welcome to my world, so that was comforting.
I dont want to cause issues, or any inconvenience. I know there's so much to deal with if I call an ambulance. I'd have to explain it to my mum in the next room. I'd have to deal with benefit providers. I'd have to give up on commitments I promised to people, dates and plans. 
But I'm sat here, staring at my safety plan in one hand, and the means to kill myself in the other, and I'm thinking if I'm getting out of this, I need to call for help. But the thing is, id only be calling for help because I know someone finding me would be an even BIGGER inconvenience than putting them through the stress of me having to call an ambulance.
How do I explain? What do I do? How do I help myself without making a spectacle of it, without seeming like im seeking attention or making a fuss?

But if i didn’t do any of that bad stuff, then im just existing. Doing nothing. I dont ever see a good thing ive done. If heaven was real and there was a system where they show me all the bad and good things ive done, the good things are probably giving coins and dimes to homeless people. But religion aside, Ive heard death feels good. Relaxing. Im tired of crying all night. I just want to relax. I dont wanna go to work and handle taxes, make a job application. I just wanna . . . sleep. forever. I dont wanna . . . be human. I dont want to die. I really dont. Its like going on my knees and grabbing deaths shins begging him not to kill me or whatever, i want a normal life. I want to have a family or have kids live in paradise. But death is the only thing that will probably save me. 


I always have this thought in the back of my mind . . . its ""your gonna be a murderer one day"" or ""your gonna be a pedophile one day"" or something worse than that. I dont like gore and the human anatomy, everytime i see real gore i throw up. But, sometimes when i watch porn i always search for 18 or- you know what i mean. I even had a thought of going to the dark web to look at girls my age naked. But i never did because i didnt want some dude watching me through my webcam . . . but i never had a thiught of not wanting to do it because its wrong. I truly am just awful. I feel like i can hurt someone. But i dont want to. I want to see a therapist but im broke. So i have to end it somehow? I cant have a life where i always think of ways to quickly die a painless death. So just find a way to end my self on the most painless way so i can not have these thoughts. Im confusing sometimes i know.


Also im an Asexual but not really? I look decent, i think- im very attracted to females, but no one really talks to me, so i tried being gay once, i was pretty attracted to big dicks, or had thoughts of becoming a women and being fucked. Or how it felt. But it didnt work for me, they were just intrusive thoughts. Im only asexual because no gender wants me.  I guess thats one thing ive moved on. Having a partner. I know no one wants me. Everytime i see a pretty girl i just move on without even talking to her, i already mnow she probably hates the way i look, or just dosent give a shit. 


But the big suprise, is i havent even tried to kill myself. Ive seen other people do it in gore sites, and they immediately regretted it. Atleast- people who hung them selves looked regretful. But i have tried to hurt or cut myself before.

I just want someone to talk to. Someone who understands. Im scared to tell my parents, my mom probably will call a priest and say a demon possessed me, my dad probably wont give a fuck, Im scared to tell my cousins because they’ll just judge me. But i sont be scared to tell my grandmother. Shes the only person that makes me scared if i kill myself. I really love her. Shes the only person who ever gave a shit about me. I really love the fact that she calls me his fourth son. She told me that she had a fourth son after my dad and my two uncles, but he didnt make it out the womb alive, but she calls me the resurrection of that baby. I guess it makes me love life a little. But i cant take it anymore. I really cant . . . All i can do is tell strangers in the internet . . ."
931,1,can anyone talk to me please
932,1,"Hi everyone,   
  
I'm 18. In some days, on my birthday, I'll kill myself. Knowing I will be gone soon feels surreal and liberating. I haven't told anyone, not even my family, closest friends or partner, and I've been pretending to be better so I can spend some last days with my loved ones before doing it. I'm just doing this post so at least someone in the World knows I'm going to do it. 

I'm a parasite to everyone around me. I can't allow people to spend time and money on me any longer while I do nothing but rot away. I hope I'll make their lives better for the first time once I'm gone. I'll be more compassionate by dying and more useful in death than I ever was or would be in life.

I've failed purposefully so many times, just hoping ill somehow get better. This time will be the last time I try

Thank you for reading and acknowledging me, I hope you end up better than me and go on to live a life full of happyness. 

\- A."
933,1,"I didn't ask them to be that type of a friend but they began to say all this supportive bs, and be there for me more. One day they do a 180 and I'm crushed. If this happened when I was sane it wouldn't affect me so much but I was already mentally gone. To make my heart feel warm and cared for for the first time in months to suddenly stopping without explanation is fucked up. Im now back to planning and I'm not going to stop this time until I find a way out. People suck ass unless you're one of the lucky few"
934,1,I hate this world. I hate these people. I hate myself. I hate it all. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. I can't fucking do this anymore.
935,1,Don't think I'll do anything tonite but 43m blocked on everything by ex and not eaten in a month. Just like to talk if poss.
936,1,the title 
937,1,"This is a bit uhh.. I don’t know. Gross. So I’m not sure if it’ll get taken down, but recently I’ve been really obsessed with watching suicide videos (and looking at pictures). I figured it would help desensitise myself to the idea. I stumbled across a photo of a girl, around my age, who successfully used my planned method, and it’s just made me feel so.. secure. Like the minute I really want things to end, it can. I don’t know why I’m posting this really, it’s just been on my mind. "
938,1,I have no one. I have nothing. I wish I was merged together with someone similar so when they expire I will too. Then I'd have someone close to me in our shared final moments. 
939,1,"To keep a long story short, I don't have a job anymore because I wrecked my car. I have a ton of debt. I'm having trouble finding a job. I occasionally get instawork shifts, but doing intense manual labor on top of having to walk there in summer heat has proven to be too much for me.

I genuinely think no one gives a fuck about me. My family doesn't love me and the only people I know in Saint Louis are people at gay bars who bullied and used me.

 I do not matter to anyone I know in real life. I do not have enough money to even get through next week let alone the rest of the month. I had ebt but it got canceled because I messed up my paperwork and I'm gonna be starving soon.

This is the beginning of the end. I am alone, broke and unloved. I have become an unlovable angry, person who can't even take care of himself. My house is infested with roaches and if I can't get a job, I won't even have a home, but with my mental health on decline I've already given up. I just hope the end isn't painful."
940,1,"Liver failure or not I'm prepared for the consequences, I have nothing to my name no relatives or anyone, "
941,1,"Broke up with my gf. Well not really, just was blocked and blocked back. Reached out cus I was having some nasty thoughts and all they could basically say was ""I don't want you to hurt yourself but I can't get back with you"" not offering me support or anything. They said it was because we weren't together anymore (We ""broke up"" 2 ish days ago). But my thing is she's fucking disloyal and I'll hate her for that and wish her the worst, I've stuck by her through multiple attempts, let her live with me and SO much more that only God knows. All at the age of 18. When it's time to show the SLIGHTEST bit of sorry (accepting that she did wrong too) or at least talk to me like a fucking person she can't even do that. Just bitch and moan about situations that could have been solved if she gave a damn about me, by not running away to the living room or someone else's house. I used to get anxious when she left therefore I would cry and get upset. She js said a couple mins ago that she's been a ""slave"" to me for months because of that which is insane because we both know that's not true. She was a hypocrite and she couldn't even do the bare minimum for me. What's worse is I don't have anyone. My dad is gone, my mum hates me and doesn't talk to me. I have friends but none picked up, fair enough they might have been sleeping, but I don't think they would have cared anyways. So yeah it sucks, I've provided for (98%) and loved this girl for about a year and the moment shit got rough she gave up. Hence why I mean disloyal. We've had arguments and ""breakups"" before and I've always come back to her. But now she's saying no. But that's fine, she prioritised everything and anything over me, including a rapist (her dad). She got upset at me for having feelings that weren't happy. She looked down my phone and got mad when I talked to a friend about a mistake she made and got angry about that. I did speak to her about said mistake, but as most things to her, it ""wasn't a big deal"" beacause the mistake wasnt bigger. And lastly, up till today she twisted my words so they can fit her narrative better. 

All I can say is,
What a waste of a year.

Edit: I was crying over the phone, I'm not gonna lie, begging to work it out, but it's for the best. ""If they wanted to they would"". I'm excited to actually be with someone who legitimately loves me 👍"
942,1,"From a young age, I’ve always questioned what the point of life was. I now know the point of living is to have a fulfilling life and be happy yet. I’ve come to realize that that will not be my life. I’ve pretty much never been happy. I’ve just been surviving. I tried self-medicating myself since sophomore year of high school. I smoked a lot of weed developed an eating disorder. Thought I would be happy if I liked how I looked, it kind of did bring me joy yet I know deep down. I still was not happy at all. It always just felt like emptiness than my senior year was depressing trying to recover from my eating disorder but then the summer was great. I had a glow up, had a summer fling, was getting drunk and just having fun I guess? My first semester at college was the same thing I kind of went hyper-maniac to get me happy. My second semester was disaster, though I sort of realized I couldn’t keep doing all these behaviors to keep me happy and then I fell into a pit. I ventured to food and would just eat so much to try and fill this emptiness and now I’ve gained so much weight. I realized I’ve never been happy. I’ve never really been able to have friendships. Nothing really makes me happy. I have no interest in life. I have horrible brain fog and horrible memory. I’m just a walking corpse. I’ve now finished my freshman year of college and I’m pretty much doing nothing with my life because I don’t want to. I’m trying to work here and there but other than that every day feels like a force. I’m just here. I feel emotionless, soulless. I feel dead. I’m scared in my own body. I’ve kind of come to realize that there’s no point in living. I’m just never gonna be happy, I don’t wanna just survive. I’m also not smart at all so I don’t know how the hell I would even get a real job. At this rate, I would be living with my parents forever working a minimum wage job and spending the rest of my time hiding in my room. I don’t have anything to talk about with people. I’m just so damn miserable. I’ve been to therapy a bit and it just doesn’t really help. I don’t think they know how to help me. I feel unfixable. I’m on Prozac and it hasn’t really done anything. I just wanna sleep forever since I don’t have the guts to kill myself. "
943,1,"I moved out of my mom’s last July and I’m rooming with my coworker and she’s been helping a lot. Been covering the utilities on top of her portion of the rent. And my finances are so fucked up i haven’t been able to pay her back for what she helped me out with or start with utilities. 

I lost my insurance last November after i turned 26 and after being medicated and going to therapy since i was 18 i was cut off because I lost my insurance. I was diagnosed as bipolar 2 in 2020 and I’ve been hanging on by a thread ever since. When i stopped therapy and meds i fell apart. 

I have a binge eating disorder and that’s all i could do for months. And having bed is the biggest part of my fucked up finances. 

My roommate is rightfully pissed at me for that on top of other issues we’ve been having. She blows up at me about everything so i truly don’t ask for anything anymore. We barely even work together anymore. 

But basically i can’t afford rent this month. I’ve exhausted every option paying rent the past 6-8 months. I thought i could get it together this month. 
But i haven’t. I’ve fucked up. Again. I have one day until they process evictions. 

I feel horrible. I know I’ve proven everyone right about me. It’s so humiliating and frustrating to know what i can do and not be able to do it. I’m feeling more peaceful about going through it. Though, my cat is my largest concern. I know no one will take her in after, i don’t want her in an animal shelter alone. 

I just don’t know what to do. There’s nothing else. I told my mom i don’t have the ambition or desire or drive to continue anymore. With anything. I can’t do anything right. And all she said was “good luck with that” 

Thanks for that, Mom, i guess. "
944,1,"why is it so hard just to follow through with it
people give up all the time, they have siblings, parents and grandparents too
But why is it so hard to give up myself? I hate everything about myself, I’m not worth the time and effort from anyone.
I want to give up and just vanish from the world, and not care about what comes next. I hate living like this"
945,1,"at the lowest point, no one to even to talk to about it, calling a helpline didn't work they just don't pick up, i'd be happy if even one person replied so that i could see i'm not alone on the planet"
946,1,"If I were to take 22 Tylenol pills each 500 mg ( so 11000 mg) would this kill me? What would it do and what would it do on an empty stomach if there's a difference that is.

Im about 5'4 and around 114, if that matters any.

Edit: How long would I have to wait for it to take effect?"
947,1,That's it. That's all. I'm just so exhausted and it feels hopeless. I don't want to stay here. 
948,1,"I ran away from home a month ago, I'm kinda surprised I'm not dead already tbh

I fucked up with a safer plan of going to Poland and living witha family member that knew abt this

But no, I fucked up, I'm not even sure why anymore, I just didn't go woth the ppl that could've gotten me over the border.

Rn im not really following a plan except trying to not get caught, and not dying accidentally

Also been stealing more and more just bc im running out of money and I was still so fucking stupid to relapse by spending 800₽ on speed

I genuinely think I only have 2 options

Go back home to my alchoholic parents that don't get in trouble by our countries cos for some reason

Or killing myself

And I would rather have this shit stop than having to go back again.

So, ig this might be my last post, I'll try to find some place and either sleep, or kill myself with a knife

So, just in case, goodbye to anyone who knew me"

950,1,"I'm 21, ugly fat, was preparing for my pre medical entrance exam I failed thrice, seriously thrice. My parents are very supportive even now but i guess they deserve better daughter. I wish to end my life. I just can't do it but i want to do it. Idk "
951,1,"I recently got diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Sure I definitely spend more time in my room and barely talk, but apparently that means I hate my mom and that I think she’s selfish. Where did she get that from? If only I could tell her I hate myself and want to die. If only she knew how I get panic attacks when she makes comments like that, but she’ll never know. She’ll never know the reason for why I died or hated myself. Yeah I’m totally a bitch and think she’s selfish for no reason. She thinks I hate her and love my dad more these days. Seriously? All I’m doing is asking him to drive me to therapy and doctor appointments. Are you kidding me? I’m seriously done with living a toxic life. I’m dying tomorrow night "
952,1,What kind of gun is best for me to purchase as a possible way out? I know nothing about guns fr but there are no restrictions other than age in my state and I’m of age. I was thinking handgun idek. Not sure how expensive they are either so if anyone knows a normal price lmk that as well. Guess it doesn’t really matter if they scam me tho lol.
953,1,I was wondering if I can check myself in at the ER for suicidal ideation without an ID or insurance. I simply can't afford it. I have no way to pay for treatment but it's gotten bad enough i'm considering checking myself in.
954,1,"I have friends but I never get to see them. We don’t even text much anymore. I could disappear tonight and nobody would notice for months. I just hate understanding that my life is so insignificant. I hope they don’t find my body, at least not for a while. 

I’ve always been afraid of dying alone, but now it seems preferable to living alone for however many years I would have had left. It’s almost embarrassing to die like this. What a complete failure I have become."
955,1,"I see that everyone here is thinking or has thought about suicide because of emotional problems… am I the only one here who will commit suicide because i am broke and homeless or what? 
I don’t mean to belittle your problems only you know what you're going through. But honestly, emotional problems don’t seem to me to be worth dying for. I’m stuck in a foreign country without a job, without shelter, and without food most days. I can’t even afford a flight ticket to return to my country. And yet, I’ve resisted for so long... Even now, as I’m giving up, I have no regrets I’ve done everything I could."
956,1,"i just don’t. i WANT to care, i want to put effort into myself, but i cant. one of my teeth got chipped to the gum recently and i just don’t care. i’m not making a dentist appointment, im lying and telling everyone i am, but im not. i don’t want to go. i don’t want to get up and take a shower and catch my face in the mirror. 

all i do is get fucked. i’m good at that. i let anyone fuck me and that’s easy because i get to lay and just be used for something, and maybe if im lucky i get to feel good too. i’m bleeding a lot down there from it. it started the day before yesterday and im still bleeding, and im not gonna tell anyone. i’m not going to go to the doctor. a part of me hopes im internally bleeding so that it’s the one thing that made me feel something to off me. that’s stupid i guess. i don’t know. i just wish i cared "
957,1,"hi, i (F24) have EUPD and autism. 

I’ve been having all these suicidal thoughts for so long, and I’ve had multiple failed attempts previously. Nothing has improved in my life since then. Infact, I’ve managed to sink lower than rock bottom, and I have no care to carry on with my life, i’m happy with the knowledge that my suffering could be over soon. I’m looking for advice on how to end it, as my previous OD’s didn’t work. I want something quick and guaranteed, as I really do not want to survive this in any condition. What would be the best way for me to OD? (I’m not looking for sympathy or anyone to talk me down, this is going to be the end of a long life of suffering, so ultimately it’s a good thing)

958,1,"i never have the guts to stand up for myself so i just sit there and let people degrade and insult me

always be seen as weak and lesser than everybody else, and theres nothing i can do about it 

god fucking damn it im so fucking pathetic i need to somebody to shoot me dead already"
959,1,"

I, F 19, have been mentally unstable since I was 13. I had my first suicidal thoughts when I was 13. Just when I thought things were getting temporarily better in life, I realized how much of a troubled person I am and how the negativity in my life spreads to everyone around me. I've only made negative impacts while trying to please everyone because i can't please myself. I don't know what to do anymore. Lately more and more situations keep adding up and I hurt a lot of people around me. I'm not ready to maintain social relationships to others, I'm not ready to continue with my life acting like my presence doesn't impact other's negatively. I've hated myself ever since I was a kid, maybe my parents had contributed to that mostly but that doesn't change the fact what kind of miserable person I am.

These situations lately have put me in a condition where I can't sleep and haven't eaten for days. I really can't do it anymore. I've never felt so lonely, desperate and sad in life. It was the last trigger I had needed to end everything. Nothing functions for me anymore, I hate myself. I've been told to suffer from consequences of my own actions and I deserve it. I knew I wasn't made for life. I just want to disappear. End it all. Give others and myself the peace I deserve. I haven't gotten out of bed in days in hopes to just die. Die while doing nothing. "
960,1,"I’m not happy. I can’t work without crying. I’ve ruined my life time and time again. I’ve been hospitalized, medicated all of the above and I’m so tired. My heart feels like it’s been ripped out bc of my fuck ups. I miss him and I’m doing everything to prove to him I’m getting better but it feels like he only likes me at night. I know I hurt him and I’m just so upset with myself. So upset with my life as a whole. Everyday has been a struggle. I don’t have any friends, he’s my world and yea he’s still talking to me but he says loving me gets him hurt. Me trying to love myself hurts. How does anyone keep going on? I can’t even function. The thoughts cover my head all day. It’d be better if I died."

964,1,"I’m a 15 year old female and I’ve been feeling like there’s no reason to live since I was around eight. There’s no events in my life that would make me feel like this. I’m privileged + have a caring and supportive family but if I come up to them one more time they’ll just brush me off because I’m overreacting. Yesterday I had a panic attack and overheard my parents in the other room, saying; “I bet she’s crying right now” “yeah.” In annoyed tones. 
If I kill myself, then maybe they’ll understand that I’m not faking it and that it’s real. It’s been real, but not even my therapist really listens. All I do and have been doing is cry alone in my room and all people say is “suck it up girl you’re annoying” but it’s not like I lash out at anyone or anything like that. They didn’t even find out until I had one day left. Didn’t attempt that time, but I have multiple times without anyone noticing. Not even friends. Slitting my wrists seems more effective than pills this time. Thoughts? I’m lost and will always be lost. Not to mention, I’m a terrible person. I’ve ruined lives of kids at my school. Honestly there’s no point and that’s VERY evident. 
This will probably be my last post online ever. I hope it is."
