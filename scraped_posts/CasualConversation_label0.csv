1,0,"So I've been dating Sarah for about two months now. I'm 35, she's 43 and is a single mom to a 12-year old daughter, Emma. I have no kids, never been with someone who has kids (divorced though), so it's been new for me. Emma is also on the spectrum - I don't know the details, don't mean to sound demeaning at all - so Sarah warned me beforehand that she can be a little distant with new people. I've met her around 5 times now and I think it's been going well, she seems to like me but I wasn't sure. 

Yesterday I had dinner at their place, and while we were eating Sarah got a phone call and went to the other room. Emma and I kept talking, and at one point she got a little quiet and looked at me. Then she said ""you know, I think this is going to work. It already feels like we're a family"". Felt like she shot me in the heart, in a good way. I didn't know what to say so I just said that I think so too and that I'm happy she said that. After dinner when Sarah and I were alone I told her what Emma had said and she almost started crying.

I can't stop thinking about it, it made me so happy to hear that they both feel so safe with me. I know we haven't been dating long but I feel like this could be something really, really good. I don't know, guess I'm just happy. Sarah and Emma are awesome."
2,0,"In our house, we are currently living through the moodiest of pre-teen phases with our 11 year old. She is too cool for just about everything right now, and if you aren't a phone screen you may as well be invisible.

Yesterday was a particularly moody day. She was upset she burned through her screen time so fast. None of her friends were calling her back to talk (I offered to chat with her but was met with a 'no'). She had literally nothing to do (me gesturing to a room full of activities was not well met) and her life was terrible.

Alas. Such is the pre-teen life.

I was fully prepared to accept that this was our new reality. Over the past year I've watched Harry Potter give way to combat boots and mushroom decor. Hour long showers done completely in the dark are the norm. And I'm pretty sure her left ear bud is permanently stuck in there, which is why she can never hear me....

Last night, my husband and I were out doing yard work and the pre-teen was lounging in our dinky blow up pool, looking too cool for school.

I puttered around the garden for a bit, and when I looked up to check on her I was met with a pool stacked high with every inflatable toy and floatie we own. Staring out from a crevice in this monstrosity of rubber was our girl, black goggles on and looking fiercely over her kingdom.

I told my husband a bog witch had moved into our pool. He looked up from weeding and said, 'That'll happen.'

The rest of the evening was amazing. The bog witch demanded offerings in exchange for protection and safety. She redid her cavern like 50 times, while my husband and I tossed her anything that would float as construction material. When we went inside we both curtsied to the bog witch and thanked her for her services. Our backyard is under her protection as long as we appease her (which was done with offerings of ribs and ice cream).

After dinner, she crawled in bed with us and we watched a silly YouTube show with her, which I did not understand at all. It was perfect.

This is one of the memories I'm gonna hold close. She's growing up crazy fast. But she's still a goofy kid deep down.

I hope the bog witch stays forever."
3,0,"I just started my own tea business from my home, dealing in small farmers markets and that sort of thing. Just recently visited on Saturday as a public and one of the interns said people have been looking for and asking about me. 

Then my brother visits today, and he told me a lady visited his shop and started talking about this new tea booth at the market, said ‚Äúit was run by a lovely young woman, she was very sweet, and knowledgeable‚Äù and she kept talking very excitedly about me and my booth, and how excited she was to try more of my teas. And my brother got to respond with, ‚ÄúIs that right? That‚Äôs my sister! üòÅ‚Äù 

Just feeling particularly proud right now! Gonna be riding this high for a while! "
4,0,"I'm an introverted and mildly socially anxious guy in my mid/late twenties. A girl around my age with whom I've recently become acquainted told me while we were greeting each other at campus that she really liked my new sweater. 

Such a simple and small thing made me feel lots of things: Happiness for the positive feedback from a girl, slight worry that she may have been mocking me, anxiety about maybe not having thanked her and/or smiled at her clearly enough, and doubts about whether taking this as mere friendliness or as some attempt at flirting. 

Yeah, I'm kinda complicated lmao. I think I'll just focus on the happiness feeling and be extra smiling with the girl when we see each other again. "
5,0,"I've been at this for a few months now... It's okay, I've been doing my best. Living in my car thankfully. But I'm just feeling incredibly lonely today, it was a special day back when my family was still around but each year it gets more and more raw for me, this year the most considering my situation. But I'm hopeful."
6,0,We all have those strange daily rituals or habits that seem totally normal to us but might raise an eyebrow from someone else. What‚Äôs your weird little routine that no one really knows about?
7,0,"I must‚Äôve been around 4 or 5. I don‚Äôt remember this but my parents do.

A fly; a normal, common housefly landed on my arm. I guess I just didn‚Äôt know what it was called because I didn‚Äôt call it a fly.

I got my mother‚Äôs attention and very emphatically said ‚ÄúMam! Mam! Look! It‚Äôs an aerospider!‚Äù

For months and months afterwards, everyone in my family called houseflies ‚Äòaerospiders‚Äô. I‚Äôm 25 now, and whenever we‚Äôre at a family gathering, the topic typically gets mentioned and we all have a laugh and start calling them aerospiders.

So what magical and wondrous words did you have for things as a child? What was your childhood dictionary?"
8,0,"I know no one else cares but I've been scared to eat grapes for over 2 decades because they make me think of eyeballs. No matter what I just look at grapes, think of eyeballs, and gag. 

I like the taste of them! I remember when I closed my eyes and ate them as a kid I enjoyed them! And I **love** white grape juice and wine so I definitely like the flavor of grapes. They just freak me out. 

Well I've been trying to get over my fear. I ate 10 grapes today **with my eyes open** and they were good but also so sweet? Like they kinda just taste like sugar with a hint of fruit?

Anyway I'm an adult so probably no one cares that I ate my grapes but I am very proud üòÇüòÇüòÇ

I will literally eat brussels sprouts, jackfruit, leychee, kiwi, guava etc. all sorts of fruits and vegetables that are less commonly enjoyed but I could not eat one of the most basic and regularly enjoyed fruits ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  humans are weird

Anyway yay for grapes "
9,0,"I always prefer to pronounce ""behemoth"" as ""BEH-huh-mawth"", even knowing it should actually be pronounced ""buh-HEE-mith"". The former just sounds so much cooler and more badass for some reason."
10,0,"For example, I like saying *""close, but no cigar"".* Idk why, it makes me feel cool and quirky

I also like hearing products described as *""_ on the go"".* It feels so slick and useful that I gotta hold my wallet shut. What phrases do you like hearing/saying?"
11,0,"I've been having more and more interest in researching random topics. I wanna know some from y'all that I can probably get into tomorrow :)

Also doesn't matter what it is, it can be silly stuff too"
12,0,"like a little ritual, tradition, or hobby that you never tell people about...not because it‚Äôs embarrassing, but because it‚Äôs *yours.*  
for me, i write letters to my future self and hide them in random places.  
sometimes years go by before i find one again."
13,0,I suuucked at teaching kids who are disobedient. I don‚Äôt know what to say and I feel so inept and weak. I wanna shout or correct them but I‚Äôm a low quiet person. I also don‚Äôt want the other kids to look at me or feel uncomfortable. My anxiety just makes it worse. 
14,0,"It‚Äôs my 27th birthday today, my favorite uncle passed and my mother found out she needs emergency surgery all just today 

Last night I felt (for the first time in years, ironically) that I wanted to do something small to celebrate my birthday but it‚Äôs been bad news since I woke up this morning 

I‚Äôm in bed now about to conclude an awful day and need some silly lightheartedness to take my mind off things, talk to me people!"
15,0,My high school philosophy teacher said this and it has stuck with me ever since. I remember someone once bragging ‚ÄúI can be a real b*tch when I want to be‚Äù and I just remember thinking can‚Äôt everyone?
16,0,"I was crying in the parking lot of a Target after a really bad phone call with my mom. I must‚Äôve looked rough because this older woman walked over, didn‚Äôt say anything at first, just handed me a mini chocolate bar and a napkin. Then she said, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to explain anything, but I want you to know it gets better.‚Äù And then she walked off before I could even thank her.

I don‚Äôt know her name, I don‚Äôt remember her face that clearly, but I remember exactly how I felt in that moment. Just seen. Like someone noticed I was breaking a little and didn‚Äôt make it weird, didn‚Äôt ask for anything, just gave a tiny bit of kindness when I needed it most.

It‚Äôs been a couple years and I still think about her when I see chocolate bars at checkout."
17,0,Just trynna utilize my summer vacations into doing/learning something **productive** and beneficial instead of doomscrolling ig or tiktok. Please do mention any **skills** I can learn or you know which have benefitted you. Here to learn something new :)
18,0,"Mine would be that food or getting compliments is not your love language. If you like people to make food or give you food, then that would be acts of service or gifts. If you like for your partner to give you compliments, then that is words of affirmation. Forehead kisses is not your love language it‚Äôs physical touch."
19,0,"I have come to learn that I get very annoyed when someone is eating a brownie and says ""I wish I had a glass of milk.""

I have no negative experience associated with brownies or someone saying that. It just annoys me, I don't know why.  
Someone always has to say it. Why do they say it? Sometimes milk is available. Sometimes it's in the fridge 3 feet from them. But instead of getting a glass of milk, they just say they want one and continue eating the brownie. 

Additionally, when someone says that they could mean that the brownie is dry and not good and milk would help, or they could mean they want it because the foods are complimentary. Which one is it? I don't care! GET THE MILK OR SHUT UP.

It's like some compulsory phrase like how Midwesterners say it wouldn't be that cold out if it weren't for the wind.

What's your ""I wish I had a glass of milk""?"
20,0,"No matter how much I try to plan it out the weekends always feel like so dull like I start with all these good intentions like catch up on sleep or maybe get ahead on homework and then suddenly it‚Äôs sunday night and I‚Äôve barely done anything except exist. This weekend I just stayed in and watched a bunch of random youtube videos.  
It wasn‚Äôt super productive but honestly it felt kinda needed. Just wish there was a little more time before the chaos starts all over on mondays lol"
21,0,"i‚Äôve been at work recently and i‚Äôm a very quiet person. i used to have selective mutism and although it‚Äôs better now i still struggle with speaking and making friends. 
i was working until close and this guy came and helped me around and checked on me. he encouraged me to be more confident and was just really kind in general. i felt seen. and he was really helpful. i appreciate these kinds of people so much. i don‚Äôt think they know how much it means and how it can go such a long way. it made my day so much better. "
22,0,For me I think i would either chose something like tron legacy or rwby because I feel like those aren't too popular but love them with all my heart.
23,0,I fell asleep but then instantly woke up with a sore face as I was on my smartphn and holding it above my face fell asleep and dropped it ony face haha. Which may actually happen now I'm pretty zzzzzzz...
24,0,"I've been thinking about this a lot lately because I had such a great solo evening this week. I usually feel like I need to be doing something productive when I'm by myself, but on saturday I decided to just embrace doing absolutely nothing planned.  
Had a little extra spending money after getting a bonus at work so I treated myself with a takeaway from a nice thai place that I always walk past. Instead of eating while watching tv like usual, I just sat on my balcony with my food and actually paid attention to the sunset. It sounds simple but it felt so awesome like it made me realize that there's more to life than just work work work (siri insert Rihanna)"
25,0,"When I was a kid I used to think once I had a job, I could just buy a good PC or console and play games for hours, because I would have been a free adult. 
Then life happened, priorities shifted and the last time I played a video game was at a local fair on an old PS1 for a few minutes.
When I became an adult, many things took time from my day, putting gaming at the bottom of the list until I forgot about it. Never owned a gaming PC nor a console past PS2, and I think It was for the better. 
I say this because I used to be surprised when I was a teenager about how new games would cost 60 euros; and then they became even more expensive and needed patches and DLCs. Plus I've been following communities about tech and, apparently, a 6 yo PC is considered old. 
Now, to all the gamers, is it worth It? How do you keep up with technology? How do you upgrade your gaming PC constantly and what happens when the old one can't be upgraded more (like when in October many PCs won't be able to support Windows 11). How much do you spend in video games and are you not disappointed when they're incomplete even after all the money you dropped on them? The current gaming industry feels a lot like a scam. This is why I've given up on gaming and catching up to new tech. My phone is from 2020 and I plan to keep it until it dies. My laptop is from 2012 and I run Linux Lite on it. When the support for Windows 10 will be over, I'll switch to Linux on my desktop too because I'm tired of changing working electronics for no reason.

26,0,"Anybody else ever eat a mango on the floor with your bare hands in the dark? If not you must try this. It's life changing. (peel it with your hands and don't cut it up to eat it, just go at it like the monkey that you are deep down)"
27,0,"As the title says, I‚Äôm not particularly fond of dogs.  I just don‚Äôt get why they are so popular.  The only thing I can think of that makes them appealing is their loyalty, but besides that I just don‚Äôt get it.

There is only one dog that I have met that I actually like and she is very calm and just does her own thing.  I can see why people find dogs cute and lovely, but I‚Äôm just not that kind of person.  Does anyone else feel similar?  "
28,0,I‚Äôm bored and completely Trying to get some experience on the app. Feel free to ask me anything or chat about random books or movies 25m Ask me anything or comment random 
29,0,"That ""jack of all trades, master of none"" feeling hits hard when you've bounced between different roles and nothing seems to stick. You start questioning if you even have any real talents, especially when you see others who seem naturally gifted at what they do. It's frustrating because you know you're capable but every job feels like you're just getting by rather than actually excelling. The worst part is not knowing if the problem is you, or if you just haven't found the right fit yet."
30,0,"Basically the title.

I just had this thought, if every human being had one wish, do you think the world would be in chaos or in peace? Because if someone were to wish something negative like ""wished a asteroid hit us"" out of stress but someone else wishes for something positive like ""wished that everyone is safe"", what would happen?. Basically wishes that contradicts one another--what would happen? What would be the end result?"
31,0,My neice is currently in search for a first time job as a 16 year old and is really struggling for a job.I was just wondering if anyone who owns a business or has any information on the subjects can just enlighten me for no reason because im just really baffled because when I was in my teens there was so many availabilities.
32,0,For me I'd definitely have to say my ult show is King of the Hill (who's ready for the reboot? üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). As for movie I'm torn between Spider-Man 1 (the Raimi version) or ROTS (it makes great nostalgic background noise if you ignore the order 66 parts)
33,0,"I love reading (especially manga) but I get so emotional when I finish a series that it honestly keeps me from starting new ones. It‚Äôs not even about whether the ending is sad or not, I just feel this deep ache when something I love ends. I‚Äôm autistic and I tend to fixate, so I‚Äôll cry, obsess, and sometimes feel weirdly empty for days after finishing something.

It makes me scared to enjoy things fully because I know they‚Äôll just end later and each page is leading up to that final moment. Even with shows or movies, I avoid finishing them because I hate that feeling of it being over. I‚Äôm 21 and I wish I could just let myself enjoy stories again without constant dread.

If anyone has been through this, how did you learn to cope with endings and still enjoy reading/watching things? Any mindset shifts or tips that helped? Fandom helps me a little, but I still feel stuck. I‚Äôd really appreciate your thoughts. :) ü©∑"
34,0,"I was taking my girlfriend to a play she wanted to see tonight and was taking one of the famous entertainment streets that had its hay day mostly in the 70s and 80s. It has some more Vegas-esque attractions, but you see  there‚Äôs still some sleazy parts including those old strip clubs motley Crue used to sing about, the famous clubs like whiskey a go go, Roxy, Viper Room, rainbow room. Sunset strip still amazes me that it‚Äôs still got ghosts from the past lingering around.  "

I don‚Äôt know the people who live there personally, but I walk by often and have noticed no one seems to be picking them. I was thinking about asking if it would be okay to take some.

My mom has always drilled into my head that life is all about perspective, and it truly seems to have just hit me recently. That and comparison is the thief of joy.

43,0,"I'm going through rough months and every nights I'm on the verge of crying.
This weekend, I visited a close friend and stayed at her place. One night, one of her cats came to my bed. He circled me several times, nudged me with his head, meowed, purred and cuddled up next to me; at the end he slept on my legs.
I was honestly so touched by his quiet, unconditional comfort. It felt like he knew I needed it.

Is something going on in say, Brazil, and other of coffee-countries? A $6 increase in six months--well, that's just hard to understand!! (And this is the lowest level of coffee. I only get Starbucks etc when I'm in an airport, going to visit my 8 year old granddaughter twice a year)."

For me, I'm confident about my problem solving skills. I can't think of many situations where a problem had me completely stumped and I wasn't able to find a solution for it. For me, every problem feels like a puzzle to solve, and I can usually solve it after I dig into it enough to understand what the problem is, or at least take time to test my ideas on it until something sticks. No matter what it is, I always know I can fix it."

I live with that, but I can also recognise how much I've grown with time.  I've thrown myself into life - I moved to a foreign country, met some extraordinary people and done things that truly scared me.  Yet here I still am!

It honestly amazes me when people say they don‚Äôt play or have quit games entirely. I can‚Äôt even imagine what that kind of self-control feels like. Do you just not find them interesting? Or did you used to play and then decide to stop? I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to balance everything better, but games are such a huge escape for me, especially when college gets stressful.

It‚Äôs been almost a year since I had a short but meaningful interaction with someone on Magic Tiles 3. Their username was something like ‚Äúdevilious,‚Äù and they told me their name was Angel. My username was insecurepurposs81, and they used to call me ‚ÄúInse.‚Äù It might not have lasted long, but for me, it felt like a deep and genuine conversation  one of those unexpected moments that just stays with you. My internet went out in the middle of it and didn‚Äôt come back for hours, and by the time it did, they were gone. I‚Äôve thought about it so many times since then. If that hadn‚Äôt happened, I honestly believe we would‚Äôve talked more and maybe even stayed in touch. I just miss that connection, the comfort of being seen in such a short time. I think they were from the US, but I‚Äôm not sure. Even now, I still want to reach out  just to talk again, even for a moment. I know it‚Äôs a long shot, but if you‚Äôre out there, Angel, or if someone happens to recognize this  just know I still remember, and I hope you‚Äôre doing okay.

65,0,"I have been travelling to Italy a bunch of times, it is a beautiful country with lots to see and do. If you like the sea, it is also a place with amazing beaches and beach life that is very up to my taste.  
Anyway, Italians, especially the ones in the south, are expressive but generally relaxed people. There is a need to follow the rules but you can always go around it if there is some logic there. The same logic applies to parking as well, so around some popular beach sites it is very common to see bunch of cars parked behind the edge lines, on the road shoulder. This is not unusual to see in other countries like Croatia, Cyprus, Turkey, Greece...  
So, I have adopted this unwritten rule and all through south of Italy I was parking my car behind the road edge line. I was very happy if I would find a spot in the middle, not being the first or last car in the line. I was thinking even if they start to clear the line of cars, mine will be near the last ones to be towed. Traveling all through Calabria I didn't have any issues and to be honest I haven't seen even one towing truck near the beaches.  
With this build up parking confidence I did enter Amalfi coast. Stunning views, sharp cliffs and narrow road, but also some signs on the side. But, who is going to look at those signs when you have all that beauty in front of you? Not me :) While I was driving I was scanning for a place to park, you can see lines of cars waiting to enter the paid parking and garages. I didn't wanna wait and I was thinking maybe there will be some space on the side of the road. Very quickly I spot a free space, on the road shoulder, right in the middle of the line of parked cars. The ideal spot. I went on a quick swim and a drink, but when I came back my car was gone. I instantly knew that it was a mistake not to read those road signs :)  
It turned out that space behind the edge road line is reserved for the locals, and all their cars have a distinct visible patch. The local police or parking authority has scouts that are running around on scooters and are catching these violations. They see your car and they call a tow truck which takes it to a nearby parking lot. To take my car back I needed to pay a parking and towing fee and there was also a traffic violation.  
The fee was not extremely high, if I remember correctly around 200‚Ç¨, but apart for the money my the biggest disappointment was the inconsistency of the unwritten parking rules.  
Jokes aside, Amalfi has so much tourists and so little space so going there with a car is probably some sort of space luxury. So if you are planning to visit this magnificent part of Campania with a car try to be very early, read the road signs and do not park on the side of the road."
66,0,"Yesterday, I found myself wandering into a little bookstore tucked away on a quiet street. The kind of place that smells like old pages and possibility.
The owner, an elderly lady with kind eyes and a soft voice, greeted me like I‚Äôd been there a hundred times before.
‚ÄúLooking for anything special today?‚Äù she asked, as if she already knew the answer.


I wasn‚Äôt sure what I was looking for, but I let her guide me to a shelf filled with dusty novels and worn-out covers. She handed me a book with a faded spine and said, ‚ÄúThis one changed my life.‚Äù


As I flipped through the pages, I felt a strange comfort, like I‚Äôd just stumbled upon a secret.
It wasn‚Äôt home, but in that moment, it felt just as warm.

75,0,I'm new to reddit and I've encountered many harsh people here on reddit. Is this place really friendly and welcoming? Even to 16yr old amateurs like me?
76,0,"For instance I‚Äôve been friends with this person for about 7 years give or take. We‚Äôre in a friend group of 4 (including myself) this friend randomly texted the group chat sometime last summer and explained to myself and the two other members in the group, that they do not like when the three of us hang out without her. They went on to write 3 long messages about how they basically feel left out. One of my friends responded to her long messages by saying that there have been plenty of instances of them hanging out with 1 or 2 members of the group. We have all done it! Sometimes the other 2 members of the group are busy and it‚Äôs just the two of us who hang out and vise versa. There have been plenty of instances I‚Äôve personally not been involved with hang outs. It never made me upset though because it‚Äôs never been to spite any of us. WE have all been friends since elementary school. I was honestly really annoyed with the messages she sent to the group chat. So I took the opportunity to tell her things she constantly did to me that I did not like. 7 years of pent up animosity basically come out in that moment. Every time I tried to tell them to not joke about certain things, they would shut me down and laugh it off. I took this opportunity to be very straight forward about how I feel. Pretty much to some it all up it got messy and a 5th party got involved.I haven‚Äôt spoken to them in about 9 months. I tried to salvage the friendship but felt like I was the only one putting in effort too. Every thing seemed alright for about a month but then I got ghosted some time late last august. I feel pretty shitty about the whole situation. I‚Äôm still friends with the 2 other members. I can‚Äôt speak on their behalf but I can speak for myself. I wish the argument never happened. I wish I just kept the way I felt too myself. I still think about them from time to time. I don‚Äôt really know how to move on. "

86,0,"The premise of Dune really was ahead of its time. A futuristic society that seems to still function based on humanistic character traits. 



I thought supposedly, more than global trade, the internet would make us more interconnected and not hate eachother or be prone to state propaganda with free flow of information. It seems people inevidibly still hate one another, and prejudice doesn't go away. And social media and internet will normalize overtime if it hasn't already. I then wondered what the internet would look like in one hundred years time. I think it'll be used as a tool, an option that we can say no to. I think awareness of spending too much time online will be well understood. I think again the internet will be used as a tool, and people will ultimately prioritize spending time in person with family and friends. I think things like influencers portraying a magically better life will be disregarded, and in further years, people will realize what's more important to their own respective lives. I think the Internet will be optimized. And ultimately, people will remain people. The idea of people changing is absurd. I have similar interests in video games. Eventually, we should understand down to a science what makes a video game fun for each respective age group. Additionally, we may have concise knowledge on what time consumption on video games or fun should be acceptable or become unhealthy. 



And so I think of Dune. A futuristic society that feels primitive. Perhaps society should run based on optimizing the human experience. Perhaps fashion trends, music tastes, will normalize and one day instead of the question of what's hip now, we can look at the answer within the history of the past one hundred years of clothing styles, songs and albums and singers, and dissect what makes life exciting in and of itself. Maybe innovation will slow down, and instead of chasing the novelty, we begin to optimize with what we already have, and make better use of what is and understand better what was, all to better understand what it means to be human.

After about half an hour, the tourists asked if we knew any auto repair shops near our destination and i wasn't sure, so i started googling. 

The Indian dude's eyes immediately lit up, and he called up to ask his uncle if he knew any mechanics shops, then both the couple and the other guy left the bus together at our destination to find a shop.

96,0,"So, I am getting into a beat up Hyundai from the early 2000s. On a hot April day, with probably more then 35C (95+F), this black car acts like a sunshine magnet. The AC is struggling with the heat so there is little difference between the temperature in the car and outside. The driver, who looks like he should be attending elementary school, smiles and makes a single nod with his head while I am entering the car.

We are gliding on the wide streets of Cairo while very repetitive beat with this eastern hail like singing is playing from the radio. The first thing you notice is the lines (for lanes) on the streets have absolutely no function, it is just a pure waste of paint. Also, the brakes in the car are very much spared because traffic is floating as if we are riding on the Nile. I can't remember seeing any stop lights or stop signs.

There is no lanes, but also there is no speeding. All the cars are trying to maintaining consistent speed, my cabbie is gunning a bit less then 60km/h (40m/h) on a clear 4 lane road. There are very few cars passing us by. Seeing blinkers is a mirage. I am not sure why they are not taken off from the vehicles and sold to places where they are actually used. All drivers are tailgate whispers, they are very good at reading the direction cues from the cars in front.

There is a pickup truck in front of us and in the back there is probably more then 10 people, a small boy is sitting on the edge with his leg hanging just above the rear wheel. On the outer, so called lanes, from time to time, you can spot tuk tuks that are moving in the opposite direction. People are crossing the street where ever they see fit. They are passing so close to the car that you can almost feel their shoes touching the tires. We are not stopping when we see a pedestrian in our ""lane"", and they are not running to cross the street faster, but somehow we just pass by them.

Every car on the road is scratched, and has minor or major impact damages. All of them have a functioning horn, and it is used slightly less than the gas pedal. It seems that you would probably be more safe if your car had a brake malfunction than if your horn went off. The cars and their drivers are like hummingbirds, they are constantly communicating between each other using the horn. I would imagine that local car shops are spending half of their working hours servicing only car horns.

The traffic there is to some extent an organized chaos, but I did arrive at my destination without any issues. Few additional gray hair I must admit, but it was worth the experience. Now, after this daily commute in my home town seems like a meditation session :)

For anyone experiencing frequent road frustration I can highly recommend one taxi ride in Cairo.

To all drivers in Cairo, thank you and keep on humming."

101,0,"I have undergone 2 operations - one last year and other this year. So my movements have been very limited for these 2 yrs. Before the operations, I had a very busy schedule. So when I had to go into this forced restricted activity phase, it was very tough emotionally.

Music helped to some extent, but slowly even that didn't help. On one of my follow up visits to doctor, I got  into conversation with a patient. He had undergone 6 operations, but was very cheerful, with a smiling face. Initially,  I thought it was just a facade. But as my conversation went deeper, I realised the person was genuinely joyful.

On asking he said, he just counts his blessings when he starts getting depressed or frustrated. He said ""I still had the opportunity to correct the problems with operations,  but there are many can't due to various reasons. So it's a big thing, I am here and not 6 feet underneath the ground!""

That hit me. I started looking around me. I have a supportive family, still have a job. How many have even these? So now I have started focusing on my blessings, it is tough sometimes.  The 'why me?' Keeps coming up. But it is slowly working.

Just wanted to share this experience.

I don‚Äôt know if anyone relates. 

(Before ppl say this is narcissism, I don‚Äôt think I am better than anyone else, we are all equal. This is just what I notice with social dynamics since I‚Äôve become fully content in myself when I‚Äôm involved in them). 

Anyway, I‚Äôve done a lot of inner work over the years to a point where I am very confident and happy in myself now and able to kinda just say whatever comes to mind without second guessing it and it generally gets a positive reaction because I think it just comes across to people that I‚Äôm not afraid to be myself and it causes a positive reaction. 

I notice that when I enter a social space where people are already talking the energy of the room shifts suddenly and all eyes are on me. 

I start to laugh and joke and people laugh along but it seems like when I am in a room I have to carry the energy almost for other ppl to then open up. Where some ppl can sit in silence and be a background character and not draw too much attention I don‚Äôt seem to be able to do that. 

So I‚Äôve started just leaning into this as I think this is just the person I am meant to be who uplifts others. Would be nice to be able to just chill and not have to make effort sometimes. But then I guess I‚Äôm not being myself. 

Is it true that once you are rly confident and carry yourself well people notice and feel that energy and you become the center of attention even if you aren‚Äôt trying to be? 

I‚Äôm never trying to be the center of attention it just seems to naturally go that way once I enter a room. So I‚Äôm just gradually leaning into it now and the social interactions go better. That is just my observation of what seems to happen. 

TLDR: It seems ever since I became confident and happy in myself when I enter a social setting all eyes and attention is on me even without asking it to be. Is this normal? Do confident people just carry a certain energy that demands attention? 

I‚Äôd love to hear thoughts from ppl who relate. Thank you!

122,0,"When I was about 9 I was at Movie World on the Gold Coast (Queensland, Australia) with my Dad. He wanted to go on the Wild West ride but I wasn‚Äôt huge into fast rides so he asked this older lady if she could watch me while he went on. In retrospect this was probably some bad parenting but it was 2004. I stayed watching the ride the whole time and at some point the lady wanted to look in the gift shop next door and told me she‚Äôd be right there and I just nodded and kept watching the ride. 

At some point after that these Asian tourists came up to me and said something, I believe it may have been in Japanese but I‚Äôm not sure. I just know they were of East Asian descent and speaking in a language I didn‚Äôt know. Being 9 and English being my only language I had no idea what they said so I just smiled and nodded politely and went back to watching the ride for my Dad. Unbeknownst to me I had just agreed to whatever they had asked (which I found out later was to be in a photo with them) and suddenly I was being picked up by this guy. My flight or fright did not kick in and instead I froze and thought ‚Äúam I being kidnapped?‚Äù. A few moments later I thankfully realised that was NOT the case and the guy placed me next to him on the fence and motioned for me to smile to the camera his friend was holding. 

So long story short I always think about how 9 year old me probably looking half shocked half awkwardly smiling is on some randoms family travelling photos somewhere in East Asia. And thankfully what could have been a scary thing ended up just being a funny memory and something my Mum scolded my Dad for (leaving me with a stranger to go on a ride) for the rest of his life. "

I learned having a lesbian friend is awesome. You get a feminine connection you can‚Äôt get with another man but they will also watch football with you. It‚Äôs like the best of both worlds. Sometimes she even likes the same girls I do. I definitely want to find another since she‚Äôs moved away. "

For me, it‚Äôs the freedom to enjoy the little, everyday moments without feeling rushed or overwhelmed.

I don‚Äôt dream of working 70-hour weeks just to afford some fancy car or $300 steak dinner. I‚Äôd much rather have time real time with the people I love.

138,0,"as a kid I ate jam sandwiches almost every day for lunch. dinner was almost always stir fry (2-4 nights a week), chicken tenders or pasta. as soon as I became independent (around 16) I had a huge shock realizing how much I could cut down expenses by buying non frozen and experiment with all types of food. 

as an adult I almost never repeat dinners more than twice a month. I enjoy home cooking, trying new things from different cultures and doing the best research in my power to make it authentic. my breakfasts are usually involving eggs and a carb with a little Veg. they repeat more often but not with much frequency either. there's god knows how many meals that fit that criteria. 

if I eat anything with more frequency I grow to dislike it. I've noticed alot of people who I know do things like taco Tuesday or spaghetti Saturday and they have been doing it for like ten years, or even more interestingly there are people like my father,  and grandparents who ate like the same ten dinner meals for 20 plus years.

 as ive met people through my life and travels Ive found my grandparents way to be more common than my habits. so here I am. what do you do in relation to meal repeticion and planning? "

140,0,"Recently I found an old post of mine from a time when I was doing pretty poorly mentally, and I spoke of a feeling that something good was in my future and how that false hope was what kept me going. It was from 2020/21 and looking back and it I actually feel amazed at how much happier I‚Äôve been since. 

End of covid had me move to a new place. And I met some of the best people I‚Äôve known who are all very close to my heart now. I feel like the love I‚Äôm capable of is expanding every year. I still had my failures even these few years. But I think the support of those close to me didn‚Äôt let me lose confidence in myself. Something I was very easily susceptible to in the past. 

Well I‚Äôm moving to a new place for a new job next month. And while I‚Äôm anxious about it in general I‚Äôm so excited. I think my biggest learning since has been that change is exciting, even if it‚Äôs scary.  But also I‚Äôve greatly had increased anxiety about death (especially for my family) and tragedy recently, and I‚Äôm sure recent events have a lot to do with that. I‚Äôm also concerned that moving will have me doubt myself, since this new version of myself was formed in the perception of others. Considering all that‚Äôs happening in the world right now it feels facetious to say that I believe ‚Äúit all gets better‚Äù. But I really do wanna believe it. It‚Äôs what got me through the last five years and I wanna hold onto it. "

142,0,"When I was 11, I was the flower girl in my aunt's wedding. I wore one of my sister's dresses. My memory of it was that I was fat, awkward, and just didn't look good.

One of my cousins just posted several pictures, including some from the wedding, which I had never seen. One included me. I looked wonderful. Long, curly blonde hair, beautiful dress, and just sweet.  

It's funny how you can have a memory that is completely flipped when you see the truth. It must have been my going-through-puberty self that colored my memory.

148,0,"With summer, and the talk of activities, we often hear about swimming. More often than not, it‚Äôs during the heat of the day, and outdoors. 

With our pool set up, I decided to give a morning float and swim around the pool a try. Outdoor temp before sunrise was about 78 degrees, and the water temperature was about 60. I had my coffee tumbler with me, and I kicked back in one of our lounge floaties. 

And tbh?? A lot better than expected. 

Got to hear the birds chirp, got to take in the sunrise while sipping my coffee, and best of all was I didn‚Äôt have to worry about sunscreen. It was just a relaxing morning. 

Also, I didn‚Äôt have to worry about kids doing a cannonball right next to me, so the waters just carried me around for the morning. 

Definitely gonna pool time in the morning a try again, that was so nice and quiet. "

I would like more close friends. I guess, more people like me? Maybe it's time for me to consider joining more social events and meeting new people to look for people who I can jive with.

152,0,"I am not exactly why I want to be in life and I have gone through a roller coaster of grief, but I have also observed that I spend a lot of time day dreaming about giving things to the less privileged. I am buying a very big mixer, it‚Äôs expensive and when i think of how I will be using it because of its large size(it can mix dozens of cookies that I can‚Äôt eat alone), I imagine baking for people on the streets especially during special holidays such as Christmas , and new years, making them high quality meals that I enjoy and adding other nice things to a package for them, e.g cute fancy towels and clothing‚Äù so they can feel good even if it‚Äôs short term.

I am clocking it now, and I am asking myself ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you instead dream of making a large group of friends that you can be cooking for and gifting?‚Äù(although I have been heartbroken a lot in the past due to betrayals, so I don‚Äôt dream about relationships)

I also realized that when I get something extra, or maybe buy a meal combo, I may just eat the fries and give the burger and drinks to someone on the streets, I was once on the night by 12am looking for someone to give huge packs of food. I could have maybe done something else with the packs but that night I felt like ‚Äúwhy keep and refrigerate fresh food for yourself when someone else can enjoy it fresh?

While reflecting I also realized I have never fully kept my earnings to myself, even while doing little jobs I would buy courses for janitors where I worked (e.g tech courses - I felt they were too young and education could change their lives )

I would also tell people my goal was to be rich and give it out. Even though I am also someone who lives in isolation and mostly vanishes from the public. Like I do things for people and then just move on and not look back, zero attachment or need.

But, when it comes to social interactions, he is always silent, be it friends, family, his own parents & siblings, his clients when not dealing with some litigations etc....  I am perhaps the only person with whom he is socially cordial with.

Is my husband an introvert or an ambivert of some type? 

PS:-  I am trying to help my husband improve his social skills, Bcoz he wants to improve his social skills and converse well with everyone, bcoz he feels this issue is costing him valuable relationships.. so a help would go a long way guys

Also, I'm sorry if this is a stupid question but is it weird for friends to hang out 1 on 1 at each other's places or should you invite groups?

But I also notice that people do notice it. Yesterday I wore pants that I bought a few months ago for the first time, pants I had been afraid to wear in public. I could tell that one of my sisters didnt like them or thought they were weird but they have too much tact to say that outloud. My mother said they looked nice but you can never trust what a mother says in terms of looks anyway since they would not say anything bad anyway. But when my other sister heard my mom say that, she said ""no they dont"" as a response to my mom. 

Tho it kind of annoyed me to know that many if not most people thought the pants were weird in a non good way I finally decided to not let that influence me.

For me, consistency and hard work have been the real game changers. Not just grinding blindly, but showing up with purpose, learning from mistakes, staying patient, and refusing to give up when things get slow. It's the small habits and daily efforts that quietly build momentum over time.

174,0,"I'm well aware since highschool that I have a really boring personality. I‚Äôm not the funny or interesting in conversations, and I don‚Äôt have strong opinions or unique hobbies that make me stand out. I usually just go along with things and stay quiet unless someone talks to me first. I also don‚Äôt have many interests. It feels like I'm just existing. 

The only cause I can think of is maybe something from childhood. I remember my mom once telling me that she and my dad used to leave us alone at home a lot because they both had to work, they had no choice because of financial struggles. I don‚Äôt blame them, but I do wonder if that would count as emotional neglect and it may has something to do with why I turned out this way.

I used to be a bubbly toddler tbh, but then things got messy when marital problems came along. My dad cheated, and eventually he was gone. 

Now that I‚Äôm an adult, I just feel kind of empty. Even being talkative or social at work takes a lot out of me.

I think a lot of people are coming to realize that community is important, but personally I still have a lot of difficulty approaching people to strike up conversation.

I think a lot of it for me is not wanting to bother people while they're preoccupied and not wanting conversation. And while I know that other people's reactions aren't something I should bother trying to control, there's still the socially anxious part of my brain that absolutely blows a gasket if a conversation I have is anything less than perfectly smooth.

I was also thinking that maybe we could have some sort of article of clothing that could mean ""I would like to socialize"" so that people can more easily make conversation without worrying about imposing on others?

My husband is also screen down. He says it‚Äôs because he works in a shop environment and he‚Äôs worried that he could damage the screen at work and at home if he‚Äôs nit a big texter or emailer so he‚Äôs not tied to it.

Needless to say, the movie utterly destroyed us (but destroyed me more than my bf because I was crying at the end so much and he shed a tear or two after seeing me cry)

I cried so much to the point that I started having a nosebleed, and I told my bf that I was a ketchup bottle leaking blood from both my uterus and my nose, and he said 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not Alicia, you‚Äôre A-leak-sha‚Äù and we both just bursted out laughing. I was still crying though, crying and laughing, but this is a moment I just wanted to share. üò≠üòÇ I love him sm

Maybe a total stranger or maybe just someone distant enough that It doesn't matter. Someone you can tell literally anything to and It be okay. Like the shit you'd normally take to the grave and not tell a soul. Things your husband or wife doesn't even know. With this someone you could vent to, confide in, ask the risky questions, share the bad thoughts or crazy confessions with, and it goes nowhere because there are no strings attached.

It‚Äôs not that anything big happened. But my chest feels a little lighter when I let the small stuff out. Like the feeling of pulling warm sheets over your head when the world feels too loud.

I don‚Äôt always know what I‚Äôm trying to say. But it still feels good to write it down. Like maybe I‚Äôm making space for something I don‚Äôt even understand yet.

186,0,"so i had this group at school, we graduated a while ago but we still kept in touch, we didn't see each other often because everyone was busy doing their own thing but whenever my best friend came to town there would definitely be a get together, we weren't really close but we all got along, no drama or inner conflicts, i'm quite introverted so i don't usually chat often but on the outings everyone seemed to get along, out of all the get togethers i only missed the last one because that day i had something important to do, after that my best friend got really busy so she couldn't travel last month, and a few days ago i was on ig when I saw that they had gathered without me, my best friend was as surprised as I was, she chats with all of them often and no one mentioned anything, She's angry, so the next time she comes to town she won't hang out with them. I don't know if they'll continue chatting or not in the future because she's very close to two guys in the group. At least I've already told her that in any future meeting I won't go. I'm not angry or anything, but I've already experienced this situation with other people and I'm not interested in any of this. If they don't want to hang out with me or if they only do it when my best friend is around, then I'm done with them. Although it does surprise me a little. Like I said, we all seemed to get along.

193,0,"I'm a grade 10 student, 15F and is planning to pursue nursing. Seeing a lot of homeless people in the street gave me an idea to dream big, like, building my own hospital which gives free treatments to homeless people. But I just want to share my idea and I know that it sounds impossible. 

Aside from that, I also want to build my own company wherein they hire fresh graduates to gain experience, not only will they gain experience in that company but also the workers there will also teach them things regarding the course they graduated in or whatever they wanna learn, they can learn it there with the help of the other employees that have experience that tutors or teach them for free but I don't knowwww it sounds really impossible, and I still have a lot of questions going on in my mind.

I wrote this because I wanna know in the future how ridiculous my dream is haha. I actually want to do it lol but I'm not rich and I'm not that good in any terms. I also want to build my own hotel or condo bldg or I could buy one and manage it. The money that I earn there will go to the hospital for the homeless but I don't think that's enough.

And lastly, I want to build a school for the families that don't have enough money to support their children to enroll in any school, and homeless people.

I just want to share it because I don't have anyone to share this with. It is my first time posting on Reddit. English is not my first language so I'm sorry for any grammatical errors.

Edit: I didn't expect to receive nice comments. Thank you for believing in this dream and not finding it ridiculous. I am planning to take a step and looking for ways I can do to earn and learn more about it.

I don‚Äôt know if anyone else feels this way, but I really just love gas stations. Not even for the gas (I don't drive, I've just always been within walking distance) ‚Äî just the actual vibe of going inside. Especially late at night, or when you‚Äôve got the right music playing. Something about the almost liminal vibes just hits.

Most of the ones around me are ampm and they always have such good deals?? Like where else can I get a massive soda for under a dollar. Or grab a hot dog, energy drink, and a cookie for less than five bucks. It‚Äôs amazing.

I usually stop in before work for an energy drink most days, and sometimes after work too for snacks or scratchers. It‚Äôs like a little reward. 
I'll also walk to one nearby if I'm bored and can't sleep, or if I just need to get out of the house. Or anytime I've gone on a trip or school, or had to move because of foster care or other issues- there's always been a gas station.

Also the people who work there are usually super chill? Not always, obviously, but I‚Äôve had a lot of just nice little interactions. Even with customers. Even the objectively ""not great"" interactions are memorable and hold a bit of nostalgia lol.

Everything‚Äôs always kinda the same. Same humming of the coolers, same snacks, same annoyingly florescent lights.

Anyway yeah. Just wanted to say I love gas stations. They‚Äôre underrated and I‚Äôm always happy to go to one. "
205,0,"They can have be poorly made, badly written, or just riddled with bad acting. For me, I love the early Godzilla movies.

It's to the point where sometimes they reuse footage of one monster's arm from a previous movie that doesn't match the current monster in that film, but yeah, I love them to death. I guess for TV shows I'd have to pick some of those early 2010s Nickelodeon shows, but that's mostly due to nostalgia."

207,0,"Theres something so satisfying about finally being able to buy the things you always wanted as a kid. For me, that is cereal. Specifically, the super sugary, cartoon character on the box kind my mom would always steer the shopping cart away from.

Walking around a grocery store and grabbing a box of cereal without needing permission feels like a small, hilarious victory. Its not really about the cereal itself but the simple freedom of the choice. Eating a bowl of cereal because I can? Thats peak adulthood in my book and it never fails to make me smile.

It's such a simple pleasure, but it feels like a real symbol of independence. It got me wondering what everyone else's version of this is.

What's yours? I'd love to hear the story behind it.

215,0,"I thought about putting this in shower thoughts or something, but there's a lot more to this that I've been thinking of.

The rules for day of the week abbreviations aren't consistent. I've seen:

* Mon/M
* Tues/Tu/T
* Wed/W
* Thurs/Thu/Th/T
* Fri/F
* Sat/Sa/S
* Sun/Su/S

It can't be first three letters only, because I've very rarely seen ""Tue""; it can't be ""just subtract -day,"" because I've never seen ""Wednes"" or ""Satur""; and it can't be first syllable because I've never seen ""Wednes"". BUT it does seem like the third option is what it is. I can see that Wed looks better, but I feel like that suggests that Wednesday is a three-syllable word. Wedd Ness Day.

I read through the list of items on the screen and noticed that my one red bell pepper was instead listed as *seventy-one* bell peppers. I asked the cashier about it and she was very apologetic. I thought it was hilarious, as did everyone else in line, and we all had a good laugh (including the cashier). She voided the seventy extra peppers and I paid for just the one I needed. And that is the story of how I nearly became the guy in those elementary school math problems who buys obscene quantities of fruit at the local supermarket."

221,0,"With the added benefit that whatever liquid you dispense will be unable to cause any physical harm to your hand or finger during the process of you dispensing it. So if you choose to dispense hot water, it will not burn your finger, but if you dispense it so it drops on the rest of your body, it will still burn you.

You can choose the temperature of the liquid you dispense, but you cant change it after locking it in. So for example you can choose to dispense cold water or hot water but if you want to do both, you need to use 2 fingers to do so.

You can control the pressure, how much of the liquid is coming out, kind of like a garden hose. There will be a limit of how far you can shoot the liquids lets say around 10 meters at max. And the amount of liquid in the ""beam"" you shoot is maxed to be the diameter of your finger.

I will choose:

1. Liquid gold. This is purely to make money, I will dispense the gold into molds and sell it once hardened.  

2. Water at 40 degrees celsius. Because this is hot about the max temperature to use for showering safely. Since I already have enough money from the gold to get all the coffee and cola etc I would want, I am now only concerned with what I actually would need for survival if things get bad. Its not too hot to drink, so hydration is taken care off. It will let me have a warm shower and keep myself clean.  

3. Broth or soup, specifically one that has all the nutrients, vitamins, minerals etc. that a human would need, essential and non essential. I can live off from this alone if I ever need to, and dont have to worry about getting nutrient deficiencies.  

4. Liquid antibiotic drugs, such as peniccillin. This will allow to treat bacterial infections that could happen in survival situations.  

5. Liquid molten steel. This is good because it gives me a source of heat and fire. With this I can also build things from metal, all kinds of tools, even structures. It would be extremely usefull in a long term survival situation. Making tools of all kind, knives, hammers, saws, shovels. To building materials like nails. A thin stream could be used to make steel wire. Pots, pans and other cooking utensils could be made. "

A newspaper vendor has his corner, and is there faithfully at 5:00 every morning.  Around 9:00, a little old man shuffles slowly out of his building, comes to stare at the newsstand for about one second, and then go back inside. 

Every. Single.  Day. 

Finally dude has enough and has to ask.  ""Why do you come down here and just look at the papers everyday?""

It could easily be half that. So much filler ‚Äî random ocean shots, slow dramatic pacing, and interviews with people who don‚Äôt add anything new. Just a lot of fluff.

Meanwhile, you go on YouTube and you‚Äôll find a dozen creators covering the exact same story in 20-30 minutes, with better pacing, straight facts, and way more engaging editing. No unnecessary suspense or melodrama. Just solid storytelling.

So this is the first time we're all the bills, all the responsibilities are on my head and it's safe to say my emotions range from terrified, to excited. It's been a long time since I've had my own space, so I didn't have to worry about putting a shirt on before leaving. My room or being able to scramble to the bed in nothing but a towel  having forgot my change of clothes because I've always been around others, so there is freedom in that. But there's also fear because I'm not good with money, that isn't to say I don't SAVE money, just tracking money has always been hard for me, so hearing everything I have to spend money on scares the dickens outta me. But my bf is quite confident I can comfortably afford the place so I do feel better about that.

So, why can't I tell anyone? Well technically nothing is stopping me, but heres the thing my boyfriend is on the spectrum but both him and those around him never took the diagno(sis)  seriously and so he's been digging himself a mental health hole for decades. I would think everything is fine, that we're doing fine then BAM everything would explode. We've learned that he's very good at masking until he simply cannot anymore, but lately he's been taking large strides into actually understanding who he is vs just trying to be what is expected of him, ignoring his triggers and frustrations, leaving him unable to relax and sleep. I'm very proud of him really, change is incredibly hard, and I don't blame him for needing the space to grow, I myself went through my own sort of growth during our time but mine was internal, where a lot of his triggers and issues are both external and internal. I've tried to give him space but my personality just is very hard to coincide with when he's healing like this, I'm a chatterbox, ADD, noisey. These aren't inherently bad things but when he's trying to decompress or maybe something's bothering him and he can't voice it he slips right back into masking. Of course there's more to it but it is what it is. 

I don't want to tell my family I'm getting an apartment because they will ask why my bf isn't coming with me,  or why we moved out in general and that means I'd have to tell them his issues, and I'm not sure how much they would understand it honestly and he doesn't want to talk about it with anyone (minus his therapist), so I'm gonna lie and say I wanted to move out cause I wanted my own space, which is more of a white lie the a true lie, I have been feeling claustrophobic at times always being around people, but due to the housing market being insane never able to get my own home. And if course I enjoyed saving money.

I guess I could lie and say we both moved out to my family and that we needed our own space.  and then just tell his parents one half. But too much is going on for me right now to deal with that. 

 I'm trying to look at this more as an opportunity, rather than what it is, by the end of this we may realize we can't be together due to many factors and that's scary. So I'm trying to focus on the positives:

- there's a pool, i've always want to try swimming for workouts, but the gyms who had it were too expensive
- plenty of free time, I actually already got an apprenticeship learning a new skill (I'm employed full time so this is just a hobby), and I'll have more fridge space for baking, and other things I want to try 
- I won't have to wait for the bathroom in the morning lmao, petty maybe but my God I yearn for a place with two bathrooms at least I'll have my own now 
- budgeting, I'm going to learn how to use Excel and learn how to actually track my money so this sort of thing isn't so scary. Sounds basic but it's actually pretty daunting to me. 

At least that's a couple things I'm excited about. I'm sure there's more but I suppose I just wanted to tell someone I'm really trying hard to move forward in my life, even if the circumstances suck. I'll only be 6 minutes away so we'll both be visiting each other often- I guess I just hope it helps him. Reading about other people with autism and how he describes it just sounds so hard. 

Thanks for reading my complicated mess! I know it's weird but sometimes life is weird.

 It's silly but I've always been proud of my ability to reverse out of these with no problems. I just turn down all the windows so I can listen for traffic and just go slow.

241,0,"(19M) My issue about this is that a lot of the skills that you'd need in the actual ""real-world"" are things that aren't even in the conventional education system. And so what ends up happening is that, people like me who already have no concept of many basic things because my environment growing up didn't really permit the learning of these things, get slapped in the face with a reality check that I'd actually need to learn the things that I took for granted because I hadn't the need to do them. It's less about learning these important life skills but more so KNOWING about them, sure you can make arguments about the fact that information in today's day and age is ubiquitous and easily accessible on the internet and the only thing that you'd have to do is look it up, but how would I even know about it in the first place?

Her: you have no idea how much I needed to hear that.

251,0,"So, I think I am a wuss when it comes to eating out at a restaurant or food place. As far as I can remember, if I have placed an order for a dish, and the dish that comes out is somewhat different to the one I have ordered, I just take it and have it anyway. I don't actually tell the staff that the dish was not what I had ordered. Many times, the order taker repeats the order back to me before paying so if something was repeated wrongly, I would make the amendment. But if I make my order and they just tell me the cost of it and take my payment, I usually don't say anything. Today, I realised that this goes further than I thought. Even when I can clearly see on the screen that the order taker has entered the wrong dish but not repeated the order or checked it with me before paying, I still did not raise anything. I don't know why I do this. "

253,0,"And I was right.

I've retained some things from childhood, like the urge to play in clear water whenever I see it. I can only assume this is a natural human instinct, the way chasing lizards or building little ""houses"" out of twigs and pieces of bark is.

Every time I clean out my sink and fill it with clear water, I think, ""This needs fish swimming around in it.""

Since putting live fish in your sink is not recommended, I bought the electronic kind.

Honestly, I've wanted this toy since I was a kid. I thought there were even odds that I'd be bored with it, like so many other things I've outgrown. Not so!

You know how cats, when they watch you twitch a feather wand for them, their pupils get really, really big? I imagine what they're feeling is exactly how I feel when I watch my electronic fish swim around in my sink. Only instead of getting massively dilated pupils, I just keep making this face: :D  at my reflection.

We met online and knew eachother for about a month before we decided we wanted to be together, but neither of us were in a great place to meet up for any extended period of time so we remained online dating for about 6 months. She got some time off and I was able to get 3 and a half days off as well so we planned for her to come down to the US from Canada and we'd have a mini vacation at a super nice air bnb. 

I was so nervous the week leading up to it. Work has been stressful, there's been a heatwave here and overall I just felt stressed about the fact that I had not been exercising enough and had put on some weight. She knew, but I still just felt like she was gonna get off the plane and hate me.

Little seems like fate was plotting against things going right. But I'll leave out all that went wrong to say that I had one of the best 5 days of my life. She's everything I had hoped for and more. She's smart, funny, caring and genuine. I had to drop her off at the airport this morning and I know I should be sad, but I can't help but smile and think of one random moment or another over the last few days and feel flooded with joy. It's so hard for me to be comfortable around people and it was almost instantaneous with her. 

I was hopeful the trip was going to go well and that we'd like each other in person, but I had no concept for just how awesome this could be. I'm a 36 yr old man spinning and swooning like a teenager and i just needed to get that out. Thanks for reading if you made it this far."

I sit down in my office, log in, open the webex for the weekly regional conference call. It's usually roughly 400 people or so. 

We go through the usual routine, but then an executive takes the mic and suddenly my company photo is on the screen.

He says, ""[me] are you on the call?"".. I unmute- ""Hi, Good morning!"" [polite niceties] Exec: ""I wanted to call you out because outside of work the other day I ran into an old friend, and she was asking what I'm doing for a living. I told her that I'm in charge of all of the offices for [bank] in [city]. She told me that she lives in __ but drives all the way to __ because [me] I always remember her, and no matter how complicated the issue she throws at me you always just find a way to get it done without her having to worry"".

268,0,"I personally don't like to talk very much, this is especially true when I just don't see the need or point in engaging in menial conversation.

This has lead to certain people perceiving me as being aloof, reserved, shy or even in some cases ""stuck-up"" or outright mute. It's not that idle conversation alludes me, it's just that I don't feel the need or compulsion to talk when there's really nothing to be said. But when I do engage in conversation I tend to try to dig deep, and genuinely understand what it is that somebody is trying to express and convey to me.

These discussions just have more substance, and are also quite personally enriching for me also. I get the opportunity of gaining some well thought out insight coming from a completely different perspective. Whether l stand to agree or disagree is largely irrelevant, because with the experience I've intellectually matured to some degree.

These sorts of conversations also present a inter-relational benefit, since it helps facilitate the development of stronger interpersonal understanding and familiarity between the involved individuals. I personally have a much better rapport with the colleagues l naturally engage in such conversations with than the ones that I don't. 

But this style of communication definitely has it's drawbacks, with the most consistent being some people just saying that ""you like to debate"" and that you are ""interviewing them instead of having a normal conversation"". Being labeled as ""argumentative"" and a ""know-it-all"" is just something that comes with the territory. You can't win them all I guess..."

When we got to the street, without fail, he'd look left then right or vice versa before crossing, if he saw a car he'd wait, if it was far he'd run across, if he saw none he'd walk across.

293,0,"It‚Äôs interesting because people don‚Äôt do this back in the days nor do it as much.

Back in early 80s or 90s no one will dream to dragged their feet to stop themselves even if they are on a skateboard, they always stepped. 
I still remember the Marty McFly skateboard scenes in back to the future. 

However since the 2000s I see and hear kids, teens Or even adults were skidding their rubber soles all the time just out and about not just when playing sports or riding something, it‚Äôs still like this today. They are drifting and making their shoes sound like tires.

It‚Äôs become a preferred way to control speed  on a skateboard, scooter or a bike, or while on foot. Even though the scooter and bike generally have real brakes built in. Apparently it was a trend for a BMX to not use to pull the brake or even to ride brake less completely and depend on their feet to stop. I even got made fun of for using the brakes on my BMX bike for its intended purpose. It‚Äôs quite a different world from the 90s where kids always find it. Fun to drift there BMX bike by slamming on the coaster break pedals or rear brake lever. 
Skateboard guides online teach newcomers to ‚Äúfoot break‚Äù before such guides came out skateboarders used to push or tap to slow down or stop or simply, jumped walked or run off or rolled unto grass, and if they were better, they powerslide. But ever since skateboarding became a hot topic online in the mid 2000s everybody from newbie or even experienced ones who knows how to slide started to drag their feet to slow down or stop more often.

I know a toddler kid who got her scooter refuses to use her heel brakes and always wanted to drag her feet to stop. She learned the hard way it wouldn‚Äôt work if the hill is too steep. I always curious why?

Edit: I saw a post on ‚Äúfootbraking‚Äù on r/skateboarding and realized that no one back in the day ever dragged any footwear on the ground for any reason that is until 2006 or so when skateboard guides Online started teaching to footbrake, And I knew people who skateboarded.

297,0,"Hi everyone,

I actually registered back in August 2024 to secure my username ‚Äì but only started *really* using Reddit two weeks ago. I‚Äôd like to share some experiences‚Ä¶ and to make some declarations of love ‚Äì to Reddit and a few Subreddits ‚ù§Ô∏è

üìö In my life (and my love of history), I‚Äôve built a massive archive of vintage photos, films and documents ‚Äì showing everyday life and big events across the 20th century. I always wanted to share this treasure with others, because these pieces can be funny, moving, thought-provoking ‚Äì but never boring.

üåê So I started posting on the usual mainstream platforms. Zero views, zero likes. Like sending beautifully wrapped gift boxes into a black hole. Then I tried YouTube ‚Äì one English, one German channel. Better ‚Äì at least some views and likes (yay!).

ü§î Then I thought about *cross-promotion* (Beep! Forbidden word!) ‚Äì and decided to activate my Reddit account. And guess what: After a few rocky moments, I genuinely fell in love with this platform.

üí° I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôll be any ‚Äúcross-promotional success‚Äù (Oops! I said it again) ‚Äì but I honestly don‚Äôt care anymore. Because what I found here was something better: Subreddits where people **really engage** with the material (thumbs up for r/historyporn, r/finland or r/Austria). It‚Äôs fun, motivating, and gives you the mental fuel you need to keep a long-term project going.

Here‚Äôs what I learned (the hard way):

üìù **1. Rules are sacred.**  
Seriously. Read them before posting. Then again. Mods are strict ‚Äì and rightly so.

üôâ **2. Don‚Äôt expect mod replies.**  
I never got one. It‚Äôs not personal. They are surely busy. Just try, fail, learn, adapt.

üìâ **3. Watch your comment karma.**  
Negative comment karma can block you from posting and commenting in many subs. If something tanks ‚Äì remove it.

üå∫ **4. Find your ‚Äúgarden.‚Äù**  
If a post gets removed (and you truly followed the rules), just move on. Subreddits deserve *you*, not the other way around.

üß° **5. Reddit is surprisingly civil.**  
So much thoughtful humor, especially in r/CasualUK ‚Äì you're brilliant.

üñºÔ∏è One cool thing I noticed:  
I‚Äôve been collecting historical media for decades ‚Äì but many people don‚Äôt even realize how fascinating everyday history can be *until they randomly stumble upon it*. An amusement park in Melbourne in the 1950s. A 16mm film showing traffic in Brighton in the 1940s or people in a street caf√© in Paris in the 1960s. These moments often say more than a whole textbook.

üì∏ Reddit surprised me by being the *first* place where people actually *stop* and say, ‚ÄúHey, that‚Äôs interesting.‚Äù That kind of attention and conversation is rare ‚Äì and it really lifted my spirits.

I‚Äôm still learning. Still messing up here and there. But I‚Äôve already found more here than I expected. Thanks for being a place where even vintage nerds feel welcome. üëã

What were your ‚ÄúReddit childhood experiences‚Äù?"

300,0,"I live in a very low cost of living area.  My husband works a normal W2 job. I do gig work I enjoy to bring in a little money too. We make about 75K a year. So it's not a lot, but our expenses are low so it feels like we do very well. During a normal month, we usually save about $1000 a month if nothing crazy happens. 

In my state, every year we need to get the cars inspected to renew the registration and pay taxes. 3 of my tires failed (I had a hole in the sidewall a few months ago so that tire was almost new). Let's go ahead and get new tires. Then when they took the tires off, one of my brake pads had a problem where it was sticking, so the brake pad was totally worn down on one side but fine on the other. ""Is this why the entire steer columns shakes super bad when I brake?"" ""Yes"" Let's go ahead and fix that too. 

So I'm getting my car inspected, and paid $1,379 for 3 new tires, fix the brake where is was sticking, and I think they turned the rotors too. I am so fucking thankful that we can just...fix the car. I don't have to stress about the tires blowing out. I know the brakes are going to work. 

About a month ago, my 5 year old had to have major dental work done under full sedation. Crowns on the baby molars and removing one tooth. I have insurance, but you know how it is in the US. So far it's been $1000. But I can just...do it. I don't have to worry that my son will be in terrible tooth pain or have an abscess. Neither of these things are going to affect our road trip coming up.

We have season passes to the local water park this summer. We are going on a week long family vacation at the end of the month. I have the kids signed up for a few weeks of summer camp at the end of july and august. 

I am so fucking thankful that we can afford to be the family I want to be. We can fix the problems as they arise before they affect our lives."

Dear sweet little one

My sweet little one crying in the shower so no one can see your tears to avoid their fake concern. Holding yourself as silent sobs rattle your bones. Wondering what it's all for. The cursing you barely understand. The pain for things is out of your control. The silent prayers to anyone who would listen. For your journey to end before you wake. 

My dear little one, life is impossibly hard for you right now and completely and totally unfair to you. The things you are going through no child should ever go through. You have seen first-hand horror that most adults would avoid their bowels with just the telling of it.

So with all that you have gone through, you will go through. There is still strength in you to see the sun every day and the Glorious Moon every night. Some days will be harder than others, and some days will fill you with so much joy that you will weep. Your life is worth living for them all the bad days and the good days. So please, little one, keep your head up high, chin to the sky, shoulders back, and know that your life is an adventure, one that is packed full of chaos and love, sorrows and joy, amazing hellos, and mournful goodbyes. 

You are brave you are smart you're amazing in every way you are also selfish and stubborn and a big pain in people's butts this is all Who You Are The Good The Bad and The Ugly and you know what that is perfectly fine you don't have to be beautiful and you don't have to be ugly you don't have to be anything other than who you are I love you little one a sweet little me The Lost Child. Who has been forgotten by people who are supposed to love you right now. Alone in that shower crying her heart out, I remember you, and I love you, my little past self. You're so much stronger than you think you are, and in the future, you will be loved. We'll find people who love us just the way We are.


Lots of love 
Your future self"

Just put on some slow sleep meditation positive down talk thing and it was very relaxing at first but the deeper in I got, the more suspicious I got because it was simultaneously sort of flawless yet had strange little inconsistencies. Then it dawned to me that it could be possibly made with AI and all calm was gone because I had no sure way to confirm in the moment.

So yeah, now I'm up and  I think I'm developing a sort of AI phobia/paranoia towards things being ""not real"" and I suspect it's going to be a popular condition in the near future.

311,0,"As an older gen z, I lived most of my childhood with no internet, and once i did get it in 2013 or so, I didn‚Äôt get social media (including YouTube) until I was around 20 (just didn‚Äôt feel it was something that interested me) for context, I was homeschooled, so no peer pressure to do it either. I got my first smartphone in 2016. I feel like I had an experience pretty unique to someone my age. I grew up more or less in the same way as older millennials or even gen x, but with modern media.

312,0,"When asked whether I like my job, I usually reply ""as much as one can, I suppose"". What I mean is, I consider myself lucky: I've got a good job as an energy analyst, I make a decent living and I have opportunities. But...

Now I know there are people out there who love and identify with their jobs - not me. Although I'm not even 30 yet, I've pretty much given up on having a truly rewarding job. To me, anything I'm forced to do 40 hours a week will inevitably become a drag.

  
The best attitude I can muster is distance and apathy - I try to keep things in hand without stressing, and mentally abandon the whole thing once my shift is over. Unfortunately, after a while, tasks pile up and suddenly I find myself in a metaphorical burning house. Honestly, this is the only time I can actually commit to working: when there is an emergency due to piled up negligence, I get incredibly stressed and stay in late, sometimes several days in a row, to catch up with myself.

I feel sad, that my younger brother will be moving on his new workplace. 4-5hrs drive away from home, its not ideal to commute daily, so he chooses to look for a home to rent. He used to live with my parents and he help them all the time in everyday tasks. He provides for my parents all their needs including the time and support. I lived within the neighbor so we see each other every single day. im happy he got his dream job, but im afraid that no one will look after him, 
i know he is a young adult but im worried for his safety and his health, i pray that he chooses to eat healthy(he has little knowlege of cooking). I pray for his good health.

317,0,"Last October, I finished a research assistantship at a major university and since then I have been trying to find my next steps, be it new career, venture, community to join and so on. In the months since then, I have had to rely on regular financial assistance from my grandfather's family due to a combination of factors; general difficulty to find work in research and tech nowadays combined with my autism and ADHD making it in important ways particularly hard to navigate careers, get feet in the door, build networks and fight the right ventures.  All that in addition to general bad luck, for example finishing a research position at a company and then ending up trying to find a position at the height of the pandemic with all the hiring freezes.

I've struggled with a sense of shame over this because I felt that since I am going to be 40 soon and I felt I haven't lived up to the proper standards of what men are supposed to be and meant to be.  Being financially well off enough to buy and own a house and car, support and raise a family, advance in careers and so on.  I haven't ever been able to go on dates before for various emotional and psychological reasons I'm working on in therapy and elsewhere.  I have often felt being able to show independence on a regular basis is particularly important and so I feel in a sense I am not to where I should be for men even if they have autism and adhd. And especially invalid relative to NTs who by their 30s and 40s should be able to be completely independent at every level and have no periods where they need community or family aid.

I am working on looking at this from more positive, constructive angles so I don't get anguish and emotional pain over it.  And perhaps find helpful, healing ways to look at it.  I am in the process, as I have said, of going to therapy, learning how to be accepting of myself and learning how to live for my own fulfillment.  I am making distinct progress in my thoughts and feelings.  That said, I would love to be able to go further and learn how to embrace myself.  What can help with this?"

They have a floor made out of tiny hexagons (an inch or two across) that move you around so that as you walk you don't actually move in the space.  Not like a treadmill - they can move you in any direction.

I never imagined they were close to technology like this.  Is there other amazing tech you have seen demonstrated that we could be getting in a few years or decades?

325,0,"I think to a certain extent this has always been true but lately I've noticed it to be a particularly large trend in people of all ages, nobody wants to get older, and this goes both mentally and physically.

In some ways I think its nice that people no longer feel that they have to act a certain way when they reach a certain age but at the same time I also find it kind of bizarre. I feel like the amount of middle-aged men and women still acting and dressing like how I'd expect an early 20 year old to act is kind of odd. Also, everybody seems to be on their own skincare routine in recent years because God forbid you get a single wrinkle.

I think a lot of it is nostalgia in that eople always want to relive their ""glory years"" but in doing so I don't think they really make themselves happy, they just try to recreate what can't be recreated and miss out on what could be great experiences that happen as you get ""older.""

Also, I feel like more and more I'm seeing people not wanting to ever retire. Yes, some of this is by choice but honestly I know A LOT of people who just refuse to retire. They'll say they're ""retiring"" than go and do their ""retirment job"" which is a full-time job still or they'll be contracted by the company they retired from to continue working there in some way for several more years.

I've noticed this more in the last couple years more than ever, its like people are just afraid to enter their next phase of life.

329,0,"Lately, I‚Äôve noticed something strange. I tend to imagine and visualize things very vividly especially when I deeply want something to happen. I‚Äôve read that strong visualization and emotional belief are essential parts of manifestation.

Recently, I gave an online assessment for a company. It went well, and I was confident I‚Äôd get shortlisted. I started manifesting every day, picturing myself working there, receiving my salary, and living that reality. I kept doing this with a lot of belief and positive energy for over a week.

But when the results came out, I wasn‚Äôt even selected for an interview. I felt very disappointed. This isn‚Äôt the first time either whenever I visualize and believe in something deeply, the outcome usually doesn‚Äôt turn out in my favor.

Is there something I might be doing wrong in the manifestation process? Has anyone else experienced something similar or found ways to shift this pattern?

Like they would accidentally come out of their sockets when my mom was holding my arm and I try to run well my mom is still holding my arm then I had to be put in the emergency room to get my arms back in their sockets.

People are always talking about how the kids are in trouble because they have the attention span of a goldfish and, well, that's bad. But I've also really struggled with my own attention span and I do think it's because of my use of social media. When I was a teenager I actually spent hours playing guitar and learning music from books, without a computer in front of me. I also read books, I wasn't a huge reader but I did read. When I was in college I definitely noticed a sharp decline in my attention span as I used my phone more and became more addicted to reddit and YouTube, but that was also tempered by having to complete assignments. These days I think I've let it really slide. I spend way to much time on Reddit and TikTok and YouTube than I'd care to admit. When I try to pickup my guitar and learn a new song or something, I have a really hard time focusing my attention on learning the patterns and usually get distracted within 5-10 minutes despite having access to songster and guitarpro which are amazing pieces of learning software that I would've loved to have back when all I had was inaccurate ultimate guitar transcripts and tab books. Its something  I've become more consciously aware of this year and am fighting to reclaim my attention span by reading books and generally consuming slower paced forms of media. But I still spend too much time on Reddit and TikTok.

A big one for us is ""people who say that, usually are!"" it's a 30 rock reference and it's Tracy Morgan's character responding to someone who says ""I'm classy!"" so we tend to use it if someone is declaring they are classy, rich, nice, etc.

378,0,"So, Ive been seeing about how the Annabelle doll from Ed and Lorraine supposedly got moved from its case.

However, I have a distinct memory of rumors years ago of her going missing, meaning already out of her case. I then saw a video from their son in law, Tony Spera, showing Annabelle and saying ""shes not missing, she didnt get out on her own. I took her."" Or around that idea.

Does anyone else remember that? Because, now there are videos ive seen being blessed, or moved, or when it was moved, etc. 

What's worse, I just spent an hour looking for that video of Tony Spera and I cannot find it. Years ago when I saw it, it was his last video at that time. I would check once in a while and notice he juat stopped making videos.

There has to be something logical other then a made up memory. I remember watching after seeing videos that ""oh, she got out and no one knows where she is!""

Personally, I don't think the doll is haunted or anything, its just not finding some information i remember clearly. "

I kept writing for some time until I got tired and decided to take a break. I turned off my laptop and sat back and just started to casually look around. Then I made eye contact with the girl I just mentioned. I thought she was really cute and I think it showed because I unconsciously let out a subtle smile. She smiled back and quickly went back to her tablet and kept reading. I also turned on my laptop and resumed my work but kept thinking ""I should talk to her"" but at the same time thought it would be creepy. I don't have trouble talking to women as long as we've previously introduced or we've met somewhere like during class. But this time it was the first time I've seen this girl, didn't know anything about her or who she was. And I've always felt like approaching a complete stranger it's a little creepy. Anyway I just kept working, and would occasionally look her way but she was wearing headphones and didn't break eye contact with her tablet. Like half an hour later I noticed she was packing her stuff and getting ready to leave. I thought I should just ask for her name. But it was like hearing two voices in my head, one saying do it and the other one saying it would be uncomfortable or freaky. So she just left and I never said a word. Considering I've going to campus for more than a year and this is the first time I've seen her (also we're over 30.000 students) I'd says my chances of seeing her again are very low.

My bursitis instantly went away and running because way easier. I tried to put on my old shoes and instantly started to feel pain.

The wind is blowing, it's so warm. Where I grew up, we got this in August maybe. I moved to a desert region last year and now it's like this in June!

Makes me remember summers at my grandparents house, we took a week-long trip there almost every summer. That smell of dry grass...or hot wet grass during the late morning when you'd be filling up the kiddie pool.

Late summer evenings when you could finally throw open all the windows and it didnt feel creepy for some reason. It felt more like, there might be a carnival down the street. Fried food, cotton candy. You might smell your neighbor's dinner cooking as the street lights came on...

Popsicles for breakfast, lunch sandwiches at the community pool. A special trip to the lake beach on Saturday, where you might catch a glimpse of your crush.

From what I can see, traveling usually involves going somewhere new, seeing new things, maybe trying new food or experiencing different cultures. But that whole ‚Äúseeing new things‚Äù aspect just doesn‚Äôt click with me as fun or meaningful.

I‚Äôm just genuinely curious because so many people seem passionate about travel, and I feel like I‚Äôm missing something fundamental about what makes it rewarding.
What am I not seeing here?"
399,0,"There are many people out there that feel like they need to be constantly busy and stimulated at work and that they would rather be crazy stressed out because it makes the day go by faster. 

I am not one of those people. I work as an IT systems administrator an and had my fair share of terrible jobs before I got here. I've worked in restaurants, I've worked in warehouses, I've worked in horrendously managed small computer companies in client-facing roles. Stressed out all the time, absolute hell on Earth while I was at work, I would spend my time off of work dreading having to go back to work. 

Now? I was able to work my way up into a pretty cushy role. I worked my ass off to get here and it took 8 years of grinding it out but we are finally in a position where most of our job as a department is simply monitoring for problems and fixing them where they come up. 

On any given day, I have maybe 2 or 3 hours of actual work to do and the rest of my time is going on walks, taking coffee breaks, bullshitting with my coworkers or browsing Reddit. It's boring but I'm making way more money than I ever thought I would and I love the fact that I'm getting paid more than I ever have to relax for most of the day. 

My team and I worked very hard to get ourselves to this position. A lot of automation, a lot of replacing unreliable solutions and technology now, A lot of grinding it out and long nights but I feel like I finally made it.

Of course there are busy days and sometimes major things happen that require a lot of work in a high pressure situation but those days are few and far between. "
400,0,"For me personally, there are quite a few things

Everyone around me see as unreliable due to my somewhat clumsy personality. But in reality, I can handle situations preety well only by myself. I handle things very well, I can make deals and not only this, I am very good at managing things. Still my family things I'm clumsy so I don't even bother showing them my reliable side.


Also we can include, my maturity levels too. 

My family thinks I am very immature . People normally say my younger brother is the older one.  But actually I am very good at consoling people, Im usually the one keeping my family intact, I am usually thr one solving conflicts. This contradicts my nautre a lot lol it's just I cry very easily due to my emotional personality so everyone thinks I'm immature.

It's fun to have these contradictory nature. What's yours??"
401,0,"I think the reason I liked it is because I love the type of shows that are basically about people living their daily life with a laidback vibe. I also liked the concept of these four kids living their life on the weekend and getting into situations. I also thought it could have some funny dialogue at times and could have some nice morality at times. It's been a long time since I watched the show, but one episode I recall really liking was when Lor had to do well on a test to avoid having to go to military school and it led to a heartwarming ending. I also thought Tino's mom was really cool and probably one of my favorite parents in a Disney cartoon, with how she would give helpful advice and just like her son, she had a sense of sarcasm that I liked

I hardly see anyone talk about it, which makes me think it's not really remembered much. I see people get nostalgic about Hey Arnold and I've even seen people get nostalgic about Recess (not as much as Arnold, but there are some people who are nostalgic for Recess), but I hardly ever see people be like ""The Weekenders was my childhood"". I'm not sure why it isn't remembered, since it aired on ABC during the One Saturday Morning block, so it was available even to those without cable. One last thing I'll mention is I love the theme song. It's such a fun theme song"

Any way you like to cook em, scrambled, over easy, sunny side up, etc...

Vs

Typical pancakes, crepes, etc (idk of many ways to cook pancakes)

I like my eggs scrambled with a bit of heavy cream mixed in, butter in the pan, cook it slow on low heat with some shredded cheddar sprinkled on top. Maybe chives or diced peppers. Eggs have more steps in my mind to make them perfect, but pancakes seem harder to get right. I like them light and fluffy, but I tend to mess up the measurements, probably because I eye everything. I think pancakes are little harder to get right, especially something fancier like crepes."

And it ended up being the best day I‚Äôve had in a long time.

We spent the whole day by the beach, just talking, laughing, doing absolutely nothing, and then had the most amazing dinner. Nothing crazy happened. No big adventure. But it was peaceful and fun and just felt refreshing.

413,0,"I‚Äôve been reflecting on what actually makes life rich and meaningful, and I‚Äôm curious about your perspectives.

For me, I think it comes down to a few core things: having work that contributes to society and makes me feel appreciated, maintaining a good relationship with myself (inner peace, I guess?), and having a partner who I genuinely enjoy spending time with and who brings out the best in me.

I also think continuous growth is essential - challenging myself with new experiences, never stopping learning, that kind of thing. But I realize that underlying all of this is the need to actually understand what brings *me* happiness in the first place. That requires new experiences and honest self-reflection to figure out what truly resonates.

The thing is, I‚Äôm probably missing out on sources of fulfillment I haven‚Äôt even considered yet. Maybe there are whole dimensions of happiness I‚Äôm blind to because of my particular background or way of thinking.

So I‚Äôm curious - what do you think are the essential elements of a good life? What brings you genuine satisfaction or meaning? Are there things you‚Äôve discovered that surprised you about what actually makes you happy?

I‚Äôd love to hear different perspectives, especially if you think there are important aspects I haven‚Äôt mentioned!"

418,0,"I‚Äôve been thinking about how certain moments or experiences can really shift how we see the world.

For me, it was meeting someone who genuinely accepted me for who I am - not trying to change me or judge me, just complete acceptance. It sounds simple, but it completely changed how I saw myself and made me way more willing to put myself out there.

I‚Äôve also found that being around people who are actively working toward their goals or just approaching life with genuine positivity has been incredibly motivating. There‚Äôs something contagious about that kind of energy that makes you want to step up your own game.

It made me realize how much our environment and the people we surround ourselves with can shape not just our mood, but our entire approach to life.

What about you? Was there a moment, person, or experience that made you see yourself or the world differently and actually stuck with you?"
419,0,"I was thinking back on how, when I was little, my grandpa took me and my sister to his friend's place, who happened to be some bird expert lady (I was like 8, so I don't know what she actually did). She was tagging and releasing hummingbirds for a project and was telling us about how they're illegal to hold or capture without a permit. She let my sister and I each hold one of the hummingbirds while she tagged them, then let us release them right after. It was such a cool little moment.

I realized that very few people have ever/will ever get that opportunity, but now I'm curious about what other cool stuff everyone else has gotten to do!"

Then I got close to my exit and on the over pass you could see a line of fire trucks and a big flag being lifted up on the truck ladder. I realized that they were honoring fallen firefighters.   My heart ached for them and the families.  I‚Äôve never seen anything like that in real life.  It was VERY powerful for me.  As I passed it I said a prayer for those lost and their families.  üò¢

425,0,"
I‚Äôm always trying to improve how I think through complex problems and make better decisions, but I suspect I have blind spots I‚Äôm not aware of.

My current approach usually involves breaking things down systematically - I‚Äôll factor problems into their core components, then do scenario analysis (if X condition, then Y; if Z condition, then W). I find that defining these conditions clearly upfront prevents a lot of fuzzy thinking later.

I also try to balance rational analysis with emotional intelligence - sometimes the ‚Äòlogical‚Äô choice isn‚Äôt actually the right one when you factor in psychological realities or long-term satisfaction. And I always ask myself what the essential question really is, rather than getting caught up in surface-level details.

But I‚Äôm curious: what thinking frameworks or mental models do you rely on that I might be missing? Do you have ways of catching your own cognitive biases? Specific techniques for seeing problems from angles you normally wouldn‚Äôt consider?

I‚Äôm particularly interested in identifying the kinds of blind spots that prevent good thinking - the stuff you don‚Äôt know you don‚Äôt know. What approaches have helped you think more clearly about complex situations?"
426,0,"Two big things I'm currently working on and just wanted to show it in here ^^

I've discovered that the more I focus on what I lack (or think I lack) in my life the unhappier I am. As a result I can't really appreciate how much my life has improved in the past year. I've met cool new people, got myself into the gym, got myself engaged in some organisations and figured myself, my strengths and weaknesses out (at least for the most part for nothing's ever chiseled in stone). If I had told my younger self how far I'd come by the age of 18 I probably couldn't have fancied it at all. Lately, I really craved some success in my romantic life too and felt miserable and sorrowful because that's a part of life I lack in. By now I've come to the conclusion that I only waste time and energy descending into self-pity about it. I'll definitely create opportunities and put myself out there but I'll let it all happen by the time it's meant to be. ""Comparison is the thief of joy."" 

Another important aspect for me is courage. I often catch myself lacking honesty about my feelings because I'm worried about what the other could think about me. That's absolutely one thing that my present self is highly focused on and what I really want to improve because it's so so crucial in relationships with friends and partners.

Have a nice day, people of Reddit :D

427,0,"I have 6 current piercings (2 lobes on each side, a tragus, and a conch). 
I have had many other piercings in the 12 years I have been able to have them. 
But like... What's the point. Everytime I got them, it was just a ""I'm bored, and this is a cute little piercing"". 
But really? They are a pain in the butt.
Those first few months - a year of healing. Daily attention to it, making sure you don't touch it a certain way. Annoying. 
They aren't always comfortable. I use flatbacks, and the shortest I can get. Fairly comfortable, but it's still a pain (literally) with my ear bud presses against my tragus. Or if an over the ear headphone presses the conch. (and they are fully healed, it's just that it's added pressure.). 

I finally took my nose ring of 4 years out because it's not like it was doing anything. It wasn't enhancing my look. It was just shiny and I liked it. But I was sick of everytime blowing my nose it would press into my nostril a bit (again, very short flatback, so it's not like it happened all the time.) the final straw for my nose piercing was that it closes SO quick, even when healed. I've have 3 MRIs and 2 surgery this past year, so I obviously had to take it out. If I out it in immediately after, I wouldn't have issues. But I waited like 3 days after surgery (because I was out of it and not a concern). And it jusg HURT trying to get it back in. And I wasn't about to go get it restreched. So I just took it out.

So, obviously I'm not AGAINST having piercings. But how does everyone else feel about their piercings? "

* Muay Thai
* Firearms (gun shooting)

429,0,"What things make you happy? What things in life are the ones that keep you totally unbothered and help you stay the course, no matter what happens to you? What makes living worth it to you? What is the conversation about life you are having with yourself? How do you reconcile yourself with life?

For me, personally, it's all the things I **want** to do. There are so many things to explore, to do, to experience!  I sometimes fear I will run out of time before I get to do all those things I want to do! Like I want to read so many more books.  Or learn how to play guitar - that's been patiently waiting for me to pick it up for years. Countries I definitely want to visit before I perish. I want to finish writing my book. I want to achieve my personal body goals. Learn more languages! 

Or moments of small joys that make life so pretty: like a baby smiling at me or a toddler running towards me in excitement; shared laughter with friends; sharing hugs! Seeing a field covered in flowers under a clear blue sky or taking a ride early in the morning with a sunrise. Or just being able to make someone else's day better with your presence- what more do you need?

How do you get through life? What makes life beautiful to you?"

We mostly jumped from swings, rolling down hills full of boulders etc...

But one day I thought it would be great to climb up a tree and then jump down from it. So me and my friend went in to the forest and found the perfect oak tree. 

An important note: I had a hoodie with a zipper.

I climbed up to one of the the branches (about 3 meters up) while my friend stood next to the tree watching me. In the moment I jumped, I felt a hard yank around my neck and my vision turned black as I was hanging in the air.

Apprently my hoodie got caught on to one of the smaller branches, it almost undressed me but it got stuck around my neck, I was hanging about two meters in the air screaming bloody murder!

My friend froze and didn't know what to do, about one minute in I managed to set myself free.

 I recently was a part of my mommy‚Äôs funeral. I went up several times, one particular time there was a bang, something metal fell. 
  My family were looking at me saying omg what did you do?   I‚Äôm walking around her casket, looking for anything that may have bent or moved and I found nothing. 
I turn around and my brother lets me know he put the first bell of mom‚Äôs collection in her casket, when I leaned in on it, the bell fell to the bottom of her casket.  Everyone started laughing!

441,0,"Am a doc, so have not had truly free time in years, but recently moved to a different hosp. where working hours are lenient and I have most evenings off. 
I have started gymming, and learning the flute, also want to read a lot of novels, go for runs, learn the guitar and dwell in spirituality, and maybe keep up with my curriculum(never ending learning). 
I get free at 3pm and have to go to the hosp for about an hour in the evening for rounds.
Really need advice from better sorted people, on how to pack everything in my day so I can make the most of this free stint.

Hi everyone!
I‚Äôve been reflecting on my learning experiences over the years, and I‚Äôm curious about what really makes the difference between slow, frustrating learning and fast, effective learning.
From my own experience, I think the two most crucial factors are:

1.	Finding the fundamental principles first - Instead of getting lost in details, focusing on what‚Äôs truly essential and foundational to the subject

2.	Getting to the right teacher/mentor as quickly as possible - Someone who really understands the subject and can guide you efficiently"
445,0,"Like if you‚Äôre at the grocery store, and you pass in front of someone looking at the racks, even if you‚Äôre not causing them to move, do you say ‚Äúexcuse me‚Äù, as in ‚Äúexcuse me for passing in front of you/temporarily blocking your line of sight‚Äù?

I do this habitually, and I‚Äôm shocked by how many ppl don‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs just basic manners."

447,0,"I love fashion and regularly scroll Pinterest to look at outfits but being a grown up gets in my way of living out my dreams. Also, I dislike getting attention and I end up wearing mostly unisex, black clothes even in my personal time. but recently, I‚Äôve been doing some fun stuff with my appearance like doing my hair differently and putting on more fun makeup. The time to buy some new clothes is coming up since the weather is getting warmer, so I‚Äôm thinking of switching things up and wearing some more frilly, feminine stuff like I‚Äôve been saving on my feed! 

To answer my own question, I‚Äôd be in the office with a rococo ball gown or spaghetti western cowboy clothes if nothing was stopping me. "

449,0,"After a recent stint of unemployment when my teaching job ended, I finally got offered a remote position last week, however, my internet was acting spotty, and it caused me to miss a lot of my very first shifts. Then over this past weekend, it went out and stayed out. I scheduled a tech for the earliest visit, which was tomorrow afternoon. 

Today I got a text that the issue was an outage and had been fixed, and suggested I cancel the appointment. So I did, then found out it actually was not fixed shortly after. 

Started a chat with customer service of my isp, explained the situation, and asked if I could still get the visit tomorrow. The rep was able to get me a visit for tomorrow morning (!!!), which if it works out means I should be back to work tomorrow on time, fingers crossed. Then gave me a credit on my bill and an appointment to talk to billing about reimbursing me for the missed days last week.

450,0,"Some fun details that you didn't ask for:

- Why do I have a RedBubble artist account? Because a few years ago my college group needed merchs and I didn't have the financial authority or official logos to order them in bulk, so I put them on Redbubble to purchase for myself until the business team got their shit together two years later.

- What were my more recent designs then if they weren't team merch? Terrible puns about engineering software, with the softwares' logos incorporated in the design. I stole two of them from someone I met in class who printed them via a label maker. Thank you random canadian guy in fluid mechanics for the inspo.

- How much did you profit off the sweatshirt? About $7, but I don't actually get paid unless I hit the $20 minimum threshold

- Why am I posting this? Because the power's out at home and I'm bored"
451,0,"I realised my true purpose in life is to get a degree, live somewhere peaceful and quiet and disappear from all social media except Reddit. Preferably, uncontactable from anyone except immediate family members.  


I want to live somewhere, buy a math textbook, a gaming pc and the newest gaming console. Then, I will just spend a couple hours learning some math, a couple hours gaming if I have the strength to do it after finishing my job. If I can, maybe also find a partner for life but that's another cans of worm. 

I don't want to travel somewhere, fly to Japan for luxury shopping and experience or something. I just want to settle down and have a peace and quiet life. And then maybe spend some time loving my family members and friends that I am really close with.

Misunderstandings are normal and obviously more likely in written form, but how frequently are you misunderstood? How much attention do you put on expressing yourself clearly? I often rephrase/rewrite, give examples, list possibilities, add parentheses (like, to clarify what I mean like this), use softening qualifiers like ""like"", ""in my opinion"", ""personally ..."", ""or whatever"" ""idk, but ..."".

458,0,"I feel that it is becoming more difficult to escape the negative news that we are constantly exposed to, and I think that it is easy to get lost in the ocean of negativity and forget the things in life that are positive.

So what are some of the positive things happening in your life that you would like to share?

For me, my sister was recently given some very positive health news that we were all concerned about. It feels like such a weight was lifted from my shoulders, and I am proud of her!"
459,0,"Been thinking about this a lot lately after having dinner with a friend in a crowded restaurant. We sat very close to a couple who were just next right to us, and after telling a friend something funny that happened to me recently, the couple laughed and joined our conversation. We spent the entire night talking and having a great time. Everything happened spontaneously, and I can't recall meeting new people like that in a long time.  
  
I remember that making friends was pretty straightforward before:

* You lived near each other or went to school together
* You hung out in person constantly
* Weekend plans were made face-to-face on Friday at school or work

But now it feels so different:

* We meet people through apps, online communities, or algorithm-suggested ""people you may know""
* Most of our ""hanging out"" happens through screens, gaming, video calls, watching stuff together online
* It is easier to get in touch with people now because of the internet and social media/social apps

**But somehow we're all lonelier than ever???**¬†*(Don't you feel the same way?)* and don't get me wrong, I love that I can maintain friendships with people across the world.¬†**But there's something about spontaneous, in-person connection that feels almost extinct.**  
  
Like, when's the last time you:

* Made a friend while waiting in line somewhere?
* Had a deep conversation with a stranger on public transport?
* Bonded with someone over a shared moment of chaos (delayed flight, power outage, etc.)?
* Just ran into someone and decided to hang out right then?

The weirdest part is we have more ways to connect than ever, but making¬†new¬†friends as an adult feels impossibly hard. Everyone's got their established friend groups, their social media circles, their routine. Breaking into that feels like applying for a job sometimes lol. Maybe I'm just nostalgic, but I miss when friendship felt more accidental and organic.  
  
What do you think? Has the way we make friends actually changed, or am I just getting old and grumpy?¬†What is the good side of the story I'm not seeing or enjoying about how we connect now? And more importantly, how do you actually make genuine new friends as an adult in 2025?"

476,0,"So you're walking or driving across your Town's main near the local laundromat.

What will you do? Do know if you try to pick up the cat in any fashion, it will leave you very sore and maybe missing body parts. You can watch the cat open up the washer and repeatedly jump down picking up every individual piece of clothing and putting it in the washer, struggle with the laundry detergent, then pull out a credit card and swipe the card to pay for it or possibly help what are you going to do."
477,0,"Now how TF did that happen? Well, it was early 2010, and at the time I was 7 years old and in 2nd grade. My mom fell asleep in front of the TV in the living room and I was there next to her, and then early in the morning at like 2:00ish, I turned the TV to PBS because I grew up watching PBS Kids. But since it was 2am, they were showing ""Great Performances,"" and this episode was a performance of an opera called ""Lucia di Lammermoor"" at the Metropolitan Opera House. I remember being so creeped out like ""WTH is this? It's a stage play, I can see that, but that singing is so *weird,* it's like it's a different language. And the actors facial and emotional expressions look kinda scary."" My mom woke up while this was playing and flipped the TV to TLC, but then when she fell back asleep, I'd flip it back to PBS because I was just so fascinated by what I was seeing.

Later on I looked at the DirecTV guide and found out the show I was watching was called ""Great Performances at the Met,"" so I asked my dad what the ""Met"" was, and he thought I was saying ""myth,"" so he said ""a myth is a story that's not proven; that nobody knows for sure if it's true or false."" That's when he brought up that there was a show on the Discovery Channel called ""Mythbusters"" where they do experiments to try and prove or disprove myths. We DVR'd an episode and watched it together, and it was more of a typical Discovery-Channel-style stunt show. It was cool, but I remember wondering ""WTH does this have to do with that creepy opera I saw on PBS at 2am?""

Now of course, I know and understand what this all was. Did you ever go through anything similar?"

Hardwood or tile drive me crazy because it feels the wetness isn't going anywhere and it feels so clammy when my feet are touching those surfaces.

I also dont want to sit down and be rubbing the bottom of my feet with a towel to get them dry. It just feels nice and comfy for the carpet do it.

486,0,"It's weird how our mindset has so much influence on how we perceive something.

I know we frame things, we color things, we have our own view of ourself, others, situations, the world.

And then there's a thing happening and all of a sudden it is important and we just put time and effort into that same activity that we perceived as.. ""It drains me..."", ""It makes me tired.."" or plain: ""I don't wanna do it!"".

The past 20 years I have been using a dryer. My mom has always dried her clothes by hanging.

I was wondering why she's very fit compared to other old people I see. She does stuff. She hangs her and my dad clothing, that's fitness. She's tending to the garden, pulling plants, pushing plants, moving stuff around (don't know why, but that plant in pot needs to be moved...).

Since 2 months I have been hanging my clothes. I'm starting to see household chores as part of a fitness/wellbeing rituals. They've 2 goals:

- Maintenance of my environment, and increase hygiene and order.
- Maintenance of my health, and increase my fitness and energy capacity (the more often I do it, the easier it becomes).

Why do I write this... Maybe someone might be inspired to hang their clothes more often instead of using the dryer so they have done the physical exercise their body needs. And it's better for your wallet, clothing and it smells way better! The fresh air is not reproducable. 

Have a nice day!

488,0,"I hope this does not break rule 6 but out of all places in the world, US-Americans have to be the one to call me weird for putting mayo on my fries? It is fried potato and mayo is fantastic to it. I cannot even call it aquired taste because American cuisine has so many dishes with mayonnaise, but putting mayo on fries is ""demonic"" (as my friend lovingly dubbed it). 

For the country of the free they surely are restrictive with their mayonnaise use. 

Everyone in Germany has fries with mayo. We even have regional names for fries with mayo and ketchup. I am shocked. I have seen popeyes menus and they have so many different sauces. But mayo and fries crosses the line? I feel like I am in some fever dream because I cannot make sense of this. This feels like some form of culture shock.

Edit: so the comments are either ""there are millions of Americans and there are Americans who do this"" and then there is comments slandering mayo and my mother

Edit 2: well, I was not talking about ketchup and mayo. I was talking more about just mayo. "
489,0,"When I was young I was online looking up toys I had very vague memories of, just to cure curiosity and trigger more memories. I couldn't find the exact version of a toy that I really loved anywhere, until I finally found this YouTube video with someone showing it off. I should've known what was coming, from the time it was posted and the warning at the beginning, ""This is not for kids"". I thought the warning was just some garbled from an old person who didn't know how the Internet works or was a heads up and we were going into ""this video has old pawpaw cussing like a sailor, I'm just here to show off a listing or do a toy recall warning""  territory. Nah, it was a very poorly edited part-frame picture of the Exorcist girl. It actually did startle me and hurt because my ears are sensitive to sharp noises but otherwise it was this noise from a video game if I remember correctly.

Things like this really interest me, it's an entire anomaly. I guess the warning at the beginning could be the obligatory ""I'm not responsible if your kids see this"" or ""it's not my fault if you scare someone with this"" but then if kids aren't getting scared then what's the point of doing Sesame Street or even making the video? People are so weird. And honestly with my experience in the 2000s and with the way the video was made I got the vibes that the poster legitimately didn't want kids near this but put it up anyway --for whatever reason because this was a really really weird period of the internet. But that begs the question, who is that for?? I've seen a lot of other stuff like this even things that aren't screamers but especially for something like that."

I remember feeling so embarrassed and stupid after getting out and it still holds a very clear place in my memory. Every time I think of it I just laugh at my idiotic self and think nostalgically about the spontaneous nature of who I was as a kid. I kind of miss that."

Today, she texted me on tiktok and seemed quite annoyed that I viewed her profile. She knows who I am. I'm pretty sure because we sat next to each other in a few classes, and my profile picture has me in so. I'm just wondering why she would be so annoyed. Surely, she would be happy that I viewed her profile and watched 1 or 2 of her videos because it meant she got more views? "

But I gave it another shot recently and tried something new. Before ordering, I used app that let me see how stuff fits on your own body. You don‚Äôt just pick a size, it kinda builds a version of you, then shows how the clothes would look. Not perfect, but surprisingly accurate (+-)

Tried on a hoodie and a jacket virtually, liked how they looked, and hit order. When they came, I was fully expecting to be disappointed again. But they both fit better than half the stuff Ive bought in-store.

520,0,"The other day I was walking down the street, and it was one of those days when I was in a good mood. I came up with this theory: the more a person is sociable, open, direct, positive, and eager to meet others, the less they feel the weight of social isolation or loneliness.

Let me explain better: imagine that you and your friend move 200 km away from your home, and even though you‚Äôre only 10 km apart from each other in this new city, you live in the same town.

One of you is positive and actively tries to connect with people, talking, laughing, even just saying hi to others in the city, at the post office, walking the dog, at a restaurant, a bar, or the library. Basically, he greets everyone and always finds a way to break the ice. Maybe by asking, ‚ÄúIs the water drinkable?‚Äù or ‚ÄúAre these napkins here to clean up food?‚Äù or something like that. He always finds a way to strike up a conversation and ends up finding someone to spend time with each day.

The other friend is also positive, but doesn‚Äôt make connections with everyone. He sticks to just saying hi. Shyness and social anxiety are the first things that hold him back. I thought about how the first person doesn‚Äôt really feel alone in any environment because he manages to quickly make new friends, by engaging with people. Whereas the second, due to social anxiety, can‚Äôt really build those connections.

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve gone to the beach. There are 300 people lying on sunbeds, but you feel alone because you don‚Äôt know anyone. Just by asking one of them if the bar sells ice cream, you‚Äôve made a connection, and now you feel a little less ‚Äúalone"" even tho you have that inner feeling of ""shame"".

How many of you have felt that way? It takes so little to immediately click with someone, to feel a sense of warmth, and sometimes, that little spark leads to an invitation to play cards or do something else together.

That‚Äôs why I think yes, we can be mysterious, quiet, and speak little, but that should come after we‚Äôve gotten to know people. At first, we need to make the effort to feel a little embarrassed in front of others, to take that first step, to always break the ice, to be more ""extroverted"", just at first.

  
Also, take in account that you'll see and hear people bad talking about how you always ""piss off"" other people by relaxing or living their day, or that you are ""restless"" or the antipathies that arise from others who speak badly of you because you are always the ""center of attention"".

Know that it is not exactly like that, but it is you who are making connections, and to do them, you MUST make the first moves, always

Why think of the people in your town as one big family?

I was reflecting on those who feel lonely, maybe because they‚Äôve lost a parent, ended a relationship, or just feel disconnected. This perspective might offer some comfort.

You're never truly alone if you believe you can make friends with anyone in your town. Sure, there will be some people you don't get along with, but probably 70% are open to connection.

With that mindset, you always have a support system. No matter what happens, people will know you as that friendly, sociable person.

It was then removed again for discussing AI. Considering the fact that it was removed before it was even posted, it was likely run through an AI filter, which I find hilariously ironic. The main subject also wasn't AI. Related, sure, but only nominally. In fact, I specified that my major issue was with the content itself, not the method of creation, and gave additional examples to demonstrate.

When i go out to work and then i come back home somewhere along the way I can do small talk and if i am lucky enough I can insert humour and sarcasm in the small talk and get a chuckle out of the person, it can be a man or a woman. 

I have given compliment to a man on their suit and i told them they looked really good in them because their colours felt like a really nice combination along with their skin colour and their jacket colour and boots. They would keep looking at themselves for a long while.

Give them a hug with words :D

And then with women...
Women are fairly talkative and easygoing so I make occasional conversation about the current situation I'm in and ask about theirs and see if i can add some irony or humour to give them a chuckle.

I know most of people reading this have been working and impacting real business too and you guys are lot professional than me.

591,0,"Theres no good reason it should be such a struggle to understand and respect each other ... interacting casually with a variety of different people should be common place if we were to recognize a sense of community as the powerful asset that it is.

Whatever it is we're going through and however we might perceive things, regardless of our differences, we share some similarities that are basic to being a human being. Its through this common ground where we can plant ideas and consider them, and grow to some degree. We also understand our capabilities and can learn to communicate more effectively, in order to do whats in our best interests as a species (lots of things) ... but we have to hold that space for each other in a mature way that allows us to be present and open minded. That's where we show up and speak on a real level, supporting authenticity and creative freedom and experimenting non judgmentally. But we dont interact as a society in ways that benefit us in the long term, and our participation in these unsustainable systems is a disservice to our more enlightened better halves.  We can accept each other, in an attempt to break new grounf that allows us to chsnnel our energy towards the greater good, just as we knownwe could and should if we wish to break through the barriers in place. That's where courage comes in. In the process, we respond differently to the norms that we find contribute to these disconnectedness. 

Because really ... do our quirks and personality traits throw us off so much that we dont think ts worth trying to connect & strike a balance? Should we try changing? In what ways/in what spaces? 

Or are we who we are regardless and deserving of the freedom to express ourselves authentically, and experiment with being radical in your willingness to try new things ... for the sake of progressing?

And aren't we all a person with value? Aren't we equals? So whos to say only some of us sjould have an advantage,  and be granted the levers to power? Who's to say we dont all deserve a place at the table, and to be free from the threat of violence? Because, as a dedicated bunch,  there's a lot of potential we have to be a positive force.  So lets try to do that, and attempt to be bigger people and set some good examples so we can travel those roads to a brighter future. Its available to us ... we just have to act during these precious moments and speak frankly about our circumstances and the conditions we're in, before we lose all control, and be unwilling participants in a chaotic, unstable, dark world that burdens us instead of benefits us. Lets do what we know we must in order to live a life worth living. Just take a chsnce and allow yourself the grace to try and approach your brothers and sisters as souls in need of a caring environment so that we might flourish instead of perish. The choice is ours to make.

606,0,"You'd assume that when we mean rural, slightly more northern Canada is infested with bugs, we're just complaining about clouds of mosquitoes at dusk, right? Wrong. You're being eaten alive by a whole new level.


There aren't *just* clouds of mosquitoes. You get a variety pack all day long. They go at you like you're naked and dripped in honey. There's giant horseflies (or ""taons"" in Canadian French) who straight up rips off a little chunk of skin with its mandible to feed on your blood. Being bitten by a horsefly HURTS and it leaves an itchy, painful bump for days. It's like a jellyfish sting. And they're also mean as hell, unlike black flies (who also drink your blood). Then there's tiny midges, or ""br√ªlots"" from the word ""br√ªle,"" ""burn."" They burn you. Their bite is like a tiny cigarette burn and leaves red dots all over you. There's bush flies but they don't actively seek you out unless it's to drink your sweat. There's ticks who bury themselves under your skin for days and can give you Lyme disease‚Äî and their numbers are rising with climate change. Mosquitoes are bigger, more aggressive and itch harder than their little city companions, and a lot more than European mosquitoes. There's clouds of each of them and they're all swarming at you. Some places are genuinely impossible to go to in summer because they're so bug-infested, like the tall grass field in the back of my late grandfather's land. Rural Canadians love bonfires partly because the smoke keeps bugs away more.


The bugs in rural Canada are the real predators. They feed off humans, deers, bears, moose, foxes, anything. Even trees. There's big invasive bugs that are killing trees in droves like Biblical locusts. Some of them can be an inch big. 


But we have a lot of lakes! So you're safe from blood-thirsty critters in the water, right? Wrong. Most of them are leech-infested, some so badly humans are unable can't swim there. I have regularly seen leeches the length of my entire hand (aka the height of an average smart phone) swimming in shallow water like small black snakes‚Äî water snakes, at least, are scared of humans. After every swim in that cold ass water you gotta have a buddy check you for blood-sucking leeches on your back and you gotta check inside your shorts. There's a gross feeling when tugging on a leech stuck to your skin, it makes me dry heave. They're slimy and slippery yet clench powerfully like a slimy hamstring. They THINK. They FIGHT to stay on you. We also have spiders that walk on water! If you're unlucky to be a bit more to the southern side of rural Ontario/Qu√©bec, you also have to worry about an aggressive, carnivorous snapping turtle the size of a car wheel biting off something. They're mean and can bite your fingers clean off. They're Canadian gators. Water won't protect you.


All in all, you'd think we worry more about bears and moose and wolves and geese more in rural Canada. No. Bugs. EVERYTHING is mean and trying to drink your blood.


Edit: Northerners who laugh at my pitiful score of 12 bites in 2 days one time saying they can get 12 bites in a minute at the right time and place, and are correcting me saying I didn't mention deer flies or those big loud helicopter-ass beetles who sound like stallions of Satan are proving EXACTLY MY POINT. Apparently the dock spiders who walk on water bite too. Canadian bug country will EAT YOU ALIVE."

612,0,"Ive had a New 3ds XL since I was a kid, and I just picked it up to seriously play for the first time in years, and immediately decided to mod it, and realized, holy shit, why am I even trying to use a computer or steam deck to emulate anything retro at all? It obviously runs 3ds and ds games perfectly, AND it has built in sorta-but-not-really emulators that run every GBA game ive tried so far absolutely perfectly. And apparently it runs pretty much every GB, SNES, essentially every Nintendo system that came before it outside of the wii and wii u very well, and even at least some playstation 1 games. 

And if you dont have a 3ds, you can so easily find people reselling them.

615,0,"Let‚Äôs go way back to my Grade 7, pre-pandemic days. I was a new student at my school, so of course I was shy. But once you get to know me, it‚Äôs all kulitan and kabaliwan. Back then, I was eager to make friends. Even though I was super shy, I still gave it my best. It didn‚Äôt take long before I made friends, and we even formed a group called OT6 (Only the 6), haha. Our group was made up of one girl who had been studying there her whole life, and the five of us who were all new students.

Fast forward to the end of the school year, our group started to fall apart. Only four of us remained, including me. The other two found new friends, but we still talked from time to time. Then during our Ibong Adarna roleplay practice, a rumor started spreading about us, the remaining four from OT6. People were saying we were backstabbing the two who left our group, which confused us because we never talked about them at all. The issue got so bad that it reached Grade 12 students and even some teachers. We almost got suspended without even knowing why. For the rest of the school year, we were bullied by almost everyone, even our classmates. It felt like the four of us were the only ones sticking together. When things finally calmed down, we found out it was actually the two who left the group who spread the rumors. So in the end, the real backstabbers were them. We were the victims, yet we were the ones blamed and insulted. To make things worse, the four of us even failed a subject because our teacher favored the two who spread the rumors. Our parents were almost called for a meeting that they shouldn‚Äôt have even been involved in. We were treated like the black sheep of the school. I was traumatized. I never expected that someone I once considered a friend would be the one to drag me down.

Then the pandemic happened. Everything went online. I laid low to the point where no one would even notice me. I did that for the rest of the pandemic because I was scared someone would recognize me. Grade 10 came, and things started going back to normal. At the end of Grade 9, I had made two close friends. We were a trio: one guy (Durian) and one girl (Clown). The three of us were super close. They even knew what I went through in Grade 7. It traumatized me so much that I didn‚Äôt want to meet new people anymore. Of course, I had other friends, but nothing compared to the bond the three of us had. Clown always told me I should try making new friends and reminded me that she wouldn‚Äôt always be around. So when Grade 10 ended, I was determined to open up more. Most of our classmates were transferring to other schools, so it felt like the right time.

Grade 11 started. Durian and I were both in the STEM strand, while Clown was in ABM. We all had different classrooms, so we were separated. I was so scared because I barely knew anyone, and most of them were new students. Then I made a friend. Let‚Äôs call her Snob. She was the first to approach me, and we instantly clicked. Two more girls joined us later on. I even told them what happened back in Grade 7. They were all fun, cheerful, and super cute. But among the four of us, Snob and I were the closest. We‚Äôd go to the mall after class. Even though I had new friends, I still hung out with Durian and Clown, just not as often. Then Snob started liking one of our friends. I suggested she hang out with Durian and Clown since they were already playing with the person she like. At first, she was shy, but soon enough they were playing like they‚Äôd known each other forever. Our trio became a group of four.

But one day, Snob suddenly started ignoring me. She didn‚Äôt talk to me the whole day, like she was snobbing me on purpose. I had no idea why. But with Clown, she acted like nothing happened. Since Snob started getting close to Clown, her attitude changed. She was always frowning, easily annoyed, and barely talking to me or the other girls. This went on for the rest of the school year. She always seemed irritated or down. Before Grade 12 started, I heard rumors that Clown was backstabbing me. This time, I heard it from my sister. Snob and Clown became super close, and I felt like I had never even been part of their friendship. Before I found out about the rumors, we would still hang out sometimes. But whenever we did, I was always left out. They‚Äôd talk about things I didn‚Äôt know and sometimes leave me behind. So I stopped hanging out with them. Eventually, I found out that both Snob and Clown were the ones spreading things about me. My sister heard it directly from her friends. It was happening again. They knew what I had been through, and yet they still turned their backs on me.

When Grade 12 started, I ignored both of them and made new friends from my Grade 11 class. I told them about what happened, and apparently, they had issues with Snob and Clown too, which explained why they didn‚Äôt like them either. One day, Snob suddenly approached me. She asked why I wasn‚Äôt talking to her. Later, one of my friends told me that Snob said she don't like me for not noticing her. What she didn‚Äôt know was that I already knew everything she had said about me. She apologized, but to this day, I still don‚Äôt trust her. As for Clown, I don‚Äôt talk to her at all anymore. She just went along with it and chose not to speak to me either.


TL;DR / Summary:

In Grade 7, I was a new and shy student who made friends and became part of a group called OT6. The group eventually broke apart, and false rumors spread that my friends and I were backstabbing the others. We were bullied, almost suspended, and failed a subject even though we did nothing wrong. It left me traumatized, so I stayed quiet during the pandemic.

By Grade 10, I made two close friends named Durian and Clown. In Grade 11, I made a new friend named Snob and formed a new group. Later on, Snob became close to Clown and started ignoring me. Eventually, I found out they were talking behind my back, even though they knew what I had been through before. I felt betrayed again.

In Grade 12, I stopped talking to both Snob and Clown and made new friends who also had problems with them. Snob tried to apologize, but I no longer trusted her. Now, I have moved on and no longer talk to either of them."

she also said yes so we still talk each other as a friends so much end up playing games together in lockdown our bond was getting stronger but she recently had breakup so she was moving on and ik because she used to tell me everything even small , small problem or anything happening in her life , so in 11 class i actually developed feelings for her and she got to know she was not prepared for this so she starting spreading fake rumours about me in class 11 to my coaching friends so i get a reason to hate her and because of hate i easily move on but i was still attached with that bond . IDK why she did this at this moment 


So recently i met mutual friend who was close to her and ik but she told me truth that she started spreading rumours about you because you started liking her she also showed chat too & her last text was i dont want to hurt him please krishna(god), my plan is good? He will hate me and i dont have problem even if he blames me .
After that she told me that me she ghosted everyone even me too and moved on from delhi to another state idk where  ( she didn't told anyone) & deactivated all her social media accounts.

You can also stay in front of a hotel window late at night because the solitude is just right for freedom

for example-- my (34F) dad (63M) has always had a lot of trouble connecting with me on my interests. I'm pretty nerdy, artsy, and academic, and he's just none of those things at all. He's never really been able to talk to me about anything, or I him. We also just historically haven't gotten along well because of our personalities.

Now that I'm an adult and do my own grocery shopping, one day I had happened to mention to him that I purchased some really yummy pluots (apricot + plum hybrid) during small talk. He had never heard of them, so he went and got one, and now literally every year during stone fruit season he sends me multiple texts asking how the stone fruit are right now in \[whatever city I live in at that moment\]. it's just so funny, and even outside of stone fruit season I'll get a random text that's like ""man I cant wait for stone fruit season!"" or ""almost stone fruit season! Can't wait!""

\- time (massaging the oil onto my lashes for around 60 seconds - trying not to fall asleep while standing in front of the mirror with my eyes closed)  
\- microfiber cloth (I had tried it before and I have to admit it works better than cotton pads, even if it's not quite the miracle some sellers claim it to be)

Little Bear was also super calm and cozy. Cartoon Network was more constant noise like Ed Edd n Eddy or really scary stuff with Courage or lots of violence like Dragon Ball Z and Gundam

I've been thinking about this lately because it happened to me again. Had this friend I used to text constantly, we'd hang out every weekend, knew each other's coffee orders by heart. Then life happened. I started therapy, got into hiking, began caring about different stuff. They stayed exactly where they were, which was fine, but we just... stopped clicking.

No big fight. No ""we need to talk"" moment. Just shorter texts, longer gaps between hangouts, and that weird feeling when you realize you don't really know what's going on in their life anymore. It's like watching someone walk away in slow motion.

Part of me used to think this meant I was being fake or shallow. But honestly? Sometimes you outgrow people the same way you outgrow clothes. Doesn't mean the shirt was bad, just means you're not the same size anymore.

It's saad but also kind of beautiful in a weird way. Like, we're all just figuring ourselves out, and sometimes that means our paths split up.

Anyone else been through this? Hit me up in my DMs if you want to chat about it.

For me, I think a reasonable amount to spend on a dinner date for two people, is about $60-$80 tops, tip not included. In this im counting drinks, a shared appetizer, entree for each person and no deserts. Typical chain restaurant or something little fancier but not expensive.

For something fancier I'd say $100 - $150 total no tip. Like formal attire and fancy dishes/atmosphere."

I enjoy it though. I talk a lot to different things on walks, or at least when no one's around. I think mostly it's just a thank you that I usually say, because I think it makes me happier. And I like to. 

Sometimes I end up feeling really worried like this for no reason. Like when people ask my favorite color, if I answer right away it's easy, but if I think about it I start to feel really guilty for choosing a color. Or a favorite animal.  "

653,0,"I have friends finding people online, people far away from their locations and connect with them. But when I do, I always end up being ghosted. Have you guys ever found true connections that still last till now. If so, how do you do that. Maybe it‚Äôs on me, but I really wanna connect with new people across the world. "
654,0, So for work we are clearing an area of land that had trees so condos can be built in the future. So the work the past few weeks has been cutting down trees. Cutting them up. Loading the logs to our shop and the brush to the landfill. Im torn because it feels wrong of course. Just clearing land. I get it. Condos are to be built. And we also are making use of everything. The logs we turn to firewood then sell to ace hardware. The brush gets turned to mulch and is free to the public. But it still feels wrong. Like even tho the meat will feed lots of people someone still had to kill the cow and in that metaphore Im the one killing the cowAnd im not objecting or stopping but I am questioning a lot of this. Mainly the process and the fact it feels rushed and timed. Like I get the condos are to be built but I feel if we took the time we could build them in a way that would agree with more than just out lack of time on earth. Because that seems to be the main motivator right now in this job you know?
655,0,Okay the name itself I don't have a problem with it but as soon as I got on to Reddit everybody still calling it and checking tender or a chicken nugget and the chicken nuggets are out of the conversation here cuz that's just ground up chicken loud boneless wings could literally be any part of the chicken fried up and Foster I might have explained it horribly but we're just going to keep on rolling the boat with tenders I can see the argument but but hit me out tenders are supposed to be like big big whenever I think of a tender I think it's like gigantic at least big at least a little bit long and when I have if I call a boneless swing a tender somebody needs to hit me upside the head with a metal bat because something has gone wrong with me so in my argument I just call it boneless wings whenever I get it from anywhere
656,0,"Sleep in till like 11, then immediately hit a greasy diner for pancakes, bacon, and a coffee the size of my head. After that, had a long walk with my headphones in, music way too loud, pretending I‚Äôm the main character. Spend the afternoon on the couch binge-watching something trashy but addictive, like reality shows or early 2000s teen dramas. Order something way too expensive on DoorDash that I‚Äôll regret later. End the day with a hot shower, clean sheets, and absolutely zero plans for tomorrow. Pure bliss."
657,0,"In real life and on the internet. Like what do you talk about? What happens when you run out of things to talk about (specially when you are connected online)? How do you keep the friendship? How can you stay friends with someone for years!? How many friends do you have? 

I have been pretty friendless most of my life except the occasional groups I became a part of in high school and college. Once it was over, so were the friendships. I have never made a friend online either. What are your tips and tricks for making friends? "
658,0,"So yeah, after 5 years and a pretty difficult and stressful final exams, i finally ended my studies and became a ""magister"" as we Europeans call it. I studied education, cuz i wanted to become a teacher. I genuinely saw myself doing it in the future. 

So finding a job will be my next big task, which will be really difficult considering the giant difference between rent prices and teaching sallary in this country. Which might be one of the reasons why people quit teaching.

So yeah, i have no idea what i will do, if i even will teach or not. But hopefully i did not waste 5 years for nothing, and that i at least got something from it. "
659,0,"The song ""Science Fiction Double Feature"" in Rocky Horror implies a second, similar film. Here are the ones I consider to be contenders.

Criteria is basically any film I think matches Rocky Horror Picture Show in terms of being silly, sexy, wild, campy, or just bizarre. I asked myself ""If I caught this and RHPS after midnight, would I feel like I had just had a perfect experience?""

What are your critiques or additions?

660,0,"How do you like your coffee? I personally drink mine black. And where for anyone who doesn‚Äôt get their beans from a grocery store, list the roasters that you like to get your beans from."
661,0,I will just randomly get the urge to write a children‚Äôs book and will work on it non stop for like a week. Then I will get bored and forget about it. Then like a year later the cycle repeats. Does this happen to anyone else or just me? 
662,0,"I often get phone calls, and no one's there. I only answer when I think it might be someone k
LObviously it's spam. But why? I block the number and they just keep calling back because I can see that a blocked number called I just don't hear it ring. What are the purpose of these calls? Is it to just to see if a human answers so they can put you on other lists? "
663,0,"One time I dropped it in the parking lot and it was returned to me before I knew it was gone. Another time I left it in a public bathroom and someone found me on social media to return it. Most recently I left it on top of my car while getting gas and of course forgot it was up there. As I'm driving down the road, someone speeds up next to my car and tosses the wallet through my window!

I think the reason why it keeps coming back to me must be karma. I go out of my way to return lost items when I find them. Once I found a tablet laying on the side of the road. I brought it home and found the owner by looking at their social media account. Then personally delivered it to her. I've found cell phones on more than one occasion too and made sure they got back to their owner.

Have you ever had something like your wallet repeatedly returned to you?

Update: I'm seriously shocked at the rudeness and judgment in the comment section. I'm not saying its a good idea to lose your wallet to see if it comes back to you. Only one person even answered whether they had a wallet returned or not. You guys are acting like I've committed a misdemeanor or something."
664,0,"I told them, no, I'm not, and they were surprised. I explained to them, and now i will explain to you, and pose the same question! 

I have my own life, and relationships, outside of my romantic relationships. Though I do love my girlfriend, she isn't the only person I love. I love my family, I love my friends, I love myself‚Äî so being around my friends, family, or just by myself makes me happy. I value her thoughts and opinions above most others, obviously, but she isn't the only person I listen to. It's kind of like how I have a favorite song, but that doesn't stop me from listening to other songs, and enjoying them. I'll always like the time spent with her, but I don't mourn the fact that I'm not spending time with her. 

So, now i ask you, when you are apart from your partner for long periods of time, are you upset? or are you like me? ^^ "
665,0,"I figure a lot of people probably have some ancestry in somewhere besides the country they live in (though I suppose this is a much less interesting question if your family has lived in the same area for generations, haha). Me and my husband were discussing this the other day and I thought I'd put it to Reddit out of curiosity!"
666,0,"A friend and I recently laid in the grass and just watched the clouds. We had forgotten just how fun it is to watch the clouds and pick out shapes. We even had a blast arguing about shapes and trying to point out why we saw what we saw.

It was so relaxing. I forgot how enjoyable it can be."
667,0,It's her first birthday this weekend and I want to do something special for her.  She already has all the toys she could ever want(I went overboard when I first got her) so what else would you recommend?
668,0,"I was watching jersey shore the Italian season (back when it aired) and recognized a girl I went to high school with‚Ä¶on Jersey shore‚Ä¶IN ITALY! 

I was so excited because the chances were so low, especially them filming in Italy. 


I also recognized another girl from HS who was on Worst Cooks of America "
669,0,"My child has now lost their 5th tooth.  We are currently doing the whole ‚Äúferry-away-the-tooth-and-drop-money-in-its-hiding-spot.‚Äù

So far, I am undecided what to do with the baby teeth and so I‚Äôve just been keeping them in small plastic ziploc bags and storing them away.

At least, I have been‚Ä¶

But, currently I only know for sure where this most recent tooth is.  I admit, it‚Äôs been a challenge to find a spot where (1) I don‚Äôt then move them around and (2) that the child won‚Äôt accidentally discover the kept teeth through pure random chance.

And, yet, I still haven‚Äôt found them.

My spouse doesn‚Äôt deal with the Tooth Fairy event, though is supportive. They are a lovely person, and can‚Äôt help making jokes while I search:

‚ÄúHave you‚Ä¶lost a tooth? *smiles*‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are not old enough or young enough to lose teeth right now!‚Äù"
670,0,"We think we have a basic understanding of reality. The truth is, we are missing an incredibly vast amount of answers. Commonly people think of the following questions: are we in a simulation? What's the meaning of life? Am I the only conscious person? What happens after death? But even these questions aren't as deep as it gets.

The thing is, we navigate the world with skills we earned (it seems) from evolution, not truth. The more you look closely, the more you realize how mysterious our existence is. Logic helps us answer big questions, but these questions could easily not even be the right ones. Reality doesn't have to make sense to us at all.

It seems like a leap of faith, but truly we just answer everything through an evolved framework. To us, science is a helpful tool at prediction and understanding with what we have, but science doesn't have to matter fundamentally. 

We think we've got a decent start on understanding reality, but we probably just created a map that happens to work well practically. Essentially the truth could be absolutely (and I mean absolutely) anything. It doesn't even need to follow logic. Maybe one day we'll understand it, or not. 

Anyways, thanks for reading this! Life is truly fascinating"
671,0,"I live in Singapore, recently for work I was subcontracted out and am required to RTO 5 days a week to the client site. Work itself was ok but the new commute is hellish af. I have to transfer at two interchanges and holy hell it's so bad. Trains are packed to the brim, you literally have to physically squeeze yourself in, that is after waiting for several trains to pass due to overcrowding.

Then when you disembark at one interchange you are required to shuffle along with thousands of other souless salarymen up escalators to the other train line where you rinse and repeat, let several trains go by before you physically shove yourself in. Of course, at every stop you have to either step out or squeeze back even more to let others alight.

The next interchange the train literally disembarks passengers onto a dangerously overcrowded platform for the next connecting train. Again, you have to shuffle your way forward until eventutally you get a spot on the next oncoming train. The entire trip there's simply zero room to type on your phone, you just gotta have earbuds in from the start and blast music until the crowd finally subsides. Everony is souless, you get death stares for even so much as to lightly brush against them. I've even seen people yelling and shouting too, it's pretty unnerving.

This shit goes both ways, the 8am morning and 7pm evening rush hour. Each commute is at least 1hr 15mins each way on good days when the train isn't delayed or broken down. Work punctuality is very sacred in Singapore so being late even 5 minutes after 9am will get me written up.

I can't do this shit everyday but I do recognize my privilge of getting to taste hybrid work arragenments with a less hellish commute at my main office before being contracted out. Just needed to rant as the trains are especially crowded today where even station staff is stopping people from going up the platforms. So hows your commute?"
672,0,"Just wanted someone to tell lol, she's really cute and today she had her hair down and I just found her really beautiful. 

I probably won't do anything about it, I don't think she'd be interested in someone like me so I probably wouldn't have any luck getting a date. I also don't really want to make things awkward at work by seeing someone there since that could become an awkward quick lol"
673,0,"Seriously, half the time I feel like I‚Äôm just winging it. From taxes to how long chicken lasts in the fridge, it‚Äôs all just educated guessing and vibes. Does anyone actually feel like they have life figured out? Or are we all just improvising?"
674,0,"I don't mean like actually getting famous on the internet. But I feel like we all have at least one experience where something we made, commented, or posted got a lot of attention. Like top comment on a youtube video.

I remember when I was like ten, I used to play some Bloons level creator. Y'all remember Bloons? The game that BTD is based on. Their website had this level creator and I'd have a blast letting my creativity run wild. I remember making this one level called Tick Tock Clock. The level had nothing to do with timing nor clocks. I think I just named it that because I also used to play a lot of Mario Kart on the DS, and Tick Tock Clock was one of my favorite tracks.

That level ended up becoming one of the most played on the website. Some shitty level I created when I was ten with a name that made no sense.

Just some random memory that came to me, and I was curious if any of y'all remembered what y'alls first taste of ""fame"" was."
675,0,Most days I feel so drained and tired all day long and can‚Äôt wait to ‚Äúget in bed and go to sleep‚Äù but as soon as I get in bed I‚Äôm up for hours past the time I should be asleep üòÇ I know I can‚Äôt be the only one. Why do we do this to ourselves?
