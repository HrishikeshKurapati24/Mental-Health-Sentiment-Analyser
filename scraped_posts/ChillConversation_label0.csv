1,0,"A robot stole my job today

A robot just stole (part of) my job haha ðŸ™ƒ 

I do commission based work for my regional manager sorting through refund spreadsheets and data for 11 local fast food stores getting money back and compensation for mistakes made, courier drivers who take too long etc 

Just got an email saying they've developed an automated AI based system to do it all and they no longer need me at all lol 

I have other admin duties and a regular wage but got a good additional bonus from this which is gonna suck to lose ðŸ™ƒ

2,0,I find I'm moving more towards older analog tech all the time.
3,0,"At these difficult times, listening is a crucial tool. Many people have gone through a lot worse in their lives, and it's essential to listen to them and be a support, no matter who they are. I have recently started talking to a few people on the internet over 1-hour video calls and mostly listened to what they had to share and took an effort to be a helping hand. If you are interested to talk or just share anything.

**I am planning to connect with people from all parts of life and the world over a Video Call for like 30mins/1 hour. I am interested in interacting with people, understanding cultures, listening to their hardships, happiness, literally anything.**

**DM Me and we can set up a meeting!**  
You can watch snippets on 'peopleepisodes' Instagram handle."

I don't know if this is the right place to post this.

Ok, Here is my story.  
My job has me at different sites in all different states.  
Most of that time it will last me more than a week.  
Now not knowing anybody, or anything about that state that the site is in.  
That leaves my weekends with me just sitting in my hotel.

So, What i am looking for is someone to just show me something.  
I don't care if it is a walk around a swap meet, or going down to look  at the historical parts of town.  
As I am an old dude, I would prefer a female in her upper 40's plus.

Right now they have me in Provo, Ut."

12,0,Sunday is a day usually spent relaxing and resetting your batteries for the work week to start back up again. What tunes do you listen to on days like today to make this happen? Feel free to post links so we can hear what you're chilling out to. 
13,0,I've been watching True Detective Season 2. I had a hard time getting into it initially and I loved season one but four episodes in it's starting to make sense to me. What are you watching?
14,0,"Typically, for me, I enjoy smoking cigars on the porch and drinking a couple of brews while listening to some melancholy music such as Sigur Ros, Noah Gundersen, or Bon Iver."
15,0,I'll start: I was born in Peru but I've lived in Orlando since I was 11 years old. I love living in here but going to theme parks gets boring after awhile. It's just a regular city but with lots of tourist and fun stuff to do. 
16,0,"Do you have a routine or something you like to do every Sunday?

I usually clean my house some, have brunch in a nearby restaurant (I like to try new ones whenever possible), then every Sunday evening I'll get a new movie going and make popcorn. At the end of my day I'll unwind with a nice bath."
