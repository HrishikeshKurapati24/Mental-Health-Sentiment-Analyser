1,2,Just absolute fucking hell. That's it.
2,2,"I'd never admit this in real life, but I often talk out loud to myself, like just expressing my random day-to-day thoughts, back-and-forth conversationally. (I know it's bizarre but I come from an abusive home, and grew up with few friends) The impulse has (unfortunately) carried into my adult life. 

Present day, I'm pitifully awkward, and I have debilitating social anxiety, but if you could hear me talk out loud to myself, you'd never guess. I sound just like any normal functioning adult.

But put me in a real social environment, and my brain goes into a panic, and suddenly, I lock up and I can't think of anything to say. 

I'd do anything to translate that private social ability into public. Someone please tell me I'm not alone on this?"
3,2,Ruining my life 
4,2,I feel very uncomfortable around people specially neighbours and i feel so self concious like someone is hearing me and is trying to mess with me ?
5,2,I'm starting to believe weed is affecting me negatively. I've been wanting to quit for a while but I am honestly addicted to it (+15 year smoker). It is increasing my social anxiety. Is it possible?
6,2,"But unlike them, you are not going to point it out to them, you just feel bad about it"
7,2,"ive always wanted a friend but due to social anxiety it's been very difficult, sometimes I tell myself ill be more social or outgoing 'tomorrow' but it never really happens... but I made a friend recently and we literally have so much in common with our interests, it's kind of like looking into a mirror- the only difference is that he doesn't have social anxiety and is more outgoing than me. now we have exchanged phone numbers and are texting but I have this lingering fear in my mind, that ""I'll end up disappointing him and he'll see that we didn't have anything in common at all, and that I was still the same unlikeable, boring coward I always was."" 

now when I text him it's very stressful because I want to say the perfect things so he still wants to be my friend, so that he doesn't regret having met me... I dont know what to do. I know hes a good person but at the end of the day, im scared he'll just hate me and realize im boring. but when I have these thoughts, its as if im thinking badly about him even though I KNOW he is a good person. how do I overcome these thoughts and self-doubt, and fears about losing a friend I just made?

also if anyone has texting tips I would be grateful, I dont know how to keep the convo going..."
8,2,"I don't even know if this would be categorized as social anxiety but when someone looks at me any more than a glance I get so so pissed off and often it follows with a ""wtf are you looking at? Can I f##king help you?!"". Something about it just makes me ragefully angry and I cant stop it. To me someone looking at me more than one without actually speaking is considered aggression and my first thought is ""the must need that "" (want their a** kicked). "
9,2,"I (29 m) don’t know how or why I turned out this way, given that I used to be much more sociable in high school and college, where I had valid reasons for interacting with other people who weren’t part of my family. These days, I barely interact with the adults in my workplace, since most of them are either too young or too old to freely chat with. The people around my age can literally be counted on one hand, and I don’t want to shoot the breeze with any of them; I don’t talk to male coworkers (or unattractive female coworkers) because I’m worried that they’ll think I’m strange, boring, or slow on the uptake, and I barely even acknowledge attractive female coworkers because I’m worried that they’ll think I’m a disgusting creep with an unsavory ulterior motive, even if I have little to no interest in actively courting them. I just generally assume that people will think less of me, and tend to preemptively close myself off from others as a result. This is a problem because my parents won’t be around forever, and my social isolation is already starting to make me paranoid about others and their perceptions of me. I know that I need a professional therapist to address my issues first, but I hope that this subreddit will enable me to vent about my grievances, as well as offer some advice that I sorely need. For starters, how on earth do I make friends outside of college or work? Don’t bring up bars, because I do not and will never drink. 
"
10,2,"Right now, I have about 9 unread conversations from friends this past week, and I’m too anxious to respond to a single one. 

A part of it is due to putting off my replies for so long, meaning that I now have to apologize and somehow explain myself. But I ended up here in the first place because I have this deep gut fear of responding to any and all texts. And when I try to respond promptly, I sometimes take upwards of 45 minutes to muster a simple response to a funny video or a “Hey how’s it going?” 

I feel incredibly terrible and inconsiderate myself, but it’s eating me up inside more thinking of how the other person must feel. Yet, I also feel paralyzed by the position my anxiety has put me in. This isn’t the first time this has happened, either. In recent years, I have gone weeks, even months, without responding to people due to anxiety, but I want to learn how to overcome it before I make them wait any longer.

Has anyone else experienced this? Any tips that have helped you? If not, really any support is welcome, thanks <3"
11,2,I'm so pathetic
12,2,"Does anyone else do this?

While eating dinner with someone, I will catch myself staring at their food, not because I want it or because it looks appetizing. I think it’s to avoid eye contact. Looking at someone’s food is so much easier than looking at someone’s face lmao. It’s just where I end up placing my eyes while eating with someone. I am getting myself out of this. I’ve always done this as a kid and never realized till I was an adult how uncomfortable it must make people and how weird it is. And weird for me, since I have a weight issue. People usually think it’s because I want their food. It’s just where my eyes go instead of their face. Does anyone else do this??? 

I’ve done this since I was a kid. Just stared at the other person’s food instead of making eye contact. I feel weird admitting this. 

I am learning not to do this anymore. It has nothing to do with wanting the person’s food, but it’s so much easier to stare at their food than make eye contact lol. I don’t do it as much as I used to but occasionally catch myself doing so. "
13,2,"I feel like all my friends hate me or at least think I’m really annoying/ a chore to be around.

My mind does this thing where all the past memories I have I caricature myself to being this super loud, annoying person that is hard to be around so I tend to have huge moments in time where I restrict all my friends and isolate myself to “recover”.

I have this one friend (I’ll call her friend A) for example, who is super dry to me on text and I have a huge sinking feeling she’s only hanging around us because she has a crush on closer friend (friend B), because I’ve had a lot of embarrassing/annoying actions towards friend A and my mind translates all these experiences into huge deals would be friendship  dealbreakers- when I told friend B she told me friend A probably wasn’t thinking about all my faults but I can’t help it.

This is so bad it’s to the point where I’ve been having recurring dreams (or nightmares) where they both leave me or secretly hate me and are only hanging out with me because they feel bad and don’t want to cause trouble and literally wake up in a cold sweat. 

I know they can’t hate me that much because they ask me to hang out with them sometimes, but as a trio so I could just be someone they keep around because they don’t want to be bad people. 

But I still isolate myself from them and having constant waves of emotion where I feel like shit and have full anxiety attacks"
14,2,"I 26F have been talking with a guy every day for two months, mostly sexting, but we chat as well. Today i had the day off from work and he asked how i would spend my time. At first i told the truth.. (that i had some things to do at home and that i wanted to make some progress on my jigsaw puzzle) but then i felt embarrassed because i have no one besides my mom to spend my day with. I have nothing fun to do, no friends to go out with. 
My only two friends and i have grown apart and i have strong social anxiety and consider myself uninteresting and awkward so i haven't been able to make new friends.
Long story short, i lied and told him a few minutes ago that i was going to go out with a friend to have some drinks.
I feel bad for lying, like a fraud and so pathetic because in reality i'm just lying in my bed.. but it would have been so lame and boring telling the truth.  
I just wanted to vent. "
15,2,been feeling lonely recently. I struggle to go out and socialize. never reached out on reddit before but here we are. im looking to make some friends to get my mind off of negative thoughts hmu
16,2,"Ok so I am determined to beat my social anxiety but sometimes I just worry that I won't beat it until I'm much older I know small steps and stuff but I'm 20 and I've never really had a life I have no real friends or people to hangout with but I'm lucky enough to have a family that's here for me I just would like to feel like I've started living so much has already passed me by and I'm trying not to dwell on it but I still worry I won't make any real progress for years to come. 

Sorry I just needed to vent if you are reading this thanks for your time "
17,2,"i lived alone in my house for the longest time, Ive never spent a complete day away from my house in my entire life.A year ago,i was suddenly required to go to a new place, miles far away from my house, Full of people ive never seen before, As someone who already struggles with conveying their thoughts and just generally being able to hold a conversation past 2 words, i Struggled an entire year with this, Not much changed, Im still the most disconnected person in my college, How do i even connect to another human? I feel failed as an INFJ, I want to get past this stage so bad, but i just dont know how?? I Just dont have a Clue at this point,I thought so much about it, banged my head against this so many times and now ive ceased to be able to properly think..i feel my brain has stopped working...

Another face of this problem is that i find it Awkward when most people are having just genuinely fun moments, it feel so foreign to me, I almost cringe out when people are simply trying to have fun, I dont know why i am like this, Perhaps ive never ever experienced enjoyment to that extent? I certainly had moments in my childhood where i laughed and cried and enjoyed being with my friends..but before i knew it that smil was gone, all that was left was a face that molds itself according to its surroundings, as a desperate attempt to not feel outcasted..

I doubt theres anyone in the world that wants to just explode more than me..Please help"
18,2,"The event I want to talk about today proves how incapable I am in social situations. I urgently needed to use the bathroom while I was in the middle of the city, and for some reason, I couldn’t find any public restrooms. I was also under time pressure because I had an appointment, and I just wanted to quickly use a bathroom somewhere. So I went into a restaurant to use theirs. I know very well that you’re not supposed to just use the bathroom in a restaurant without ordering something, but I was too scared to ask the waitress at the door if I could use it. I get extremely anxious in situations like that, to the point where I can’t even greet someone properly.

While I was upstairs using the toilet, I already heard the waitress downstairs complaining loudly about me because I hadn’t asked for permission to use it. I started getting anxious in the bathroom, afraid that I’d get in trouble once I went back down, so I stayed in there for a long time, too scared to come out. I would have liked to apologize when I left the restaurant, but I was too ashamed and couldn’t bring myself to do it. So I just left without saying anything. As I walked out, the waitress called after me loudly and annoyed, “How about asking before you use the bathroom next time?” I panicked and walked out without looking at her. She even followed me outside and yelled “Asshole!” after me.

At that point, I stopped and apologized for not asking first. I told her that I would be happy to pay and that I would gladly come back in and order a drink. She said it wasn’t about the money, but about the fact that I didn’t greet anyone or ask for permission to use the toilet. She said it’s rude to use a bathroom without paying for the service. I apologized again, and she said it was a lesson for the future. I agreed and said goodbye. I really did feel sorry.

I feel like I should write the restaurant an email to apologize again. After the whole thing, I cried for half an hour and felt completely overwhelmed.

I totally understand it was my fault, and I know that I’m the problem. I already felt bad when I entered the restaurant, but somehow I can’t control my behavior in these situations. It’s incredibly hard for me to greet people or ask if I can use the bathroom. At the same time, I don’t understand why I can’t just bring myself to politely ask and greet someone. I’m actually a very understanding person, but I often can’t show it — and that destroys me. I knew from the start that if I didn’t ask, there would be consequences, and still I was too afraid to ask. It would’ve been so much easier to just politely ask, but something inside me holds me back. Has anyone else experienced something like this? Can anyone explain why I behave this way, even though I know there will be consequences?"
19,2,"If you’re going to comment on someone’s post, I think it’s important to try to do it without judgment. We’re all here to share and support each other, and it helps when responses come from a place of curiosity or kindness rather than criticism. Bluntness without understanding or without intention to help can come across as dismissive, especially when someone is being vulnerable… especially in a forum about social anxiety. Because when someone shares a fear or a trauma and the response is a judgment disguised as bluntness, it’s not only unhelpful and it can completely miss the point and make the person feel even more unseen. I’m just throwing a seed for reflection! "
20,2,I need some friends its weird to ask for friends on online but I am with every insecurities as possible so I need friends online be my friend if you same as me 
21,2,So here’s the thing I have job interview lined up pretty much in like four hours time and I don’t want to like go to the job interview because I feel quite unqualified given the job description and I don’t even have that 50% of qualifications which they mention in the description so I have this panic anxiety and that if I go there I will embarrass myself and that feeling of that embarrassment is like crippling you know so I don’t want to go there but I have been thinking that if I don’t go now that I will regret it big time because this is the first Interview that I have landed after a series of hundred applications back-and-forth but having said that I  question myself that the worst thing they can say is no and I would get back but you know that feeling of embarrassment? I’m sure it will finish just under 10 minutes because I don’t know much of the stuff that they mention in the job so and I don’t have that behavioural interview qualities which I have been preparing lately.
22,2,"Trying to make new friends again and be more social .. going out to eat makes me anxious and some social settings . Trying to be more engaging  and social . Let’s have some fun this summer ! 
I made a page on here called social anxiety is hard one word .if you want to write to me there or here !"
23,2,"hi, i'm a 17 year old girl and i've struggled with eating when i'm anxious or excited about something for almost my whole life. for example, i'm in theatre and sometimes during tech week i'll eat barely anything the entire week because of how stressful a time it is, and then at the cast party on closing night i won't be able to eat at whatever restaurant we go to because i'm so happy being with my friends and also sad that the show is over. basically, how it used to be was whenever i was feeling any sort of super strong emotion, i would struggle with eating. 

however, recently (past couple months) it's been that i just can't eat in public. my friend group will usually go out to eat when we hang out, and i'll take one bite of my food and feel like i have to throw up. it's a little better if we eat at someone's house, but still not back to normal. it doesn't matter what food it is, except ice cream or snow cones and stuff like that i can always eat fine lol. anything else though makes me super nauseous. it happens sometimes when i'm with my family or even literally by myself in my car. 

i feel like this started when i went on my first date with my boyfriend. i was super nervous because i really liked him and i don't date a lot, and he took me out to brunch. i took one bite of my food and literally had to run to the bathroom to throw up. that time i think it was just because i was nervous, but it's happened a couple times since then, but i've had plenty of time to become comfortable with him so if this is actually the correlation in my mind, i do not understand it because he has never made me feel insecure about my body or anything to do with my eating habits. i also don't have a history with guys or other people who have. i always feel safe and relaxed with him in every other way, so i don't understand what my problem is when it comes to food. 

does anyone have any answers as to why i feel like this all of a sudden? i have never really struggled with body image issues or anything like that and i usually love eating food. i miss being able to eat with my friends without feeling like i'm going to throw up and they've started to get worried about me because i never eat when i'm with them. any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you!!

tldr: eating food in public or just around other people makes me nauseous and i need advice because this is super inconvenient"
24,2,"I went to a wedding as a plus one and didn’t know anyone. My partner was in the wedding party as well, so I was often alone. That was fine, I understood and managed okay. But my partner had at least twenty friends they knew attend this wedding so I was often put in situations with them. Which I appreciate, don’t get me wrong. But idk what came over me, I really struggled to converse with anyone. My battery was already dead from pre wedding festivities I had to be present for but I just froze up in conversations at the wedding itself and all I could do was smile and nod most of the time. 

And now of course, I’m over analyzing my behavior and worried I made my partner look bad in front of friends. I was literally doing okay until the wedding itself. Idk if it was the pressure of a formal event but I just hit a wall and feel terrible about it now. 

Has anyone been through something like this? How did you cope with the residual anxiety after?"
25,2,"Wondering what has been the most useful, helpful, or insightful thing you've learned about social anxiety.

It's so bad I can't move my hands sometimes."
27,2,"I’m a high performer and do well one on one. But social situations are getting a little crazy. I have so much trouble, feel sick before them, put on a mask to briefly, awkwardly interact, and then leave ASAP. Unfortunately, I’m now in mgmt so I have to interact with people WAY more often.

In December, I went to the office holiday party because I wanted to have fun and open up a bit, but ended up staying too long and drinking too much at the after party because I wanted to be more comfortable and was actually enjoying myself. I blacked out. I was told that no one saw anything really crazy or bad, but now since then… a full six months later… I’m paranoid that everyone is judging me or talking behind my back even though I have no real reason to think so, which just triggers me and makes the anxiety worse. Trust me, won’t be doing that again. (Used to drink to cope all the time in social situations - and it worked! Til it didn’t, and I’d black out and end up in a week-long hangxiety spiral. I hate that I did this again after not doing so for so long and I hate that it’s still affecting me months later.) 

I’ve recently started therapy but I have no idea how to combat this. It’s just been getting worse the older I get. Probably because I’m feeding it with paranoia and obsessive thinking. I also deal with depression, for which I’ve recently started Zoloft.

I feel the same way at parties and stuff, but not quite as bad - plus I don’t really go out and hang out with new people very often anymore at all. 

Any tips? I guess I just needed to type it out, too "
28,2,"I hate myself so deeply that it keeps me from making friends. I feel awkward, weird, dumb, slow, fat, and stupid—and I’ve been living like this since I was 12. I’m almost 19 now. I remember when I was like 14 I used to wish that I was an unanimated object like doll so I wouldn’t have to act or speak because of how much I hate myself .Even when someone touches me/hug me , I’m just shocked—because for me I’m so disgusting So Why would anyone touch someone so rotten, dirty, and disgusting like me? And the one worst part is I’m a ‘conventionally attractive woman,’ i get hit on pretty much often by both men and women and I often get complimented so I feel like my appearance doesn’t reflect how I act. I feel like everyone is disappointed when they approach me. Something is genuinely wrong with me. I constantly feel like a monster. I always hated anything that involved groupe work because i always felt like i was going to be the dumbest slowest person and that no one was going to listen to me ,I even quite a course I’ve payed for because I felt disgusting and monstrous and  I didn’t even got a refund after that .When I’m at school and we have a homework or even a work that we have to do in class I’ll always want to see what other people have done (i don’t copy them ) because i don’t trust myself,and I will always over complicating the work because if it seems too easy for me it mean that I’m wrong because of how dumb I think I am .I genuinely feel rotten—I don’t even have words to describe it. I compare myself all the time and overthink everything. I’ve always been super self-conscious—it’s ruining my life. I hate the way I talk, stand, and sound. There’s also something about my face that feels off. I feel so much 
shame and hatred that sometimes I don’t even think I deserve to speak. When someone acts kindly toward me, I’m surprised and relieved, like, ‘Oh—okay, I don’t disgust them.’ And I feel the same way about my body: I’ve alternated between binge-eating and anorexia. I’m 64 kg at 1.73 m—but I still won’t wear a shirt without a jacket because I feel fat and disgusting. I’ve never had a friend literally I’ve never a single time hung out with anyone. The last message I received from someone outside my family was literally over a year ago ( aiaï aï  ,bref )—since I graduated high school. At first, people approache me they are nice, but then once they see how shy, anxious, dumb, and slow I am, they detach and stop talking to me. This self hatred is also leading to a crazy amount of people pleasing that I also think is the reason why I feel like people don’t like me if I tell you A and you tell me B I will then change my mind and agree with you even tho I don’t and person is obviously wrong .I feel like it’s impossible for me to let go and finally BE without overthinking literally every single thing I do .
I always had this feeling that I don’t belong anywhere with anyone and it’s exhausting.i spend my time trying to find reasons why I don’t have any friend tried to read and get more knowledge,trying to lear new skills painting playing guitar or changing my style because I thought that maybe it was because I wasn’t interesting enough but a the end I end up realizing that other people don’t need to do all that to have friends and that i was the problem and that they just didn’t like ME ,my person ,my whole being.

Anyway , my intention is not necessarily  to pity (even if kinda look like it )but
Rather to have advice and especially to know if I’m not the only one that go through this . Also English is not my mother tongue so I apologize if there are mistakes 🙏"

31,2,"Hey, throwaway because I'm kinda embarrassed.

I'm in my 30s and been in therapy for social anxiety for a while now, unfortunately I had to pause that due to me not being able to afford it. One of the things that came up though was me being terrified of online interactions (even though I've done a lot of online gaming before). Just making this post took months of mental preparation. 

I do wanna work on that though, so I'm looking for suggestions of online games that I can play with randoms everyday to train myself talking to people. Here's what I'm looking for:

* Games where it's common or even neccessary to use the voice chat (it's tough to initiate conversation in a game where nobody really talks normally)
* not too competetive (getting yelled at is still scary)
* the nicer the community is in general to new players the better

I hope this post is within the guidelines, I never posted here before."
32,2,"In my school, a large portion of the school knows who I am. It's because in 6th grade I was a wreck, an unfunny class clown that sometimes took it too far. I'm still trying to recover since people still view as my 6th grade self. What do I do?"

38,2,"The number one thing I read about to help social anxiety is exposure therapy. And I think at this point I can confidently say I have tried and failed.

I'm in my early twenties. I've had social anxiety since I was probably thirteen. There have been ups and downs, phases where it was very subtle and I could manage it, and phases where it has been so crippling that I don't leave my house for months.

These past two years in particular, I've really tried to combat it with going out as much as possible. And I soooo wish I could say that it's helped, but my god...

Not only has it not helped, it may have made it worse.

I told myself this year I would get a gym membership and commit to working out. I've got one foot in the door so to speak, so I'm proud of that: I got a gym membership and I do go to the gym semi-regularly.

But I'm not going as consistently as I need to, and it's mainly because I get violently anxious both before I go and during my workouts.

My face gets unbelievably red everytime I even think about going to the gym. There have been three times where before getting in my car to drive to the gym I have vomited from this terrible pit in my stomach. I get dizzy, my head races, my entire body shakes. It's awful.

When I was younger, my social anxiety would usually just manifest as me being quiet and keeping my head down and looking passive. But now I genuinely get ill, it makes me physically sick.

I seriously don't know what to do at this point. I'm on medication as well, and it doesn't seem to be substantially helping.

It's just so insane how everyday things that most people don't even think about before doing, I have to build up the courage as if I'm about to skydive out of a plane.

Anyway, this is more or less just a rant. I hope someone found it relatable..."

The doctor even told me that I did the right thing and that I can be proud of myself for taking this step. "

44,2,"So I went to gas station to pick up a bite to eat and an energy drink, I say hello and the old lady brightens a bit and starts to go on about ""I'm always having coffee etc"" but she's itching like she's nervous etc, and I'm thinking why is she nervous? Only thing I can think of is I didn't brush my teeth before I went in and had coffee and my breath reminded her of it? lol. Could've had something to do with the energy drink I purchased, but she was itching like she was nervous.  "
45,2,Where do people go to make online friends... i feel like this would be a good option for me but dont know where to start. 
46,2,Being disrespect cause you have social anxiety and you are too quiet and shy to respond how can I survive i don't know 
47,2,"Do you ever isolate yourself for so long in your mind that you forget just how bad your anxiety is, and then when the inevitable day comes when you have to interact with people, you mess up so badly that you are slapped in the face with the reality of how terrible things really are. And it begins to feel as though things are infinitely worse than they were two months ago and you start to wonder how you are going to live another 60 years like this. And then you isolate yourself again and the cycle repeats endlessly."
48,2,"My face expression changes when i go to public places and my face expression becomes very sad and weird and people starts seeing me and starts laughing and i feel very uncomfortable and then i go in very low confidence and when i talk to people I can't complete my sentances and stops in between and continue again with sad face and weird expressions when try to focus on my work in library rather then focusing on book i start thinking anyone one seeing me then again i became uncomfortable with sad face and weird expressions then people starts more seeing me .. i become so uncomfortable i have to leave the place

49,2,"Whenever i want to make the first move in anything like starting a conversation , approaching someone, asking someone something i feel so UNWANTED like i actually feel like a creep 😭😭 this insecurity has led me to be very passive in my relationships which has annoyed others a lot. I know friendships are a two way street and i really want to be active but i can never shake off the feeling that im too worthless to contribute"
50,2,"For context I was discussing a package I had bought from one of my friends, and along the way we had a miscommunication about one of the payments. The other friend, who wasn't involved, asked us, (but I assume primarily me) to move this conversation into DMs. If I had only restrained myself and had the respect to stop when I was told, I wouldn't have escalated a situation that would've otherwise been small. I was instantly told off by both people and was asked to log off for the night.

I have an issue with being able to take opposing opinions and boundaries properly. I imagine this is partially due to my autism impairing me from being able to process tone and social situations correctly but also as someone whose normally very tolerant towards people putting me in uncomfortable situations, I tend to take things more personally because that levity shouldn't be entitled to me regardless. 

I feel very personally when someone establishes a boundary for me because as someone who gives lots of levity to others, it often frustrates me that I can't get the same levity back. Rationally I understand this is because of differing personalities but irrationally I take it as someone trying to put power over me. I know I shouldn't feel that way, but with how firmly that boundary is placed I can't help feeling like a little kid who needs to be reigned in. "
51,2,"Whenever I’m interacting with people who aren’t in my close circle – like coworkers, acquaintances, strangers, or even casual friends – I automatically smile. But not in a natural or confident way. It’s this awkward, nervous kind of smile that doesn’t really feel genuine, and it just *happens* without me meaning to.

I’ve noticed it feels like a kind of defense mechanism – like I’m subconsciously trying to show I’m non-threatening or trying to please the other person. The smile isn’t connected to any real emotion; it just comes up whenever I feel slightly out of my comfort zone. It’s like my body is trying to keep the peace, even when there’s no conflict.

The thing is, I *know* it makes me look unsure or submissive – almost like I’m signaling that I’m “below” the other person. Sometimes I worry it invites people to not take me seriously or even walk over me. And the frustrating part is, I don’t know how to stop. Even when I catch myself doing it, I can’t seem to change the reaction in the moment.

This doesn’t happen with very close friends or family – with them I’m relaxed, and my expressions feel natural. But as soon as I step outside that zone, it’s like my body switches into awkward autopilot.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is it tied to self-esteem or social anxiety? And more importantly – how do you *train* yourself to break this pattern and show up with a more grounded presence?

Any advice, similar experiences, or exercises would be really helpful."
52,2,"I leave in Bangalore and I don't have a girlfriend. I'm 29 and working as a software engineer.

53,2,i dont know if this relates to social anxiety but i struggle with severe procrasination. its even to the point where i feel like i wasted years of my life because i just want to avoid tasks or the future. its not beneficial to my mental health. i have a huge exam coming up and barely done anything for it. im thinking of starting medication for anxiety but was wondering if this would help or worsen it? perhaps wellbutrin (adhd meds) may help?
54,2,"So recently I tried to push myself to be out this weekend. I did and at first was having a good time. But then I tried smoking n it induced some anxiety but the kicker is I think some of the fears a true. While out I noticed a lot about the ppl I was with. For one, if you think I’m being weird why not come up and talk to me instead I feel like I became a target. I was talked about, judged , and most of the night people kept moving from me. I went to the bathroom to check to see if I was sweating n I was so there goes a confirmed fear. Second , I believe everybody knew something they think I wouldn’t have picked up on. Which is the person I thought I was with, brought someone she had been talking to as well and we were both there together. Aside from the place being one of the places I seen a lot of (women who are careless) go to. It began to be like that. On top of that, they kept telling me they could go without n if I was so worried that my fear was true I should go talk to them. But I won’t cause I’m a bitch, and embarrassing them. I eventually figured I could get a drink to bring the anxiety down but I’m in sobriety surrounded by all this so I really struggled. There were other things in between but just haven’t felt right about it all sense. I was social the night before but I wasn’t sweating, and there wasn’t that many ppl. Idk what to think anymore? I don’t have any confirmation that the thing I’m thinking is true or not or how to get it or if I well n that’s been cause more anxiety . What to do? "
55,2,"Everyday I prepare myself to be belittled in some way by the public. I also work in the beauty industry so I deal a lot of middle aged women in particular, and they can be the worst sometimes when it comes to giving condescending smiles, thinking they always know best and you’re stupid or inexperienced. I’d like to prove them wrong and like they can trust me to give them advice, but my anxiety sometimes causes me to come off as stupid because I can’t find the right words to explain things properly because I get overwhelmed, plus I have bad ADHD, and here lately I have noticed my memory and words seem to be so scrambled all the time, I think it is just my constant anxiety and my job is making it worse. I thought maybe overtime I would just get thicker skin but honestly I’m not getting used to it I’m getting fed up with it. At this point I’m worried I’m gonna lash out on someone and get fired. I bring my work home with me, mentally. Like I cannot stop thinking about anything negative that happened at work that day, I will fixate on it. Because I know that I feel like that’s also where a lot of my anxiety comes from is anticipating something negative to happen and then me obsessing over it for the next couple days to come, even on my days off, and it just ruins everything.

56,2,"i kinda bombed a presentation a few days ago. my professor stopped me in the middle of my presentation and asked me if i 'memorised' my whole speech because i didn't turn around and look/read off of my slides. to which i said, i practiced my presentation. 

i thought i was doing well regarding my anxiety; i haven't had recent episodes of anxiety attacks, but that comment from her has literally consumed my thoughts for two nights in a row. i have been doubting myself and assuming that my classmates must have thought i was dumb and i get really anxious around people who are ""better/smarter"" than me that i genuinely feel embarrassed by my presentation."

Right now, I'm applying part time job through online but my mom said asking for part time job face-to-face is better (which is true because some shop doesnt have online application). I have already asked 2 shop and it has already drained me. First one give me one answer ""no"" and the other one said no one hiring but in normal response. I felt like they are judging and laughing at me. Right now, my mom wants me to go out find part time job but I'm literally fighting a demon inside me just to ask ""are you guys hiring?"". "
59,2,"Basically the title. Sometimes people would say hi, and I'd return their greetings, but I got the sense I should have been more extroverted? I feel like there's something very standoffish with my body language and please don't brush that off since I came to this realization over time, there's something in my nonverbal expression that makes people think I don't like them, or the anxiety is very apparent in me. I actually wondered if some people stopped walking there because of me. 

My anxiety is slightly better now that I stopped going but the depression is worse. I found another walking spot but I only go sporadically during the day, and another one I go to a few times a week in the evening. 

Another reason why I stopped walking at the first spot is because I feel like this woman who regularly went to the same park had a thing for me and while it was flattering I'm in a horrible life situation and shouldn't date. 

Overall, I thought going to the park would've been nice because I'm just some guy, who would notice me? But I feel like I was expected to be more sociable at least on certain situations and I basically went there every day for the first year. Now I'm thinking a number of my neighbors think I'm an asshole or weird and on top of that maybe since I walked there every day they have this perception of me that was ingrained over a long period of time.

60,2,"I'm at a family vacation at the beach and we're staying at a hotel. I was excited and I set some goals to overcome my anxiety like going to the pool when there's lots of people and talking to a guy.

I even thought I wouldn't talk to any guy) Today, I just went to th pool to accomplish my goal and two guys sat next to my chair. One of them started talking to me an we had a conversation. He's staying with his dad and a friend (the other guy). Then, he invited to take a ride but I knew that would make my family worry about me so I declined. Then the conversation stopped and he suddenly invited me to have some beers in his room. I didn't know what to say so I said ""I'll think about it"". Then we went silent and after some minutes of me not knowing what to say, trying to imagine why he said that, and jst panicking, he just said ""well, I'm leaving, since you didn't want to go with me"". I knew he wanted me to say something but I froze again. So he jst left. That was so uncomfortable. I could see the disappointment in his face. I don't even know why I still felt bad. I wasn't even sure I wanted to go.  "
61,2,I was isolating myself for about 5 years and am surprised how friendly people are. Is this normal ? From online talk I heard people are especially mean to ugly people but it seems people are actually really nice. Is this normal or do people just feel bad for me because of my looks? Genuinely curious 
62,2,"I hope I chose a correct subreddit for this. Mostly need to talk because I just feel frustrated and confused. If somebody reads this - awesome. Any comments are appreciated but I'm not sure what I'm expecting from posting this other than being able to get some stuff off my chest.

 So I am \[M30+\] (I may be vague with some irrelevant details on purpose) and I've made a group of friends online on the social media. We've known each other for several years and I guess we all enjoy talking to each other. We discuss all sort of topics, share videos and memes, have our own jokes. We managed to develop our own small community with our entire own “lore” that would probably be largely unintelligible for a person from the outside what are we even talking about.

 At the prime of our chat we've had new messages from various members flowing in so quickly that keeping up with them was basically impossible. As we continued our existence, some members left because of various reasons and we became fewer a fewer. Sometimes people went away and later came back.

 Before getting involved in this community, I've had some other online friends before. With a few of them I continue to maintain contact and that contact is very precious to me. Overall I've observed that it is much easier from my perspective to get into friendly relations with people I meet online than offline. A key reason for this is my shy attitude combined with low self-esteem problems. The details may not be entirely relevant  here.

While I consider all current chat members to be my very dear friends and I strongly care for all of them, over time I seem to have developed a special kind of taste for conversations with H. \[F30+, this isn't her true initial\]. I very much enjoy her witty style of conversations, her perspective on various topics, her  type of humour and at the same time, while she may be very outspoken about topics she cares about, there is a heart-melting kindness in her towards her friends when you get to know her better. If an obvious question comes to your mind whether I developed a romantic interest in her, then the answer is... maybe? I don’t know. She is a very enigmatic person and I am having a lot of trouble “figuring her out”. I certainly do love her in some way and I’m not the kind of person who throws that word around lightly. I’m just not sure in what way exactly. Sometimes I like to think of her as my twin sister but not always.

Around a year ago, I was going, for work-related reasons, to visit the country where H. lives. I shyly asked her if maybe she would be willing to meet and have a drink together or have a conversation. I'm not naive and I didn't want to set myself up for disappointment so I preferred to expect the worst. I have made in my mind a full list of potential reasons why she might refuse. Still, her justification caught me by surprise.

I guess this is time for a Disclaimer. What I am about to say is (I hope) obvious but I’m going to say this just in case so that nobody who is reading this even for a moment suspects otherwise. I am in no way blaming H. for her decision. I believe she had every right to decide as she decided. While I don't fully understand the justification she provided, this does not in any way imply that her motive was unreasonable. Just like - I hope - it is not unreasonable that I feel the way I feel while fully acknowledging that H. was in her full right to do what she did.

What H. answered boiled down to: “that's lovely of you to suggest such a meeting but I have a rule of not mixing online and offline friendships. That’s not personal about you. Maybe I just lack courage”. (I currently don’t have access to the account with our conversation but I believe that my rephrasing is quite faithful). Since I didn't want to be disrespectful to her decision or to hurt her feelings in any way, and also – I admit - confused by this justification, I answered that we are still friends anyway and that if she ever has a change of mind, she can always tell me if she wants. End of topic.

The problem is that since then this has felt like a thorn. A thorn I felt I couldn't tell anybody about without seeming like I'm feeling entitled to H.'s time and attention. If she had said back then that she doesn't like me enough to meet me, I would have felt heartbroken but I would at least know why she did what she did. If she had said not now but there is a tiny chance that I will change my mind in the future when I get to know you better, I would have hope.

The answer hurt back then, and still does now, because of its finality and because of how helpless it made me feel. Again, I’m in no way questioning the validity of H.’s decision or her right to do so, I’m just trying to get some overwhelming feelings of my chest. Numerous thoughts ran through my mind. This felt to me like meeting my friend online turned out to be some sort of an original sin that cannot ever be washed away regardless of what I do. If I was a random stranger and asked her for directions in the street, she would have answered but because I was tarnished with the original sin of being on the same online chat, she wouldn’t even want to hear a “Hello” from me. I wasn’t asking her for a date or proposing to her, I just wanted to see – at least for a moment – a friend who is very dear to me. Now please go back and reread the Disclaimer if you need to do so.  

Shortly after I sent her my message, H., who earlier had been very active in our community, told us (chat members) all that we are  her beloved friends but she is struggling with some problems and since then she severely limited her participation in our chat. H., while very outspoken about various non-personal topics she cares about, has always been surprisingly reluctant to talk about her personal stuff, even topics that seemed “innocent”. I remember a conversation where she mentioned her job and – to continue the topic – I asked her what seemed to me to be a very safe and non-controversial question, just to follow up with the small talk. She stated that she doesn’t feel comfortable talking about this and suggested changing the topic. I couldn’t help but wonder if I scared her away from the chat with my suggestion. I really don’t want to go into trying to psychoanalyse a friend (I believe that would be inappropriate) but based on her various messages. both private and public, I feel like H. is very cautious with whom she allows to get to know her out of fear of getting hurt in some way by other people. (What doesn’t help is that recently our shared friend from the chat, I’ll call her A., left the chat in rather unpleasant circumstances. I miss A., regardless of what she did, but other chat members seem to be unwilling to even mention her name now.)

While I don’t suspect that my message was the exclusive reason of her somewhat distancing herself from the chat, I keep thinking that, in combination with other stuff, I contributed to scaring H. away. Maybe she was afraid that the chat, previously an escapism from reality, has become too real.  Or maybe I am wrong and the time proximity of these events is a pure coincidence. That’s another question that I keep asking myself and maybe I’ll never know the answer.

I keep emotionally struggling with this whole situation and I miss very dearly our earlier long discussions with H. (they could be philosophical debates or just a series of exchanges of jokes or whatever). Whenever I go to the chat, I feel underwhelmed and depressed because I remember what this place used to be like. The change seemed to have happened abruptly, in an instant. This overwhelming feeling of sadness (also increased by other circumstances in my life) caused me to move away from the chat. I had already disappeared from the chat earlier already for some periods of time. Somewhere maybe around last Christmas I disappeared for probably longer than ever before.

I missed my friends of the chat. A lot of stuff in the offline world reminded me of them. At the same time my absence helped me to distance myself at least partially from the nrgative emotions described above. I stopped thinking so intensively about my conversation with H. Then I came back. I had known I would. And my feelings caused by the chat also came back. Now this has already been over a month since my return, I believe, but this vicious cycle seems to be taking more and more control of my life to the point that I have no idea what I am supposed to do.

I can't leave the chat permanently because I would miss the people from there too much and also I know that I'm not the only person there who, to some extent, relies on the chat for some emotional support. Leaving would be a betrayal of friends that I both need in my life but also I don't want to hurt them by leaving. While I do have some other friends, both online and offline (not that there are too many of them), and I'm not trying to dismiss any of them as irrelevant in any way (on the contrary – I also need them in my life), the conversations with chat friends are unlike conversations with anybody else. These people are not disposable and nobody else would be able to fulfil the same role in my life. I don’t know anybody else like that.

But when I stay on the chat, the feelings of sadness and helplessness intensify. My mind is overwhelmed by the stuff I already described. I feel like I can’t go on like this either way – with or without being on the chat. This is just devastating whatever is left of my mental well-being.

I know all of this post may sound overly dramatic. That’s normal that various people online have various expectations and that you can’t advance a friendship without both sides consenting. I feel like I’m being unreasonable and whiny here. Regardless, I feel how I feel, and I feel sad, tired and frustrated.

So what do I expect to achieve with this post? I’m not sure. Mostly I needed to talk. I hope somebody reads this. I don’t expect anybody to other some perfect solution to my problems, but if you want to contribute a comment, you are welcome. Here are some questions I’m struggling with that – if you decide to comment – you might want to consider in your answer.

(a) Is there a reasonable way out of this conundrum that on the chat, or away from the chat, I am feeling depressed?

(b) If you know people who are in some way like H., what can I do to ensure that she feels more safe and comfortable? I am not asking how to convince her to change her decision. I don’t even want to convince her. I want her to feel comfortable and if she ever decides to change her decision, I think this is for her to decide and not me.

Post-credit scene: I know how dumb this all sounds but this was not made up or written by an AI. The funniest part will be if by accident somebody from the chat sees this. There is no way they will fail to figure out who I am and who H. is. I’m not sure if that would be good or bad though."
63,2,"I've heard guys in my class laugh about me today for being so qiet in class after a teacher asked me in front of everyone to answer a question i didnt even know the answer to. That is kind of an weak point to me, everything was shaking and i KNEW EXACTLY what Kind of look the ""cool confident"" girls gave me. It was horrible i just wanted to faint on Spot and never wake up if you get what i mean.

So later in school i basically went to the bathroom, and i didnt even intent to cry i just wanted to use a toilet but i couldnt stop myself anymore. The problem: when i cry, my eyes get really really Red and that doesnt go away rlly fast, and when i stepped out of the door, a girl saw me and asked if i was okay. I immediatly panicked a little internally and just said ""i have makeup in my eye"" and went away...but she judged me a little because unintentionally, my tone sounded rude...i didnt want to be rude.
I went back to the classroom and got those looks again.

I Am not even diagnosed with anything. I am probably just overwhelmed and overreacting, at least that is what everyone tells me. This Ruins evenings because i often spend then crying, it makes social life and Events hard and i just want to stay home forever. I Dont feel seen, even tho i have a supporting family and friends, no one takes the struggle serious. Not even here, when i try to get help i get like 1-2 comments, which helps but it feels like a Slap in the face, As if people do think i am overreacting

Idk what to do anymore. I wish i could quit school and stay in my solitude room forever :(
How was your day? "
64,2,"Hi everyone,

I’m really struggling and could use some genuine advice from fellow introverts or anyone with social anxiety who’s been in a similar spot.

I’ve worked really hard to get to where I am. I’m educated, have the degrees and credentials, and I know I’m smart. But when it comes to public speaking or being in meetings that aren’t one-on-one, I freeze. My face turns red,I get extremely nervous, sometimes I stumble over my words, my voice gets shakey, or completely blank out. It’s embarrassing and frustrating.

I can hold casual conversations with my co workers. But once I’m in a setting where I feel like people are watching or judging me—like meetings, or presentations—my social anxiety takes over.  I worry so much about saying the wrong thing or messing up. I try not to care what people think, but deep down, I still do. I can be a perfectionist and it’s exhausting..

It used to be way worse. I would completely stumble through presentations and leave feeling humiliated. I’ve made some progress over time, but I still feel so far from where I want to be. It’s gotten to the point where I know it’s holding me back from promotions and leadership roles, and I want more for myself. I want to be successful. I want to grow.

If anyone out there has been through this—especially fellow introverts—please, how did you cope? What helped you improve? Did you speak to any professionals about this issue? How did you start showing up more confidently in group settings?

Any honest advice, tools, books, techniques, or even just encouragement is appreciated more than you know.

Thank you in advance.

— A tired introvert trying to grow.."
65,2,"As soon as we were done all I could think was, how I was so quiet and had nothing to really add to the conversation. I just know if I was someone else they could've had a better time than trying to be friends with someone like me. God I wish I was more interesting and could socialize more fluently "
66,2,I have really bad social anxiety even online when it's anonymous but I'm really trying to get better so I'm posting this to hopefully slowly get better 
67,2,"I was trying to do some introspection for an exercise, and I was asked to ""figure out what I am afraid of"". Common answers seem to be things like ""I'm afraid people will think I'm dumb, weird, creepy, etc."" but I don't know if that necessarily applies to me. 
 
Obviously it would be great if everyone liked me, but once an interaction is over I don't really dwell on the outcome too much. I don't mind if people think I'm weird or stupid. I've definitely met people in my life who either dislike me or I think they dislike me. Unless they play an important role in my life, I don't think about it too much. I'll think about if they're justified in disliking me, and if they are I'll laugh about it and move on. If I think they're not, then I'll maybe curse them a little in my head but I'll still move on. 
 
I'm open to this being a sort of coping mechanism that I've come up with, the idea that I am indifferent to the outcome of social interactions. And if this is indeed the case, that my ego is protecting me by manifesting these feelings as indifference, how can I probe that? But if I think about the events that make me feel anxiety, it really doesn't feel like it has anything to do with that. 
 
Instead, it feels like I'm afraid of the interaction itself. Once the interaction is over, I'm mentally free. Maybe I'll cringe at myself a bit if I think it went really poorly, but I'm always able to laugh at myself in that situation rather than being pressed by it. But if I'm not afraid of a certain outcome, then why am I feeling anxiety in the first place? I feel like this is an important step in attempting to remedy this condition, but I am in need of outside help. Does this description resonate anyone else? 

TL;DR Does anyone have insight on why one might feel anxiety from social interactions, yet not be afraid of the outcome?"
68,2,"My cheeks go red pretty easily. Talking to someone and randomly thinking of going red could make me go red. For example when I’m speaking in class or when someone calls me out for something I go red. My cheeks also turn red when playing football, when it hot outside and the suns shining on my face, when it’s really cold. The football part I don’t mind but just the sun shining on one side of my face and that makes me go red is annoying. I think a big part of it is just me thinking o shit now my face I getting hot or now I a situation I would normally blush in and then I go red. I never had this problem before but randomly like 1-2 years ago I just started going red. I’m 15 years and I wouldn’t really say that I got social anxiety but I have some kinda anxiety I guess. I’m not even embarrassed when speaking in front of my class it’s just that I’m embarrassed cause of the fact that I blush. It got better for a while and I kinda stopped blushing and then a friend called me out when I went red and spoke about it another time and ever since that I’m back on square one. Since I’m 15 it’s a big big problem since now’s the time when I’m supposed to have fun and do stuff but instead my blushing limits me and I can only imagine how this’ll be when I get a job and need to meet a lot of people and present stuff to them. Also I’m a boy so I don’t wanna wear any makeup or stuff like that to cover it up. I just wanna learn how to cope with it or make it go away. I would greatly appreciate any tips!🙏( anyone who reads this is making my life a bit easier!)"
69,2,"I wasn’t really a social person even in my home country. I didn’t go out much, and I didn’t have many close friends.  
Now I’m on a working holiday in a different country, and it’s been… really hard.

I’ve met a few people through Reddit meetups, but I feel like I’m not a good person to be around. Maybe it’s because my English isn’t very good, so I can’t really share my thoughts or connect deeply. The conversations don’t go very far, and the connections don’t last.  
Sometimes I wonder—do they even see me as a real friend, or just someone they talked to once?

Also, I’ve been putting off sending out my resume for a month now. I know I need to, but I’m scared. Scared of being rejected, scared of someone calling me, scared that I won’t understand them or won’t know what to say.  
For the first two weeks after I arrived, I barely left the room. I even locked the door and stayed in.

I want to change, but I don’t know how.  
What do you do to become someone that others want to be around? What kind of effort do you make?  
I feel like I wasn’t a good friend or a likable person back home either… so I’m not sure where to begin.

Any advice would really mean a lot."

72,2,"Hello I’m a 24M and I’ve had trouble making friends my whole life. I’m married and my wife is my best friend, I’m close with my 4 siblings and I have one other close friend that I talk to regularly but we don’t get to hang out because we’re both military and stationed at different bases now. I’ve always struggled making friends and I used to blame it on just being shy. While that definitely is part of it, I’ve made it a point to put myself out there and still that doesn’t work. I feel like when I put myself out there I am received as being arrogant or cocky and when I’m more reserved I am perceived like I feel like I’m too good to talk to anyone. But I am well liked at work and have a lot of “friends” but I don’t hang out with any of them outside of work. The thing that is confusing to me is I’ve never had trouble finding a romantic partner or anything.  I’m really trying to put myself out of my comfort zone and make friends, any tips would be greatly appreciated."
73,2,"For clarity, I'm a 52M and I have 0 people that I would call a friend. My entire life I have struggled to connect with people. I will be friendly and as social as I can stand at work, or if I have to go out in public. However, there is a disconnect when it comes to actually crossing the line from acquaintance to friend. I don't understand why I feel the way i do. I don't get anxious around others per say. Its more along the lines of I just dont want to be around people. I find people clingy, judgemental, opinionated, and mostly interested in only themselves and what I  can do for them. Not, how can this person enrich my life. So at the end of the day, I'd rather just stay home and keep to myself. So my question, do I struggle with social anxiety, or am I just an asshole?"
74,2,"27M. This is a pattern that I've only recently started to notice, but it's been there all my life. More prevalent after I graduated high school and went into college, losing my main friend group and trying to make new ones.

Basically, I can become friendly/social enough with individuals in different settings (my sport club that I'm a member at, work, family, parties, etc.). But the moment there's multiple people, it feels like cliques start to form and I am just awkwardly sitting on the sidelines. I know that these are opportunities to join the conversations, but I just never get the feeling that I'm invited to insert myself, or that I have nothing to add to the conversations.

Does anybody else struggle with something similar? I'm a very socially anxious person, and it's been debilitating. I'd like some advice on how to overcome this."
75,2,"Hi all,

I hope it’s okay if I document my attempts at making friends from time to time.

Last weekend, on June 14th, I signed up for a girls’ date to the art gallery. Everyone seemed friendly. The event was supposed to continue with some time at the park—playing board games, cycling, and having dinner. However, I only stayed for the gallery visit.

I wasn’t feeling quite like myself—maybe because I only had four hours of sleep, or maybe because I find the art gallery to be a place best experienced alone. One person kindly offered to take my picture, but I was too absorbed in studying the artwork.

It felt like I was in my own world. I wanted to get lost in it. Most of the paintings were watercolours from over a hundred years ago, and I was completely enthralled by the delicate brushstrokes and the soft, washed-out colours.

I left early, saying I wasn’t feeling well.

I’ve signed up for a night hike and a sports event over the coming weekends. Hopefully those will turn out better, lift my spirits and help me feel more connected."
76,2,"Hello!! 

As the title suggests I (22m) am pretty great when it comes to talking to new people. Especially if I have absolutely 0 outside connection to them, and they don’t seem like people I’d particularly -WANT- to be friends with (that’s another issue where I get to nervous because I’m worried me trying to be friendly will come off creepy and weird?? Even though I don’t have that issue with regular people??) 

But when it comes to people i do have a connection with (family, friends, coworkers, partners, cast mates ect.)  I get so overwhelmingly anxious talking to them. I don’t want to ruin our friendship, and I want to always do the right thing and make the right choice ((I always want the +👬 sims stat effect)) that I end up WAYYYYY overthinking, so I either zone out and done respond, go recluse, look miserable, hide in within myself - which then makes the person who I love feel like I hate being around them, because I can never be comfortable around them. 

But if I spend to much time talking to the strangers they then become important and then I can’t talk to them… it’s like after a certain point of connectivity I just can’t??? It’s like I forget they like me or trust they want to hear or see me things I just don’t worry about with strangers"
77,2,"Used to be my worst nightmare. First the noise... everyone having a seemingly amazing time talking effortlessly to people they know? Strangers? If you felt like a loner at school it's hard to feel like you will be accepted. 
Then there's the queue... having to deal with more confident or taller people pushing in front. Then add in being in a foreign country. Sometimes if there's people who are also English it's more nerve wracking as you feel more judged... 
How do you not feel intimidated or as if you're  unwanted? I'm better at this than I used to be and after a few drinks I have no issues (obviously) "
78,2,I'm not sure if I have social anxiety or something else so I've come for help. So I don't avoid social interactions but I'm not willingly going to them. Loud noises sometimes overstimulates me and I get uncomfortable when I push me for something. Although i do reflect on my actions very thoroughly and I always believe people judge me for everything i do.
79,2,"So I've been trying to interact with people online, I started playing a little bit of garry's mod, but I panic when trying to speak or chat. The same happens with discord servers, or any other platform for that matter. It's been years since I've made any effort to interact with others, so I guess I can't really help it, does anyone have conversations online? How do you manage the fear and not quit?"
80,2,"I believe I have social anxiety as well. I know I do. My mom and I had this conversation a couple of years ago and I guess I inherited this from her. I think I do an okay job at managing it. I'm far from extroverted... But I guess I'm an okay actor sometimes.

When I read a lot of testimonials here, it seems that the majority of people here want to connect with others, but have a hard time doing it. I completely get that first hand.

For me... I have my partner who is also my best friend wrapped into one. He also has social anxiety so I feel so fortunate that he and I support each other with it. We've talked about it as well.I love that we have that in common with each other. I didn't even know for the first couple of years we were together we ""came out of the closet"" to each other about this. [No wonder we vibed so well in the beginning!]

I think a good idea might be to have this page be used to be a place where maybe people can meet and connect. Perhaps when making a post here state your age/sex/location and if someone sounds interesting... Shoot a message and see where things go where you all know that you won't be negatively judged. The internet is a great place to hide social anxiety. Find similar interests... Get to know each other online and perhaps meet in person someday and maybe you'd make a great friend.

I don't know...  I think it's a good idea. Everyone here seems to want the same things but are afraid of being judged. We have a great space HERE in which to find someone to connect with someone who probably understands you and your unique needs. They also share those same needs.

Good luck ❤️"
81,2,"im not sure if this falls under social anxiety but i absolutely hate hate hate asking for things. not just big things like money or food or anything, but even small things like ""can i borrow this"" or ""can you pick this thing up for me from the ground"". it's not the fear of hearing ""no"" that makes scares me, its the embarrassment and disappointment that ensues. it takes a lot for me to build up the confidence to ask. my heart starts racing and its like im playing tug of war in my head. 



im in a summer camp/college bridge program for context. just now i built up the courage to ask my program director to check something for me and the blunt ""no"" and subsequent look completely crushed me. is this just me being immature? i genuinely felt like crying and had to step out to avoid embarrassment. it's not the fact that she said no, it was everything - the build-up, the convincing myself that it wouldn't be that bad, and the subsequent complete shutdown of my request. this isn't just that situation, its every time where i ask something.

  
on that topic, i feel so extremely isolated here. i came in determined to make friends and change the narrative but i just feel like im weird and everyone thinks the same too. its gotten to the point where people are excluding me from activities and i just feel gross and strange. i dont know if im oversharing in conversations or if im not doing something right and its killing me. i dont know if this falls under social anxiety but im so lost at this point. i feel like completely giving up on everything and never even trying to make connections with people again because what's the point if i always have the same experience every time? "
82,2,"So I work at this american grocery store (most around the neighborhood are mostly hispanic + Asian customers, like el guero, petes market, or cermak produce) and it is usually is busy (especially since they closed our local food4less like 5 years ago).

As I am walking doing my sweeping with the broom, I accidentally make eye contact and this woman smiles at me.

What should I do? 
I do not have any idea what to do. Do I smile back, is she trying to keep from laughing at me, do i wave hi, do i say hello (i usually say good morning if its morning), is she flirting/coming on to me (i highly doubt it).

I feel so uncomfortable and respond with nothing and keep doing my work"
83,2,"Ive been staying home since the start of march. I hardly go out. I have stopped going to school and i couldnt graduate either. I was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder mid march, but i was still able to go out on walks (with a parent). I was able to have friends and guests over, even though it caused mild anxiety. Now i cant tolerate anyone else (i get panic attacks) other than the people that already live here. I also cant call/video call anyone because it causes alot of stress and anxiety. A while ago i started getting thoughts that are usually described as OCD so i talked to my psychiatrist about it and got told that i developed those thoughts because my anxiety has gotten worse.

Im scared im not going to be able to recover from this and get back to how i used to be. Ive lost hope and i just dont know anymore. Its like i keep going in circles.

Maybe someone has been through something similar like this?
"
84,2,"Not sure if this relevant enough to be here, but I do have bad social anxiety and this specific issue on top of that really does make it feel harder to talk with people 

For starters, I’m 17, but throughout all of school I noticed people treat me weirdly, best way I can explain it is they talk to me like an amused parent of a chaotic kid (I’m not even chaotic?) and it makes me really hate talking to people. I’m not even talking about random people that I don’t know, it’s mostly my *friends* that do it. I know they don’t mean any harm, but it makes me so uncomfortable. It’s not even specific things they say that make me feel that way, but I constantly notice people using a more condescending tone when talking to me than when they talk to others

I have a feeling it could be because I’m unbelievably short (I’m 5’2 LOL) because I can’t envision them treating me that way if I was actually tall. That could just be coming from a place of insecurity because it used to make me really self conscious but I know those things really can change people’s perception of you

Whatever it is, does anyone have any advice on how I can avoid feeling patronized by everyone?"
85,2,"Since 2020, I’ve struggled a lot with social anxiety and depression. I currently live in the UK whilst my grandparents are in Canada. Whilst it isn’t as bad as it used to be, I still struggle a lot with phone calls/FaceTime which happens to be one of the main forms of contact with my grandparents. I feel horrible because I know they won’t be around forever but I can only pluck up the courage to speak to them when I’m either told by my mum/spotted in the background. Usually the conversation ends in awkward silence and me pretending to be occupied by something. 
Not only is it the phone calls, but I was lucky enough to visit them last year, however spent the majority of the time glued to my mums side and panicking whenever I was in a room alone with one of them. 
I wish I could have the same bond with them that I had when I was younger but I fear my anxiety will never let experience it again. "
86,2,"I went to my first pride event but I didn't have anyone to go with, not even friends, and so after getting some food from a food truck (at least) I tried walking to all the stands because I wanted to check them out, but I just felt like everyone was staring at and judging me so I couldn't go to any of them. Everyone had people with them too and all looked to be having so much fun. Im too shy to even go do activities by myself let alone walk up to others and talk to them. So it wasn't anywhere near as fun as I thought it would be. I don't know how I'm ever going to get a girlfriend at this rate lol. At least the fajita plate was good. "
87,2,"I'm 18M, just finishing exams and then going to uni after summer and starting a new life in a new city (very excited).

I've spent 2 years in my current school that I've now finished, and along the way I've hung out with the same group of friends. 
For the first year and a half, everything felt good, normal, this ""element"" that I'll talk about in a sec didn't bother me because I didn't really see it.
But in the last few months at this school, I've come to realize and believe more and more that all my relationships at the school and in that town are superficial as hell. 
I have school friends who I'll hang out with just during school but never after because they all go home and never suggest it, whereas I'm at boarding school so I'm sort of limited did to curfew..etc. It's like the whole of my friendships at school are a way for us to just not be alone, but we don't actually have any in common, at least I don't and there stems the problem: I don't feel understood or heard by anyone. 
It's become so bad that even going to school for one day to pass my exams has become horrible, I feel alone amongst my friends and alone in the town itself. 
I'm craving and seeking complex and deep relationships with cool ass people, not some superficial shit that makes me feel horrible. In consequence to all of that I feel behind, like I'm missing out on all these experiences these friends are having, and I'm essentially putting pressure on myself to try and not miss out. But I gotta realise that missing out doesn't exist, you can't be behind bro, behind what even ? I'm chilling and living my life, and each person is living theirs too. It'll get better.
I guess I'm just writing this to seek reassurance, thanks to anyone who reads and replies to me. :)"
88,2,"I usually hang out by myself. I go to concerts, movies, restaurants, and bars alone. I do have some close friends that I hang out with, but most of the time, I’m alone. I don’t mind it, and actually got more comfortable with being alone. 

One of my friends was having a party, and invited me to come along. For context, me and this friend are cool, but we’re not super close. We met thru a hobby we both enjoy, and ended up on the same team. We hang out one on one every so often, but last time we did was last year. 

Anyway, I didn’t want to go because life got in the way and I had to stop attending team events, so I’m not as close with anyone anymore. I also didn’t know any of the newer members of the team, but she insisted I come. My mom said I should go and meet people, so I did. 

I got there and pretty much…no one talked to me. Some of the members I used to talk to came up to me and spoke to me a bit, but they were mostly busy talking to the other team members or their friends that they invited. My friend who invited me ate with me and chatted with me a bit, but that was it. I understood because she was busy hosting and had to entertain everyone. The newer team members didn’t acknowledge me at all. One of them introduced themselves to me, but that was it. I sat at the table by myself and watching everyone socialize. There were times where I tried to join in on a conversation with others who were also sitting at the table, but they were just like, “oh.” Needless to say, I left the party early. 

On the drive home, I cried. I felt so stupid and embarrassed. I feel like I don’t do well in group settings at all. I usually don’t talk to people unless they talk to me first, because I usually don’t know what to say. However, when I go to concerts and bars by myself, I’m out dancing and singing like no care in the world. 

I also want to add—I went on a date last night, and the guy was mostly doing all the talking. When he asked me about myself I just told him what I did for work and that’s about it. I told him, “Honestly, I don’t know what to say about myself. I don’t have any interesting stories or anything to share.” 😭 

WTF is wrong with me?! Is it social anxiety or am I just super shy? "
89,2,"Back in middle school, I learned that being involved in drama or gossip was the only way to feel relevant or included. That phase thankfully faded in high school. I ended up making my best friend just by being myself, and I thought I had outgrown that need to ""perform"" in social settings.

But in college, I was treading new waters. I studied computer science and started feeling like a total outcast. I didn’t really make friends during that time. Between my social anxiety, being in a male-dominated major, and then the pandemic hitting, I just kind of isolated.

The gossipy/snarky attitude resurfaced later on, oddly enough, when I was trying to bond with my (now) husband’s family. I didn’t feel like I could connect by being my authentic self. If I tried talking about the things I actually like, I’d get blank stares or feel left out of the conversation. But when I joined in on the sarcasm or gossip, people seemed to like me. So I fell back into that old role, even though it didn’t feel good.

Now, after some work in therapy, I’ve realized that I don’t want to keep socializing that way. It’s unfulfilling and leaves me feeling disconnected from people. The real me is analytical and nerdy.I like deep conversations, exploring ideas, and talking about the things I genuinely care about. But when I try to do that, I often feel like I’m “too much” or “bragging.”

I’ve always been kind of ahead of my peers in terms of life milestones: I bought my first house at 21, my first car at 20, and started my career before graduating. So while others were talking about friend drama or things I couldn’t relate to, I was thinking about bills and long-term goals. It made me feel like I had to dumb myself down or forget about the things I care about just to connect, which was exhausting.

Recently, I let go of relationships that no longer fit me. It's freeing in a way, but now I’m at this weird in-between stage of wanting new, authentic friendships and not knowing how to build them.

I’m a woman in STEM, and while I enjoy my work, I haven’t had luck making friends there. The guys tend to befriend each other and I often feel left out — I get it, and I’ve accepted it, but it’s still lonely sometimes. Outside of work, I have a lot of interests (baking, cooking, knitting, crocheting, horses, STEM, gardening), but I’m not sure how to turn those into meaningful social connections.

Has anyone else gone through something similar? Re-learning how to socialize more authentically as an adult? How did you find people you actually *clicked* with?"
90,2,"I have to take medicine after breakfast so I went to buy it. My scooter won't start easily especially when it's at rest for a longass night 
So I tried to start it at centre stand but no result. I did it from 3 minutes no results. Social anxiety rushed to peak. I notice 3 to 4 people observing what the heck I was trying to do. Usually I start it after a min. But this time nothing worked. A drink guy approached me and tried to help by starting it mf it started in first attempt itself. A DRUNK GUY has more aura than me. Social anxiety makes our mind go blank to the extent that you can't even think properly and so stupid things over and again 
Fuck it "
91,2,"I'm tired of myself, of others, of being me. And just everything in general. I just want to rest for a while. I want to be different, i want to be able to talk to people without having 10 anxiety attacks in an hour. Why did i have to be this way? When others aren't? I stole my life from myself by being an anxious mess. 

I feel shame for no reason. As if I'm naked in the middle of a crowded street. I'd rather stop existing forever. 

I love being alive, i just don't like myself. Nothing can make me like myself. "
92,2,"I am alone, I was always alone. I used music, gaming, porn, movies, tv series, books etc. for coping. I am dumb and I can't stand life anymore. I am alone because I am dumb. I don't know how to speak with someone, how to use my facial expressions, how to move my lips, how to tone my voice, how to show my emotions, how to not worry about what I am saying, how to not thinking all of these. Nobody wants to talk with someone they are not comfortable with. That's why nobody wants to talk with me, no excuses. But can I stand this life anymore like this? I feel like an alien, always felt like an alien. Why didn't people accept me in the beginning tho, why? I was decent maybe not funny, not talkative but a decent guy. Now I turned into a loser and a freak. I did nothing to solve this issue for years because I was feeling numb. I was feeling defeated. I became a stranger to whole world. Now only solution seems like dying. I can't see a door that makes me satisfied with my life. I can't see an escape from this prison. It is eating me everyday and I become dumber every minute I stay here. I am a coward. But I am right about being coward. "
93,2,So its summer vacation time and im going to be a high school junior after it ends. İ was really socially anxious 2 years ago and couldnt talk with noone and i tried to change. Lost weight and stuff. Seems like i couldnt get much better since im still lonely. İ have like 2 close friends and like 10 people i talk to every now and then. Since it is the start of the summer vacation i feel lonely since everyone i know was from school. What to do guys? İ will start going to the gym dunno if i will find friends tho. İm afraid of being lonely in collage too or attract weird asocial people since only they are trying to find friends. Just like me... Am i too late? How can i be a more social person when school starts again even tho i dont have friends so i cant talk with noone rn?
94,2,"I (M25) went to a wedding this past weekend. There was a girl (F25) there that my friends (the two getting married) wanted me to meet because they believed we would be a good match (she was one of the bridesmaids and I was a groomsman, so plenty of opportunities to talk). The days leading to the event I felt a mixture of excitement and dread. This was the closest I had been in a very long time to talking to a girl I had not met before within this kind of context. When I finally did meet her my brain locked up and I completely froze, unable to get out anything besides meaningless small talk. I became increasingly frustrated with myself as the night went on and I noticed her dancing alone, unable to gain the courage to ask her to dance. My fellow groomsmen brought me outside to discuss it, as I'm sure they noticed me actively trying to avoid talking to her, trying to give me the moral boost to make a move. The only thing I could tell them is that I was a self-destructive coward. They vehemently disagreed and wanted me to stop talking so poorly about myself but it's how I felt and I couldn't shake those emotions. The rest of the night was spent essentially the same way; seeing her alone, trying to gain the courage to talk to her, psyching myself out, and ultimately doing nothing. After the ceremony and reception were over, the bridal party and a few others that attended the wedding went out to a bar for an after party. Perhaps it was the change in atmosphere or the continuation of a long night of drinking, but I finally felt some semblance of an urge to talk to her. However once I found her, she was sitting at the bar talking to another guy.

I had two main thoughts throughout the night: ""a sweet, attractive woman has never looked twice at me, she won't be any different"" and ""I am so insanely awkward, please don't put anyone else through that."" There is almost a sense of comfort that I feel with thinking like this and I think it's because it's the only way I've felt for so long. I need to break this habit but it genuinely seems impossible. Situations like this are very rarely put in front of me, and when they do present themselves, I always get in this thought pattern. Problem being is that the entire night, I was constantly getting compliments for how good I looked in my suit which I would hope could give me the confidence boost I would need to talk to the girl but it ultimately did nothing for the overbearing negative thoughts in my head.

If anyone else has ever been trapped in their own head like this, what were you ultimately able to do to break the habit? I'm scared I'm going to be stuck like this if I cant figure something out."

97,2,"I got social anxiety and erythrophobia at the end of my seventh grade school year. Things only got worse. I used to want to be the center of attention, and now I cant even look other people in the eye. It took about a year for everyone to go from liking me to getting weirded out by me. I hate it. It’s only going downhill. Ts abt to be my thirteenth reason gng 😭. I lost my sense of humor and im constantly miserable. I only want to stay at home now because of how nervous I get around other people. It feels like everyone’s eyes are always on me and they’re always judging. I cant even stay in the same room with my dad for more than a minute without getting uncomfortable and wanting to leave. I know there’s no hope for me, but im just too lazy to end it. I dont really fear death or where I’ll end up, its just a very painful complicated process that I dont have the patience or willpower for. 

This is all made worse by the fact that my mom thinks im being dramatic. She’s just telling me to stay positive all the time and to get off my computer. She won’t take me to therapy or let me get diagnosed. She doesn’t know how I feel when I’m forced to meet someone I’m not familiar with."

And presentations are the worst. I usually dont avoid because i dont want to dissapoint my friends i am working with...but it makes me feel nauseaus and i always feel like i need to go to the bathroom (guys is that normal..?) 

After the worst one, i had nightmares about standing there, they are staring and there were exit signs St the Windows. So basically my head tells me the window is the way out? 

And Sports class too, we had trampoline And all of them were watching me, i couldnt control my legs And failed horribly i even heard giggles

102,2,"I live one of those lives that is not so much ignored but simply lies beyond the comprehension of most people. I can acknowledge I live on the edge of human social existence. 

For starters I have autism. This alone makes me incomprehensible to most people. The way I view the world and the way I understand the world is so very different from most people. With that said I think the world has become a bit more understanding of neurodivergence in many aspects of life. While I certainly think being autistic separates me from most people I do think there is certainly a place for people with autism to thrive and be understood in the world today. 

What really seems to separate me and makes me beyond the realm of understanding to the vast majority of people is that I pair autism with extreme chronic anxiety. In truth I had such bad anxiety all my life that it masked my autism. I would spend five minutes with a doctor and all they would see is what a nervous wreck I was. 

Therapists and phyciatrists tried treating the anxiety. They never looked deeper I was only diagnosed with autism at the age of 37 (I am 38 right now).

Obviously, I am a little bit unique since I have both autism and anxiety. But what most people do not understand is that I am learning to live with my anxiety. I am learning to manage it and craft a life around it as best I can. I battled my anxiety very openly for years. I did my absolute best for years. But now it has been a solid 20 years of battling anxiety as an adult. And I am not afraid to admit I lost that war.

Life for me will not look the same as it will for most people. It will be a more limited and simplistic life. And for me that is totally fine. But I do have to acknowledge that for most people my life simply makes no sense. They cannot begin to understand what I went through. Or who I am.

I lost my war on anxiety. Now it is about learning to live with my life the way it is :) Not the way other people expect me to live it. "

I lowkey hope they don’t response but I also really need a part time job this summer and fall. 

I have no work experience because obviously social anxiety. I applied to retail jobs because I do really want to work on getting better at communication and gain some customer service experience. 

I’ll be turning 26 soon so it’s even more nerve wrecking cuz I have to work for insurance. 

Ugh I hate this feeling! I would like some advice or words of encouragement if you have any. But this is more of a vent post cuz now I need to just keep applying. 5 applications aren’t gonna guarantee a job 😭

"
104,2,"Let me start by saying I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read my post, I hope it’s not too long of a read but I’m really struggling here.

I’m not even sure where to begin, but I feel like my social anxiety is like a highway where I start to feel better and more confident in myself and I’m just cruising smoothly along.

Then certain people come along like stop signs out of nowhere, and drag me right back down into self doubt.

I’ve certainly been dealing with social anxiety and depression my whole life and have pinpointed it to being caused by having one extremely overprotective parent, and the other being extremely critical of anything and everything I did growing up.

So, basically I don’t know how to deal with people, especially other males in a normal way without feeling like any confrontation will become a heated argument or I will be looked at as weak and not “manly” for being too negative.

I guess I will just share my most recent experience and go from there…

One of my hobbies is playing hockey during the week, sometimes on a team, and sometimes during rental sessions.

It really is a small community where most everyone knows everyone else, and I’ve become friends with the guy who captains quite a few teams, and also runs most of the rental sessions during the week.

As someone who deals with SA, it’s been hard for me to finally get confidence in myself and my playing style because I didn’t really start getting into playing hockey until my mid twenties. This means I have never been coached by anyone and have had to teach myself how to play, but I’ve always known how to skate at an advanced level.

The point I’m getting at is I feel like I’ve come a long way and have finally found my fit. I have gotten better and most people around me have noticed and when I play with them, I feel confident in myself which leads to them feeling confident in me so we have fun out there and the stress from the grind if everyday life just melts away.

At the end of the day, I have learned not to be so hard on myself and to actually have fun out there because that’s what it’s all about. It’s just a recreational activity and sometimes it really is fun to take it seriously especially when playing vs other good teams. But MOST times it’s playing with other people who know we all have work the next morning and we’re really just there to not think about anything, and just enjoy each other’s company and play a game.

Now here is my current problem…

There’s this guy who plays every so often who has been friends for a long time with the guy who I mentioned earlier that runs some teams and the rental sessions.

In my opinion, this guy really doesn’t respect me as a person or a hockey player because, well he reminds me a lot of my parent who is extremely over-critical.

I constantly hear him talking good about other guys out there and ignores their mistakes, but with me it’s the opposite.

I can feel him watching me all the time and picking me apart when I make a mistake, and ignoring every good play I make out there.

And the worst part is he never shuts up. He is always yelling like a coach. Even when we’re winning, it’s like he’s expecting everyone to skate hard and treat every moment like we’re playing in the NHL.

The problem I have is I let this bother me and it completely, and I mean completely takes me out of my game to the point where I just want to leave and go home because I’m not having fun doing something that is literally meant to be a fun time.

I know I get sensitive so I just get really quiet and don’t say anything to the guy and I can feel his disrespect towards me, even though he never directly says anything to me. I don’t want to ask our mutual friend every time if this dude is going to be playing, because then I feel like I will come off as a baby or weak if I say I’m not playing if he’s going to show up.

But like I said, the real issue is I don’t know how to tune this guy out because I feel I get triggered by him because he speaks exactly like my over-critical parent. And obviously I don’t know how to confront him in the right way either.

It’s like he doesn’t want to appreciate that I have gotten better and he just feels like I’m still the same player I was 5 years ago and am going to just make mistakes out there and be stupid. I want to just tell him to shut the fuck up and let me play and trust me. But then I will be the asshole right? I want to tell him to just chill out and enjoy the game and have fun, but he’s just one if them guys that I can’t get myself to like, even though I definitely don’t hate the guy or anything. It’s just one of those things I guess.

It’s like certain people put you in a category especially when you’re the more laid back, quiet type, and then all of a sudden when you show improvements, it makes them react a certain way.

Even when I’m on the opposite team as him when we play against each other in a rental session. I will make a good play against him and not hear a peep out of him like “oh good play” or “nice move” or anything. But then when someone else does the same, I’ll hear him singing their praises.

I mean I’m at the rink like 4+ times a week because it’s something I obviously enjoy doing and then this guy comes along every so often and completely ruins it for me. So now after playing with him today, I’m back to doubting myself. 

I got real quiet after the game, and when my other buddy showed up for the game after mine, I barely said a word to him because I know that I will just start “complaining” about the dude I don’t get along with.

It’s like I’ve been doing SO GOOD recently and all it takes is for this one person to show up one time and just like that, all that effort to be more positive and just enjoy life goes right out the window.

I just don’t know how to channel this energy from people who remind me of the ones in my life who always made me feel less than. Especially when it comes to them being involved in the same activities that I enjoy doing for not only exercise, but for boosting my self confidence."
105,2,"I struggle a lot with social anxiety and feeling mentally foggy around people I’m not close to. I’m usually okay with coworkers because there’s this built-in understanding that they’ll help me if I need it, but with others, I tend to isolate myself. I don’t want to come off as a burden or put pressure on anyone, so I just stay quiet.

I don’t really feel much empathy unless someone is really close to me, and even then I don’t know how to comfort them. Emotional conversations make me uncomfortable, so I usually avoid them. Before talking to someone, I’ll plan out what I want to say, but when the moment comes especially if I’m interested in the person I forget everything. My mind just goes blank. Sometimes I get too nervous to even approach them. If I’m not interested in the person and just need something from them, it’s a little easier, but it still doesn’t feel natural.

I feel normal when I’m with people I already have a connection with, or if there’s a mutual friend involved. But when I’m on my own, I struggle a lot. I don’t really know what this is. I don’t feel like I can talk to my friends about it because I’m scared to open up, and honestly, I don’t even know who I’d talk to. Right now, hiding behind a screen feels like the safest option.

Personally, I’m not very attractive and I’m overweight though I’ve been working on that. In the past three months, I’ve lost 55 pounds trying to gain back my confidence, but I still have a long way to go. Even if it’s just in my head, I feel like people treat me worse because of how I look. That belief has become a huge mental block that I can’t seem to get past, no matter how much I try to reason through it. I feel lonely, and I’m only getting older. I’m 23 and just starting a new career, but this issue is really holding me back socially. I didn’t used to be like this. Everything started spiraling after I graduated high school during COVID, went through college online, and had to transition back into the real world. Since then, I’ve felt stuck in my own head."
106,2,"Hey. 27M from England here. Feeling, well, the only way to put this is lost and hopeless. I've had Social Anxiety at least since I was 14, that's when I really noticed it for the first time. Now it's a lot stronger unfortunately, but I've always just accepted it, never tried to fight it and don't leave the house much. However, in the past week something changed. It's like a switch flipped in me, and now I have an extreme constant feeling of loneliness and strong anxiety about wasting what's left of my late 20's I can't shake it either, can't bare this anymore. I NEED to do something, but what?

Especially as I find it basically impossible to talk to people. Seriously, even something like looking someone in the eye and saying hello is something I find to be absolute hell. I don't even know how some people suffering from this manage to get a GF/BF I can't even make the first steps to become friends with someone, let alone trying to get a GF lol.

I've never tried, or rather been too scared to do something about it until now. I just.....don't know where to begin. Even typing this out feels unnatural and wrong. Like my own body is trying to stop me from making a small start. It's ridiculous. If I carry on like this, nothing will change, I know that. I'll be in my 70's and have nothing to show for it. And that scares the hell out of me, but I don't know what to do..."
107,2,"Vent cuz i don't know what else to do. I fucking hate myself so much, I've not had a friendship that's lasted cuz people find me too intense and my intrests don't match other people. I'm sick of being so emotional and making people my world. I wish someone could accept me even though im boring and quiet, im loyal af but nobody cares about friendship especially cuz im an adult now"
108,2,"this happened so fast I didn’t even have time to process it .. 
Since my mother couldn't drive to pay the bills, I had to step in. I don't usually drive that far, so my step-grandpa drove me to the location, which was about a 40min drive. I struggle with major anxiety staying in the car for that long so I had to force myself to “ get over it “ or else who’s gonna do it ? and I asked my younger sister to tag along so she can accompany me while I get off lol . The car ride there was brutal.. I kept telling myself I didn’t need my anxiety pills to get through it.
we got lost so it was another 8min drive going in circles.. anywho, when we got to our first stop, I had to FaceTime my mother to repeat exactly what she had told me beforehand bcs my brain completely lost track of what I was suppose to say right at the very last minute…
I already felt so embarrassed having to speak up my face felt hot and my ears as well hhhh.
And to top it off a little kid behind me asked his dad about the noise the machine was making and he had to explain that I was getting a money order and thats how the machine works etc … ( oiga si de por sí me ando agüitando ) I already wanted to run away but I kept trying to remember not to forget the receipt ! 
Anywho after that I felt so proud of myself that i definitely didn’t tweak out and stuttered (I definitely did ) and then the next stop was another 10min drive and I thought I had to deal with the embarrassment of talking to another person but thank god I didn't have to I just dropped off the paper at some small quiet office to the front desk lady ? and she said thank you and that was that. tbh I didn't even felt panicky the car ride home anymore, I was too busy feeling relieved that it was finally done …. I guess forcing yourself to socialize helps with stepping out of your comfort zone but omg it’s very draining right afterwards .
Also this isn’t my first time forcing myself to socialize lol , I also had to take out money from a check that was under my name and I accidentally handed over 20 assuming I had to pay and that was so AAGSHDBUED  he giggled at me and explained that it automatically pays itself off with the money I’m taking out..and my hands were shaking so bad after signing in my name and he asked if this was my first time and obv it was ! (He looked like the same age as me so it was 10x more embarrassing)  very nice guy so I’m glad it wasn’t some rude person attending me 🙂‍↕️ "
109,2,"In a few days i have to make a presentation about a book in front of my class. I'm really nervous and I don't know what to do about it. I know that no one gives a damn about the presentation and that everyone just wants to go home. Also my class is really supportive and I know that they wouldnt laugh at me, but im still tensed just thinking about the presentation. I already know my voice will be shaking the entire time and i wont be able to speak propertly. I need at least a good advice. Thank you all."
110,2,"I dont see how its possible as someone with severe social anxiety, and agoraphobia so i stay in my room all day and dont really go outside at all. Im about to turn 18 next month and yes ik people will say thats normal at 18 but i dont see how anything could change as i get older. I dont think im ugly or anything like girls have always called me cute in school but i never knew how to respond or talk id just be lookin awkward. My best chance at getting one was when i was in school, in fact i almost had one it was like a situaionship but i was being hesitant and not commiting even tho i liked her. But not too long after i became very depressed and started having panic attacks which caused me to switch to online school bc i had no idea what was happening to me and was scared to go back to school, like i stopped talking to my friends and was isolating in my room. And obviously isolation makes everything worse and ive been like this for pretty much three years, completely isolated, depressed, disconnected from reality, scared to socialize and leave the house. I shouldve graduated this year if i never became depressed and switched to online school. Its been 3 years of hell and i dont see myself getting any better. And ik i shouldnt be worried about a girlfriend and more so should be focusing on my mental health and i am but even if i do fix my mental health i still dont see how i could ever get a girlfriend like ive ruined my mind and everything by watching corn and isolating myself from the world. I just wish i could go back to how i was and i dont wanna be lonely for the rest of my life. My sister even has severe bipolar with psychotic episodes and she has no problem getting a boyfriend so why cant i? Im just a loser man"
111,2,"I was with friends at the club but one by one they bounced and I was left inebriated dancing with a bunch of strangers to '90s boy bands. 'nsync was on and one of the girls started twerking so, on a whim, I decided to smack her butt. She started laughing, her female friend started laughing, their male friend (who I had not noticed until that moment) started staring daggers at me and I sensed that I really fucked up.

I didn't even have ulterior motives, I just wasn't thinking. I asked her friend ""was that too much?"" and she gave a noncommittal answer but the male friend was still staring at me so since I already cashed out my tab I decided to bounce.

I've been touched inappropriately at that same bar and it really sucked; I didn't feel safe for weeks afterward so it really guts me to have been a part of that same kind of behavior. I feel really gross like I don't even know myself any more.

I don't even know how to navigate what happened or what these people must think of the rando who got too handsy. I never thought I'd be that guy but here I am."
112,2,"I've had social anxiety since I was around 6 or 7 (due to severe bullying), and I am now 34 and still so anxious about... Almost every single social scenario, whether it's as minor as buying groceries in person or as extreme as solo travel and living with strangers. 

The good news that I think most probably can relate to: 95% of the time, whatever I have spent sleepless nights and long days worrying and stressing about, sometimes for weeks, hasn't been nearly as bad as my fears, and sometimes not even bad at all.

That being said, I now realize this doesn't help change my perspective or lessen my anxiety at all. It makes almost 0 difference, because it ultimately doesn't matter in the long run if say, your presentation at work wasn't catastrophic, because the time you spent worrying in the days or weeks leading up to it was such an unendurable and painful ordeal, that your brain remembers *that* way more than the fact that the event itself went 'okay'. So, next time, you're going to get the same stress and worry cycle anyway, with the added 'what-if' of like 'Yeah, last time it went fine, but this time could be different'. There's always going to be that 'what if' or 'Yes, but...' for social anxiety sufferers.

This applies to things within your control as well. A work presentation is hard to bail out of and something you more or less are forced to do, but let's say the scenario is something *you* pushed yourself to do, like you somehow gathered enough bravery to ask someone out on a date. Even if they accept, you still are gonna get intense anxiety about that date, and now it becomes 'too real', so there's a high chance you never even show up.

It doesn't end there. If you do again gather the courage to make it, and the date goes well, the next time, or the next time you want to ask another person out, you'll still get tremendous anxiety.

It's always the anticipation of the event that stays in your psyche. That's why it's hard to break free from the cycle. I think at this point I am just trying to accept (And Goddamn, is it incredibly hard) that I'm going to have continual anxiety that's gonna mess me up for days or weeks before any event and get through it. 

Sometimes I have to push myself to meet these events and scenarios, because it's still better than doing nothing and withdrawing at home, because you never know what good can come out of it. Nothing good comes out of withdrawing, especially long-term. We have to show up for ourselves and sometimes other people that care about us, even if it beats us down in the process. That's just how our brains are wired.

Anyway, I don't know if I've made much sense or I was just rambling. I've been in chronic stress and anxiety about something for weeks and it'll continue, so I just wanted to let a few things out about this gruelling anxiety cycle that we must have a mental battle with day in and day out."
113,2,"
I haven’t done this before but I’m actually scared now. Yes she gave me the green light and for the past few months she overall enjoys talking to me. But I’m scared because I look ugly at the moment

I’ve had a history with no friends for the majority of my life (18 years out of my life, and I’m almost 19 now), and I’ve been struggling with absolute rock bottom self confidence issues since childhood. So now that things are actually happening now I’m scared. I look really good in long hair (most likely because I have an oval-oblong face shape so I need volume), but right now my hair is short so I look terrible. I look like sht. I’m scared to hang out with her because I’m not good enough. Even though it’s just as friends it doesn’t matter. I look so bad in short hair and I don’t even know how she agreed to hang out in the first place. I don’t think I’m good enough for this, but I had to do it because I need to improve my social skills and stop being alone 24/7(which is my comfort zone). I also need social skills for networking so I have no choice. I can’t just work and study constantly forever as a coping mechanism

But the confidence just isn’t there man I feel like I look like a 4/10 max right now even if no one else agrees. Sure there’s a possibility that others think I look fine (which I’ve been told) but I just assume they’re being nice. Even if that’s not the case it doesn’t matter, because I view my self as ugly and so I feel ashamed that I’m hanging out with this person.

What can I do now? It’s already gonna happen so the only thing I can do is prepare "
114,2,"When I have to go somewhere the next day, I fear it until the next day then I really fear it.   Haven't showered in days, nowhere to go but tomorrow I have tms, then the dentist on Tuesday.   I've been so depressed and gave up trying to shower because it seems so hard.  Anyways, im not at ease and anticipatory anxiety is crippling.  Theres no point to this, I just wanted to get it out because my ocd is going crazy."
115,2,When do l break eye contact when someone done talking? I know I’m overthinking it but it just feels so awkward once the person done talking and we both just staring at each other. Should l just look away or stare until they break eye contact first? 
116,2,"Two years ago I started a group therapy, mainly because of the issue of having panic attacks during presentations at work. I am 37 and have a long history of social anxiety with already a few therapy attemps, but nothing that was sustainable.

  
The group therapy was very different, it was less about solving problems, but more about feeling things in the body and have the exchange with others. I did the therapy for about 1.5 years and over time, the problem shifted from presentations and talking at work to loneliness. Before the therapy started, I had days where I had no problem with watching twitch 8 hours a day and go out for 30 mins was enough for me.

But therapy taught me that loneliness is my actual problem. I was and I am always alone. Example: If I take 2 weeks off from work, it could happen that I don't talk for 2 weeks because I don't see any people. The only problem with that: This realization hit so hard that I don't know how to handle that. During my therapy, I also developed a problem with anger. Sometimes I am so angry about my situation that I destroy things at home, plates or cups. This is the only way to release my anger, something needs to shatter. 

  
Therapy is over since a year now, but I am left with these bad feelings about my loneliness. I am trying things, go into groups, try bumble bff, go out alone and so on, but nothing helps. Therapy raises these strong feelings of loneliness in my, but it didn't teach me home to make connections. Or tell me what's wrong with me that I don't find any connections despite trying."

119,2,"I've had a lot of success practicing my social skills on large discord servers using voice chats. It's much more low stress yet still anxiety provoking for me, and there's a lot less risk involved.

  


**I've found some anxiety management techniques that really help for stress:**

At first, my social anxiety was still intense, but after consistently using self-soothing techniques, it's become much easier to manage.

**My main strategies:**

**1. Managing physical tension:** I've noticed that anxiety creates physical sensations and tension in the body. The anxious feelings don't disappear completely, but if I let tension build up without addressing it, my anxiety gets much worse.

Deep, slow diaphragmatic breathing helps a lot. Sometimes tension accumulates anyway, which is natural. I've learned to let my body naturally tense up on the inhale, then consciously release that tension on the exhale.

**2. ""Looking for the danger"":** My therapist explained that anxiety is our biological response to feeling in danger or out of control. When I notice anxiety building, I stop and locate where I'm feeling it in my body. Then I ask myself (sometimes out loud), ""Where is the danger?""

Usually I'll realize there's no actual danger and calm down, or I'll rationalize that whatever I'm worried about isn't as threatening as it seemed.

These techniques have made social interactions much more manageable for me."

121,2,"Really need something for my social anxiety as I start school soon. 

Is there something I haven’t considered? "
122,2,Just like in title. Have you tried? What the outcomes were?
123,2,So I made 1 other post here and everyone basically said I would have anxiety for the rest of my life but for the past couple years I've been improving my social skills and I'd say I'm like a 7/10 from a 2/10 on my social skills. Very happy 
124,2,"I'll begin with it is so much easier said than done and I say that with experience. I still have those moments where I'm like ""what if everyone is looking at me and judging me?!"" or whatever i go through, but overall my mindset has begun to change. 

I've told myself that those who are going to judge me for my weirdness, awkwardness, prone-ness to confusion, and anything else that comes along with me just being myself aren't people for me and more than likely they'll just judge me for a moment and go about their day. Or they'll just judge me no matter what because thats the type of person they are. Or they won't judge me at all.

One of the reasons I've gone through this change is having been around people who don't like me for years and trying to get them to like me by staying quiet wasn't going to change that and neither was being myself and that's because they're not my people, but I won't be able to find my people if I'm not myself everywhere I go even if it makes me feel vulnerable.

It isn't like my social anxiety is 100% better, but since I decided to dedicate this year to not allowing fear to hold me back I've done so much I never thought I would have including basically asking someone out, giving strangers compliments, giving a eulogy, ordering food at a restaurant I would have turned away from, telling people how I feel about them, having longer conversations with strangers who talk to me that aren't just creeps(and I assume people are creeps less now), going on hikes alone, and MAKING PHONE CALLS(that's still the hardest). Oh I also started being more honest and open with myself and my therapist!

Anyways, find what works for you, friends. My therapist says that the unfortunate part about social anxiety is one of the only things that really works is exposure to social situations even if you start with the small stuff. Don't do it because someone says you have to to make progress. Do things you want to do. Say you're in public and you really like a strangers hair or outfit and you really want to tell them, but social anxiety is holding you back just tell them because they're going to be happy you complimented them, and the interaction will never be as complicated as you think it's going to be, but it's really in those small interactions that begin to tell your nervous system that interaction with other people is okay. 

Social anxiety is real and it's complicated, but a lot more of us have it than we think. Kindness goes a long way! It took someone acknowledging me each time they saw me to help change my perspective. Love to you all❤️"
125,2,"Usually on the weekends, if I do not have plans (which is often), I will not leave my house at all unless absolutely necessary. The idea of it just seems too overwhelming and I would rather stay comfortable in my home. I know this is not healthy and will only make my anxiety worse. I also enjoy being outdoors but being outside alone can be hard. I want to be able to go for walks, read outside, and do things like that without overthinking it. Does anyone else deal with this? Is there anything that helps you? "
126,2,"I’ve always been a somewhat introverted person. I’m fine in smaller group settings but when it comes to larger groups of people or presentations in from of the class I get so much anxiety. 
I’m first year out of uni but during uni when there were group presentations I would find these so anxiety provoking even though I knew all the people in my class well, and wasn’t scared of them. My body just has this reaction that I can’t stop?? We also had a lot of on the spot presentations last year in a group where we had to quickly create something to present. I was often more quiet during these because I find this kind of thing really hard. 
This led to some of my uni friends making jokes about how quiet I am and how I never speak. This happened quite a lot, and it really got to me. Especially considering they didn’t seem to notice that it was upsetting for me, but I also didn’t say anything so guess that’s on me for that. 
I’m finished uni now, and have been invited back to do a talk in with a few others to the current uni students in my degree (was very suprised I was picked since I didn’t really speak much in front of the class lol). This definitely makes me a bit anxious but Im still happy to do it as I feel confident in what I know about my career etc. however my other uni friend that has been asked to do this was telling our friends about this the other day, and was making jokes about how I never talk so it’s going to be her doing all the talking. This upset me and brought back all these feelings from the past at uni. 
I just feel like such a boring person with no personality. And I know that isn’t true but it’s so hard not to feel this way when I’m being made to feel worse for being more of an introvert. Is it really that bad?? 
"
127,2,"im so anxious and depressed as hell right now. everyone in my class already knows each other and im supposed to introduce myself in front of them. i cant help but feel alienated. sadly, i can't ever shake the feeling that either all of them are going to laugh at me (this happened hack at my old school -10th grade) or either think that im very awkward and unattractive. what's worse is, im literally the most unattractive and awkward person in our class 💔💔 so obc its true. so how the hell am i supposed to survive my fucking first day. ive been bullied ever since i was in middle school, im a senior now and ik i should atleast toughen up since im sixteen but i can't stop bawling nor shaking right now like fourteen year old me. i feel like a tall child smh. if only my brain and appearance were different, i wouldn't feel like this at all."
128,2,"I have had a week off work now when I have mostly kept to myself and not had to interact with anyone and done some of the few things I do when I have time to spare (riding my bike, watching movies). Knowing that I ""have to"" go back to work, and be around others again, in the next few days, feels hellish. I am beginning to think that work is making me sick, the almost constant stress of being around others and then that messes up my sleep and then that messes up my health. My social anxiety stops being an issue when.. I no longer need to socialise. I am fine just being alone and not speaking to anyone all week long. I know when a wake up and go to work on Monday another part of me will die inside. It is as simple as quitting. But if only it was as simple as quitting. Right now all I can do is wish that the clock would slow down."
129,2,"This week I have been out with a girl, that i did not know very much. I thought it would be nice getting to know new person and felt that my social anxiety was better after I finished highschool like a month ago. The date was fine, but i cannot shake the felling that i wasnt enough. That I was not funny, interesting and supportive enough.  Now I am just recollecting everything I have said and feel really embaressed. If I take it rationally there is no reasson to feel that way. She was easy to talk to and at the end of the date i felt like she was glad that we went out. I even texted her afterwards i´ve had a good time and she replied the same. So naturally i felt bad that i even texted her. Now I don´t even know if I am going to see her again even though I really want to.

Sorry if this post is not very interesting, but it feels good to write it down. I know that my situation is nothing compare to a lot of people that suffers from social anxiety and I still have a good group of friends, but when it comes to  people, I need to know them for a few years so I dont feel embarrassed around them."
130,2,"Hi everyone,

First of all, sorry if my English isn't perfect, I'm not a native speaker.

I (F33) have been struggling with social anxiety since I was a teenager. Since my early 20s, I've also developed a fear of blushing in social situations, which has become a real phobia. Because of this anxiety, I have a small social circle, but I'm perfectly fine with that. Despite everything, I live a normal life. I have a partner who understands my fears, and I feel very comfortable around him.

For a long time, especially during my studies, I did everything I could to avoid anxiety-provoking situations. I managed to avoid internships, chose low-stress summer jobs, and initially worked as a freelancer in a field that allowed me to stay away from office environments. The job itself didn’t fulfill me though, so I decided to switch careers and learn something new, something I could also do freelance or at least remotely.

I completed a distance-learning program and really enjoyed it. But I didn’t feel ready to go freelance right away, so I decided, despite my anxiety, to try working in a company. I recently got hired (which I’m very grateful for because the job market is tough right now), and I just started last week. And now my social anxiety is hitting me full force.

Once my onboarding period is over, I'll be allowed to work remotely three days a week, which will definitely help me breathe. But in the meantime, I have to endure a work environment that truly terrifies me: the corporate world.

There are about 40 people in the company (not all at once thanks to remote work), but for me that’s a lot. Being the “new person” makes everything harder, I feel so exposed. I thought I had built up some confidence over the years, but now I feel like a child again, surrounded by strangers. My blushing fear is back stronger than ever. I've already blushed in front of many coworkers. Even though I’m genuinely interested in the project I’m working on, I feel like I’m constantly on high alert.

I’d love to hear from others who suffer from social anxiety in the workplace.
How do you cope with it?

I know it’s still early and that things usually get better over time. But deep down I also know my anxiety will probably never disappear completely.

Thanks for reading."
131,2,"I've been experiencing something strange lately—over the past year or two, people often stare at me. Sometimes they scratch their nose while looking, smirk, make a face that seems like disgust, or quickly lower their head as they pass by. It doesn’t seem to be because I’m particularly attractive or unattractive—I’d say I’m maybe slightly above average in terms of looks. I usually dress pretty casually: jeans and a basic t-shirt.

I’ve been trying to figure out why this is happening. One theory I have is that it might be due to my appearance: I’m around 6 feet tall, about 75 kg (165 lbs), so on the leaner side, but still within a normal range. I also have a longer-than-average neck with sharp jawline and a mature-looking face. I’m 30 now, so maybe aging has something to do with it?

Still, I see guys my age who are even skinnier or have similar features, and I doubt they get the same kind of attention—or do they? Has anyone else noticed something like this?

Why I got shut down in a big events or the hyped one, where everyone just enjoying the moment and going crazy and hyped, I got completly overwhelmed!

I have my last day in uni. This week, and I don't want to stuck in the dead black hole again, I want also to hype and live my last moments with my collegues & to compensate my lonley years of uni. Through out this day

133,2,"I **(21yo F)** have been diagnosed with social anxiety for a while now, but I still have a hard time even leaving my home. I was wondering if anyone here has any tips or life hacks for easing my anxiety when socializing with others? My goal for the next few months is to be able to converse with a stranger in real life without feeling like my life is in danger. **(Ps. This is my first time on Reddit.)**"
134,2,"Everyone's told me to get a job that interacts with people to help with the anxiety and eventually I'll get used to it, but I've been working for over 5 years in customer service positions and my anxiety is 100x worse than it was before. I throw up and cry before every single shift but I can't find a job where I don't have to interact with customers or clients. Before working I could at least go shopping alone but now I can't leave the house because it stresses me out so much. I'm always in fight or flight mode and I don't know how to interact with people normally without sounding like an employee talking to a customer. I've gone to therapy and taken meds but my anxiety has gotten so bad I can't even talk to a therapist anymore so I can't get refills on my prescription. I feel so helpless, everyone just says I need to suck it up and get used to it but I can't, I just can't. I'm also on the spectrum if that gives some context. The only thing that helps is getting high or drunk but I can't do that at work or even in public so it's not that much of help. I know I need a job to survive but how long do I have to keep surviving like this? I'm 22 I cannot imagine doing this for another 10 years, I'm mentally and physically exhausted, I just want to crawl in a hole and hide there forever and never interact with anyone again. Thank you for reading and I'm sorry for any typos, I needed to vent before clocking in. "
135,2,"Just my luck. I rarely get hiccups but for some reason my body said fuck me you only have a tiny bit of alcohol in your system but let’s give you the most embarrassing gigantic hiccups of all time in front of your coworker who you also think is cute hahaha

Went out to dinner with coworkers and a couple of the others got wasted so me and this other coworker split off to be by ourselves because we were the only sober ones (Well, she was sober. I needed a few drinks in me to calm the nerves but I was still full in control of my mental faculties). We were just walking and talking and I started to feel more confident to the point where I was almost monopolizing the conversation when I suddenly give the most fucking exaggerated HIC sound and she starts laughing meanwhile I’m praying it’s just one like it usually is but nah I do it again. And again. And again. And then I’m like oh fuck yeah I have hiccups in front of my coworker I don’t know too well and also sorta have a thing for and people are turning around as we’re walking and either smiling or laughing.

The worst part is when the hiccups stop being funny and start being annoying. After maybe 20 minutes, she stopped laughing and I was stressed over her being irritated with me and possibly wishing she could tell me to shut the fuck up. Which is then confirmed when she starts offering methods to get rid of them like holding my breath which my self hating brain takes as she finds you insufferable instead of she’s trying to help. At one point she asks if I’m okay and if I need to sit down. Shit was mortifying.

I’m pissed because if I was just going to get hiccups anyway I may as well have gotten blackout drunk because then I would have been so far gone I wouldn’t have cared, DAMN."
136,2,"When I get in a bad place, I hide.  I have always repeated the same phrase.

137,2,"17M here, not really sure how to start this. Everywhere I go people treat me like I'm an idiot, or like I don't understand the situation and that I need to be treated like a baby. I notice it especially in older individuals and it's very disheartening because I know they mean well. I struggle with words sometimes, and definitely lacking a bit in the social skills department, but I feel like it should be obvious that I'm perfectly mentally capable, but people don't seem to understand that. Sometimes I feel like I'm just overthinking it but at the same time I see everyone around me who is my age being treated completely differently. It's incredibly frustrating and embarrassing, and I notice it everywhere I go."
138,2,"Hi everyone, 
Sorry in advance for a lengthy post, I hope some can take the time to read. 
I joined this group as I believe my son has social anxiety and anxiety in general. Well, I know he does. He has always been shy and a worrier, but never seemed to have issues making friends or socially overall until this year, the dreaded 7th grade. The first half was ok but the second half he started feeling 'sick' a lot and missing school and his grades dropped (a bit, nothing crazy but noticeable). He came to me one night a couple of months ago in tears, and told me how he'd been feeling and had been feeling for a while. He feels lonely and sad, and like he doesn't know what to say or how to be funny and freezes up, even with friends. Physically shaking when having to speak in front of the class. I have noticed that he doesn't get texted a lot or isn't part of many group chats, and when he is he never really responds to anything and eventually fades out. Btw as a mom I hate that kids have to deal with texts and group chat stuff, things I didn't have to but I know are part of life and social life now. The more he told me and the more I looked into I do think he has social anxiety (he also worries a lot about other things like his health, bad storms, someone breaking into the house). We have started therapy and cbt. He is also one of the youngest boys in his grade and on the smaller side - I think he will eventually catch up but there are boys more than a year older than him because where we live everyone seems to hold their boys back a grade, and we just followed the regular guidelines and started him on time. So, there is so much more background here but I know this post is long - my husband and I are considering having him reclass to 7th grade again. He had a good friend who did this last year and who would be in his grade, and 2 other boys from his grade are doing it (not exactly sure of their reasons). It is a pretty normal thing to happen here, especially for boys. We will keep him in therapy and everything we can to help but we also thought him having another year to work through some of the anxiety, have therapy, and being on the older side instead of younger may help his overall confidence as well. In a lot of ways he is just not as socially or emotionally mature as his classmates and it has become clearer in middle school to me. So I guess my question would be to those who started feeling this in middle school, do you feel an extra year may have helped emotionally/socially/maturity wise? I so want to help him any way I can and to do the right thing. I myself have always been shy and introverted and I don't think there is anything 'wrong' about it, it is just the way some people are. I want to give him the tools to help as I hate to see him sad and feeling 'worried and nervous about everything all of the time'. So I guess my basic question is thoughts on reclassing. I don't in any way expect it to be a miracle 'fix' or anything, just that it may give him room to breathe and a some more confidence, not only for middle school but looking ahead to high school and college as well. Thanks so much for any thoughts, I joined this group in order to help him but as I have anxiety myself (genetic, I know) it has helped me too. Sorry for the long post! "
139,2,"Whenever I do the simplest of chores or even daily tasks such as getting ready, showering, preparing a meal, etc. it always feels as if I’m being watched and judged at my every single move, and honestly I could say my social anxiety has gotten a bit better but it is still there whenever it comes to crowds. My anxiety used to be really bad back in 2020, when covid was a big thing. I couldn’t even take out the trash and would panic in front of the door because I was terrified of people looking at me and judging my every move. Sometimes I feel as if even when I’m alone people are still there, but I’m pretty sure I’m just paranoid and that isn’t social anxiety whatsoever. "
140,2,"I need help seriously, I can't have a normal conversation with someone, I can't make i contact with someone, and this ""issue"" is really affecting my life, and it doesn'matter how hard I tried, how much effort I put, I just can't, I can't be different, I can't talk, I can't make eye contact, at this point I will day alone, without anything or anyone, and I rather kill my self before that happens, because this is not life.
I tried to go with a psychologist and I took some sections but as you can guess, didn't help, I think I sold out all my options here, I can't do anything to change a little about, I don't even know what to do anymore, I'm having really dark thoughts.
I have had problems before because I cant even argue with people I just sit there and take all the rage because I'm afraid to answer, even though I tried to change that there is something that force me to not do anything, what the fuck is wrong with me?.
I even have lose opportunities whit girls just because I'm to afraid to talk to them, here is funny one: back then when I was in English classes, there was a girl interested on me, know this because she told that, anyways, I told my self multiple times, every fuking day ""tomorrow I'm gonna talk with her, I'm gonna ask for her number, I'm gonna ask her out"" none of that happens, because I couldn't even look at her eyes, I sat right next to her.

141,2,"I’ve made a good group of online Discord friends based off this game. I love discussing the story and theories with them, but I keep getting shit wrong (misinterpreting quotes, misremembering story). It’s so embarrassing that I’ve decided to reread the story, but I just keep misinterpreting quotes and getting things wrong. 

I get so painfully embarrassed everytime I’m corrected. I get the urge to isolate myself and stop talking in the gc out of shame but luckily I’ve always come back to them and haven’t completely gone silent yet. 

How do you deal with embarrassing moments? I’m afraid of self sabotaging because this gc is the only place I socialize. "
142,2,"I’ve sort of lost interest in wanting friends and getting to know other people. I didn’t always feel this way but I think many years of being friendless, ostracized, and living in social isolation has made me this way. I hate being quiet. I hate being shy. I hate being socially awkward. I’d rather present myself as a confident and extroverted person, but I’m not sure if that’s possible anymore. Confident, after a lot of effort I do think it’s possible. Extroverted, I don’t think so. I don’t like the stigma that comes with being an introvert and I didn’t always consider myself to be introverted either. I only started to act introverted because of insecurities. Before that, I would make an effort to speak to whoever was next to me and try to make everyone laugh. 

I severely lack social skills because of the quality of life that social anxiety and depression gave me for most of my life. I think if all of my social anxiety and depression were to instantly disappear I would still be in trouble. It’s not just that I don’t feel comfortable speaking to people, I legitimately don’t know how. I could talk about myself but there isn’t much to say. I either haven’t done anything worthy of mention because I’m too afraid to try (social anxiety) or I just don’t care to do anything (depression). I could maybe ask questions instead and while I do know a few basic questions that I could ask, I might not be able to follow up their response with an answer or another question. I think what makes this difficult is the fact that I just don’t really care about other people’s personal lives anymore. If I had a genuine interest in getting to know people better, the follow up questions would come to me a lot more easily. 

I’m unemployed at the moment and a big reason for it is because I don’t know how to talk to people. I’d like to be able to have regular conversations with my future coworkers just so that I won’t stand out as a quiet and shy person. I’m not entirely against making friends but I also just don’t care to either. I’m kind of used to not speaking and not being spoken to, this has been the case for most of my life. Although it still hurts a little to know that I don’t have any friends, I’m becoming more comfortable with that. I really just don’t want to be thought of as being less than because I’m not talkative enough or because I’m socially maladjusted. I know I probably shouldn’t care but I can’t help it. I have a long history of not being able to fit in anywhere and being treated like shit because I don’t fit in. "
143,2,"First of all, I know I'm insecure about my appearance. I'm currently traveling and had to ask my friend to book an airbnb instead of me because the host requested a selfie and I was unable to take mine. I always try extra hard with working out, fashion and so on, but nothing really helped.

Today I went to the library and hopped on to the escalator. I had nothing going on in my brain and was just zoning out. Then the two girls in the front looked back like they found something funny and weird. In the hallway to the next floor escalator, they took turns to turn back and walk backward for a moment, looking face to face with me as if checking what kind of freaky creature is that. I was uncomfortable meeting their eyes and tried to look away and look at my phone.

I initially had a floor to go to, but it looked bad since I was always at the back of them, which they were constantly giggling and I felt so ashamed and humiliated, also feeling I'd seen creepy. If my floor was the same as theirs they must've felt extra creepy abt me as I was following them. So I just got off on any floor praying it was not their floor either, and headed right to the bathroom to check if I looked funny. I really did look like a clown. I checked on the bathrooms of several floors to double check with different lightings.

Will it be because I just look weird, or I have long hair for a guy, my fashion was wacky, I had a large bag on me, or even maybe some kind of racism, since I'm yellow(Korean) and they were white, and I'm 5'9 menlet and they were almost tall or maybe even taller than me?"

146,2,"Hi everyone. I wanted to post this because, lately, I feel like I've been isolating myself quite a bit from everyone around me. On the one hand, I almost enjoy just having myself to worry about, but I feel also that I should be doing more. I'm in my mid-20s in grad school for reference. Also, I don't have a good relationship with my parents at all so I essentially don't interact with them anymore. I still have friends, but I just feel distant from everyone right now. Also, I was in a 2.5 year relationship last year, but I haven't been seeing anyone since the breakup and that's another way in which I have felt isolated. I don't know if I need therapy or what to do. I just feel like I allowed myself to check out. Also, at times, I've felt increasingly depressed and/or anxious, but this doesn't necessarily last.

But it's crucial to figure out the pillars of self-esteem, explore and analyze yourself no matter how painful the process. Note: this is an incredibly difficult process. But it's worth putting time into because the consequences after a certain age are enormous."

151,2,"Not sure what this is, I’m not always like this - often in periods when I become depressed and my confidence hits an all time low, but what I notice is that when I talk with people I don’t know (store clerks, waiter, etc…), and emphasize speaking as clear, audible as possible - I’m always hit with a pause, distanced look on their face and clarification to what I asked. 

I speak fluent English, no accent, and again - to me what I am saying makes sense. 

I tend to think it has to do with energy, and possibly people don’t like it, or are thrown off by it, but this really in a positive feedback like cycle seems to effect my confidence even more, and result in approach anxiety. 

To make it worse, when they ask for clarification - I’ve gotten to the point where I’m frustrated with not just myself, but the people across from me, so I generally aggressively rephrase what I said, which inevitably makes them even more spiteful/distained towards me. 

What is this, what can I do?

152,2,"I still have physical symptoms like a nasal drip when I talk to people for prolonged times. I’m an extrovert though so I like talking (energizes me) to people although SA holds me back sometimes. 

I’ve always loved going to group fitness classes specifically cardio dance/zumba. I could never get into the front row. My friend always tried to get me up there and hell to the naw. I don’t like people seeing me up there, probably judging me hard. I just don’t like that focused attention people get in the first row. I’ve been cardio dancing for 20+ years and I don’t think I’ve ever stood in the front row.

But three years ago, I forced myself to sign up to became a fitness instructor because my daughter was going to the same uni as a freshman and I wanted to see her more. First year was hell that I had to go on antidepressants because it wasn’t getting any better. And the worst was the uni made us stand up on stage facing the participants. If I knew it was going to be like that (thought my back would be to them) I would never have signed up for the GPX instructor training. But I stuck it out. And when I was given my own class at the uni, I promptly taught with my back to them. 

So it’s been almost 3 years (my instructing anniversary is in August), and I’ve probably taught at least 200+ cardio dance classes, standing front and center (yes I even taught hip hop fitness with ass shaking and the whole sha-bang). 

These past 2 days, I went with my friends as a participant to a Zumba and a cardio hip hop class…. Wouldn’t you know, I stood right up in the front row. Even initially came in with space in the 3rd row (it was a crowded class) and immediately slid right into the front row. It’s totally comfortable for me now. 

It’s crazy but it’s true. Some of these SA symptoms is fueled by fear. Once you conquer that fear, it no longer has a hold onto you. I wholly believe in exposure therapy because clearly I see it’s worked for me. 

I still have that friend, the one that tried to get me up there with her in the front row. She was with me at the cardio HH class. Funny, now I tried to get her to come up there with me in the front row, but she didn’t want to because she wasn’t comfortable in a new class. I’m so comfortable now, I didn’t even care if I didn’t know any of the routines. I usually can get most of the steps. No longer have that fear of looking stupid up there.

161,2,"So, I've been taking classes with the same group of people for a year and a half but this particular semester something I wasn't expected happened: the leader of the whole group, the most popular girl started to talk to me. Let's call her ""Anne"". And it felt wonderful. She's always around other people of ""her"" group, especially there's a guy I also feel awesome with. The three of us share the same humour and I see a lot of common in how we are... though we do have quite different likings and interests.

The point is since April I've been getting closer to her. She's also with two other girls with whom she's way closer than others and shares much more stuff. With those two girls I haven't interaected much but with ""Anne"" and the other guy I did. Mostly studying stuff mixed with a tiny comment about more personal things but so far they are still a closed group with me outside. They talk among them with a certain tone I can hear it changes when talking to me.

It'd be magical to *feel* part of them, and I did feel that way sometimes, but just one or two days, the next one I'm ""outside"" again. And though I did tell ""Anne"" that I'm down for grabbing lunch together after classes or some quiet plans like that (I wrote her via Wpp some weeks ago) nothing happened. In classes, they sit basically in a row and talk together, not including me, and at the same time IDK if I should ""jump"" into their conversations. 

I often find myself on weekends and holidays about what shall I do on Tuesday (the first day we have classes) and how should I behave or what I could do. Or also, what I **should have said** here and there, just for Tuesdays to do nothing, or, to be precise, simply follow what they do. If Anne happens to talk to me I join her and calmly talk with her too. I also have, like, ""interrupted"" their talks to join them and it did feel magical, but that's it, they leave the classroom together and, again, we never met outside of classes (though I inist, they like to do things like going to clubs or stuff like that I'm not interested in)

Either way, it's a lot of text (sorry XD) and I could have written ten pages more I think with more details XD

Any tip will be welcomed. Thanks! :)"
162,2,"When people think ""social anxiety"" they just think a super nervous and visably scared person but we come in multiple packages i guess lol

I'm not at all a cold person once i actually get comfortable with people but oh my god is it a struggle beforehand. Multiple of my friends have said they thought i did not like them at all before we grew closer. AND ITS SO MUCH WORSE WHEN I ACC LIKE THE PERSON!! I wish i had ""I'm not mean, just super anxious"" written on my forehead.

As a mechanism to avoid strangers approaching me i also developed the bitchiest resting bitch face known to man, which is both a blessing and a curse"
163,2,"I'm 23 F, I have mild autism and social anxiety but I've been going to the gym for a long time for weight loss and mental health. I'm 5 foot 5, medium height and I have been setting the leg curl pad to the highest number which is a 1 where it sits above the ankle on my calf, I have also set the pad on 2 and it sits on my ankles, what number would you recommend for me? I have been showed how to use this machine by the staff but I'm still struggling to process it and I feel silly to ask them again as an anxious person because it was daunting for me to ask them the first time. I'm just wondering if anyone else that goes to the gym have any idea?  I know this is an anxiety sub and not gym related but as someone anxious I thought I would ask here "

Please be kind and give some advice "
165,2,"Throwaway account cause this is personal.

As a kid I loved to dance at the parties my mom hosted. I loved to talk to others and I would try and see if i can host things as well. Like party activites such as board games, scavenger hunt, etc. Although the majority of people being middle aged I still did this.

My mom would call it annoying and frequently shut me down if I did any of these things. And at the age of five I realized how embarrassment felt like. And subsequentially I felt guilty for even trying such. I didn’t feel like I could express myself as much as I wanted. I started to really dislike parties and seeing people and I felt like every party since then I had annoyed those people, and they remember my mom scolding me in front of them. And that was embarrassing. 

I wish I didn’t feel that way at a young age to feel like an annoyance especially when I was trying to have fun in my own funky way. I feel like it’s greatly affected me because it did put in my mind the feeling of being an annoyance to others, being embarrassed at everything. Every now, over a decade later, do I feel like I’m doing something wrong in public. I feel guilty that I’m being an annoyance."
166,2,"My boss is really difficult to read and approach. She is the only one who really sets off my anxiety. One day she will walk past you and ignore you and the next she doesn't stop talking; often asking really odd questions as if she's trying to put you into a corner. She found out I am very good friends with one of the sales reps for example, and she said ""do you not think he's really boring!?""

Yesterday, she stormed into the room I was in, spoke in a really low voice with my colleague and didn't even look at anyone. During the conversation she snapped at her and left. Later that afternoon she was chatty and laughing along with people. My husband was collecting me from work yesterday and he got stuck in traffic, and at 10 minutes past my finish time she saw me and loudly said ""what the f**k are you still doing here?"" And I froze because I didn't know if she was joking or how I should respond, even though it would have been easy enough to explain that my husband was running late. 

I've had a situation before where she has goaded me about something and I reacted. I didn't raise my voice or swear or anything like that but she said I was ""aggressive"" and proceeded to give me the silent treatment. She later said she knew me snapping was out of character and she was worried about me yet never had a conversation about it, just ignored me for weeks?

She often bullies people into working well beyond their contracted hours and openly admits it. She belittles people behind their back whilst saying nothing to their face. She insulted a colleague in front of a customer and then got really mad when she was called out on it and gave a non-apology to the person she was rude to.

I know the problem is with her and not me but whenever I see her or have a social interaction with her I can't stop thinking about it and replying the scenario for the rest of the day. The ideal outcome would be for me to leave but until I find another job that pays the same it's not going to happen anytime soon. Has anyone else experienced similar with people who are so unpredictable? There is no HR to approach and my boss is the company director so I don't even know where to start."
167,2,"exactly what the title says. i don't know what to do and i'm so scared. i'm catastrophizing, but i'm still so scared. anything will help.

my grandma just died and i can't stop thinking about how my parents will die, about how my brother will die and how my pets will die. i won't have anyone to lean on, as they're my only support. i'm crying while typing this and, last night, i had a breakdown so bad i could only regulate by hitting my legs hard enough for some bruising to appear this morning.

i really, really don't know what to do. i'm so scared of people that i can't make an honest connection to save my life. i think i want to save myself the heartbreak and just kill myself before anyone else can die, but i'm too much of a coward to just fucking buck up and do it.

i'm trans in a red state (can't move out of my parent's house) so not many people will think of it as too much of a loss, but i'm still so scared. i don't have anyone. i'm crying over a keyboard, typing some stupid post nobody will read, and i'm so, so scared that this will be my evening routine every night for years until everyone that's important in my life is gone so i finally have an excuse to commit suicide.

this post is a mess. i hate this disease. it took everything from me before i even knew what everything was, and i don't want to be this scared animal anymore. what do i do? moreover, where do i even start?"
168,2,"Something happened yesterday that triggered a bad self-hate spiral. When I look at the incident with the rational side of my brain, I know it wasn’t a bad thing, but sometimes that’s not enough to stop the spiral. I haven’t had a bad one in a while and so I panicked a bit and that made it worse.

I can't even begin to tell you how deeply embedded the sentiment of wishing I hadn't been born is. "
171,2,"Hello, how are you all?

Well this starts from a very young age, I have two parents who were too strong in character, my father raised in the countryside was a very rough person, there was physical and emotional abuse, my parents had a lot of lack of money as children and I had a great lack of affection.

With my father who made fun of me, he was my own bully at home, at school I was a very self-conscious and fearful boy and that lack of protection caused me to not know how to protect myself.

My whole school years were hell for me, plus I suffered some bullying for being gay, which I decided to ignore until I was 21 or 22 years old. Time when I was in college, which was a great relief as the bullying from the kids ended, it was at that time when I exploded and was able to accept that I was gay, which took me time to process.

The process was crying in bed, dropping out of college and my demanding parents complaining about why I had done it.

This is where I talk about something that was a very good escape in my life to be able to relate to others and live in my own world while all this was going on since I was a teenager, video games, like ragnarok online, aion, there I could relate to others even though sometimes I didn't like to talk on the microphone.

And as you can understand, having the example of a father with anger problems, I also grew up bitter, argumentative, critical and hating everything. I also have a toxic past.

As a consequence of the above, I also had a very strong self-criticism of myself, the damage that others had caused in me was inside my head. Playing to escape from the world and not taking care of my problems, because of the fear and not sleeping at night overthinking everything.

 In between all that I spent playing aion I met a super positive friend, who got me that vibe, made me want to be like him and realize that the world is not an inhospitable place as I learned from my family (I've only had online friends because it's easy for me for all the years of playing games).

There came a point in my life when I made the decision to face my problems and since I like to read, I started to find out about self-esteem, which was the first thing I needed to build in me.

I read about it, the effects it has, I even found a video about how negative feelings are a poison for our soul, among all that I also decided to exercise, since that helped, everything always cost me a lot at the beginning, but as time went by it became much easier, it took me about a year to change my mentality from negative to positive.

Then it was the turn of overthinking, I looked for information about how that was horrible for our mind because we tired ourselves, and I found a way to write on a piece of paper when there was something in my head that was going around too much, it was like going from the mind to the page all that, it worked for me and helped me to stop doing it.

Going back a little bit to my 22nd year when being gay exploded, I fell into a hole of depression, I looked for information about what causes depression and it had to do with the past, then I realized that my body was tired of being the bitter character I was and it was screaming for me to go back to being that loving child, also that waiting for another person to get you out of that hole is a fantasy so I was myself who took that damaged child by the hand to heal him and get him out of it.
I also looked for many videos of people coming out of the closet since I was 22 and didn't even know that being homosexual was normal.

Then going back to the healing path, I asked for help and went to a psychologist, I never got to talk about social anxiety with her, we dealt with the physical abuse, she mentioned some post-traumatic stress disorder. We did something was emdr and it was funny in an exercise we did I saw myself as a black traffic signal figure, when in reality life has colors.

Also one of the first things she recommended was some conscious breathing exercises and my god, I realized how anxiety made me breathe horribly bad. And before I stopped going to her she gave me a page to meditate, I did it for a long time and that helped me a lot too, especially to relativize things, breathe better and decrease my anxiety.

This is not an overcoming story, I have never worked, I have no real friends, I don't leave the house, and I couldn't finish college. All my achievements are within me. I achieved peace of mind, I stopped being that ultra-shy kid, I let go of overthinking and self-destructive criticism.

I'll continue another day because the translator won't let me anymore haha.

I will leave below everything that has helped me on this path.

172,2,"I'm currently working my first job out of college and on top of typical bad social anxiety I have a lot of anxiety about the job. I went to an after work party today and I knew I was being awkward as hell but I thought at least I was trying. I was talking with someone I had worked with a couple times, they tend to ask a lot of questions and are very talkative so I feel like they know me reasonably well. They straight up told me at the party within earshot of others that I need to work on my social skills. I ended up leaving early because as far as feasible worst case scenarios that I worry about happening in a social setting this is easily in the top 3. 

I don't know what to do I thought I was about to throw up, I feel like I don't know if I can keep working here it feels like my thoughts wondering if everyone at my job hates me and thinks I'm awkward were all just answered."
173,2,"I have been having problems going to social events since forever. Having small talk, meeting new people terrorises me. 

How to get rid of this feeling? My boyfriend is an extrovert, he can express himself, hold conversations with new people, and I’m the complete opposite. I freeze. And i go into a bubble then. It shows on my face too.

Im pretty comfortable when I’m with people I know but how to enjoy such gatherings?? I have to attend an engagement where unknown people will be present. 

I love my boyfriend but i think other people like him more because he’s funny and I am an introvert 😒😒"
174,2,"I care a whole lot about what people think. So much so that it has ruined my life. My education suffered because of it as a teenager, I’ve spent more years being unemployed than employed post high school graduation (graduated in 2016), and have lived a life of social isolation for over a decade. I just want to be normal. I don’t want to stand out for ANY reason, good or bad. It may sound a bit egotistical of me to think that I do, but I’ve been made fun of by plenty of people growing up over my appearance. I’ve been told that I look crazy and like I wanted to kill someone. Well I was pretty depressed growing up as a result of the quality of life social anxiety has brought me, so I do see their point. I still am depressed and socially anxious, more than ever. I can’t leave my house for any reason without feeling like all eyes are on me. I would feel a whole lot better over all if I didn’t look the way that I do. I’d be able to leave my home and not worry about standing out for all of the wrong reasons. Just one weird look from someone could ruin my day. There’s been instances where I’d go weeks of feeling confident, only to have that confidence that took me several weeks to build to come crumbling down over a comment or look someone gave me. Then I’m back to feeling overly self conscious and afraid to leave my home again. I hate being thought of as being weird. To be fair, I kind of am now. Maybe I’ve always been a bit strange, but it didn’t keep me from having friends. I like to think that I was pretty normal as a kid. I didn’t start becoming anxious and quiet until the start of middle school. I had self esteem issues that kept me from approaching people and for whatever reason no one wanted to speak to me. I had very few friends that I would only see during cafeteria or outside the school building after school was over. I’d spend my time in class sitting quietly and to myself wondering why my classmates wouldn’t show interest in speaking to me. I thought there must be something wrong or off putting about me. I could go an entire school day without speaking a word if my teachers didn’t call for me in class or if the few friends that I had were absent. Despite having a pretty low self esteem, I still felt relatively normal all throughout most of middle school. I still had my interests from before, I was still capable of living comfortably outside of school. My life didn’t turn to complete shit until after the eight grade school year started. Without going too much into detail what happened, I started getting a lot of negative attention that I wasn’t used to in the years before and would regularly be made fun of on a daily basis over my appearance and with the way that I walked. I went from being ignored and made to feel invisible by my peers, to suddenly being spotlighted, ridiculed, and laughed at in front of the whole class. This went on for almost the entire school year and had stopped entirely the following year. I wasn’t regularly made fun of or laughed at in my freshman year. No one brought up the way that I walked that I would have people imitate and mock me for. Things went back to the way things were before the eight grade with me being ignored by everyone. The damage had already been done with everything that I experienced the previous year and I haven’t been able to fully recover from it a whole 13 years later. I did start hearing more and more comments about me looking like a serial killer as high school progressed. The frequency of the comments seemed to coincide with my mental health. The more neurotic I became, the more school shooter jokes were made towards me. I would hear this from both my classmates and some school staff members. The few friends that I had, I realized only spoke to me out of pity. I had no real friends. This is why I obsess so much over what people think of me.  I’m not convinced that I’m a regular human being anymore, that’s if I ever was one to begin with. I felt at my most happiest and most normal during elementary school. After that, my life has just been on a continuous downward slope. I don’t have friends, I haven’t had any in a very long time. Being perceived as being different has only brought me much ostracism and much ridicule. I was made fun of by other students and teachers during high school when I was clearly in an emotional crisis. I feel much worse today and I don’t expect people to act any different towards my situation. I’m currently unemployed because I’m afraid of work being not too dissimilar to high school. Even if no one makes fun of me openly, I will still be ostracized at work and that hurts just as much as being laughed at. Life would be so much less stressful if I felt like I was on equal footing as everyone else around me. I feel subhuman. With my long time social anxiety and depression getting worse, and with relatively new brain fog (I’ve had this for a couple of years now) also getting worse, I’m sure I stand out even more from regular much more healthier folks. I can’t fake being healthy and normal as much as I wish that I could. People see it and are put off by it. It hurts to be ignored and be called hurtful names. Can’t tell if I’m just overly sensitive and perhaps just need to “man up” as I’m sure many around me would suggest or if I have an acceptable reason as to why I get upset so easily and why I care so much about how I’m perceived. "
175,2,"I have known how severe my social anxiety is but this day just made me feel so depressed about myself. My dad surprisingly got me a gym membership one day to a pretty big and above average gym without my acknowledgement. When he first told me about it, I couldn’t help but go the gym because of the pressure my dad placed on me. My very first day of the gym went amazing, I was able to get a 1 day free with a trainer, who basically helped me with the workouts. Seeing how my first day went, I was feeling pretty good about it but still felt nauseous thinking about being alone but I went to the gym either ways two days after with my little brother. My brother just does the treadmill and for my case, I was going to go focus on the things my trainer thought me the other day. When I got there, it was packed and tbh I was feeling very nervous but what I have forgotten was when my trainer did the workouts with me, it was in a private area and now I was supposed to do it in public. When I started walking around trying to find the machines and benches I wanted to do, I got so nervous and started stressing because I kept walking by the same group of people and I hate it if I look lost, so just 5 minutes later, I went to my little brother in the treadmill and wanted to leave so bad cuz I kept feeling this overwhelming weight on me. I stayed beside my brother  in the treadmill until he was done and we went home. I have never felt so ashamed of my self and so disappointed. I don’t know what got over me but now all the determination I had about going to the gym is lost and I feel so bad. Also the pressure of my dad and my little brother wanting to go is also stressing me out because my anxiety is getting in the way."

177,2,"I hate how at 26 I've finally learned about my social anxiety and just how bad it is and how much of my life it's ruined from relationships to where I'd be possibly if it didn't get in the way. Maybe I was right in some scenarios cause I didn't feel ""safe"" but now I look back and wonder if I didn't make some of the choices I made I'd be more successful or actually have a long term relationship or actually have friends especially since I have a lot in common with quite a few people. Also wonder if it's sad that im still dealing with it at such an old age especially being a guy and should've already fixed it years ago. The fact I had to take speech classes and had strict parents kinda explains everything but missed so many flags. Just thought I was super shy and awkward cause I couldn't go into a grocery store alone like my siblings could or could never go to a movie theatre alone or do anything alone which is why I stay inside 24/7."

How do you guys who work in corporate function?"

I have family I’ve known for 12 years since I didn’t know my dad but I have one now I consider my dad and not step dad. But I talk to some of them even still today and I just can’t because I think they’ll judge me. Can’t maybe is incorrect but talk too little is more correct.

I guess I started speaking fast and rambling the backstory while explaining and the pharmacy assistant I’m assuming goes (in a bit of a sassy way) “okay slow down”. I felt so embarassed after because I just kept rambling on and spoke so fast about what my mom needed when I didnt even need to do that.

186,2,"This is my first time on Reddit. So please forgive me for the flaws. Don't know how I mustered to courage to get started with writing this. 
So it's 2:40 am here, and obviously I haven't slept. It's because my mind is excellent at replaying the most embarrassing moments of the day (or maybe my life). There's not a day that goes by without overthinking even the tiniest details. 

Since I started college this year, I've been having a tough time dealing with people. Spending a awful amount of time thinking about what could possibly go wrong the next day. Everyday, waking up with a kind of pain or pressure in my stomach, does not feel right. As soon as I reach college, I can't resist keep looking at the time, hoping to get back home as soon as possible. I am so tired of pretending to be busy on the phone to my colleagues. 

It seems everybody has somebody around me, and I am the only one with nobody. Ah, what a wonderful life! 
The only good thing: I can make some eye contact. "
187,2,"
Social anxiety isn’t just about being shy.
It’s much heavier than that.

It steals your voice before you can even speak.

It makes simple conversations feel like 
mountains you can’t climb.

It makes you walk away from connections you secretly crave.

It convinces you that you’re being judged when no one’s even looking.

It turns eye contact into a battlefield and silence into shame.

It makes you feel isolated in a room full of people 
especially when you see others laughing, speaking, connecting…
while you sit there, heart racing, frozen.

It makes you lose before you even get the chance to try.

"
188,2,"I brought this up before about how self-esteem is crucial for a healthy social life, but I also know it's an incredibly difficult thing to piece together for someone with social anxiety. All I know is, it made my own family use me, and that has set me in a very negative trajectory. Better to find a way to construct healthy self-esteem sooner than later. Because in my experience, the longer you go with low self-esteem, the harder it will be to increase it as life's challenges mount. 

And I hope this doesn't sound like mindless self-help. What I mean is, it's a very cynical lesson I learned a few years ago. My own family made me a punching bag because of this, and my life has been a living nightmare since. Now I'm angry, twitchy, intensely distant from everyone. I have no idea if it's possible to dig myself out of this hole, but I wished I would've found a way to be more secure in myself before life's challenges started to pile up. I hope other people can figure this out before it's too late for them."

190,2,"(M22) I have a big problem with overcoming social anxiety. While I have made many friends through my extramural studies and I feel like I'm a very positive, open and interesting person, I have a problem with making new friends in my hometown that I could spend free time with.

I'm still in the group of friends that I've been hanging out with since middle school but the problem is that it is a very closed group and there's no way to bring more faces to it. I've always felt kinda lonely with them since we don't have more deep and open conversations that bros would have.

And here I've decided to just ask people straight if they would like to hang out in free time or to draw me into their group. I don't know if it's a good idea but tomorrow I'm going to my local cafeteria and ask someone (even waitress :)) if they would like to be friends with me.

191,2,"Hello, I'm a 17-year-old guy.

I haven't been doing well, and it's been going on for a while. I've been staying inside, almost never leaving my house. I don't even go to school anymore. I don't have friends to go hang out with. I struggle with insecurities like my weight. I also feel so annoying, clingy, and desperate.

I have one online friend, and he's great, but I feel like I'm annoying him. I text him a lot. I don't mean to, but I get so lonely, and I don't have anyone else to talk to. We've been friends for a few years now, but lately we don't spend a lot of time together.

The other people in my life are my brother, my mom, and my dad. I don't do much with my parents because they work so much, and my brother and I don't really like the same things. We still talk, but we don't do much together, so other than those people, I'm alone. I don't talk to anyone else in my family because I'm scared.

I used to go to therapy. It started when I was 16. I did in-home therapy and exposure therapy. After a while, I started going to an actual office for therapy, and I did that for a while, but I eventually quit that too. Everything just felt so pointless it was so exhausting to do it, and I felt like I wasn't progressing anymore. I was still always in my room alone. 

I also struggle a lot with jealousy. I always feel horrible when I'm around people. I feel like everyone is better than me. I hate when I see people with friends or people spending time with their loved ones because I just want that for myself. I want to be able to hang out with friends or talk to my family without being scared. 

I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore everything has just started to feel pointless. I struggle to even get up in the mornings, same thing with brushing my teeth or showering. Most basic things just feel entirely pointless. I want to try I want to better myself, but I always give up. I don't know what steps to take at this point. I feel hopeless, lost, and terrified.

I'm sorry if this is messy I'm very stressed."

And worse, it's to all women. I don't know how to talk to them regardless if they are a granny or a kid.

It's not just to women I find attractive, in fact I think I find EASIER, to talk to women I'm attracted, because I know what I want, and that is to let them know i like them, and im pretty direct and not nervous when doing that.

What I find hard is to become friends with women, specially the ones I don't find attractive. Also it's NOT that deep down I'm not interested in them(friend wise). I truly found some very cool women that i subconsciously said ""Damm she's so funny"", and I wanted to become friends and just friends, but I couldn't. I don't know, it's like my mind turns blank and I don't know what topics to talk.

Weirdly too, I have a sister who i get along fine, and female cousins i get very well, even one of my best friends is a woman, but all those relationships were made when I was a kid, when i was less concerned. I asked them how can I become friends with girls, and I followed their advices, but it never worked.

Any advice?

Tldr: I don't know how to become friends to women, I just have this problem with women I'm not attracted, however the fact that I find them unattractive doesn't mean I don't find them interesting friend wise"
193,2,"As an emetophobic with social anxiety this is my most nightmarish symptom. I might be feeling all well (except for the 'base' anxiety) and then all of a sudden I feel this huge wave of nausea just flush through me, it feels for a second or two that I need to run off but so far I've always managed to just sit through it. But god damn is it scary and annoying symptom. I would very much like to prevent these from happening but they come on so randomly seemingly without any trigger it's really hard to deal with them."
194,2,"DAE use all three of these? This is what my psych has me on. 

I built tolerance to the clonazepam so I’m still anxious and panic all day so he said to use these. (Eventually will taper clonazepam but that’s on pause again). At my appointment he was my able to see how I can’t make eye contact, my whole body tenses especially shoulders neck and head. And I shake. Just a total nervous mess. We’re not going the ssri/snri route at this time as I’ve tried a lot and we’re giving me a break from them. I’m guessing my body is in constant fight or flight and I need to do exposure therapy daily or something. Idk. 

Anyways, do these help anyone else? "
195,2,"I was spending my morning journaling as I suffer with extreme anxiety - as well as horrible social anxiety, and depression. And I thought about my life as a whole and even though I have gone through a tough time due to certain events that played out throughout my life, I avoid connection for one specific reason. It came from being bullied as a child and not feeling enough. At home, and in school. If I wasn’t enough at home and I wasn’t enough in school I just wasn’t enough. And I will never be good enough. I get extremely nervous in large groups. I have maybe 3 amazing friends that are lifelong friends. And it’s hard for me to want to connect because of the fear of being rejected. My dad always made me feel inadequate with his comments. I was too stupid to hold a normal conversation with him. While my mother always saw me for who I was and loved me. Always lifted me up to because she knew my worth. I wasn’t the cutest child. I had glasses and a light mustache. I come from a Brazilian and Italian background. My mom had to wax. And so did I. But what 6 year old waxes their mustache. I also wore glasses - the big ones from the 90’s because I was a premie and very blind. Kids saw different, and picked on me badly. I felt trapped in my body and didn’t feel safe. As an adult it has significantly impacted my social life. I met my husband a few years ago who has literally hundreds of friends. He’s a social butterfly. I used to spend time with him and his friends a lot and even after a year I still didn’t feel accepted. Even if they have accepted me. Maybe they think I don’t like them. I do - I just don’t know how to communicate and I’m always in my head. I get too afraid. So I would leave and hide in the bathroom to have a panic attack while they’re playing trivia because I was too afraid I wouldn’t know the answers and they would think less of me. I’m always feeling stuck in these situations. My husband stopped going out after we got married and spending much time with them because he doesn’t want me to be alone and prefers if I go out with him. But I can’t get myself to do that. It’s a huge struggle and I just wish I didn’t feel this way. And when I’m anxious I can’t process anything. I can’t speak. I have severe symptoms with anxiety and panic attacks. I wish parents would teach their children how to treat others who may appear different. Kids don’t understand the trauma they cause when they bully another child. It doesn’t go away. It’s always there. At least for me. "
196,2,"20M, studying engineering with a scholarship, and I feel so lost and the more I become aware of my problems, the more things get so complex and tangled.

It all started with a porn addiction in high school, I didn't care about nothing but how it affected my productivity, and I tried so hard to overcome it, but I couldn't, I read many books about, watched many videos about it, but nothing worked.

Then I got into uni, and it made me so aware about how lonely I am, people around me seemed happy with their friends and relationships and I started to be resentful and envious towards them. I felt so lonely because I had no friends and I don't even know how to make any, so I spent everyday in my room bed rotting and crying about it. I knew why I couldn't quit porn, it is because I used it as coping for loneliness.

And as an attempt to solve this, I went to therapy, and starting journaling my thoughts and feelings on a daily basis, and things got a lot more complex.

I became aware to the fact that I have been severely socially anxious for almost my whole 20 years of living, all my childhood was just in my room, and all of my life basically is in my room, I never had friends, I never hung out with anybody. I was never able to defend myself against bullies, and them physically beating me up or verbally offending me made my self-confidence and self-esteem so low. 

Now I feel so weak, fragile and worthless. I feel too small for the world and others even treat me as a kid. I'm so deprived of connection and I feel that Im not made for normal life: I can't talk to people, I don't think I will get a job and even if I managed to get one, I would be paid poorly because engineers in my country are paid so poorly (~200$/month), and I don't think I have the energy to work on immigrating to somewhere else, my grades are shit and I don't do any extracurriculars due to the anxiety.

I lost the will to live and I see no point in continuing living at all, and there is nothing even to live for, and I lost motivation to do anything, I can't even prepare food for myself. Everything feels numb, and I dissociate from reality too much, I can't even study. 

In the last spring semester, I was suffering from medication side effects (Cymbalta) in the finals week, and I couldn't study and I spent my time crying instead of studying, and couldn't make the final projects and I was a burden on the professors and my peers in the project and they have shamed me for not working on the projects with them or studying, and I got bad grades in that semester, I got Bs and Cs. I used to be an A student.

I'm just born pathetic, I would cry in primary school on any inconvenience so the teachers would hold me and pity me, just for attention.

I'm just born in the wrong place and time with the wrong traits. I'm not a man by any means, I can't provide and I can't defend myself physically or verbally, I'm a minority member already which makes things even worse. 

I just can't talk to people, it is hard, it is painful, it is excruciating, I can't stand it. I stutter a lot and say much nonsense because I'm in fight-or-flight. I really hate it, and I really hate the fact that I gotta network to find a job, I can't do that, this is too much for me to do, I don't enjoy it, and I don't enjoy anything in my life, I just hate my whole life

I get reminded that at the end that I am the only one who can solve my problems yet I'm just too tired, too weak and too small to solve them. I think that the whole social thing is not for me, I think that this life is not for me, it is too much.

I'm just scared of pain, I don't want any pain, I don't want it, I'm scared of it. Even when I think of suicide, I fear the pain. I don't want to feel it. I don't care about anything but the pain. I want to relieve it. I don't want to live in pain. Everyday I would wake up and cry and hide my head under the pillow because I'm too scared of the world outside."

Its been maybe 7 months since i got one and when i did use to get haircuts my head would noticeably shake and sometimes would have panic attacks and get overstimulated by everything. I would just sit in that chair feeling embaressed bc i know the barber can see my head shaking evrytime he puts the clippers to my head. I do have pretty severe social anxiety and dpdr and the dpdr just makes my anxiety 10x worse than it already is. Im just wondering if anyone has dealt with this or something similar."
198,2,"So why do i never see posts about this miracle drug?

I used benzos which worked but ended up with years of withdrawal issues because of daily use and a lot of side effects like drowsiness, forgetfullnes etc..

Pagoclone does the exact same but without the withdrawal and without any sedation. It just works that good.

I only use it sporadically when i get severe social anxiety at work which i had today and just 30 minutes later i am completely relaxed around everyone and feel way more talkative, even initiating conversations without any high or sedation. Just as my normal should be.

Why hasnt this drug been studied more? Cause i think this med should be the future of anxiety treatment!"
199,2,"I know it comes from low self-esteem and social anxiety, so this isn’t unfixable. But every time I invite people to go out, for dinner, what have you, I can get incredibly worked up in my head whether or not that person is having a good time or would rather be somewhere else. For people I’ve known for years or have a strong relationship with, it’s not as big of a problem. But in developing friendships, it becomes such an inhibiting factor in creating plans to the point that I often don’t make plans. 

Is this universal? How do I overcome this?"

I long for close friendships but it’s so hard for me to put myself out there. When I’ve revealed how I’m introverted and shy, everyone says they’d never assume that, so I suppose I can mask well but internally I am dying. I’m on Zoloft but doesn’t seem to help this situation. I force myself to socialize with my kids friends parents and volunteer at their schools but even that exposure hasn’t helped. What tips do y’all have for me? Any anti-anxiety meds that you know of that work better than Zoloft for this? "
203,2,"I myself have numerous mental health issues, including anxiety, so I understand how difficult it can be. I still don't know what to do with my socially anxious friend.

Basically, she never wants to spend time gother just one on one. It happened around 3 times in 5 years. We even agreed that I must never invite her anywhere first. She works a lot and needs all her weekends to get rest. So, it's been months now since I saw her last time, and today I had a misfortune of inviting her over to my place next weekend along with other mutual friends.

She replies with a wall of text explaining that in fact, all these months, she's been really struggling with various substances addictions, that's why all her weekends were busy. She told me that now she wants to get better and eliminate all the triggers, one of which is spending alone time with me.

I was so lost, because we never do. She pointed out that it's probably never going to happen now, because she can't see me alone without drinking and stuff, but can't see me sober neither because of her social anxiety. Her and her husband will still invite their friends over (probably including me and my fiancé, not sure) because it's less triggering for her.

I suggested calling, but she hates it because of social anxiety. I suggested going out to a tea shop, or something, but it's too triggering to her addiction. I'm at the point where I can only see her at a party of like 10 people (once every 2-3 months) or message her to ask how she's doing, and that's it. No real conversation or anything.

I really want to stay friends with her, but either her social anxiety is too much for her to handle, or she just doesn't want to be friends anymore and trying to get rid of me. How can I understand her better?"
204,2,"I cried a lot tonight because it was the last time I had the opportunity to meet this group of people in my university club, and I realised none of them care about me at all. I tried to put myself out there by going to as many social events they put on as possible, but time and time again, I found myself being ditched by them. They are genuinely all lovely people, and the ditching was all a bit unintentional, in the sense they just gravitated to the people that made them happy and they felt comfortable with. It hurts because I really liked the vibe of some of the people in that group, and I felt like, if things were different, I would have made some really great, fun friends. When I was initially on anti-depressants, I met this one guy who I got on a lot with. But then I had to stop the meds because they messed up my sleep too much, and when I saw the same guy again, I just couldn't be the same with him. 

I'm just trapped in this prison of my mind that makes me unable to be comfortable, and as a result, I can't connect with the people I want to. It's so soul-crushing, but at the same time i get it. Of course you wouldn't want to hang out with someone who is so in their own head they can't make any decent conversation and you can't have a laugh with them. You can take pity on them but damn, forget about a proper friendship. Honestly I truly believe there is nothing harder in this world than being rejected by people who you would love to be with (in any type of relationship; romantic or platonic). 

This is a bit of a rant but I don't want to give up on making friends. I don't really have any reliable support network right now and that's a very depressing prospect for me, but the idea I will never make friends makes me feel lowkey suicidal. I'll never kill myself though, because I just need to keep trying to the bitter end to break through this fucking horrible mental illness. I'm scared for the future, and I so desperately want to be happy and comfortable in my own skin with others. I'm just unsure how to get to that point, after trying CBT and medication. I'm considering a hero dose of shrooms, if anyone's tried that lol."
205,2,"I've never had much luck making friends, spent all my childhood in isolation and haven't got anyone at university. Last year I finally worked up the courage to join a discord server for something I was a fan of as I couldn't bear the silence anymore. After a hesitant start, it worked. I made some really good friends, many of whom I met up with multiple times in person. It seemed like I was finally getting somewhere.

One of said friends had been getting on my nerves for a while. To be honest it wasn't a healthy relationship. They were just using me and I knew that, I just couldn't bear the thought of it ending. Well, I finally grew a backbone and cut them off yesterday after a particularly nasty episode. Unfortunately, everyone decided to side with them (probably because they threatened to harm themself). 

And now I have nothing. I was kicked out of not only the group chat but also the main discord I first joined which had nothing to do with what happened.

Now I'm alone again and don't know what to do. I'm not going to crawl back and beg to be forgiven, I have just about enough self respect for that. I don't deserve to be treated that way. I don't even know if it's worth having friends anymore, if this is what it's like. But fuck I can't face being alone again for the rest of my life."
206,2,"I'm kinda friends with this girl. She basically said I have nice eyes a couple days back. I came back a couple days later and told her she has really pretty eyes. She later texted me asking what I said because she couldn't hear me. I repeated myself. She went silent. I apologized for if that was weird (which I now realize was weird.) she said it's ok and ""thanks anyways"".

Yowch.

Any way I can prevent myself from looking like a creep next time?

207,2,So I wanted to know if anyone else feels this way - sometimes I feel like there are all these social cues people can just pick up and know what to say/ do and i just can't understand it?

At times it feels like everyone else is running but im just stumbling about cuz my legs r tied up? how do u know how ur meant to react and what ur meant to say?
208,2,"**Hi,** I'm an introverted person. I have friends and I get along well with them at school, but I never see them outside of that setting. My problem is that I don't know how to have a conversation when I'm alone with one of them. I struggle to keep a conversation going: I don't know what to talk about, how to respond, or how to keep it flowing.

I envy people who can talk naturally, laugh, and feel comfortable without effort. What I’m looking for isn’t just talking about the other person’s interests all the time. I’d just like to be able to talk one-on-one, calmly, in a simple and natural way, without always having to “search for a topic.”

Here’s an example: when I go out with a friend to the library, even if they try to fill the silences, I can’t manage to talk normally the entire day. I know it sounds like a strange problem… **But what can I do?**"
209,2,Yes i have social anxiety but what im currently gonna describe does it belong to social anxiety? So basicly when im out in public when random people stare at my i blush like crazy. Random people i dont know or girls i blush fucking crazy i feel like i got cursed
210,2,"okay so not *everything* i say, but everytime i (21f) chat with a classmate of mine about more than just homework, i start regretting things i say afterwards. i feel the need for more close relations in my day to day life, because my partner and best friends live far away, but everytime i speak with the people from my school that im relatively close to, it feels like i say everything wrong.

a few examples, i said something negative about one of the girls' boyfriend, i said i miss gossip, overall talking about other people in general, whenever i notice i have talked a bit too long about myself or a certain topic im passionate about in general. 

its exhausting and i keep beating myself up for it. i really like these friends from school but this problem makes me insecure and makes me awkward, while i was well intetioned and upened up to get to a deeper level.

Does anybody know whats happening and what i can do about it?

211,2,"Hey guys. I’m 27. Female. Been dealing with being a borderline hermit for the last 5 years or so—haven’t had ppl to hang out with consistently since post-COVID. I really want to break out of it. My social anxiety just sucks ass so bad. I really want friends again. I want ppl to talk to for no reason other than just wanting to talk to them. I’m tired of convincing myself I’m better off alone—I’m literally not and I feel like it’s driving me insane. Yet my issue lies in not knowing what to do to make it better. I’m not gonna go to a bar. I’m not gonna strike up conversations with strangers. I try making small talk with coworkers but they give me the vibe that they’ve already written me off as being too weird to ever hang with. 

Part of me wants to try giving compliments to random customers at work but 1. I don’t want them to think I’m flirting (masculine presenting lesbian 👋🏾) and 2. How would I handle future interactions? I care about the what ifs so much it stops me from doing anything. I just hate that “what ifs” have come true for me so many times in the past, now I’m convinced my anxiety always “has a valid point.” I feel like I’m losing the ability to argue against it (if that makes sense)"

All of this ends up really being something very complicated and making it difficult in social interactions, I realize that many people try to make fun of me because of my way, even if for them it's a joke, for me it's something like a stab, I feel really bad and want to cry (it's worth remembering that for me crying is very difficult, I think it's also because of these symptoms of social anxiety, because I'm afraid of crying in public, I've always hidden my crying a lot, but I wanted to learn how to be able to cry more, because nowadays I recognize that it is important, when necessary) making it clear that I don't have a diagnosis, but I have a lot of symptoms and this really becomes difficult for me"

I think that they don't want to be with me but do so in order to get me included I guess, most of the time when I try to talk no one hears me neither answers me, maybe it's not anxiety and they truly just don't like me but my social anxiety isn't helping the situation.

216,2,"I’m trying to remember as far as I can… personally I think it might be due to the fact that:

- as a baby/toddler, I had severe health issues that isolated me from others
- as a child I had friends, but I was also sometimes mocked for being chubby 
- I was also by myself a lot because my 2 sisters are way older than me 
- since I was overprotected by my parents, I was basically scared of a lot of things, and some members of my family would even tell me that I was not smart or resourceful (compared to other children that were even a bit younger than me)
- some different health issues appeared when I was a teen, which also sort of isolated me + I was the classic depressed type of teen hating on my body, people and life in general

I have the feeling that I grew up trying to walk in a minefield for some reason. I carry this feeling even nowadays, with weird thoughts like “I went through another day” or “I survived another cringy interaction with someone”. I live as if life was a burden, and people were challenges. 

It’s been 9 years I live abroad. At the start, I was able to make new friends, connections, then I messed things up by putting distance with people or breaking friendships because I felt in “danger” (boundaries / needs not respected IMO) instead of trying to fix things. Also covid hit, and it damaged things even more around me but also in my brain. I have also changed jobs a few times and this impacted my relationships a lot.

218,2,"Somehow I have managed to talk enough at work to be on pretty good terms with a few of my co-workers. One of them has invited two of us, me and one of the guys, to go to a club on saturday. Now, I am not someone who likes clubbing. Or at least I don't think I'll like it, I've never actually been but it really does not seem like my scene. My first instinct is to say no, just not go, make up some story of why I can't make it, but then I got to thinking about how depressed I get about not ever doing anything or talking to anyone. I feel like I should go, I should at least give it a shot, right? My sister thinks the same thing. She was very excited for me and exclaimed that I should go. The only problem is that just thinking about it makes me so anxious that I start crying. I'll just be alone in a room and then I'll start thinking about it, then I'll start to cry. It's paralyzing. I am terrified. Usually when I go out to anything, a bar or a house party, i'll pretty much follow around the friend that I went with the whole time. It would be incredibly weird to follow around one of my co-workers, I'm not at that level with them yet and probably never will be. The details are so foggy. I've never been to this place before and I'm not even entirely sure where it is. I don't know what time they're going and the thought of standing in some club I've never been too surrounded by strangers awkwardly waiting for the two people I am acquaintances with at work to show up is horrifying. That is another thing that makes me start crying. 

Really, I know that I should go. Some part of me WANTS to go. Just everything about it makes me so anxious that I feel physically ill. "

It's proven to be true time and time again no matter how much I try to change the fact and have since accepted it. Really, It's kind of peaceful. I do things for myself and for those I want to help/protect. I can focus on things that matter to me, and compared to others, I feel I'm doing pretty well in my life. Yet, my parents, the charismatic and beautiful people they are don't understand why I'm so different from them or my siblings, or other kids my age. They say I'm ""too"" serious and can't understand why I can't be ""just like the other kids."" My parents are honestly good people, and I do love them, but they seem to only worry about how I'm doing socially instead of the more important things in life, and expect me to be this character I can't be. I hope I explained this well, and how could I address my parents about this issue?

221,2,"I’m a senior high school student about to graduate. I struggle with social anxiety, and I’m very reserved and shy. 

In a nutshell… I’ve been interested in a guy in my class. He sits right beside me. I find him sweet. He leans forward to listen me, due to my quiet voice. He’s gentle and respectful. As for communication, he responds to messages within reasonable time (minutes to 2 hours) and is engaging. He seems introverted but also maintains good social relations with others. 

I’d like to get to know him. But… I wonder what are the chances for someone to be interested in someone who is socially anxious. I know my limits, but I know my strengths. Despite my social anxiety controlling certain aspects of my life, I live a normal-enough life. I have my own hobbies and feel comfortable being alone. 

Would it be worth the shot to “ask him out”? If so, how would it be best to approach it? By text? Or would it be best in-person? If that’s the case, I think I’ll blush too hard and stutter.

222,2,"Hello,   
  
Today, I was reading about charisma and how I could incorporate it into my personality. I found out that I have certain problematic habits that have to go before I think of being more charismatic. I suspect some of you might relate, and I’d love your perspectives or tips if you’ve overcome similar struggles.   
  
  
My Core Issues (as I see them):  
  
1) Hyper-Self-Consciousness: I overanalyze how I’m perceived. For example, walking down the street, I’ll avoid eye contact with strangers by staring at blank spaces, which later makes me feel awkward and ""closed off"". It feels as if I am trying to protect myself from a big danger in the environment. In public (like on the metro), I’ll pretend to be busy (fake phone calls, exaggerated ""deep thought"" face) to avoid interactions and eye-contact. It’s like I’m preemptively protecting myself from being ""seen.""

  
2) Unexpected Conversations Throw Me: If I randomly meet a friend and he tries talking to me, I might mumble or give a weird reply, unless I’m fully comfortable, in which case I’m my confident self. Same with friends-of-friends, or some familiar people I know. I'll again try to disappear from them. Sometimes I feel as if I am the child of my 2 other friends who just met their friends, and I am hiding behind their back 😂😂  
  
I used to think that I was being my usual self, but it's not, since it's draining my energy in a perfectly normal environment, and it needs to go. I feel that I've solved 30-40% of the problem now that I consciously recognize it, but I'd love to hear some practical advice from those who were once like me, and have transformed into more confident individuals.

A little about me - It is evident that I am an introvert (20 yo; MBTI-INFJ if it helps), I was much more anxious and underconfident earlier. I have worked on myself, but I still feel there are some final barriers left to overcome. I am confident in one on one conversations with almost everybody, but these are some situations where I should do better. 

Thanks for your time  
"
223,2,"Basically I feel like everyone is watching me and judging me. Maybe even bad mouthing me, and I had it under control until my fears were confirmed by a I guess friend at work. As soon as I get out of my car to go clock in my heart starts racing and I just feel exposed for lack of a better term. I work fast food and it’s close quarters in the kitchen of course. As well as being time sensitive so there is a lot of pressure. My husband wants me to go back in the morning just to work out a two weeks. But I can’t imagine the anxiety I’ll feel now that I’ve walked out due to almost having a panic attack. Some of the stuff that bothers me is real and some of it is in my head I know but it’s just too much now. I’ve never dealt with this before and I pushed through it for a whole year! But today the feeling was just too heavy and I had to get out of there.  I just was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this? "
224,2,"I wasn't always socially anxious. Not really. But a life time of people pointing things out about me  (and they're often the same things), from different people in different settings, has given me bad social anxiety. 

People say it's just in your head that people judge negatively, but I don't know... People have negatively judged me my whole life, and they've not been quiet about it.

How would therapy approach this?"
225,2,"I was getting groceries and needed to tap my card twice because the cashier thought I was paying with VISA when I wasn't. When I used the wrong card she said with frustration that she had asked me three times if I was using VISA. I had only heard the last instance and I thought she just asked if I was paying by card, to which I said yes. I felt rather ashamed and it's been stuck in my head for the hour since it happened. It doesn't help that said grocery store is just down the street from my new place and I'd like to go there frequently (I had already met this cashier once before).

The cashier spoke rather quietly, it was crowded, and we were conversing in Mandarin which I'm only semi-fluent in. I think those are the reasons I couldn't hear her accurately, but I often do find myself being unable to make out what people are saying, so I'm not sure if it's more of a me problem. Perhaps I should've asked for clarification when I couldn't exactly make out what she was saying, but when interacting with strangers my anxious mind usually just wants to get through it as quickly and straightforwardly as possible.  

Maybe I'm just overthinking this, it's not like I regularly get told off for rudeness. In fact I've rarely been told off in general so I'm not used to it and maybe take it too seriously. Just writing to get this off my chest and move on with my day. "
226,2,"For a bit of background information: I’ve never been really athletic. The only sport I did was road cycling, but I can’t do that anymore because I’m recovering from anorexia. In any case, my friends meet sometimes and it happens that they play beach volleyball on the beach, for example. I don’t know if it’s because I’m just not an athletic person. But when I know that sports could be involved in meetings, I always cancel. It’s so uncomfortable for me and when we’re in the park and someone says they took a ball, I could throw up every time and literally cry. I either leave immediately or find a stupid excuse. Does anyone relate…???

Edit : honestly I’m kind of noticing that this happens with any activity I’m unfamiliar with. Could also be a card game but it’s mainly sports "
227,2,"I'm Soo happy I decided to take my cat out for a walk today.

Some kids came to pet my cat and an older lady with her kid also pet my cat. I had a few small talk with them.

And last of all a really pretty girl around my age came to me and we talked about CATS! we had a good conversation that lasted around 30min.

Although I was REALLY nervous, I think I managed to talk to her without her thinking I'm weird :,)

That's all. just wanted to talk about my success XD "
228,2,"Literally, I know I don't have it, I mean it in the sense of knowing how to stand up for myself when people try to contradict/do harm to me, I wish I didn't have to go through that, I see a lot of people trying to take advantage of me and cause fragility, I just wanted to know a way to show them that they shouldn't do that to me, but I feel very embarrassed showing that I don't like it, because I seem ""sensitive"""
229,2,"I have struggled with this for a long time. I feel as though people just hate me, the second they see me. I try to be polite and respectful but people will end up being so harsh, condescending, impolite in return. Some days when I'm working it just feels like every customer is giving me an attitude or being really rude, looking at me with this huge frown and look of absolute distain, treating me like I'm their enemy when I'm trying my best to be cool. I'll usually end interactions with ""thank you"" or ""have a good one"" or something similar, but a lot of people will just stare angrily at me like I seriously offended them and say nothing back and it feels so awkward. I'm just trying to be respectful and kind but it's like people are seriously offended by my presence. I'm just a regular dude trying to get through the day and not cause problems.

It gives me this really bad feeling, like I'm just hated by everyone immidiately at first glance. It makes me feel bad about myself, sometimes it feels like I'm the only one who gets treated this way by other people. Other people seem to get warm and positive responses from others but I never do. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, what nuanced social rule it is that I'm breaking. I replay all the negative interactions and negative people in my head and it really gets to me and I don't know how to deal with it. And sometimes I wish just one person was nice to me. Does anyone else feel this way?"
230,2,"I wasn't too pumped about starting college. I started off the 1st year by trying small talk with whoever just so i don't look like a loner. I eventually, thankfully, found some people I vibed with, and we became friends.

Now, in the 2nd year, after spending enough time with them, I just feel down whenever i sit with them. I can't seem to fully click with them and find myslef missing my school friends, which I rarely talk to anymore. Im unable to completely be myself with them, nor speak normally, i keep jumbling up my words (i always do but it should be this bad with strangers). And I keep getting talked over since we are 5, so you either get your chance to talk quickly or not. My voice is quite low, so someone would cut me off or not hear me at all, lol. So basically i just feel invisible, left out or a ""background charecter"". I wasn't like this in school idk what happened.

I still like them as people, and I can't see myself finding any other group that would i would be more comfortable with, but I don't like how they make me feel about myself ykwim. And I don't think I'll be able to find new friends as I suck at talking to new people and i don't go to uni much, I just go for 1 day when I have attendance which is the same group with the same people where everybody already have their friend groups ""solidified"" so even if I did manage to drift away from my group (without feeling like a jackas) I'll have no one to talk to in uni.

Socialising here is draining the hell out of me. Im longing for connections I lost and connections I can't seem to make. I feel like an outcast and I'm scared of being percieved as one"
231,2,"Парни, нужна ваша точка зрения.

Мне 25 лет, второй год живу на Пхукете. Работаю, жильё есть, но с социальной жизнью полный ноль. Общаюсь только с теми, кого знал раньше — с новыми людьми контакт не строится.

Вижу, как в компании, где я живу, все общаются между собой, но меня держат на дистанции. Разговоры только по делу, всё сухо, будто «какой-то не такой». Даже если сам иду на контакт — ноль отдачи. Поэтому стал всё больше времени проводить один. Есть ощущение, что меня не уважают, не воспринимают всерьёз, как будто я “не в теме”.

Понимаю, что, возможно, дело во мне. Где-то не тот вайб, где-то зажатость. Но при этом я не дурак — с головой, с внешностью порядок, работаю, живу честно. Хочу нормального круга общения, настоящих друзей, отношения. Но сейчас словно хожу в вакууме.

Вопрос к тем, кто через это проходил:

**Как выстраивать социальные связи в чужой стране, если чувствуешь себя чужим? Как прокачать уверенность и выйти из этой изоляции?**"
232,2,"Let me start with the good news- I found roommates to begin with, so I will not be subject to random selection. I even managed to meet one in person recently.

Now for the bad news, that I'm sure you could guess from the sub- I'm still terrified. One of my greatest fears in social situations is acting like a total jerk. Normally, this is unfounded (although it still freaks me out), but there's a difference between behaving properly outside and doing the same thing while in my main living area.

I don't know if I'm asking for advice here or just doing low-level venting, but that's the current situation. "
233,2,"I joined a very specialized area in banking — junior role, no prior experience. It’s a great opportunity, good pay, but nearly three months in and I’ve barely had any real tasks. Most of my time has been spent going through business rules and doing some coding. My senior is too busy to train me or explain what she’s working on, even when we’re both in the office. I keep asking for work, but the tasks I get are vague and unstructured.

When at office, I just sit there pretending to be busy, overthinking everything, visibly anxious. I’m barely copied in emails.

My manager (not my supervisor) is polite but very awkward around me — avoids eye contact, doesn’t start conversations, and usually goes to lunch with others without ever inviting me. I’m quite shy myself, which makes the silence even more uncomfortable. He might just be reserved too, but sometimes it feels like he just doesn’t like me. 

My supervisor, on the other hand, is very kind, and said twice they’re happy with me. She compliments my note-taking, says I’m self-taught, and that I have potential. She even said she wouldn’t mind if I eventually surpass her, since she’s not young and they need someone to be a backup. But despite all that, things are slow and not demanding at all as she's been promising.

They often compare me to the previous person — who was fired and is constantly badmouthed. I feel mentally drained, disconnected from the team, and honestly disappointed. I thought I’d be learning by now, especially with the expectations they set early on. Am I overthinking this? Or could they actually let me go for being too quiet and not fitting in socially? I just need a bit more confidence to start opening up ...
"
234,2,"I have really bad social anxiety but I am significantly more anxious in groups than one on one. Whenever I am in a group, everyone seems so desperate to speak and they all talk over each other, or the same second someone is done talking they speak. Everyone judges you if you don't talk, which is why everyone is so desperate to speak, but at the same time that creates an environment that is really fucking hard to get a word in. I don't think people who don't talk should be judged, because honestly in order to talk you have to interrupt people when it comes to groups. When I think of something I want to say and plan to say it after one person in the group is done talking, someone interrupts that person when they are almost done their sentence and I lose my chance to speak. This cycle continues until I've been quiet the whole time, and people have probably judged me for not talking enough. I am so sick of this. Maybe I should just only have one on one friends my whole life. I've always wanted a friend group, it seems so fun, I just can't get the hang of speaking in one because there's literally no opportunities to talk."
235,2,"Hi all, I just wanted to positive rant, not sure if there is a word for that, but hey... You get what I mean.

Since the beginning of this year I challenged myself to compliment anyone during the day, and I mean a true heartfelt compliment. I've gone as big as saying to my best friend that he is my best friend to as small as saying to a cashier that I liked her tattoo. 

My reasoning: I find it hard to talk to other people (I guess some of you can relate :p), so this will be my ""training"". Everybody loves getting compliments right, so you'll start off the conversation on a positive note. 

Today I have been thinking about the difference between then and now. I notice that I'm having a remarkably easier time keeping conversation (though I still need to improve heavily on that. My next experiment: next week I'm going to a festival... alone). Plus I don't freak out as much when someone tries to talk to me. 

So that's all I wanted to say... Still work to do, but the first steps have been stepped, or whatver the experession is. Have a nice evening / day / night, whenever you're reading this."
236,2,Im really nervous right now just by thinking of introducing yourself cause ive been laughed at by the same classmates i dont really what to do. I shouldn’t been born
237,2,I usually don't talk to girls much because of not I am sigma boi but I can't just talk to them I think they will react weirdly if I talk to them. Although I am not ugly i look good but I have seen many guys in my class talk to girls effortlessly and have many gf but I can't talk to them and can't even make eye contact please help
238,2,I have a swimming pool in my society I have membership and all and I also had gone there 1 yr ago but now I am fearing to go because my physique is not good but better than before I have well developed chest but arms are thin asf which I am thinking people will judge and also wear full jacket when I go out I think people will judge me and I also don't make eye contact much pls motivate me🙏🙏
239,2,"""What are some common triggers of social anxiety, and how do you usually cope with them?"" tysm "
240,2,"I always had social anxiety. Ok. Its started in my high school after smoking marihuana but actually all that was managable. I always was scared of people, specially mens, and i always avoided big people of group, couldnt speak and groups etc. But i always had couple of friends with which I was comfrotable. But actually always needed big amount of alcohol to drink it so i can be relaxed to speak. That was in my high school and little bit later. But once i had complitely mental break down after some social events and i am not the same anymore. My brain shut down complitely, i cant speak at all, i become mute, i cant speak at all nothing is coming to my mind to speak, nothing is helping anymore, not alcohol and nothing, i cant walk infront of people-its like im having some barrier which i cant skip, its really like real barrier to feel its like i cant feel people dont want me around, people are avoiding me, they cant sit still next to me, nobody wants to be around me, everybody is speaking fast and going somewhere like they are in hurry when they walking by me, something i had inside of me which is terrible, i hate that part od myself but i cant get rid of it. That part is grown with years of disappointment, bad things which happened to me, inability to change anything, i cant change my core and i cant live like that anymore.. people are now scared of me the same like i am scared of them because I become some other creature- i am definitely not human… its terrible experiance… i just cant live like that anymore.. i never wanted in my life that people are scared of me or that they avoiding me. Once i had social anxiety and i was shy and afraid but i was cute girl. Now my brain is fried with no ability to change. I didnt deserve all that bad things to happen to me. Is here somebody whos social anxiety is changed their brain permanently on the bad side. Before i tried also meds, talk therapy, exposure therapy but everything just made me worse and worse :(((
"
241,2,"Genuinely struggling to put up with this every day. I go in, work in silence, and deliberate for 20 minutes whether to go to my mentor's desk and ask him a question. I'll also just start doom scrolling if there's nothing else for me to do instead of ask him.

I haven't really had meaningful conversations with the other intern or any of my team. Aside from the first two days, I've been eating lunch by myself (even now as I'm writing this lol) then just sitting in my car to pass time so that I don't have to immediately go back to work. I'm an introvert so this is what I prefer, but at the same time it feels like I'm doing something wrong by not trying to talk to as many people as I can at all times.

The technical work is getting harder and there seems to be more and more work assigned to me now. And when I get home I have less than half of the alone time I used to, spending most of it just preparing for the next day of work. Is this really all there is to life after graduation?

Sorry if this felt like a rant. Do any of you have any advice on what I should be doing instead? And how I can overcome my anxiety to make the most of this internship? I just feel like I'm completely wasting the great opportunity I was given."

243,2,"I've been trying to get to know this girl lately. I'm interested in her, and she seems interested in me back. We're still getting to know each other, but I can't stop overthinking and worrying about every single move I make. 

I realize I need to just let go and be more present, but that's easier said than done. Any advice??"
244,2,"Does someone else feel uneasy when getting too close in a friendship?  
There was this classmate who proposed to me to work together on projects now that we're on summer break, and so we're having discord voice calls every other day, sometimes in a row. But it's just been this week and I felt somewhat uncomfortable, since I'm not used to interacting with people. I haven't found having conversations helpful to feel better, and I don't know why I don't enjoy them."
245,2,"does anyone get the problem where you'll be talking to somebody and you're so anxious that you can't take in anything they're saying, so then you can't seem to continue the conversation because your mind is so blank and dissociated? i get so tense and scared that it feels like theres this invisible force trying to keep my mouth shut. 

i'll try to make some eye contact because i'm scared of seeming rude, but then that just worsens the ""blank mind"" state i go into. it's like my fight or flight kicks in and i can't think properly during conversations.
i'm tired of living socially isolated. i used to be so outgoing and extroverted and confident a decade ago and now i can't even look people in the eye, and i'm afraid to talk to my own family. 

i know i just need exposure to more social situations, but i can't even practice conversations with people without dissociating like this. it's extremely embarassing.. it only happens sometimes but when it doesn't i still feel very deterred from socializing because i'll never know when it'll happen.

i've tried deep breathing methods, some medications, other coping methods, and i'm currently in therapy. but it's just so hard to motivate myself to push through this phobia when i could easily embarass myself and fall into depression again from it (yes, i get full on depressed for a couple days minimum if i'm ruminating on an embarassing situation)"
246,2,"I (24M) have always been an introverted person that hides emotions, usually get exhausted of socializing quickly but not always, have a tough time keeping my close friends close and I tend to have a lot of awkwardness when I'm talking to people. I just suck at it. Main reason I'd say is that I lack confidence. I lack confidence because I lack life experiences. I lack life experiences because I don't go out a lot and my days just consist of going to a job, coming home and just watching Youtube and playing video games, maybe checking out a movie sometimes and when I do go out with few friends that I have, it is usually a good time but nothing adventurous or special and they all have very social lives with their other friends which they like to brag about. I have also never went on a date in my life, as I have only approached 2 women in my life and got rejected by both, which is fine but the problem is I don't approach women because I know things that I don't want out of a partner, but I don't really know what I want because I don't know who I am as a person, other than a nice guy which is probably how everyone would describe me as.

I know that I need to socialize more, have more social hobbies and other hobbies I can just brag about, be a better talker (the hardest part to improve imo) etc. but I don't know where to start. I'd like to know if anyone had a similar experience that I have right now and has eventually found themselves and became a much more interesting person. I want to become interesting because that would mean most things I just mentioned about myself would improve and be better than now. What hobbies did you get into? How did you begin socializing more? What made you an interesting person? Where did you start? Even those that are in a similar situation right now or have never been in a situation like this can give me advice too!

Any comment is appreciated."
247,2,"A few months ago I decided I was going to start trying to push myself more outside of comfort zone, the only way to make a positive change is to get a bit uncomfortable and do something new,. I decided to get back to my theater roots, I've always loved theater and mostly do behind the scenes work. I was hoping if anything, I would just make some friends. 

After joining the production, my mental health took a very steep dive. My dog died and I feel like I've been very depressed ever since. I'm trying to grant myself some grace because of this, I know I'm not at my best. But even though going to rehearsals has helped me keep my mind off of it, it has also made me significantly more depressed because of how bad I feel like I'm doing socially. I feel like I'm messing the job I have to do and I'm not making a good impression on anyone. I've been going to rehearsals for almost two months now, the show is starting tonight, and a girl who started last week is having more people come up and talk to her than I have. 

  
I even tried making a point to make conversation with two people every rehearsal but I am just at the point where I think I am not good at this whole socializing thing. I just think I don't operate like other people. 

  
Does anyone else with social anxiety feel like they just constantly make fools of themselves? At this point I'm just trying to get through the production without having a breakdown everyday."
248,2,"soooo I don’t know where to start 

But title is pretty self explanatory. we all had to wear the masks during the pandemic (as you all know). 

and when everyone stopped wearing it. I didn’t. And to this day when I go outside, to go anywhere I’m wearing the mask. 

When I go to work, I wear the mask. 
No I’m not sick or immunocompromised. 

I literally just wear it out of comfort. Except it’s starting to make me uncomfortable even lol. Just because I know that everyone thinks about it.  My family has even caught me at my job or out and about wearing it and they’ll ask me sick

And I lie and say I’m sick lol.  Strangers sometimes confront me about it and think I wear it for some kind if political reasoning? Or something ? Thats just the energy I get because some people seem offended when they see me with it.

But anyways, although there isn’t a big reason why I wear it. There’s definitely a bunch of little reasons

1) I’m generally insecure. Mostly about my teeth/gum health, my eye bags, not perfect skin, super hairy so I often have stubble ect.

2) I’m very expressive in the face. Before the mask era I was always told I’m very cartoonish and I’ve been told I have a very recognizable face whatever that means lol. And I can’t help it lol. 
Like people often react from my face and misinterpret my feelings. Or idk sometimes I react faster than I think. So the masks help me kinda hide those initial responses. In general I’m just not good at hiding my feelings and the masks obvi help that.

3) I do have alot of health anxiety. In general lolol. So there’s that.

And lastly it just kinda feels weird now to not wear the mask. Which is completely my fault. Because I never gave it up.  
But I don’t really know what to do because although I always plan to not wear it anymore. I’ve grown kinda reliant and just overly comfortable with the mask & I have a hard time even visualizing myself without it.

I’m not sure if this is the right community for this post because I feel like this subject is probably complicated but I feel like the heart of this problem for me..

Is that the masks help me feel like I’m hiding. Which is dumb and dosnt make sense but I’m finding it hard to put it down for that reason. It’s so dumb but it feels exposing when I don’t  have it on
And although I kinda don’t want to stop wearing it. I want too at the same time because I know it’s not normal and it probably makes me look even weirder bc of my social anxiety .

I don’t know . Hope this reaches people

249,2,How am I supposed to even live like this? I'm so deathly terrified of getting a job and I know I'll get fired or just quit soon after starting because my anxiety is so bad. And there's nothing that helps me. What am I supposed to do other than kill myself? Honestly. 
250,2,"Any tips if anyone ever made it out? Feel like my anxiety has always held me back from job interviews, and work related success. People with great communication skills always seem to have way easier career success compared to those who don’t 😪. "
251,2,"I 23(M) have not been able to crack why I can’t initiate small talk or just speak up unless I’ve been spoken to. 
I don’t have a problem doing small banter in response to someone’s initial start but I just have this feeling that I’m bothering them if I start it. 

At work my coworkers have all been through the cycle of trying to get me to talk by staring and using non verbal cues to no avail as I just stare off in the distance and feel myself turn red and start sweating. This has led to my own isolation at that job as my role doesn’t really require any socializing at the bare bones of it. I understand why some people avoid me at work due to my anti social tendencies and I tell myself it’s ok and that I’m just not the right person for that crowd but I think that’s a cope for my loneliness 

I have lost 100+ pounds over the last 2 years and this has only brought more Opportunity to socialize as pretty privilege (I’m no 10 but definitely better than I was) is very real. But the problem is that I still have this bitchass mindset that I don’t know how to talk to others. Not to mention the women who are more confident and will do things to set up a easy lay up for me to say something still seem to try after time and time again I fumble by freezing up. Every time this happens I hate myself more and more but eventually that subsides and I move on until the next time those feelings come up. 

What should I do, I want to to be able to make friends and confidently meet people, but it seems impossible from where I’m at. The people at this job may never want to interact with me due to my behaviour but as I move forward and I never want to be this awkward ever again."
252,2,"what r ur hobbies, what do u like to do for fun, what do u do on ur free time.. what did u do today .. how was ur week/weekend ?

iterations of the same question. its this thing ppl do when they wanna get to know more abt u lol. and well the truth is. i have sa and it controls my life.

its embarrassing. i freeze and js want to remove myself from the situation entirely. bc the answer every single goddamn time is gonna be underwhelming. i dont want to keep on feeling so ashamed of myself. my heart flutters n my mind shuts off. i have nothing acceptable to say. i used to think that lying would be worse, would make me feel worse abt myself. but since getting a little more comfortable w socializing ive started to tell myself that sometimes its okay to lie. little ""white"" lies here n there .. harmless right?

or maybe thats js another lie ive fed myself to make pretending a little more okay, a little less unbearable in my mind."
253,2,"I've come into a deeper realization now that most ppl no matter how much they express their open mindedness, still lack the sympathy and understanding it takes towards those who suffer immense social anxiety. not just plain introvertness or shyness, but literal anxiety in society or crowds personal or virtual.

i recently joined a private fb group that teaches through materials and lectures all for academic purposes, but they announce they'll remove those accounts that're considered unofficial, dump, or not real acc. obvoiusly i used a secondary acc in which my real identity can't be directly discovered. i have my reasons and i see few ppl in the group also voicing this issue out. i do u derstand why they have to regulate the members but our reason is also valid. 

believe it or not, i get social anxiety even in facebook. it's an ever pressing issue for me to deal with my soc anx. if i use my real acc, ppl i know would know im reviewing for a course/subject im not rllt comfortable letting them know. interactions for me would also be difficult if i use my real acc. but then after all these worries, i know why they do it they want to filter out members and make sure they are delivering free teaching service to real ppl. but it just on the side note makes me sad because im also someone who wants to study. i just have my difficulties and it's sad to realize that we're always gonna be the minority that the world in most case is not made for. 

i still hope they'd consider or they'll get tired filtering ppl out. but I'd ive rlly sad if i get removed from that just because im using an account that doesnt explicitly gives out who i am. "
254,2,"Tried zoloft all the way to 200, tried lexapro, and finally pristik 100mg. 

None have worked for my social anxiety. Should I add another medication with pristik? Anyone have any experience with that? 

Or something else entirely? "
255,2,"Like if people noticed you starting to make more of an effort to be more social, it'd mean having to acknowledge to them (even tacitly) that you have social anxiety in the first place?

That's crazy right. Like what- am I trying to pretend that this is a deliberate choice I'm making to be this way? ""No I'm in total control of how I conduct myself, I just like being awkward and withdrawn.""

I know I'm not fooling anyone, but I guess I'm just reluctant to admit to my social anxiety."
256,2,"I hate it. So much. I don't really know which subreddit I should post this on, but I'll just post it on the sub that I'm diagnosed with lmao. Online dating is the worst. I just want to be loved. I want to be loved without a screen in the way but nobody ever shows me any semblance of attraction IRL, so im forced to find it another way. It's fun for like.. the first few days. Then it becomes a chore, same with most online friends. The fact is even if someone did approach me and like me so much IRL, I don't know if id even be able to persue that relationship because im a wreck emotionally. Why is this so hard? It just seems impossible and so easy for everyone else. What is wrong with me?"
257,2,I feel like everyday my social anxiety gets worse. like everyday my vocabulary gets smaller for the things I let myself say. Like everyday everything just becomes more embarrassing or something. Don’t even get me started on talking. I have selective mutism and talking is hard. like when I’m playing a game with voice chat and someone asks me something the words get stuck in my throat. Like I open my mouth to say something but nothing comes out. But also my mind just goes blank because I’m so nervous Like I can’t even think of an answer or everything I think is wrong or embarrassing or stupid and my voice is stupid and they’re judging me you know.  Even in front of my family I just can’t respond to questions it’s like no answer I have is acceptable or deemed ok in my head. So it’s just easier not to respond at all. Sometimes after I respond to my friends texts and it’s something I deem embarrassing or whatever I have to literally turn my notifications off and flip my phone over and cover my face and prepare myself for their response before I can even look at it. Anyway Idk this was just me venting thanks. 
258,2,"Every time I go on a walk there’s always at least one embarrassing incident that happens to me. I refuse to make cars wait for me to cross the crosswalk, so I just pace back and forth in front of the crosswalk waiting for a moment where there aren’t any.

I’ve had too many moments where I actually was assertive and then almost got hit. I can’t risk the embarrassment anymore, which means making myself look like a lunatic. "

260,2,"how the hell do you even remotely fix this?
its ruining my life, and it isnt because i dont even have one.
i used to read all the hopeless posts on here and thought ""like atleast have some positivity""
but now i fully understand why, im tired of it, and im only 17.
i cant imagine living another 10 years with this honestly"
261,2,"Does this really stress anyone else out? When the barista knows your order, or when they address you by name? It makes me feel really embarassed. I was in a coffee shop I do enjoy and the barista said ‘you come in here a lot for someone who lives far away’. It made me feel so ashamed and I feel so sad that I never want to go in there again. Why do people have to say shit like this or just not mind their own business? 😞"
262,2,"I feel so underwhelming and yet im so anxious. I feel like every question's such a big deal but when i finally say what I want to say, my sentiments feel so uninteresting/unimportant. I can visibly see people be uncomfortable with my anxious energy.

Its so embarassing and pathetic. It's like, im visibly struggling AND boring. Too much about so little.

I don't really like anything to 'have' something to be passionate about. My knowledge and opinions seem so surface level. My memory is garbage. I spend most of my time mindlessly consuming things. I don't know how to be an 'attractive' friend, or really be someone anyone respects in general.

I crave connection but I can't even speak to people online. I dont know how to be understood or really communicate. Even with my writing, I can see that I'm not used to making my feelings be understood by others. My introspection means that i mainly write to put my feelings into words for myself. I write in this train of thought. I barely put in effort to organize it for others. I love to ramble and cram loosely connected ideas and tangents into paragraphs.

I dont know how to really connect with people on a deeper level. I want to try so bad but I know that I'm not at all used to healthy levels of socialization. As a loner, there's so much in my head to unpack and work on before I can really feel safe and seen by other people. It's such a pain.

tbh one of my goals entering college is to find someone i can open up to about this loneliness and whatever else. hopefully theyre understanding of this struggle. therapy, maybe. that'd be nice.
"
263,2,"I spent yesterday afternoon talking to a barista at a new café—nothing more than ordering tea.
Inside my head i practiced the whole script. i felt ready.
But when i got there... my voice shook, i stumbled over my words, and i said “thank you” like fifty times.
Later, walking home, i replayed it all:
should’ve asked how her day was.
should’ve smiled more.
should’ve sounded confident.
and every “what? why?” echoed in my head again and again.

Does anyone else go from calm to replay mode once it’s done?
How do you forgive yourself for the ‘after-moments’ that feel too late?"
264,2,"Cant help but look at myself and think damn. Why did I let this dumb shit take years away from my life, the school experiences I could of had, the friends I could of made, and all that. Its different for everyone, just for me I feel I have some great qualities that I feel like ive made to waste. Sure, I can start now, but ill remember the missed experiences and how those things could of benefited me today. More of a reason to live your life to the fullest, and bite the bullet, cause you don’t know when it will end."
265,2,"I am 16 I work a fast food job. I quit my last one for better pay. Since day one I’ve felt out of place. My manager didn’t even want to help me with my paper work when I was getting hired, and first day he shoved my uniform in my hands and didn’t say a word. 

I’ve been working there for about a month and the managers never trained me. I truly only knew how to do one station. I felt so useless standing there when everyone else would work. My managers and coworkers would always ask “do you know how to do..?” I would always reply no, and they would get frustrated with me. And when I tried to do other things my coworkers would say “they suck”. After a month of working there I had to ask how to get trained on other stations. I’m currently learning how to take orders on the pos system. It can be really confusing at times i try to ask questions, but when I do people won’t answer me and if they do they always seem annoyed. Ofc I make mistakes at times I’m still learning. When I don’t take orders it’s a problem and when I do it’s still a problem. I feel like I can’t do anything right. 

I also struggle with social anxiety, it’s smt I rlly hate about myself. I wish it was easier to just talk to anyone I meet. I rlly envy people who r like that. So ofc im rlly quiet at work. I always sit and watch other people talk to each other. I feel like everyone has their friend groups and I’m just…there. I rlly want to make friends at work, but it’s hard when I feel like no one likes me. Whenever I do try to add myself to a conversation no one will respond. It makes me not want to talk. I had a coworker tell me I’m “unapproachable” and “I look angry all the time”. That’s rlly not how I am, I’m the sweetest person when u get to know me, but no one will. Maybe I’m the problem maybe I just need to talk more?? A coworker told me my manager was speaking about me saying “I’m not the biggest fan of them”. Someone else telling me “no one likes u bc u don’t talk.” 

Honestly I think I might quit. But finding a job rn will be hard. I just feel so alone at work and like nothing I do is good enough. It’s hard working with people you know don’t like u and talk about u. It’s hard working with people who don’t even acknowledge you’re there and won’t even interact with you. I dread going to work. I go home and cry some days. 

Sorry this is so long any advice? 
"
266,2,"I’m at my wits end with this, any advice, self help, or suggestions are greatly appreciated. I’m a 26 y/o male, I have a great job, beautiful girlfriend, I consider myself good looking, fit, already investing in rental properties. But with all those things, every day is a total nightmare because of my mental health problems. I have some childhood trauma as I lost my dad at 15 months old, my single mother was always stressed and yelling at us. I have a twin brother who feels the same way but symptoms don’t seem as bad. Every morning when I wake up I feel the effects of anxiety and dread going to work. I cripple in social settings and have no confidence to even open my mouth. I feel I am a push over because of it and I hate confrontation. I’m switching to a new therapist and on Zoloft and lyrica, hopefully not forever. I ruminate non stop all day about it, I dread social settings, and it makes me feel depressed a lot of the time. I just want to be able to enjoy life, my relationships, and work without worrying about this feeling nonstop."
267,2,"There are places that, up until a few years ago even, I could for semi-reliable peace and quiet. But nowadays, I barely get out of my car and several other cars show up. Anyone else notice this? As someone with SA, I found these kinds of experiences restorative but it's like as soon as you show up in some out of the way park, other people aren't far behind. This has happened reliably across spaces and it's immensely frustrating."
268,2,"i find actually doing these social things arent that bad in the moment, sure ill be thinking about what i did wrong 3 hours past it, ill be dreading a potential social moment beforehand, but in the moment its kinda like adrenaline kicks in and im alright.
i need to get my haircut in 2 days and i fucking hate it, they always try and talk to me and i cant even change my hair since the guy has been doing the same ""usual"" for 7 years so he fucks it up every time. an irrelevant post really"
269,2,"For some context, I (24F) have had social anxiety for the majority of my life. First time I remember developing social anxiety was when I was in 1st or 2nd grade and I had a teacher who previously taught 6th graders but for some reason started teaching younger students, she would scold us, and I remember crying and telling my mom I didn't want to go to school. It got so bad that I missed weeks of school due to me not wanting to go to her class, the principal ended up talking to the teacher so she sort of calmed down but the damage was done at that point. I remember sitting down in my little desk and feeling this intense feeling in my chest and being scared to even make eye contact with her. Looking back I was probably having anxiety attacks like every day. Fast forward to 5th and 6th grade I remember being bullied for having hairy arms and also because kids are mean and that was just something kids did, I remember standing up for myself and then getting bullied even more. Pretty sure my social anxiety worsened during these years and in middle school and high school it just got worse because now I was older and had even more social pressures to fit in and be outgoing. Well I was not... instead I was the quiet, awkward, random nobody that people knew the name of but never actually became friends with. I had a couple friends but always felt like the weird one and sort of left out, I felt like my other friends didn't like being alone with me since I wasn't really fun to be around. But of course, this could all just be my inner demons speaking.

Fast forward to today, I am 24 years old, and I feel like I've made good progress but still have really bad periods where my SA takes over and I am back to zero. Its not like it goes away completely during the ""good"" times but is more bearable and less noticeable to others. I am still awkward and quiet and anxious like ALL the time and I still struggle with connecting with others. I don't trust other people enough to be myself so I don't have many friends. The only friend I have I've known for 18 years, and I still feel like I am not 100% myself around her due to fear of being judged. I still wish I didn't care what people think of me and I wish I didn't feel the need to be accepted by everyone. I am at a point where I am considering getting on medication but the thought of starting the process is scary, since I need to talk to an actual human to get medication. Anyways, I just felt like venting since sometimes writing my thoughts down sort of helps me cope. If you read this, thanks for reading this long ass post. :)"
270,2,"Not saying I don't wanna have more friends and go out more but I've grown to love being by myself throughout my healing journey. My social skills are getting better, I'm starting to meet more people and possibly make new friends. Though my social skills are getting better, I'm most comfortable alone at home in my room. I still live with my parents at 18 and I have no complaints besides sound sometimes. I love being in my cozy room by myself listening to music and doing whatever I feel like. I still want things like relationships and friendships but those intrusive thoughts I get during conversations like ""they already have friends they don't need me"" and ""this person doesn't really like me"" I hate those so much. So I'd rather just keep myself company because it makes me feel the most comfortable. It sounds like I fear going out but I really am just more happier at home."
271,2,"Hello! Do any of you have tips for dealing with social anxiety while on a trip with friends? 

Two of my closest friends and I are meeting up in NYC tomorrow (Friday) and staying until Monday. We're going to be seeing shows, doing all of our favorite activities, it's going to be a lot of fun. However, I am worried about my social anxiety. I'm very introverted and tend to need at least a little time alone during the day to reset my battery. We'll be staying in the same hotel room, so I'm not sure how much of that time I'll actually get. Last time I did something like this, I was anxious almost the entire time and was honestly kind of miserable. And as far as I know, there was no real reason that I was anxious, my body just said ""you're anxious now"".

How do you all deal with this? They're lovely people and will help me if I need it, I just hate asking, you know?"
272,2,"Ever since I was a kid i knew that I am bisexual. I was always bullied for being feminine by other children. People would always make comments about my feminine voice and my behavior. It has gotten to a point where I felt like people are telling me to stop being the way I am because my behavior is not appropriate. I was even criticized by my own family who kept telling me that me being feminine is so noticeable by the way I talk, the way I move, by my interests, my empathy for people. I was often told that I am too sweet/ too friendly for a boy. I never understood why characteristics like that are even ""embarrassing"" since I was so well-behaved as a kid. However, the constant criticism didn't stop in my childhood. In fact, it continued for so many years up until now in my 20s. It developed into a social phobia and lead to extreme isolation. I truly believe that people who are queer are more likely to become socially anxious. Can anyone relate to this?"
273,2,"I have an interview tomorrow for a visa so that I can hopefully travel and work with family or to at least have the option to. My mother was saying stuff like ""Don't act nervous"" etc. Or that they watch nervousness, so I shouldn't show nervousness or act ""shy"". I had to tell her that it's not very conducive and rather unhelpful to say that. And now I'm a bit anxious thinking of how it will go. Any suggestions to calm the nervousness. I could try faking confidence, but IDK how well that will go.  


Edit: I didn't get it because I ""couldn't prove that my reason to stay was legit"". I suspect it's because I didn't go on the work and travel program, so they think I'm trying to go for work. Either that or they think I was too nervous. I still see the fact I went alone as a win though."
274,2,"I've been Regular'd by my local coffee shop :')

I've been dealing with agoraphobia for over a decade now, but in the past year ive been making a serious effort to get the fuck outside, even if it's only to the tiny shopping centre on my street.
I go at least once a week now, and get myself an iced coffee as a reward 🤡

last week, I stepped in, my usual clammy shaky wonderful self, and there's a few people lining up at the counter to order.
The barista sees me, points to me over the people waiting, shouts ""hello sweetness! Your usual?""
Happened again today.

I'm weirdly emotional about it?

I'm terrified of repeat interactions with people.
But I've become a regular. At the supermarket, the coffee shop, the post office.

I guess going from ""can't go outside also gotta be invisible if I do"" to ""regular"" is a big step that I never anticipated being part of my journey lmao
"
275,2,"I have been unemployed for quite some time and every job I apply to I have been rejected or ignored. I have done interviews with a few companies like Walmart and I always have been ghosted after. I did some interviews for McDonald’s and I thought I was finally gonna get a job because it’s a guaranteed job and they hire anyone. That’s what everyone told me. But they ghosted me too. I followed advice to email them to show you want the job so I did. Then they emailed me “sorry you are not a good fit for McDonald’s.” A real person told me that. 

So the only thing I can think of is they didn’t like that I was shy. My shyness is very noticeable and I can’t do anything about it. I cannot even pretend to be confident. I understand why they wouldn’t hire me, since they need loud and extroverted people to work. So no they don’t hire anyone. They hire extroverted loud mouths. Makes sense. You walk in a McDonald’s and all they do is talk and talk. They are in their playing with each other cracking jokes every second. I guess I’m not that. I just wanna work. 

If I can’t get a job at Mcdonalds or Walmart them what can I do. It’s the lowest of the lowest tier jobs and I couldn’t get it. Imagine what this does to my self esteem. "
276,2,"Sorry in advance I'm feeling low.

I don't know what I am doing in my life, I am always bounded and stuck by myself by this, I can't live up to my potential because I am always scared, so many opportunities are missed, so many lives are unloved, I don't know who am I or what I like, do I like that because I do or I am just too scared to try.
I am such a failure and a disappointment to everyone I know, I am not man enough for my father, I am not the kid he wanted I am not capable of being a man, I am not good enough for my sisters, I am not a good friend because I am never there, I don't have a job, I am no one and I'll forever be no one."
277,2,"I am close to quitting my job.
I get a lot of anxiety just thinking about interacting with other people there. They all have that pretense niceness with odd intentions and unspoken berating covered by nice attitude and while it should ease my anxiety it just makes my brain buzz with static and throws me into panic and anger.

I want to quit but they all talk about my future at the company and I shouldn't get stuck inbthe wrong direction.

They don't see that I don't have leadership qualities. I can barely lead myself. But they try to make me evolve in that direction. I would be satisfied with a low paying job and they always use money as an argument. I don't care about the money. I just want to feel less bad.

I fear that if I quit, the next job will be exactly like that once again and its me, that I am the problem and won't ever be satisfied at a job and threw away an amazing opportunity because this is a great opportunity. Really a company generations of your family work at once you set foot in there."

279,2,"Hello im a teenage male and whenever i go out in public i always get weird faces by lads in public (scums). Who go in groups of 5-10 whether it be in a vehicle while walking or while standing in certain places in shops. Its crushed my self esteem the very little amount i have to even function, and i feel constantly paranoid and severe anxiety in cities now. The things they do is make annoying noises, stick out theire tongues, call you fatso, or some other insults for a tall fat person its not ok. Ive also been bullied by 1 or 2 people by themselves before in school 2 girls used to bully me call me slow and stuff the other was a lad who would call me fat laugh at me with his friends and tell me to keep walking on fatso. (I dont know if im so picked on because i have severe social anxiety and deppression too). Its not okay"
280,2,"just need to get something off of my chest, I feel like I'm overthinking/over fixating on this. The past few weeks have been one social blow up after another, and a little incident at work just made me feel so crappy.

I just had two coworkers physically stand and *lean* over their cubicle walls/desks, peer over at my computer screen, waving at me, whistling at me, and making little ""yoohoo"" sounds -- I did what I could to look absolutely focused but ended up looking over at them, only for them to want to give me a cookie and chat about nothing in particular.

I understand that small conversations can be nice for others, maybe it's fulfilling, but they feel so strange to me.

At this point, I'm wearing a mask, earphones are in, fingers are typing away, eyes focused on my work, we're in an open cubicle setting so we can all see each other --  I shake my head at them and make my eyes smile a bit to decline as politely as I can, they both shrugged and continued talking amongst themselves.

Ten minutes later, I get a chat notification from one of them saying ""you feeling pensive today?""

I don't know what to think of anything at the moment. It feels like a small moment, but I've often felt overwhelmed by being wanted/needed/asked for. Even the fact that they followed up, I understand wanting to know if something is wrong but I just feel so watched all the time. 

Sometimes even with friends --- if I share something arbitrary, on insta or something, they'll jump on my message and send 10 messages in response, or someone else will go ask if we can go do something effective immediately because it's ""been so long"" when it's only been three days. I guess, sometimes I wish it was more normalized to have this space in a healthy way. The people I feel most comfortable with, give me the space and aren't overbearing when they do communicate. But with some friends, it feels like they won't ever be happy unless I cater to their needs because it's easier for me to overexert myself than it is for them to try and understand my comfort with space and quiet. 

I can't help the guilty feeling of using that word, ""overbearing"", because I know many people suffer from feeling like they're simply too much. But sometimes, people really are too much. I have summer seasonal depression as well, a season that's usually amped up on social activity. Recently, I've been feeling like people overtly try to cover up how uncomfortable they are with silence or the lack of interaction.

It doesn't help that I've also had a fight with a friend who preferred daily texts/interaction, and I told them it was overwhelming, that space is what's best for me but it doesn't make me care about them less --- it's just how I operate comfortably. But this space makes them deeply uncomfortable, they feel awkward, they're anxious, and I'm trying my best to talk about boundaries or by meeting their needs when I can I just feel so, so exhausted. I'm getting tired of trying.

I'm not sure if this is the right place to get this stuff off my chest, but if anyone reads this -- thanks for listening."
281,2,"Since middle school, while everyone started having their first ""girlfriends"", get more friends, and starting to actually be more mature and aware of how to behave around others, i would and i still do feel stuck, like i have a problem that nobody else has ever had to face, this weird anxiety. I struggle to understand its origin, sometimes I read online that it's because of some ""trauma"", or some past experience of mine, but I just can't figure it out. In the past few years It has gotten a little bit better, but sometimes it hits me, It takes away my sleep, I'm worried that I won't be able to get out of this constant fear, when I go out and I'm by myself I start slowly tearing, even though nothing is going on, it's a gut  feeling that I'm about to feel pressured by something, and when that thing (something simple as coming across someone, or even worse someone I like), I get super teary eyes, I start panicking because I can't see anything. All of this comes with being constantly worried about my posture, how I look, even what I'm looking at sometimes. I don't know what to do everyone treats me differently as if I was dumb or slow, like something is wrong with me, this is making me hate that period that was supposed to be the best years of my life. When people talk to me I don't know how to answer sometimes unless it's a fact, or it's some knowledge thing, I struggle so much to get my personal thoughts out that I just stay silent, and then, when I do get something out, there's always that dumbass that makes some joke about the fact that I never speak, and I don't know how to reply.

I know there is people who actually love me, but I can't be loved this way, I dont wanna be a pleaser, I don't want to be nobody's toy, I don't to be addressed as ""that guy"" because they can't remember my name even though we've been hanging out for the past 2 months, I can't accept the fact that people treat me like this and the fact that I look like this in public. And I know for sure that this isn't their fault, it's just me giving off that weird, awkward energy and I'm so sorry when people feel rejected because I don't know how to handle things, I just want to get out of this situation."

283,2,"Just had a phonecall with my niece who is 12 today to wish her a happy birthday. The call lasted a total of 48 seconds. Wish I talked more with her, but I really hate small talk even with children, and oftentimes dont even know what to say especially on the phone:/ Am I overthinking this?"
284,2,"Does this happen to anyone else? I’m 30 years old and have had social anxiety since I was a child. It got better in my early 20s, then got significantly worse during & after the pandemic lockdown (which happened when I was 24) and hasn’t ever returned to “normal”. 

I just had something awkward happen to me and was telling a friend about it, and I began to over-explain myself which made the anxiety worse. I now have the urge to harm myself, which I’m not going to do, but it’s a reaction that comes up frequently when things like this happen. Likely because it would be an outlet that would make the stress & discomfort feel more physical instead of  that intense internal feeling. 

Does anyone else here experience this? It makes life so hard. "
285,2,"This is not a rhetorical or humorous question. I’m genuinely confused about how people meet someone once or twice and somehow they become permanent fixtures in each other’s lives.

The other day I was at a store with my best friend (who is extremely extroverted). She ended up talking in depth to the clerk there and today she posted that they had gotten lunch and went shopping together. Keep in mind she only met this person two days ago randomly.

In comparison I have maybe four close friends most of whom I have known for 6+ months and still don’t feel fully comfortable around. How tf do people just connect with others? Is it just me who is somehow off putting and so nobody wants to connect with me?"
286,2,"hello,

i am hoping that this post will not be taken down for controversy, and that there will be some people who can understand and relate to my struggles. 

with the political climate of the world right now, i feel my heart becoming heavier. i feel so desperate to get out and protest and speak my mind for the things i care about, but my social anxiety makes it extremely difficult for me to go through with talking openly about what i believe in. i want to go out and protest, but there is a mental barrier blocking me from doing so. i feel like such a coward. and i know no actual activists would appreciate me sitting on my ass and doing nothing. the most i can do is repost things to my story, and donate to charities, but doing that alone doesn’t feel like enough at all. i want to do more than that and make an actual impact. but it just brings me so much genuine anxiety.

can anyone else relate? i’m sorry to bring politics here. i’m sure most people can insinuate what im talking about, but im trying to be as neutral as possible. if you want to talk more about what i mean, please dm request me. i’m afraid this post can get taken down. honestly making this post alone has given me a lot of anxiety."
287,2,"I'm realizing now that, I probably am autistic. I say probably because all of the symptoms I view, and the ones that probably apply to me, I can't see how they wouldn't apply to me having social anxiety under a different perspective.

Will i have an employee over my shoulder the whole time monitoring my mistakes? Do i have to constantly talk professionally and formally? Am i gonna have to mask for 4 hours straight without break???

Talking to people, finding friends, keeping the made friends. And I want it gone, I really just want to live a normal life, and not be scared to say ""thank you"" to the cashier in the store. Doing events with the friends that I still have. Plesa help me make my life normal. Even if it's just one conversation."
290,2,"Dude life with SA is hell, and I'm probably a natural introvert on top of that. There were several places I used to go to for solitude, and when I visit them today, it's like you blink and there's a bunch of people around. Is it too much to ask to have a bit of solitude? "
291,2,"ugh. i would love some advice on starting medication for anxiety. i’m feeling really stuck, and some stigmas surrounding medication have gotten the best of me and have made me feel so lost. i’m contributing to my own problem. i envy my old self for not experiencing these issues.

i think i’ve lost myself. i used to be such an outgoing, bubbly person, but in recent years (i’m 23f) my social anxiety has become debilitating — paired with ocd and constant health scare spirals that i KNOW are irrational. i’ve now been in therapy a while, and have made some lifestyle changes… but something is still off. i wish i knew how to find myself again, and maybe medication is the answer, but my anxiety is preventing me from even trying. some people are telling me that if i start medication that i’ll never be the same, and it makes me feel weak thinking i could be tethered to something for the rest of my life. then again, that might be a good thing.  


one of my concerns: i’m a performer, and I’m actively pursuing acting for my career — as i’ve done in college — but a part of me is nervous that if i start medication, it will affect my ability to be in touch with my emotions. i know this sounds stupid, but it is a genuine question i have. anyone else? 

another concern: i really don’t want my sex drive to be affected, and i also don’t want to gain weight. i keep hearing horror stories about side effects.

anyone have any advice? i know this is super individual. just feeling lost. i feel like i can’t be present for anything. </3"
292,2,"Hey. I’m F22… i’ve been working in this law firm for the last three years, and it’s been great, overall.

It is my first job, so i took it very seriously (maybe too seriously?) and i’m good at it. I like it.

Here’s the thing. Since i started working here, i’ve always had this moments… whenever i have to talk to one of my bosses (F34). i don’t know how to explain it, but i just feel WAY more nervous than i should be, even when the thing i need to tell her is not that important.

Every time i have to ask her something i don’t know about, or when i have to let her know about something related to the job, i get so anxious. It’s beyond me, and i feel so ridiculous. Sometimes my hands shakes right before doing it, sometimes my heart beats like if it’s gonna explode. I feel nervous, at unease, it’s truly overwhelming.

And the worst part is that i CAN identify that what i’m about to do is not risky, that is not as important as my brain thinks, yet i can’t get to calm my nerves. Sometimes, i avoid talking to her (face to face), because of that, and end up texting her about whatever i needed to talk about when i’m doing homeoffice (twice a week)

I’ve talked about this with my therapist, but her answer is always “you’re judging yourself too much, and that’s the problem”….. and i know she’s right. I know this probably comes from a place where i’m being too hard on myself, where i feel i CAN’T mess up, even if what’s going on is not as important, but it’s so fucking hard to control.

I genuinely don’t know what to do anymore. When i first started working, something similar happened to me but with phone calls, and now sometimes i get as anxious about that too, but i’ve done it a lot the past three years so the “fear” is less intense (it’s still there, though).

My therapist also suggested me to keep doing it (talking to her, answering phone calls) even if it makes me feel that way, like that’s the only way to overcome it.

And she’s probably right about that too, but again, i’ve been working here for THREE years, and i’ve talked with my boss more than once ofc, and this keeps happening.  Sometimes more, sometimes less. But it happens. And i can’t stop thinking about how she must think i’m stupid or something.

She’s a good boss, yk, like she is a figure of authority but she’s not too harsh, or mean, she never yells. she’s super CALM. It makes me feel more stupid, bc i literally have no reason to react this way.

My therapist never used the term “social anxiety”, i just think that’s what i have, bc i can’t find any other explanation."
293,2,Im 17 year old. I don't have anyone who I can talk to in person. I lost ability to meet new people due to my anxiety and soon i will lose all my friends and will be completely alone. It's unfair that others have no problem with that. I know I will not achieve anything in my life so it's just over for me and i'm just stuck in this stupid body. How I can live alone? How to cope with this? All i think about now is just killing myself. My dream is to be in first place at least once. Fuck everyone who has no problem like this.
294,2,"So, 99% of the time I have no issues with social anxiety. My job literally involves giving presentations day after day and answering unhappy people’s question (change management leader). I come across in my day-to-day life as calm, unflappable, witty.

Until it comes to anything related to LGBTQ+ settings. I am a gay man, and i actually cannot deal with the thoughts of these settings. I used to love them until about 18 months ago. To make a long story short, at one event last year I had a full on anxiety attack in the bathroom (foetal position on the floor for 20 minutes just trying to breathe and not pass out), and ran to my car. At pride a few weeks later, I drank alcohol to try to cope, but ended up binge drinking due to anxiety. This was my last event being at, a year ago. It triggered former ED and self harm behaviours last summer, but after 2 months of indulging these, I finally went back to therapy. It’s been long, but I really thought I was getting better.

My therapist and I decided that I should try something in this community again, so I’m doing an LGBTQ+ fun run this weekend. To try and set me up for it, I went to a normal fun run a few weeks ago in the same location, and really enjoyed it. However, it’s in 2 days, and it’s all I can think about. Anytime I visualise being there, surrounded by LGBTQ+ people, my mouth goes dry, my heart rate increases, and ,y breathing goes shallow. It’s not full on anxiety attack, but I’m in my apartment lying on my bed. I’m terrified about what could happen Friday. 

We picked this because there’s a run, so no real expectation to socialise. Also, there is no possible way I can turn to alcohol, because it’s in the middle of a park. I have a breathing app downloaded on my phone, and I carry a small rope around my wrist I can use to fidget with to distract myself. Any other tips for me? Or does it sound like it’s too soon and I should skip it? 

My therapist is away and we were both really happy with this decision when she left, but since Monday I’ve thought about it every second of every day. "
295,2,"So I walked in the backroom to see a box of pizza
I lk thought it was for everyone (idk why my mind instantly switched to that) and then my coworker (she's a b and has corporate on speed dial like-) walked in saying it's hers, and two other coworkers
And then I got anxious and now I feel as but like how tf was I supposed to know? Now I'm worried she'll report me for doing nothing (someone's gotten fired before by accidentally taking someone's jacket yea...-) "
296,2,"I genuinely don’t understand this.

Whenever I try to approach someone — especially girls — the responses are usually cold. Distant. Like I’ve crossed a line just by saying hello.

And I’m not trying to flirt, chase, or impress anyone. I just want to connect — genuinely connect — with the people around me. We’re all in the same class, the same college, the same time in life. Why pretend like we’re invisible to each other?

Sometimes when I talk to girls, their friends tease them or spread things, like “he was flirting with her” or “he approached her.”
Why is that seen as shameful?

When I bring this up with friends, they tell me I’m doing something wrong by even trying. Some say “Don’t talk to girls at all” or “You’re asking to get humiliated.” Others admit they’re scared to even try.
Why is fear or detachment normalized — but not kindness or openness?

I’ve even had moments where girls purposely left me on seen — not accidentally, but to make me feel awkward or unwanted.
Once, a girl even acted like she didn’t know my name — even though we’d spoken before. That one hit hard.
Why pretend like someone doesn’t exist? Why go out of your way to make them feel small?

And it makes me ask:

Why is it such a crime to try and talk to another human being?

Why do we treat friendliness like it’s weakness, or attention like it’s desperation?

Why do people run from connection, when it’s the one thing we all deeply want?


The truth is — we’re all going to die someday.
So why suppress this simple human joy of knowing each other, laughing together, being real?
Why act nonchalant, distant, or indifferent on purpose?
Why reject something that makes us feel alive, seen, and human?

I’m not angry. I’m just confused. I’m not looking for validation — I just want understanding.
Is it me?
Or is this just how things are now?

If you’ve ever felt this, or have any advice — especially from a girl’s perspective — I’d really like to hear your thoughts. I live in India."
297,2,"When I was a child, I didn't have to worry about that kind of thing. When I was a teenager, instead of celebrating with parties, I started going to restaurants with a few guests. The problem is now that I'm an adult, I usually prefer to spend my birthday with just my family. The last time I invited people from outside was two years ago. I invited 10 people and only 2 came. Most of them didn't even answer me or said they wouldn't come only at the time of the event. That made me feel ashamed, because I realized that now, even if I wanted to have some kind of event for my birthday, people simply don't even care to congratulate me.



Part of me thinks that I just want to celebrate my birthday with my family, the other part thinks that deep down I'm just embarrassed and afraid to admit that I don't have any friends, I only talk sometimes to two or three people and it's almost an act on my part, and I feel bad because I feel like I'm limiting myself because of my social anxiety, I hate events where I have to give attention to people or be the center of attention, but deep down I just want to be normal and be able to have a party like a normal person, without turning everything into a problem in my mind, to be happy without depending on others, but there's this part of me that seeks validation and that suffocates me, and I always feel lost on my birthday, could you tell me your experiences of how you celebrate your birthdays? I'd like to see if any ideas resonate with me.



The worst part is that I'm in a phase where everyone is moving on, except me. Everyone already has a partner or a career, and I'm stuck in time, sometimes I just want to meet a friend but then the person goes and brings their partner and it becomes kind of awkward, my social skills are garbage, my mentality is my greatest enemy, I am so tired of being a dumb, insecure, weak, lazy, negative coward.

"
298,2,"I don’t know if others feel this, but I get really tense or anxious when I’m around people who I *perceive* as better than me — especially in terms of looks, charisma, or how socially smart they are. Like, if I’m in a group and there’s this one guy who is really confident, charming, or just gives off that ""everyone likes him"" vibe, I kind of shut down. My thoughts get loud, I second-guess myself, and I just want to disappear.

I know this comes from comparing myself too much, but I can’t seem to control it. It’s affecting my self-worth and confidence in social settings.  
Has anyone felt this way before? If so, how did you overcome it or deal with it?

Thanks for reading."

300,2,"I’ve been depressed and anxious for some time now, but its gotten to the point where im withdrawing from my social life, dont leave the house unless i absolutely have to like for work or an errand ive put off for a month, and i ignore all my responsibilities until im forced to face them. For the past few weeks i have been constantly stressed and anxious but i’ve been able to maintain a facade so my coworkers and family dont question anything. I dont want to feel like this but i dont know where to begin, the idea of talking about any of this to my friends or family is terrifying to me, let alone a therapist or psychiatrist that would be a stranger to me. I dont even know if i would be able to get the words out properly if i had to say it out loud and not type it."
301,2,"I struggle with overthinking interactions, even online ones so I decided to post here as a challenge for myself. The next challenge would be to make a phone call to customer service just to ask some question. Wish me luck!

Update: I called paypal's customer service, I had technical issues with restoring password and procrastinated for years making this call. I still have the issue, but at least I made the call 😂

The next one for tomorrow could be going to kitchen when other housemate is already using it (I avoid other housemates if possible)"
302,2,"I'm always deeply impressed by people who are brave enough to correct other people. That terrifies me. I could never tell someone that whatever they just said was blatantly false cause what if they hate me for it???

 I also wish I could tell people when I disagree with them. Instead I sit there positively reinforcing all their (sometimes very dumb) opinions like I don't think the complete opposite.

Does anyone else just people please all day long out of fear people will judge, reject, or dislike you for not kissing their ass? I hate that I'm like this but I don't know how to stop caring I just don't want to cause conflict or make people hate me."
303,2,"I recently decided I wanted to wean off my medication and see how I feel without them. I’ve been on medication since high school (2013/14 ish). I’m on half my original dose but I’m feeling so irritable and angry. I haven’t had any real bad anxiety but I’m just so frustrated with my partner constantly. Is there an end to this or do I go back on my meds? I feel so conflicted on what I should do. I hate treating my partner the way I do while irritable, but the symptoms of the meds (brain fog, memory issues, heart palpitations) they were getting so bad… has this happened to anyone else? Does it get better?"
304,2,"Our offices are cubicles right next to each other. Sometimes it's very quiet. Other times it can be loud with people on teams or zoom meetings, or talking to each other in their cubicles. I try to ignore the noise, listen to music on my earbuds, and get on with my day. Today I was listening to a webinar and it was very loud around me with people talking. I could not hear the host of the webinar without turning my earbuds up higher than I usually have them.

I got up and went to my closest neighbor's cubicle and asked her to just keep it down a little. She was talking to a coworker (about work stuff) in her cubicle. I thought they became a lot quieter. A few minutes later, I messaged her thanks. 

After the webinar was over I said I was sorry if I acted like a b*tch asking them to keep it down. She said we are all going to have to get used to the noise. She said that because we have to be in the office 5 days a week starting next month. (RTO). I'm not looking forward to that because I struggle to focus with a lot of noise, and also there's not enough parking. 

AITA for asking coworkers to be quieter because I was listening to a webinar, even though they were talking about work? 

And does anyone have a recommendation for good noise canceling earbuds or headphones that are closer to $100 than $500. Thanks. "
305,2,And I can’t stop overthinking the interaction. It’s replayed over and over 100x and I’m sure I’ll be thinking about it for a week.

I get really anxious if I meet someone new. I cant have a dating life because I dont think no one really will like me, and the thought of having someone weirds me out. I am a Senior in college, but I dont know how ive managed to stay. I feel like I dont belong anywhere. I want to have a normal life. Rent my own place, have a good job, travel, date, make new friends. But it seems odd to me to have all that. I constantly think I'm not good enough for anything. That I cant have a good job because its me. I cant have a boyfriend because its me. Socialize with others because its me. Im tired of being alone and I want to have a normal life where I go out with friends, but the thought of it kind of scares me. I want to not be able to have my mentality anymore. I cant carry on a life of constantly feeling like this and see how it passes by. Going to therapy scares me too. I do not wish my mentality on anyone, it does not let you fully live. Its horrible."

Stuff like that makes me paranoid. This guy gets red in the face whenever he sees me and doesn't wave or anything. 

Anyone else have this issue? "
311,2,"I am a medical student but I have social anxiety. I can still talk to patients and everything but I’m nervous and I’m not overly gregarious with people I don’t know. I also struggle to form close friendships with others- all my friendships have been surface level. 

So when I started med school, I wanted to get better at socializing and make some friends. I also wanted to, of course,  get advice about med school from people who were in my shoes before. I’ve signed up for various mentorship programs where I’ve been assigned to either an upperclassman, resident, or physician for guidance. The thing is, I’ve essentially not been able to maintain a relationship with any of them after 2 years.

If one fell through I can take that as just incompatibility. But the fact that it’s happened 4 times makes me feel like I’m the problem. And it’s not like I’m forcing myself into these people’s lives or being pushy— they signed up to take in a 1st year as a mentee. I’m not overbearing either, I’m withdrawn at baseline but I remain friendly to people. 

They start well with me meeting them in real life and asking questions. I get their phone numbers/ emails and maybe reach out with a quick question about the curriculum or maybe some advice for medical specialties. I’d reach out every 2-3 months or so.  One even invited me to do research with her and another invited me to lunch at a restaurant. But eventually, they’d stop responding to me. Id try to text/ email again maybe a week later just in case they missed the first message only to be met with no response. At that point i don’t want to bother them anymore cause I don’t want to be annoying. 

I saw two of the students for the first time in real life after a year of not hearing from them. I did not want to approach them cause I figured that they did not want to talk to me. And they did not. 

Some of my other classmates periodically talk about their mentors and are still in contact with them in our 3rd year. And it’s depressing cause all I wanted was a relationship like that. 

So now im wondering what went wrong. I didn’t spam them with messages, I kept things professional, didn’t pry into their personal lives,  I’m not a mean person. People say that I’m too nice even. Why can’t I maintain relationships, even professional ones? "
312,2,What kind of places can I go? I have very few friends and they don’t like going out. What places can I go to meet people and what are your go to topics of conversation if you’re to introduce yourself in a conversation.

I wait at the bus-top with a homeless man, as the bus pulls up I wait for the homeless man to go first but he gestures me to go so i do and I stare at the little payment thing in the bus and i insert 1 dollar and walk away. LEAVING the ticket I'M supposed to take. I walk all the way to the back of the bus and sit. I notice the homeless man walking towards me near the back of the bus so I pretended to be on the phone. I notice hes closer and awkwardly look up and he hands me the ticket i left. I take it and say nothing. I also missed my stop. After that I didn't take the bus again. Instead I walked an hour to my destination and  hour back everyday. When I couldv'e just taken the bus and saved time. "
318,2,"27 years old and it feels worse than ever now that I’ve truly come to terms with my social anxiety. It’s everywhere. It’s all the time. I cannot switch it off. I’m comfortable and at ease when I’m alone. But as soon as at least one other person is in a position where I feel they could potentially “judge” me or form an opinion on what I say or do, I’m get anxious. I put barriers up to protect myself from potential judgment. Every single thing I say in front of someone, there’s that eye in the back of my mind watching to make sure I don’t say something stupid to bring judgment upon myself. Every action I take in front of someone, no matter the situation or act, there is a voice that questions how I’m coming across right now. It’s on all the time and there doesn’t feel like there’s any off switch. And I just don’t know how to turn it off because it makes me worry I’ll be like this forever and will never form a meaningful relationship with anyone. It makes me feel like I’ll never truly be myself, never truly say what I want to say or what needs to be said, never truly do what I want to do or do what needs to be done. I’ll be this clammed up shell of a human with some sort of protective barrier up at any given moment, to stop the truly horrific thing of looking stupid in front of somebody or a group of people encouraging judgement or negative perception of me as a human. 

It’s on 24/7, and there is no off switch. "
319,2,"Since I was very little I always felt like people didn't like me. Sure, there were times I've made people laugh or smile, I've even volunteered to help others in need with no questions asked. Hell, I've have a group of friends that have been there for me for almost 20 years. Yet, there has always been this dark feeling that no one *actually* likes me, finds me even remotely interesting, etc.

I overanalyze facial expressions, changes in moods and responses, which in turn makes me nervous and then I stumble on what I was going to say and I end up rambling or becoming awkward and making it worse. It always seems like I agitate others during conversations too, which leads me to not really speaking much at all and not really wanting to be there anymore. Or I lock up and go non verbal and panic when someone even asks me the simplest question. I've even caught people looking at me like I have 3 heads and it doesn't help whatsoever.

I've tried talking about different subjects and making sure I'm not going too off of the rails or anything, but I'm still having a hard time making new friends and new relationships. It's much harder now that I'm a single woman too, so not only do I feel like I can never make friends, I also feel like I can never love/find love again (it doesn't help that I got out of an abusive relationship recently either).

It honestly puts me into a deep depression, that I'll never be ""normal"", or have what everyone else has. Being invited out all the time, being romanced or hit on, having big celebrations where people know you or are happy to see you, those are things that I ***dream*** about, but I have a feeling that I'll never have that. I even get thoughts of s\*icide because I feel like I don't belong anywhere or that people are much better off without me. I'm currently in therapy, but it only does so much. 

Social anxiety has definitely ruined my life."
320,2,title says it all. I start a new job friday. wish me luck.
321,2,"I know I will have to face this and I am prepared to do so, just wonder if other people responding to this post, whatever it may be might make it easier for me. I don't think I have strong social anxiety, but some specific things really trigger it out of me.

I missed my last semesters redo oral presentation and have to redo it this semester by joining the people who are now having the same class which I had last semester. I will join them and redo my presentation there, the teacher already knows about it and all.

The thing is those students don't know me. So people who don't know me and who don't expect me will be there. I feel such a strong anxiety about people wondering who I am and I almost feel obliged to explain myself since I am not part of their class. It's not even the speaking in-front of the public that's the problem, the problem is this feeling that ""I am not supposed to be here"", ""They might wonder who I am"". I feel like I want everyone to know I am going to be there, so that no one is left wondering what I am doing there. If somehow everyone could know a student from a different class would show up then most of my anxiety would be gone. That's not possible tho.

I will surely try to arrive earlier so until the other students wait in-front of the classroom I can mention I will join them today. It's funny, how I have way less anxiety to tell them before the class that I will be joining them while them wondering who I am gives me immense anxiety. Thankfully it will be that classes first redo presentation so if I am lucky only 5 ish people will show up. I know I have to do it, so not like I will run and skip it, but it just feels so horrible.

I would also love if someone who has been in a similar situation (being with a group of people who know one another but not you). Otherwise any comment is welcome."
322,2,"Just went and returned some items on my own, and then went to the grocery store and saw some rainier cherries and got excited to see them so this woman asked what they were, and I chit chatted to her real quick about them.

323,2,"I had a dream last night.

I was back in college. Not as my present day self, but as my younger self. And I think it was one of my first days in that class or something.

I sat next to some new people. Two girls and a guy. And I started talking to them. And afterwards we walked to the train station together and I asked for their social media. With the plan to keep contact.

During the talks we had fun and laughed and stuff. And I felt no fear whatsoever. It was actually pleasant to talk to and hang out with them.

It reminds me of what things were like before I had social anxiety. Back then it always felt like that.

Usually I don't care that much about having friends. It's never something I've really cared that much about, and in fact sometimes I think it can be kind of a bother. But I have to admit, having had that dream, I wish that could be reality again.

And it used to be, you know. In high school I had a friend group like that. When I first went to college I started making one before I suddenly stopped going to classes due to my anxiety spiking.

325,2,"I'm an international student in Germany and I've been jobless for months. Emails and online applications are not working in my favour. One thing I've been putting off because of my anxiety is walking into a store and asking if they're hiring.

How do I do that? I'm literally panicking at the thought of doing such thing. I literally want to cry but I need money and need to support myself and my education here. 

What's worse is the fact that I have to deal with language barrier. I can speak broken German to an extent but I'm so scared of embarrassing myself and not being able to understand what the other person is saying. I don't know what to do anymore.

Can someone please give me tips on how to walk into stores and ask for a job, please. "
326,2,"Does anyone else feel this way? 

Software engineer here. Been at this company for 3 months now. Have to go to office 5 days a week. I feel like everyone hates me and gives me the looks. At first I thought its because I'm new but they're being very nice with the newer interns who joined weeks ago. Admittedly , the interns are extremely socially active. 
Also , the work! I feel like Im deliberately assigned less work compared to others and no opportunities for collaboration.
There's so much I still dont know about work so I dont speak up during meetings , in rare cases that I do , its always because of lack of context and I just need to learn more. But somehow the interns seem to have more knowledge? tf???
I constantly feel like they've all already decided to kick me out and just waiting for the right replacement.
How do I stop feeling like this? 
Also, sorry just wanted to vent this out somewhere. Don't really have any other place to do so 😅

327,2,"How do you guys deal with social anxiety or low self esteem when you’re out?

I realized lately that my parents (especially my dad) messed with our confidence growing up, always watching, correcting, obsessed with how me and my brothers talk (BTW, my brother is even worse), our tone, what we say. He cares a lot about people's opinions, for example, he comments on stuff like my haircut (bald) in front of everyone, saying that I did it by mistake while trying to shave on my own, literally everything I do or say, he starts explaining to people why and what thinking that they might get a negative option on me.

The result? My self esteem and mood swing constantly. I’ll feel confident one hour, then suddenly drained or wanting to hide. I overthink simple stuff like going shopping or meeting friends. Even when I go out, I’m good for like an hour, then just wanna dip and be alone, sometimes I don't even go out because I just want to stay home. Not depressed, just need a lot of solo time to recharge. And if I plan something for later, I’ll feel fine at first, then when the time comes I cancel and stay home.

What can I do to increase my self esteem and confidence all the time?"
328,2,"If I’m having a one on one conversation with someone, I speak so low because I don’t want any surrounding people to hear.

329,2,"Here is a story of social anxiety in the workplace. For context, I am an average-looking, middle-aged white female. I am married with two kids. I do not take medication for anxiety, although I sometimes manage it with CBD. 

I recently came home from a ten-day on-site work project that takes place in a convention center in a midsized American city. Thousands of people participate in this work event every year; they come from many walks of life, different ages, ethnicities, regions, etc. A day in this temporary workspace is highly structured. From eight to five, thousands of people are working at their computers, which are arranged in tables of six to twelve, and those tables are grouped in task-oriented divisions of dozens to hundreds, with multiple task groups in one of several cavernous quasi-industrial spaces lit by stadium-powered LED lamps. All day long, each person works at their given task, side by side with some people, within sightline of others, earshot of more. At ten AM, everyone rises from their desk and the crowd flows out into one of a few broad corridors where there are snacks and beverages. After fifteen minutes, they return to their desks and resume work. At around noon, everyone makes their way to a cafeteria, grabs a tray and serves themselves a buffet lunch, sits down in a group or by themselves, eats and/or socializes for an hour, then back to the task, and later another break, then more of the same work until five. 

It's a workplace that's basically structured like a staggeringly over-scaled high school. It's not for everyone, and people who are prone to any kind of social anxiety might find aspects of it challenging. But people are generally copacetic and upbeat, and there’s a freedom to the lack of baggage that can lead to very interesting conversations. When all is said and done, it's a gig with clear boundaries that offers subsidized travel, and the pay isn’t bad.

One thing I know we all love is the kind of encounter where you have to walk through a space while people are walking towards you, and you have to decide with each passing person whether or not it's suitable to make eye contact, whether to nod or say a greeting, whether to smile or check internally to make sure that your face remains in a positive-neutral-relaxed position. In this workplace, you have to do this over and over again at regular intervals all day long. This could easily degenerate into constantly assessing your acquaintanceships with people you have previoiusly eaten lunch with, worked at a table with, had drinks with at a reception, etc. Due to the way the projects are set up, you find yourself crossing paths with a lot of the same people, over and over again, each day. 

This was my fourth year participating in this project. After your first year, you start to get to know some of the people who work in your area, in the uniquely limited ways that you can become familiar with people who basically have only this job in common. Most work in related fields, but again, they're coming from all over the place, and people mainly leave their home lives at home. This workplace exists only briefly on an annual interval, and lots of people only do the job once, but certain social networks arise. 

Around three days into the job, I noticed that certain members of the leadership in my area, and people in their general social circle, were...looking at me funny. It's a weird thing to verbalize noticing this, and at first I thought I was just being overly sensitive. The first time I clocked it, it was a person rather high up in the company making this face at me while we were in line at a dinner event. She's a fun, outspoken person, and in the moment, I thought she was just being spontaneously shitty by mocking the polite smile I smiled at her since I didn't have anything clever to say about the salad we were both reaching for. In that particular crowded venue, at her table was an individual I'll call J, and maybe eight other relatively-higher-level people who work in the same project.

By the time I got back to my room that night, three other people from that table had made that face at me as I passed them in various places. As the days went on, I noticed that other people in that group were making the face in increasingly exaggerated ways. While in an elevator, one of the people doing this happened to be in front of me, and I saw him stop a mutual acquaintance who looked like he was turning to talk to me while we waited to reach our floors. Instead of saying anything, he turned to me and made that face too. Both of these guys generally socialized with J. I came to notice that several of the women in J's social circle were not making that particular face at me, but rather seemed to be looking at me with some thing like curious pity when I would pass them. We'd nod or say hi, but they definitely looked like something was off.

Flashback: Three years ago, J was the person who trained me on that job, and monitored my performance with ongoing feedback. This was a stressful process for me, and throughout the days of that session, I was often consciously managing anxiety attacks of varying intensity. Part of the anxiety was knowing that J was keeping an eye on me, as he was everyone else at the table; that was his job. I quickly realized I was fighting the physical aspects of an anxiety attack just about every time we made eye contact. I started managing the anxiety by drawing parallel lines on a post-it pad; the focus of the action helped me regulate, and in a matter of less than a minute I'd be back on task. J is a perfectly nice person, affable and charming, and never did anything to draw attention to my anxiety. 

Next flashback: Two years ago, I was assigned to a different but related task where my workstation was in the neighborhood of J's. I realized that casual interactions with J had continued to create that anxiety response, even though I didn't work with him anymore. I started avoiding him, and when we would pass by in the course of the day, I guess I would either avoid eye contact, or give a sort of closed-mouth, eyebrow-raised nod. At one point, I actually stopped him and apologized for what must have seemed like not being very nice. He was totally cool about it and said he hadn't noticed anything, it was fine. We didn't talk again. 

The next time I saw him was at the beginning of this year's job. I was in a group meeting in a hallway-lounge area when he passed by. As he approached, and we made eye contact, he gave me a distinct look. If that look could be translated into words, it would be: Stay the fuck away from me. I had not seen that expression on his face before; again, he's typically a very easy going, friendly person. The face made my stomach drop. I hadn't expected to be working with him again, since each project is large and people are typically rotated through various projects within the area. I quickly realized that we had been set up at workstations about twelve feet apart from each other. What are the odds, right?

J worked with his back to me when he wasn't walking around to work with his team, and throughout the day, when he needed to discuss things with the leaders in our area, or to leave the room for any other reason, he would pass directly in front of me. I tried to avoid eye contact, and it helped that the glasses I wear at the computer limit my focal range so I can't quite make out facial expressions at a distance of more than twenty feet or so. I tried to just focus on the work, which often involved casual discussion with other people at my table. I did the job, and it was fine. I filled up about a single post-it a day with parallel lines.  I structured my break time and lunch routines to minimize the likelihood of running into him. If I had been a little more aware of what was going on, I think a wide-brimmed hat might have solved some problems. It was inevitable that I would keep passing by this guy multiple times a day and have to do something with my face. I didn’t come up with a conscious strategy, but he did not seem to want to chat, so I did my best to facially project something like “ha ha, it’s OK, this is me leaving you alone!” which I guess looked something like a little closed-mouth smile with raised eyebrows. 

And yes, within a few days, people in J’s circle were making parodies of that face back at me when I would pass them in the building. It was so weirdly aggressive, and so clearly deliberate, that I was at a total loss for how to respond. Otherwise, I talked with other people on the job a perfectly normal amount, and met a lot of really interesting people. I actually had a pretty good time, aside from this nonsense. But this nonsense, I have to tell you, really, really hurt. I hadn’t wanted to be a pain in the ass to anybody. I had received a distinct nonverbal message that I was not welcome, but I could only fuck off so far; I was there to work, like everybody else. 

I don’t know what J told people. I barely know the guy and I don’t know what he is going through in his life. I just know that he didn’t tell me anything; he did not speak to me at all. When we got to the final break time of the last day, I happened to pass him in a hallway. He wasn’t with anyone else, we were face to face, and without having figured out anything to say in advance, this time, I stopped him. As cheerfully and casually as I could, I said something like, “Hey, J, you think you can go the entire job without saying a single word to me? How have you been?” and he kind of laughed and said something like “Oh hey, how are you? How are things in (city where I’m from)?” And I’m looking at his face and seeing this rapid storm of inscrutable micro-expressions, none of which looks anything like it’s moving in the direction of an explanation or an apology. The eyes were saying something more like: what is the crazy bitch going to do?  So there was this silent beat. And I said, “Well, all right, that’s enough.” And I walked outside and across the street and got my coffee. And we went back to our desks and worked another two hours, and the job was over.

I didn’t go to the job closing reception that night, or the after-party, as I hadn’t gone to any of the project’s receptions or meetups since the weirdness had started. I wanted J to know that I wasn’t planning to come back to the on-site job next year, so I caught up with one of our mutual acquaintances as we were walking back to our hotel. I told her that people seemed to have been talking about me, and the way she seemed completely unsurprised told me that what I told her would make it back to J pretty quickly. She has been angling for a higher role in our area. I told her I was switching back to remote work going forward. I also told her this story:

I have a friend who made her career in fairly high-level corporate psychology. One time I was telling her about a problem I was having with a job. She told me: In the workplace, we are not ourselves. We are the roles that we shape ourselves into. Conflicts arise because inside, we’re still ourselves, and the roles we’re working in sometimes just don’t fit right. We want to be ourselves, but the role prevails.

What I hope she understood, and passed on, was that we had been working in a job where all day, fully grown adults were going through actions that structurally mirror a day of high school. So I guess this kind of thing was likely to happen. It did surprise me, though, and I’m still processing it.

My next door neighbor is very a charming guy but also very shy/introspective. We had a chat a few times many years ago, nowadays we mostly exchange “hi’s” when we bump into each other on the street or when we share the elevator. I’ve always had a crush on him, but for obvious reasons I never went after it. He never said anything either, so I have no idea if he’s into me or not. 

I’m just entertaining the idea for now, but I’d like the shy dudes from this sub to help me out: how can I hit on this guy without being too invasive? I mostly see him on the elevator, and kind of rarely…even though he lives right next to me.

332,2,"When I talk about this with my friends (they all live in other states), they make it sound like I'm an alien, but I know I'm in the right this time. I haven't been diagnosed with social anxiety or anything, but I'm sure I have some mild form of it, and I know you folks will understand where I'm coming from.

I'm in my early 30s. I live alone in a house that the owner converted into two apartments, and some time ago the neighbor couple in the other apartment were having some friends over and invited me. I didn't go. Later on, I tried to invite them to hang out just the 3 of us and get to know each other better. It would still be an uncomfortable situation, but plenty doable. Never really got a ""yes"" though and nothing came out of it.

My friends act like it's no big deal and I should have done it and I'm making it weird and it might even be easier when there's more people. But as far as I'm concerned, they might as well be speaking Greek.

I think I'll try once again to invite them out for brunch or whatever over the weekend, but I stand by my decision of refusing to be thrown to the wolves like that. Thoughts? Am I in the wrong here?"
333,2,"I was flying back home yesterday, and I was sitting in the window seat. It was a 5 hour flight, I went up to pee \~2 hours in. Then, around \~1.5 hours away from landing, I really had to pee that I was at the point of discomfort. The two people (in the aisle and middle seat) were both fast asleep with their eye masks on. So I decided to hold it in for the rest of the flight and ran to the bathroom as fast as I could after 😂. Just curious to hear what people's etiquette around this is? If you are sitting aisle or middle seat, do you get annoyed if the window seat person wakes you up to pee?"

When meeting new people online the biggest complaint I get is that I take too long to text back, and this is because I avoid it. My brain is so busy thinking about how to respond, how I can seem normal and not awkward, what if I’m responding too fast? What if the other person won’t know how to respond to what I say? What if I’m boring? It’s so overwhelming I just put it off until it’s too late. Then I feel WORSE because the other person is definitely fed up. I don’t know how to overcome this, I could be nauseous the entire day during texting and when I haven’t responded yet. It’s seriously ruining me, I prefer being left alone but if I do that then I won’t ever be able to improve. :T

336,2,"I’ve struggled with social anxiety since I was about 12. I used to be a very outgoing child, but got beat down a lot for my personality. When I began middle school, I tried taking a quieter approach to make people like me but it hasn’t worked out and I developed some severe anxiety in social situations. I’m now 18, i graduated last year from high school. I never really had any friends throughout high school to begin with, the ones i once had were pretty shitty and we naturally drifted apart. I thought my life would be so much better once i graduated, but it’s almost been even worse since. 

I have no job, no friends in my area (only a couple long distance, but they’re busy, outgoing people and we mostly just send videos to each other). i just finished a certificate and wont be going back to school until fall of 2026. My life has been controlled by this awful anxiety and i barely even leave my house these days because of it. I want a job, friends, to do things and live my life but it just feels like too much to handle. Every person i have tried connecting with IRL just stopped responding to me or distanced themselves from me and i don’t know why, i guess I’m just always doing/saying the wrong thing maybe. But it’s just discouraged me from trying at all anymore and i don’t know where to go from here so it’s just getting worse with each day that i waste away doing nothing. 

I don’t know how to beat this, it feels near impossible at this point to be honest. "
337,2,"I am currently in an online college class for the summer to catch up on credits. I never really speak in chat because I am too anxious. Today, the teacher asked our class what retail jobs we had worked and I decided to respond, since I have a lot to say about the retail job I have worked. About 6 people out of 20 responded, and she carefully talked to every person that responded in chat for about 3 minutes each. She then said ""let me make sure I didn't miss anyone's message"" then scrolled right past mine, and talked to the person that responded before me (my message was literally right below his idk how she could've missed it.) 

This whole situation reiterates my belief that there's something inherently wrong with me, and that's why people ignored me. Even in a situation where my message was just saying what retail job I had (and no one unmuted their mics, they just typed what retail jobs they had,) I was STILL ignored. Maybe my message or the place I worked wasn't interesting enough to be worthy of a response? Maybe she doesn't like my name? I'm not really sure and now I'm going to be thinking about it for days about what is wrong with me that I am the only one who got ignored."

She kept going on saying ""what kind of shit is that,""  ""what if that was my mother"" and ""ridiculous.""

I feel like I'm exaggerating cause now I’m crying, have a headache, and don’t even feel like eating the food I bought on my way there. Im really embarrassed, like I looked rude to everyone on the bus even though I didn’t mean to be. Like if I seen her I would've let her go before me and of course my mind constantly made up different responses, which I definitely wouldnt have the guts to say, of course AFTER it happened.

342,2,"Feel like a complete utter failure. I have such a hard time with acting normal and talking with people. I swear every workplace I've been at everyone thought I was weird and really stupid. Like I'm not exaggerating when I say a lot of people would assume I'm mentally slow with how much I struggle with it, not to mention it takes me an extra second to understand things sometimes. 

I'm 26 and keep getting stuck in these customer service jobs that are ruining me. I feel like after every shift in coming apart at the seams and often cry for hours in my car after. I'm way too old to still be struggling like this. Maybe it's just the industry since I work in a hotel and you have to be extra friendly and approachable. But now I'm stuck and desperate to stay. I've legit been desperately searching for anything else for the past year and nothing. 

I'm so tired of everyone talking behind my back and treating me like a kid or like I'm mentally slow. I hate it. I hate how no one respects me even though when it comes to things outside of talking I'm a lot better than those around me. I just wish I could be normal.

343,2,"I graduated in 2017, but i’m just reminiscing on how i would skip lunch and go to the library to sit alone. i didn’t even attempt to join groups or make friends, i just preemptively isolated myself — assuming that everyone would hate me anyway. Luckily I found friend groups during the last 2 years. but still a huge chunk of high school was just pure isolation. 

I’d look around in the library to see who else was alone, and it was always just me. At both my old school and new school, always just me without anyone. It’s surprising to think about, you’d think there be at least a few other loners.. but no. 

Though I’m eternally grateful for the few people who did want to befriend me in the end. We’d be silly, hold hands in the hallways, I loved them. 

I’m 26 now and it’s still the same, always alone and again with no one. but at least i’m somewhat happier now than i was then!"
344,2,"I just wanna point out something obvious that may not be so obvious to y'all coming in here.

Social anxiety isn't something that is unsolvable or a mystery. Someone saying ""oh I in fact feel anxiety around people that I feel are better than me, does anyone else do the same?"", that is not a grand mystery, that is just someone on level 1 sharing their experience. It's not a verdict on how far you can go. For some reason I thought it was. I visited this community regularly and I thought it was hopeless because all these people had these problems and they shared it and no one had the solution.

But here's the thing. When you go to therapy, for example, what happens there, is you bring that up, ""I feel anxiety around others who I perceive as better than"", and you learn that that is an entire mode of being or relating to others that can be deconstructed, and that it takes years of consistent effort to stop thinking in such a way, and in fact to do anything major like stopping doing something entirely.

And another thing you get in therapy is a completely different way of looking at things. Right here it's very much murky, hopeless, vague. But in therapy you have someone who knows stuff, knows the problem and knows the way out. So they're like, social anxiety is this, and you overcome it by doing this. It's precise. Even with exposure, you can very easily misunderstand what exactly to do or fall into certain wounding that prevents it from working. I'm not saying that therapy will fix that or uncover those layers, in fact, the biggest help for me has been introspection with journaling. But it helps to have a relational aspect."

347,2,"I feel that way right now, I've been staying at home for many days and I had planned to go out in the city but something is blocking me, like I'm afraid of meeting people and being observed in public, so just thinking about it makes me socially tired. People don't understand me but having to be careful about my behavior, my facial expressions, pretending to be calm while walking down the street, showing all that to people is just tiring. Also, I'm always afraid that something will happen to me, that I'll be attacked, because where I live there's street harassment against women sometimes, and more and more crazy people in the street."
348,2,"I just want to stop living and cease to exist. Everyone who I know has friends, has good social life when I can't even walk on street without being stressed and there is no way to fix it. Why me? Why I must go through this hell? I just want to fucking die."
349,2,"I just need to vent right now, I'm feeling an immense amount of shame and it's extremely overwhelming. 

Too many fucking times when I'm around new-ish people and actually do/say something instead of just silently existing, it goes bad. Now I've had two of these intances over the past week and combined with an intense lack of sleep, I'm just in a really bad place mentally. 

I've embarrassed myself but because of my social anxiety, I have no one irl to talk to. I'm sure it'd be fine eventually if I could just co regulate, have someone tell me what I did wasn't that bad or laugh at it together but now I'm just sitting here, ruminating and feeling humiliated. I have a lot of time for that, too because I don't have a job either due to my social anxiety and have been fired before for my anxiety induced bad performance. I desperately need to feel like a part of this society somehow but I'm reduced to being an alien bystander. 

Therapy has helped me work on some things but the social issue (social anxiety AND disorganized attachment, meaning even when I get close to someone, it's hard for me) is the one thing that won't budge, no matter what. 

I hope it's okay to just vent here as I'm sure no one really has advice for this instead of trying to let it go."
350,2,"Exposure therapy is not doing well in a social interaction. It just means surviving and lessening the fear response next time. If you are tense you will most likely be rejected. And you are tense because of that. No matter what you do you'll be rejected or perceive rejection, most likely. So the point is to ease that tension aka fear for next time by doing something while under the influence of that fear, saying something out of your comfort zone. And it will sound weird, partially because you're scared, partially because you don't have the social skills. People will respond weirdly, probably. The point is to survive that and feel less fear the next time. Only when you are not tense can you begin to flow and learn social skills. So there's two distinct components to social growth. One, exposure. Two, building social skills."

During the pandemic, she told me that her phone had broken and she couldn't afford a new one. I asked if she could borrow money from her family, but she couldn't, and so I offered to lend her some money - she asked for £650.

This was 4 years ago, and to date she has only paid back £100. She brought the subject up about a year ago, saying how guilty she felt, and that she would pay me back some more once she received her bonus the following month, but she never mentioned it again.

A few times, I told her if she couldn't afford to pay me back, I could write it off. I didn't really want to, but at least it gave me the feeling that it would be my decision to forgive the loan, rather than her decision to 'steal' the money from me.

The thing is, I know she has the money. She's on first-name terms with the local baristas, and smokes regularly. She even showed off a new tattoo to me (I remember thinking at the time that she should be thanking me for paying for it).

Over the past few years, we have been messaging each other less & less frequently. We meet every so often for a catch-up, but I've kind of lost interest in doing this. I noticed that, whenever it was her turn to pay, we went for a coffee, and when it was my turn, she suggested a meal somewhere. I feel this is deliberate - she can't honestly be doing this subconsciously.

My social anxiety prevents me from asking for the money back - crazy, I know, but I don't want to embarrass her by asking(!)

Over the years, she has been a good friend, and hasn't previously put a foot strong, but I now feel like an idiot. I think I'm being completely disrespected.

I was always aware of the saying, 'Never lend more than you can borrow,' and 'Dont lend to friends,' but I never thought she would do this to me. Some might say this is my fault, but it's really not.

Has anyone else been in a similar position? And if so, how did you deal with it?

Any advice would be appreciated 😊"
354,2,"Before I tell you this I need to say that in my early Secondary years I made a name for myself as being a bit weird and I posted loads of embarrassing videos on my YouTube channel which people made fun of me for and I still get some people talking to me about it after a few years but I have good friends who I can easily socialise with.

I'm in 4th year in Secondary school so I'm 15 and I have a French class with people in my year who I know but am not friends with, I find it so hard to talk to them because I just don't know what to say.

However, whenever I am somewhere new I'm one of the most outgoing people you'll ever meet whether it's the next town over to me or going to Spain on holiday.

Why is it so easy to socialise with people that don't know me and how can I get better at socialising with the people in my French class? Can any expert or non-expert who has been through school tell me why?"
355,2,"17M. Recently from last 3-4 years I'm living alone. Thinking about approaching to lot of girls to open up. I don't wanna live my life in four walls. I know one thing - respect them no matter what they say. 

Does anyone have experience or suggestion how can I approach to girls 
What should I say? 

If you're in their position what you expect from a guy to say or how he should be approaching to you? "
356,2,"So I have really bad social anxiety. I’ve been out of public school for almost five years, and I’ve been diagnosed with GAD, autism, and OCD. I turn 18 in a year, and my parents keep telling me I need to get a job soon - but the thought of that honestly stresses me out because it feels almost impossible right now.
My OCD makes things even harder. One of my biggest struggles is feeling “contaminated” or dirty whenever I leave the house, which makes being outside extremely uncomfortable.
Does anyone know of any good job options for someone like me—low on social interaction, flexible hours, and willing to hire someone who’s 16 (almost 17)? (This is the sarasota FL area, so if u know any specific small business there let me know)."
357,2,"I feel like I've taken to [dissociating](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/dissociation-and-dissociative-disorders/about-dissociation/) a little bit in some social situations.

Like today a stranger had to come over to my house for some government stuff. And at one point I was standing there and feeling very disconnected from the situation and myself. Like I was just watching something unfold rather than being part of it (even though I was).

I experienced this the last time the person came over as well. Although it was worse that time. To the point where afterwards it felt like I had literally dreamed that it had happened, even though I knew it really happened.

I've had social anxiety for a long time, but I actually haven't experienced this that often due to it.

Have some of you?"
358,2,"Hi , I won’t give details but brief summary or whatever 

You see my social anxiety started when I was very young from kindergarten. I remember when I was in my old school from kindergarten to 6th grade no one liked me including the teachers, no student wanted to sit next to me cause I was not good in studies at all and in that school only good grades and behavior matters, i still remember in kindergarten I did some mistake in the paper the teacher gave me she was walking around and saw my work and pinched me from behind I almost cried. But thats not the only thing , I have heard that for a child to gain confidence it starts from family gatherings, my family had gatherings but I rarely attended cause of some problems… I’m stressing out right now cause few wants me to make friends within a set of time stress me out and can’t focus on studying because of that stress cause of my social anxiety, yes I have trauma slightly overwhelming…during vacation I have been told to make friends but I’m scared of my social anxiety…I’m still thinking of ways to avoid it…thinking to learn crochet cause I like it but only if I get to …that’s it I guess..


You can give me advice I am not sure if I will be use them…"
359,2,"22F here. Basically what the title says. Every mental health professional has advised me to challenge my thoughts by building positive experiences. But even if I do have successful interactions, my anxiety returns. This has happened every single time. It doesn't matter how much exposure I do, it's almost like my brain's natural reaction to a social situation is terrible anxiety. Has anyone else gone through this? And if so, has anything helped you to overcome social anxiety?"
360,2,Not even my parents know about much of my intrests
361,2,"I am naturally a quiet and introverted person, and on top of this and the social anxiety, I'm also autistic, which makes it hard for me to read other people's opinions towards me.

Having watched other people's interactions, coupled with working in retail, means I can make a good first impression: I'm polite, I ask questions to get to know each other, and the other person will often reciprocate and invite me to tag along to things with them and stuff. The problem is, I can easily make acquaintances but I can't make friends.

At some point, my social anxiety gets the better of me - I hate myself so much that I'm afraid that once people truly get to know me they'll find my personality repulsive and they'll pull away. As a result, I become more reclusive and I don't involve myself in conversation as much or invite people to do things with me because I get so self conscious. 

On top of that, I struggle to interpret whether people like me or not and my anxiety leads me often to believe that they don't, even when they had always been warm and friendly beforehand. 

For example, I'm currently away abroad where I'm staying with lots of new people around my age, and while at first I settled in really well and got to know people, now I feel horribly self conscious and I'm speaking less to people I was getting on really well with last week.

Basically, I don't know how to get past myself and my own belief that people will dislike the ""real me"", but it's so isolating and it makes me hate myself even more.

If anyone has any advice I would appreciate it so much, because I'm not sure what to do."
362,2,"For years, I thought my social anxiety was limited to in-person interactions. But lately, I’m realizing it’s affecting how I engage online too. I joined a group I genuinely like—a space I want to belong to—but I keep feeling like my words and intentions are being misinterpreted. I find myself weighing every sentence before hitting send, sometimes even asking ChatGPT to review my messages. I mask my truth behind palatable phrasing. I apologise constantly—both online and in real life—for existing, for speaking, for taking up space. I shrink myself when others misunderstand me. How do I stop doing that?"
363,2,"This is something that I tend to experience in social situations that I've never came across other people mentioning. It's a physical feeling where head movement feels snappy and robotic, as if my neck was replaced by a set of cogs that can only be rotated in increments if that makes sense. The effect is more apparent the wider the angle I need to turn my head. For example if I'm sitting at a public space and looking to the right, if suddenly a bunch of people came from that direction (a bus stopped for example), trying to turn my head back to look left feels weirdly difficult and very snappy.

Is that a common thing in people with social anxiety? Is it actually a physical thing or just something inside of my head?"
364,2,"said something stupid and now I wanna dig a hole for myself, the feeling is not going away, i'm sweating and every second they're not replying back I unalive a little more inside"
365,2,"[vent post]

there's this presentation for my finals, it's five minutes in english [not my native language]. im feeling much, much too insecure for this. my speech is difficult since im barely speaking and ive been horribly afraid since my teacher tore my presentation apart, last semester. my suicide attempt didn't work and im too afraid to try another time. 

it's exhausting.

im tired of doing everything scared. im so tired. "
366,2,"So basically I just installed TikTok kind of accidentally recently, I wasn't really sure what's really going there before because I thought back then TikTok was too much for me.
Until I stumbled upon the Live platform, there is a lot kind of live they do there like gaming, chatting or people that doing ""weird thing"" for gifts

The one that interested me was the  English speaking practice live (fyi English is not my first language) which anyone could join by request to the host, so yeah I brace myself by clicking request to join and speaking to random people while practicing my english

the people there are kind and willingly to listen but I still somewhat find it hard to just speak like my mind goes blank when it's  my time to speak :"" also i'm more  comfortable when it just like 2-4 people in live room cause there's always more people joining later and I feel like I got sided when more people joined can't keep the Convo

overall I think this is a good step to more open although I'm still figuring it out how to speak more freely without feel anxious and stutter 

"
367,2,"And that's be biggest problem we face getting our mental health in check with social anxiety, these people are no replacements for close friends, they are just doing their job and unless they have lived experience, their answers are probably just what's in a textbook.  Not discouraging people to seek help, but that's personally how I feel, I think most of us would benefit more from a few understanding close friends than we would all these medical solutions"
368,2,So I was going to ask my bf sister in law to hangout. We’re around the same age. My bf and I have been dating for about 6 months. I was going to say “Oh okay. I was just wondering if you’d wanna come over and hangout. I’m going thru old clothes and was wondering if maybe you’d want some”. I know I’m making a bigger deal about this than I should but I can’t help but overthink it. It would be our first time hanging out. 
369,2,"I hear a lot of people say the only way to cure social anxiety is to be social. I totally agree with it. BUT, how do you cure social anxiety as an introvert? I have social anxiety but I also enjoy being alone and not engaging in small talk for the most part. 

How am I to work through being thrown off by social situations if I can barely stand being social? It’s like being stuck in an endless loop unless you’re willing to completely change who you are for the sake of being cured. "
370,2,"My (24f) boyfriend is a groomsman in his close friend’s wedding, which is coming up soon. I’m going as his date and I really don’t know anybody there. I know that he is going to be with the wedding party for much of the time and I will probably have to hold my own.
I have pretty bad social anxiety and fears of being socially inept (although I have never had a problem keeping friends and dating, I’m just very fearful of social situations. i know it’s a distortion but it feels real). 
Does anyone have any advice on enduring an event like this as someone with social anxiety? 

Especially because I won’t be able to be with the one person I know and feel comfortable with. I want to talk to people but I don’t know how to start sometimes, and after a while i feel drained from how much effort I’m putting into monitoring my own behavior.
"
371,2,"I’ve already made like, 2 posts on this topic (I don’t really post on reddit unless I really need something) over a span of like two years (on another account, this is a throwaway) so the fact that I’m making another one because the issue still eats me up feels depressing 

For years now, ever since I was probably 12 I’ve had an issue where I just stare at people and its not glancing or anything, it’s genuinely just prolonged stares with me not saying anything and I would do this to a single person multiple times. Maybe once would be okay, but a lot of it becomes an issue on the fact that I do it repeatedly. It usually starts out with me zoning out, me looking behind or to the side of someone and they think I’m looking at them, me being confused and looking around thinking something is going on with them, me just being curious and thinking I won’t get caught staring, and so on. 

After that I get anxious and start trying to play off the staring by looking in their direction again to be like “Im doing my own thing/I’m looking at something else” but the result is usually still them looking at me like I’m staring. But what happens is a lot of the time is that I get super unlucky for some reason and I get into scenarios where coincidentally, I’ll end up staring again or get close by to them, like sitting or walking directly next to them. Like, I’ll be checking because they’re somewhere I was going to go and they turn around at the same time and make eye contact so it looks like I’ve been staring, and I don’t look away when this happens because my reaction times are so slow. Or maybe I’ll be walking in their direction and I zone out again. This happens over and over again. 

This would usually happen at school for me. A lot of the time it’s at guys, and I’m a girl so that makes matters worse. I’ve ruined a lot of potential friendships with guys because of it, like they would be friendly with me before but then I stare and they avoid me, don’t try speaking to me/become less friendly 

Every time I talk about it on here or reddit, I think people don’t understand the gravity of what I’m saying, maybe I’m not being descriptive enough. I’m usually told that I’m overthinking it, and maybe in some ways I am but I feel I’m being irresponsible for my actions and am just scaring people. 

Sometimes I try to apply CBT reframing that usually comes down to “they probably don’t care” but the reactions I get usually say otherwise. Something else I’ve been told is that I’m not responsible for people misreading me, but that just feels wrong. Maybe because I never seem to learn and keep getting into these staring situations, these reframes feel they would work for one-off situations 

Something I think about a lot is “what if I was a man?” because I always see posts from women complaining about men staring at them and how uncomfortable it makes them, and posts about gym creeps - it’s a long story but over a few weeks, a gym is where my most recent incident happened- and I feel commonly these posts talk about men staring. Besides that, I just see posts in general like in this sub of people complaining about getting stared at. These all make me feel deeply ashamed 

The anxiety around my most recent incident made me so upset, because I swore to myself it wouldn’t happen again- but it was happening again- that I couldn’t sleep, my mental health plummeted after a period of it getting better, and I even dropped a class 

— 

I know there’s r/staringOCD but I don’t think I have that, I think it’s just a mix of me having attention problems, slow reaction times, and sometimes impulse control issues

372,2,"Like the title says, I have a job interview for a restaurant in three hours and I feel so nervous. It took days just for me to even apply to a job, and they called me to set up a time to interview yesterday. In the heat of the moment I just said this time works for me but I am so scared and I feel so unprepared. I don’t really know how formal I’m supposed to dress, or what questions they’re going to ask me, and I’m really scared I’ll blank if I get too nervous. I have a headache from the anxiety. This is my first job interview ever so I have nothing to go off of for reference. 

I guess I’m mostly posting this to vent but also in hope that someone will know what questions they might ask me and how to answer them. "
373,2,"I've been crying in my room, alone, and I just wanted to vent. I have nowhere else and no one to turn to. I'm sorry if this is against the rules

I used to be a playful, talkative little kid (from watching videos of myself back then holy shit I was so fucking normal, so happy). I was on the sensitive side, but I was still cheerful and extroverted and didn't give much of a shit. Then my life turned to fucking shit. 

My mother and older sister started to argue. It would get personal. Insults would get thrown. Sometimes, but not often, it would get physical. Every time an argument ensued I would rush to defend my mom. I was very attached to her. An insult to her was like I was being stabbed. And even if I wanted to run away, I couldn't. The screaming and shouting filled every area of the house. I cried so much. It started when I was 9-11. I couldn't escape from it, in my own fucking house, where I shit and sleep. Why couldn't my fucking mom just deal with it instead of letting me be emotionally scarred.

Why couldn't I be raised in a normal, loving fucking household? I could've been normal. I could've been atleast a little happy. But no, God, nature, or whoever the fuck, decided I should be an anxious, emotionally unstable, selectively mute piece of shit. I can't talk to anyone. I don't even know if my familial troubles caused or even contributed to my selective mutism or SAD, but there has to be some trauma somewhere, or I just have extremely shitty genetics.

I've known of my SAD since I was 14 and have tried to overcome it, but I fucking can't. I feel like it's not possible. I'm at a turning point in my life where I HAVE to get over this soon, or it's over. Fuck. 

Has anyone overcome their SAD or selective mutism?  I want to fucking believe it's possible, but I'm losing hope.

374,2,"I (35M) was invited to my spouse's work party. I was very excited for it as she was meeting her colleagues after a long time as she has been working remotely due to some health issues. The party was on a small boat that she had helped arrange.

It all started well, I'd had couple drinks and started talking to this colleague. I was mean to him, made fun of him and he felt disrespected. I don't know this colleague at all and met him for the first time. My wife has never spoken ill of him and has always said he is very good at his job. But for some reason I choose to be bad to him. I made fun of him all evening. I only realized all of this the next day and now she is having to apologize to him and he is livid. Now she has to tell her boss and other colleagues and go through the whole shameful process.

I fucked up because I have social anxiety. I got very super anxious on the boat, I picked this one guy and started projecting. I projected so hard and so bad I completely messed up. He is not willing to talk to her or listen to what she has to say. I'm neurodivergent and my social anxiety was through the roof. I was masking as well.

I don't know what do anymore. I feel terrible for what I have done. I feel gutted for what my wife has to go through, what her colleagues thinks of her and poured water on all her hard-work
And good  faith she has built with her team. She is amazing at her job and I totally ruined it for her. Nobody involved deserves this and only me and my anxiety and projection needs to be blamed.

I feel lost and feel on the edge. I'm having sleepless nights and it happened two days ago

Edit: I'm starting back therapy again. But it doesn't matter, I've already ruined it for my wife. I'm in a lot of pain and she is extremely disappointed in me."
375,2,"I want someone to talk to voice, I just want to vent maybe or something else I don't know"
376,2,"What I mean is is it better to place yourself in the centre and be careless about how people think about you as long as you are happy, or forcing yourself to give out any value you can to others as if selling yourself as a product?

377,2,"Because I have a lesbian brain and everything single hint flies over my head, I need help interpreting if a girl is attracted to me and if she is flirting with me. Bear with me. I am basically the lesbian version of a himbo.

Couple of weeks ago i met a girl at a friend's party and she knew who I was but I had never met her before. I assume she knew us through our mutual friend but i don't know for sure. First thing i noticed is that this girl is so beautiful and cute and gorgeous, like im immediately attracted. Like my lesbian brain starts planning our wedding attracted. She proceeds to shake my hand and we chat for a bit before we started dancing. However, my brain decided to dance away from her and dance with a friend instead. But she kept coming to dance next to me despite me moving away from her each time. This went on for the whole night. Yes I am aware how dumb i am.


Fast forward to this past weekend. We went to a festival with the same friends and during lunch she chose to sit next to me. Her arm kept brushing against my arm and it didn't matter if I tucked my arms inward. Her arm kept brushing against mine and I swear she even softly leaned into me a few times. During the festival she would stand so close to me that again, her arms would brush against mine. Eventually we went to a party and we danced together. When we needed to find our friends, she took my hand and led me through the crowd. She would look back at me and smile and I was just grinning like an idiot. Butterflies in my stomach, oxytocin and dopamine flowing through my veins. I even gently rubbed her hand with my thumb and she didn't pull away. She just smiled and we kept holding hands until we found our friends. The next morning i texted her to say I had a fun time. She replied back saying she was so glad we hung out and that it was really nice seeing me. I replied that it was nice seeing her too and that we should hang out again soon but it's been a whole day and she hasn't responded yet. I'm doomed I swear. Help."

379,2,"So I’ve always been anti social growing up. Scared to loosen up and have fun, extremely low confidence, little to no self esteem, never stood up for myself, always suppressing who I am and letting fear get the best of me. Now when I was younger I was happier. I was a growing kid and I had a lot of fun with my friends, but as I’ve gotten older, my mental health has only gone down hill. Caring far too much about what people think, intrusive thoughts, severe anxiety, depression, substance abuse, mood swings, lack of a social life, bad choices sometimes etc etc etc. Now when I drink, it’s like I’m a new person. I talk to a lot more people than I usually would, make people laugh, my mood can still change but it’s easier to handle, I definitely don’t overthink as much, definitely not as anxious. Now I’d be lying if I said alcohol just straight up solved all my problems and made me happy. Even when I’m drunk if I’m alone, with no distractions, I tend to let my thoughts and emotions get to me. I know I’m just running from reality, but when I’m drunk I feel so much better socially. People can’t even tell when I’m drunk too be honest. At least at work. So yeah I’ve been a on and off alcoholic. Then I stopped drinking and people say “why aren’t you talking to anyone today”? “Why do you act like you don’t know anybody”? It’s because I’m sober. Is the drunk me not really me? Or am I just confident enough to be myself and not overthink to much "
380,2,"Hey!! Ive been struggling for the last couple months with socializing as school is currently out for the summer so I’m kinda knocked out of my daily routine of being forced to talk to people. If I’m being honest I don’t have any friends or even really people i associate with and it’s been this way for a while. I have my boyfriend who I love so much, but I really need some friends also😭. I have no clue how to make friends as I don’t really like sports or clubs and stuff like that. I do have a job, but it feels like everyone there is constantly looking down on me or think I’m the dumb coworker. Recently anytime i have a conversation at work it feels like I have to plan it out in my thoughts ahead of time. Then whenever someone says something unexpected or someone starts talking to me out of the blue I feel so startled and lost for words so I usually just end up saying some kind of common response and it’s just scary bc just being in the same proximity as my coworkers sends me into a panic and makes me feel the need to play out every possible scenario that could occur in that moment.

I’m just anxious people might think I faked it... and now I’m getting really stressed about it :/ It’s not like I call off very often, and no one’s affected by my absence (it’s a pretty chill office job).

i tried to enroll myself in a university earlier and i couldn’t do it because i got too anxious, whenever i get anxious i tend to fuck up things and breakdown. 

it’s depressing how helpless and pathetic i feel, i worry too much, i overthink, i shake, i stutter. it’s like hell, i feel like everyone is watching my every move and judging me. and the fear of looking dumb and/or embarrassing myself is holding me back so much, i much rather not do or say anything at all than embarrass myself in front of everyone.

385,2,"1st day I went to go get dinner which I had a voucher for. I said “Oh I have a voucher” when asked to pay and then he repeated what I said in a mocking tone. I just gave him the voucher and walked off. That ruined my day but I thought that that wouldn’t happen again so I still looked forward to the rest of my vacation. 

Then on the 2nd day (today), I asked the waiter if they serves cans of coke instead of glasses of coke and he just stood there looking at me funny. I was confused so I said it again and he just stared at me like I’ve just said something stupid. Then my grandpa chimed in and said I always make things so awkward and then the waiter started smiling and said “oh you mean Coca Cola” and went and got me a glass of coke even though I was asking if they had cans of coke, not glasses of coke since I didn’t want to sit in the restaurant to drink it. Then after I told him this he just smiled and said they don’t do cans of coke. He could have just said that instead of doing this whole fiasco. 

This shit has genuinely destroyed my vacation. This is why I have no friends. Every time I am social and try to talk to people, they just treat me like I’m a dumb idiot that should be mocked. I just want this vacation to end so I can finally go home and go hide in my bedroom again where I was happy and content. Screw interacting with people.

I'm starting year 12 (or 11th grade) in September, and I've only got 2 friends going with me. Genuinely, how do I talk to more people? I love my friends, and I have friends in younger/older years as well as online, but I want to widen my group of friends my own age so I have more people to relate to.

388,2,"Hello all, I'm wondering how to approach asking help specifically for social anxiety. I've done this in the past and it almost always goes to tackling the severe depression first. Unfortunately, the social anxiety in my opinion is far more important to tackle since I'm really struggling to get employment after my life imploded mid-April. (For example, I'm having severe panic attacks anticipating interviews, that learning period when you start a new job, etc.)"

394,2,"Does anyone have trouble maintaining relatio ships of all kinds? Im not just talking about lovey dubby or friendships but even regular relatio ships with coworkers. I feel like I have to be the same person every single time m e and have to hold myself as that person and irs hard for me to keep a job because of it. Its a bit difficult to explain but to me its such a burden to go through life and maintaining an image and its exhausting. Especially with multiple people I see everyday. I feel like I gotta put up a show and the amount of effort to do so is so depleting. If anyone goes through this, please reply and tell me how you cope. Much appreciated and much love. Thank you ✌🏽🙏🏽❤️"
395,2,"I’ve been seeing my boyfriend for about a year now. He knows I get really anxious, especially when speaking to others. I’ve met only a couple of his friends and barely talked to them. He’s a very social person with a lot of friends and is always making new friends when he goes out. He’s always told me that he wants someone to be able to hold their own and not hide behind him.

He knows about my anxiety and that it’s hard for me, so he does give me grace and time to get comfortable. It really bothers him though. He keeps reassuring me that he’s not trying to change me, he just wants me to be more independent, which I appreciate! I love his honesty, support, and the way he pushes me. It’s just hard.

For example, we went out to eat a week ago and he asked me to go ask for a bag so we could take our leftovers to go. For some reason, I’m really not sure why, I said no. He went to get the bag and we went on with our day. Tonight, he brought it up and said that really bugged him. I feel horrible, especially because that’s something I’ve been beating myself up over since it happened. I’m not sure why I couldn’t just go get the bag?????? I told him I’m sorry and I’m embarrassed about it and have been thinking about it too. He apologized for making me feel embarrassed and said I didn’t need to be sorry. He just wanted to be honest with me.

I’m not mad at him and I don’t think he’s trying to change who I am. This isn’t a post about complaining about my boyfriend. He’s the best guy I’ve ever met, truly.

He also said that he’s thinking long term and he wants to be with someone who can socialize and be okay with his friends if he were to leave the room. I completely agree with this. I don’t want to be following him around like a lost puppy. I just don’t know why I can’t socialize the way he wants me to. I’m good at socializing with new people when I’m alone or with my friends, but when I’m with him, I get anxious and shy. I don’t know what it is or how to fix it. I don’t think he believes me when I tell him I am perfectly fine with being social since he’s never seen it. I just don’t want him to be offended if I say, “it’s only when I’m with you,” because it’s not his fault!!!!

Does anyone else feel this way? Or does anyone have some advice?"
396,2,"I've struggled with anxiety for as long as I can remember. I have a hard time setting boundaries and sticking to them. I'm always afraid that I'm going to come off as rude and hurt someone's feelings.

For example, on nice days, I take my work laptop outside and sit on my fenced in front porch. I like to bring my dog with me because he loves being outside and watching people walk by. Recently, a neighbor stopped over and had a cigarette in their hand. When they bent down to greet my dog, the smoke blew into his face. Then, they opened the gate and encouraged my dog to come out and say hello. I just sat there, frozen in place. Thankfully, my dog stayed by my side.

We had another situation at a dog park years ago, when someone brought their aggressive dog into the park. I should have left, but I didn't want to offend the other dog owner by excusing myself. Her dog ended up attacking mine but he was thankfully okay. 

Even walking my dog (he's very friendly) is tough sometimes. I'm trying to train him not to greet everyone that passes by because not everyone is friendly. I've crossed the street when seeing someone coming towards us, but I always feel so guilty and like I'm going to hurt their feelings and offend them. This is especially an issue when strangers offer treats to my dog; I don't want people to think that I don't trust them.

I don't know how to work on this, but it's really affecting my confidence. I want to keep myself and my dog safe.

Thank you in advance for the advice!"
397,2,"I was at a restaurant with my friends and this cute waitress came to take our orders and she was super close to me, she looked me up and down and said ""I like your jacket."" I didn't hold eye contact and I just got nervous, I got the heart sink feeling. What do I do to be hella confident?"
398,2,"I am 16 and I will go to college in a few months. I need to make a change.

In college, I want to make friends. I want to be happy. I want to laugh with others, get in trouble with others, be sad with others. I am just tired of being alone.

Please help me. I don't know why I am weird or feel fear when someone I don't know approaches me. I deeply crave any sort of human connection and I hope one day that feeling becomes so big that I decide to not care about the fear I feel. 

I don't even know what exactly I hope to achieve from posting this, but I beg of you to maybe give me any advice or tell me what to do. Thank you for reading."
399,2,"My best friend asked me 5-6 months ago and I accepted not knowing a speech was going to be required (never been a part of a wedding before, only attended like two as a distant friend). I've been going through the most stress of my life with work and just life in general for the past 8 months. I've always had social anxiety/stress, but my head has felt like it's been in a vice ever since 8 months ago, clamping down on me and causing depression because of it and now this speech I apparently have to give in a week. I have a short script thrown together, but I just can't. I can't sleep because of all this. I want to be there for them and I want to be there on their wedding day but the idea of the speech is choking me. Even though I wrote a short speech, it doesn't match what I want to say. They're both good people, I just can't get the words right and the anxiety of giving a speech at all is eating me alive.

If you were in my friends situation, how upset would you be if I asked to skip the speech/toast only a week until the big day? If you knew how much it's affecting me, would you be angry?"
400,2,Last year I was working at a school and was cut due to the budget. I didn't socialize as much and preferred to keep to myself. It bothered so many people. I decided to push myself to socialize and began talking to people. The last day I was told if a position opens up they would take me back. The school had an opening for the same position the upcoming year. I applied and never heard back. I did get a call from some people at the school asking if I applied and saying that they hope I come back. I found out yesterday that the Principal is hiring someone else and was told she wants someone who attends staff outings. I definitely know its not because of my work ethics but because of my lack of socialization. I feel hurt and hate that places expect you to be very social. We live in a Society where everyone is different. I wish people who preferred not to socialize were also valued in the workplace. 
401,2,I can’t even walk my dog. How the fuck do people with social anxiety work?
402,2,"I don't if my issues qualify, since I don't think I have social anxiety, but when it comes to my classmates it feels like I do. I can talk to other people fine, cashiers, people in my martial arts club and just generally people. I feel a little silly when I have to talk to stranger to ask for directions or where something in the shop is, mostly cause I feel awkward. But I'm perfectly capable of going up to people and talking with them.

Unless my classmates or other teens on the street are involved. Then it's basically panic mode. Every time I pass a group teens my age I get anxiety. Are they looking at me? Are they judging me? I bet they think I'm weird. Things like that, but I try ignore it and pretend they aren't there and tell myself I'm being ridiculous. But when it comes to my classmates... When I first started highschool I couldn't talk to them. At all. I tried the first day, didn't get any results and shut off after that. I couldn't talk with any of them for a month! The back of my head would start to hurt a lot, my palms would get sweaty and I'd start panicking. I wanted to open my mouth to say somethings, but my head would hurt and I couldn't force my mouth to even open. And I would only manage to say something if I was really stubborn and needed to say something, but after that my mouth was back to being shut. All of this went away eventually and I just feel almost always self-conscious when I have to talk to them. And even then, I can only do it when they talk to me. Sometimes I manage to ask a question about a test or something but I can't bring myself to talk to them or try and start conversations. It feels like I'm just butting in and that I don't belong there. And, well, my back of my head still sometimes hurts when I have to talk to them.

My mom is pretty upset about this, she says I'm sabotaging myself by not talking to them.She encourages me to talk to them, to ask about test when I miss them or if they know stuff from other classes, but I can never go through with it. And I ended doing a couple projects by myself cause I couldn't bring myself to ask someone if I could be in their group. And every time something like that happens she gets angry with me, cause it's not that hard to just ask about a test. But to me it's scary, and she doesn't get that and says I should just overcome it. That it would be better for me. And while that's true, I have no idea how."
403,2,"Yes this seems petty, but it's something I never got over (I'm not in high school anymore lol, M21). As I'm in my last year of university, the cohort in my degree has been getting quite close as we're all getting jobs pretty soon. So I took the leap as well and began following people on IG through recommendations. In situations like this, there are always some people (or a person, in this case) who follow all the other classmates back – even the ones I know for a fact they are not that close with; they never speak to them in class, and are usually grouped with me for assignments – but it's always me who's left out on social media. Said person has a very even following/followers ratio and follows my other friends/acquaintances back but not me. That's the part I find most offensive.

For context, I have diagnosed social anxiety and level 1 ASD. I can be a quiet person, especially in groups with people I don't know well, but I usually chime in when in larger group conversations. But I'd say people consider me pretty normal, just quiet.

Again I'll say it, I know it's petty, but in my mind it isn't because it matters to me. I’m willing to spend the energy. Why is it always me? Am I too quiet of a person to be cared about? I don't even consider myself shy anymore, compared to back when I was in early high school when I literally almost said nothing as I was too overwhelmed and had a harder time converting my thoughts into words. After high school ended, I had swept these types of situations under the carpet, only for it to arise again when I'm forced back into social situations at uni. I worked through my social skills + anxiety with an excellent psychologist for 3.5 years, and by working 2 jobs, only for it to return again in a high school-like situation, smh. I do well at work, and in my other small circles, but it’s always things like this."
404,2,"Hi, i work in an industry where i always see pretty faces age 18-36 since i don't belong to them coz our line of work is different, whenever i see women who i think are just being cute nearby, i tend to ignore and not look towards them. 

I am just afraid of accusations of i could be a creep, and i am afraid that they might accuse me if i look at them. 

So ending, i am like a horse with eye cover, that i only see forward to my path, and not who's beside me, and i never turn my heads to them if i gorgeous women

"
405,2,"A thought. If I didn’t feel like I was missing out on life so much, I would be okay with not taking to people "
406,2,"I'm 21, and for as long as I can remember, I've never been able to make eye contact. not with strangers, not with friends, not even with my girlfriend -- and we've been together for 3.5 years. It doesn't matter who the person is or how close I am to them. I just... can't do it. It's nothing something I can force, either. It's like my body just refuses, almost.

It's not like there's a specific emotion attached to it, either. It doesn't feel like fear or shame in the moment -- it's more like a blank spot. If anything, the only time I feel something is when I notice that someone has realized I'm not meeting their eye. Then I get a spike of anxiety, which makes it even harder to try.

I've been in therapy for two years and have a previous diagnosis of social anxiety, but am no longer considered to have the disorder due to not meeting any of the other criteria. My therapist thinks the eye contact issue is truly just anxiety, but honestly... that explanation doesn't land for me. I've tried the usual tools and they don't help. It's like there's something deeper going on that I can't quite reach.

I'm not diagnosed with anything else other than OCD (if that's relevant, probably not), but I do sometimes wonder if something else is going on. 

Has anyone else dealt with this? What helped you work through it, if anything? I'm open to any perspectives -- scientific, psychological, personal stories, anything. 

Thanks in advance. "
407,2,Parents wants me to help teaching kids English. My anxiety says NO but I wanna help. I don’t know what to do 
408,2,"All my life I have felt different and shy when it comes to social situations I tend not to cause a scene if something goes wrong such as bad service, cant find something I tend to keep looking rather then ask. I hate bothering people or making my problem theirs. I have a high stress job that requires me to talk confidently with a lot of people but when it comes to personal engagements I act totally different. I recently got married to my husband that I have been with for 4 years now I love him a lot but he is very open and loves to talk and ask questions and has no social anxiety. We have clashed several times while out in social situations where he is the one to kinda cause a scene and I try to quiet him down and it kinda has put a awkward tension in between us. I feel I need to figure out how to become more sociable in my personal life like I am in my work life. I do go to the gym but get freaked out when too many people are there and can't focus on working out. I have body dismorphia from a 200lb loss of weight but tend to not show my body to others as much even though my husband loves my body. I just can't seem to get out of my own head about myself. Any tips on how too get over this anxiety and be more open and kinda carefree. Is counseling the best idea? "

I feel like I annoy everyone already when I speak or exist in general, so it just hurts me even more for some reason. Does anyone else feel this way or experienced this, or am I over analyzing?"
411,2,"I straight up can't handle talking to kids. I like them and i try to be nice to them, but i find myself being super awkward around them.

414,2,"I have anger management classes to attend as part of being on probation. The worst part about the classes is every single week they ask people to share their highs and lows of the week. It makes me feel very anxious and the build up before it gets to my turn is almost unbearable. I actually got up one time and left before it got to my turn to share and it was pretty embarrassing. There’s like 20+ people in the class and I feel like the weird one in the class and if I don’t complete them I will probably get a violation of probation and be sent back to jail to serve my original sentence. Sometimes I feel like jail would be less stressful than worrying all week what I’m gonna say and how I’m gonna say it. I know that sounds extreme, going to jail instead of just fighting through the anxiety and stress but it’s a 52 week class (1 year) once a week. What should I do maybe to feel less anxious? I feel very trapped but I take responsibility for how I ended up in this situation for what I did. It’s gonna be one long ass year if I do succeed though but I have doubts I might fail all because I can’t just get over what people think of me. So dumb in reality but that’s how reclusive I feel to the whole situation. I just want some thoughts on this please. Thanks "
415,2,"The short of all this, my dad and his neighbor clashed, and I already had social anxiety now I'm just paranoid that the entire neighborhood is hostile toward me. people used to walk their dogs out there, i see it sometimes but not often. and rewind to a few weeks ago, i accidentally went into the neighborhood right next to ours and there was like twenty of them walking their dogs (in a single group), so it makes me feel like they're getting together and gossiping about me and my dad, and it's like this very subtle form of exclusion, making the neighborhood dead quiet. And I don't think that's entirely in my head, though maybe some of it is.

Anyone else go through something similar, in the sense that you think you're being gossiped about and it makes you sort of paranoid? "
416,2,"Why can't I be able to show my appreciation to people? I feel the appreciation, but I fail to show it and I always feel guilty. When someone compliments me, I either delay a thank you or just freeze and maybe walk away idk why. When I get told off, I freeze and not say sorry. Instead I run away and isolate myself. I even have trouble saying good morning or hello. I feel like a horrible person and I just can't seem to get it under control."
417,2,"So I am in the 7th grade and just moved to a new country and had to repeat 7th grade because of those and I made lots of “friends” very quickly which was kind of a blessing and a curse because I felt that nothing was wrong at first I was happy but then a bunch of class changes happened and everyone had old friends that they much rather talk with which is understandable but it kind made me jealous because I didn’t have any old friends so it was so weird and I felt horrible that I was even jealous because it was wrong but it also made me 
feel distant and like I had no one to talk to.I also annoyed a lot of people while in this state which made me spiral even further and I still feel like that especially today because it’s national best friend day and I don’t have any.Ty you if you read this entire thing and if you can just comment something .also I know I kinda sounded like a brat / bad friend and I trying to be better but it feels like Im falling behind "

I should also mention I'm diagnosed with Autism and ADHD so social skills aren't the best especially at first. I've tried to join so many communities online but for some reason I always get this deep gut feeling that I am and always will be an outsider to any group I'm in and my presence is a burden to those around me. So I'm down for some advice if anyone has any."
419,2,"Does anyone else have social anxiety online too? When I get a message, I freak out. I physically start shaking. Sometimes it takes me days to respond, sometimes I never manage at all. I’ve lost countless people this way. It gets misinterpreted as me not caring enough to get back to them, but the truth is that the more I care, the harder it is to reply...

I feel so stupid. Everyone seems to have such an easy time messaging each other and I’m just completely incapable."
420,2,"Everyone here seems to have people dislike them after seeing how they act with their social anxiety.

It doesn't matter who it is, what gender, what age, they all act the same towards me.  

The universe is playing games with me but I don't know why maybe I did something it didn't like?

I want to break up with him because I feel he deserves better. He wants to go to a music festival with me and his friends in july and this alone caused me a great deal of anxiety.

I speak to him in a monotone voice about anything and everything, where is my personality? the life? I can tell I’m boring him horribly but he still stays. idk what’s wrong with me. I wish I could talk and have interesting things to say back to him I just don’t. anybody else feel like they never have anything of interest to say to anybody ever or do I just have some sort of different issue?"

People are sick, unpredictable, and they scare me. I don't get how people hurt others. I never wanted to hurt anyone, all I wanted was peace and it makes me sad when im forced to act differently from that. the negative energy they bring to my life is genuinely bad for me to the point where it declines my mental health so I will be protecting my peace to the fullest extent. I'm aware that by doing this, I'll be missing out on a lot and never get to experience the fun things most people do, but on the bright side I'll be missing out on the bad that could make me decline even more if I don't do this. I feel like im too damaged to function normally anyway so I really have no choice. I am overly self aware to the point where it runs my life.

But whenever I feel like I'm starting to get more confident, the world feels the need to crush that hope. Machines had errors when I started using them, I get no direction on what I'm even supposed to be doing, and customers start acting rude. I go for my third day and have a panic attack in the parking lot and just run away. Now I have to go back and either be fired or get in trouble. 

I was told over and over how this walmart job was getting done by stupid people, and if I can't do it then I have no hope anywhere. I just feel completely useless and hopeless, I can't even do this simple job. Nobody around me seems to get how I feel, they just act as though I'm just shy. I feel broken, like I came out wrong, and I can't function in this world.

Those who had like social anxiety problem, how do they overcome it. I mean doesn't it like hinder your growth to networking with people and things like advancing in your career path and getting to know others. Maybe you want to communicate but self doubts are so high that everything just feels ruined. So what is like the best strategy and hacks to overcome social anxiety slowly by slowly. My cousin who works at gas station said, if you just come here for a month or so. Just watch how much your communication skills will improve because you will meet all kinds of people and understand how to deal with people. Maybe that's true hmmm "
432,2,"This might sound like a small or silly problem and maybe this isn’t even the right place to ask, but I’ve noticed lately that I get really anxious about certain everyday things that seem easy for most people.

One of them is calling a restaurant to make a reservation. It’s such a short, simple call,but it stresses me out so much that I often just... don’t do it. I always try to convince my freidns to call, even if they don’t have the time for it.

I’ve started to wonder if this is more than just “I don’t like phone calls.” It feels like I’m way more anxious about it than average and I want to understand that part of myself better.

Honestly, I’ve thought about how nice it would be, to have some kind of assistant, that can do these things for me. But I guess there is nobody that wants to call restaurants for me lol

Does anyone else feel what I’m saying?"
433,2,"So last year my dad had a clash with his neighbor, and it ended up in court. He didn't end up going to jail because the guy had a record as well, but anyways, every time I've have an awkward interaction with someone in town, I wonder if the neighbor and his friends spread some gossip about my dad and me (even though I wasn't involved in what happened, I'm sure I get lumped in with him in some way). Anyway, this makes me paranoid and I get very anxious if I have an awkward interaction with someone and assume that's the reason.

Anyone else have a similar issue when it comes to thinking someone is spreading malicious gossip about you and you're not sure how to react? "

I enjoy looking at things in-person and trying on clothes, but certain stores make me feel really uncomfortable and make me want to jump in bed and hide under the covers lol. Today I popped into Lululemon and I felt like I didn't belong there. Everyone was so talkative and on page with all the latest trends. As someone who doesn't wear trendy fitness clothes n'stuff, I felt like I stuck out like a sore thumb. I just wanted to get what I needed and dash out. Same thing happens at stores like Sephora and Aritzia, where conventionally attractive employees greet you and then quickly leave you alone because they can tell you hate it in there (which is nice in a sense, but I feel like they're judging?). I'm sure people with or without social anxiety experience similar feelings, but as an introvert, I get tense even walking past those stores haha. "
435,2,Is this a successful story? I want to try and power through my anxiety by going out by myself because if I feel this urge to go home I can just do it without inconveniencing anyone. I am in my late-20s. I wish I had this strategy sooner even if it might not be the most effective.
436,2,So......I uh corrected someone in class. Someone shouted the wrong answer and i was like thats wrong and i corrected them and now i feel like that was so bitchy of me. I shouldn't have it wasn't my place 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭
437,2,"Got hired for a part time job working in a pet store and i’m genuinely so scared, it’s my first job ever and my brain just keeps spiraling about messing stuff up and my coworkers not liking me, ugh how do people do it. worst thing is that i can still technically back out but i feel like i would be so disappointed in myself if i did that."
438,2,"Hey,

I have the option to take a dorm room but need to decide by tomorrow. I'm considering waiting for a shared apartment spot instead. I'm quite **socially isolated** due to various challenges—low self-esteem, stuttering, etc.—and the isolation is making everything worse.

In the **dorm**, someone ""uncool"" like me might become anonymous quickly, but it could also offer a protected space with potential for casual contacts. A **shared apartment** would be riskier, but as long as I'm not bullied, it could provide a sense of basic community, maybe even friendships. That said, I also value quiet nights for a stable routine.

My initial thought was to try for a shared appartment (the best-case scenario) and fall back on the dorm if it doesn’t work out. But I don’t know if I’ll get another offer from student housing. Alternatively, moving from the dorm to a WG and back if needed seems unlikely too.

There are probably other perspectives I’m missing—I’d really appreciate honest advice.

"
439,2,"I've never really fit in at my school and I don't know if it's me or the people that is the problem to be honest.

So in year 7 I was in quite a big friendship group and I would feel left out because I was quiet and wouldn't speak up for myself but looking back, at least I had friends who liked me. 
In year 8 we all drifted away to different friendship groups, I didn't have anyone to go to so I followed another girl to a different group. And that was the biggest mistake of my life. While she fit in because she was louder and more bubbly than me, I didn't. I tried my best but I really struggled to join in their conversations because I was worried about saying something wrong. I felt intimidated by them because they were all very popular and their opinions on me mattered a lot. But I continued to hang out with them because I didn't have anyone else. So for a year I sat on the other side of the bench on my phone not saying anything whilst they talked about their plans in front of me. They would always forget about me, leaving me alone at parties and going in groups together without me. 
As a side note, I'm not really sure what was going on here as I am good friends with them all now individually. Their group split around the same time I left them and I'm not sure why but half of them still don't talk to each other.

I started hiding in the toilets at the end of year 8, I started doing it for a day or two when I got fed up of being left out because they wouldn't even notice and I soon realised that it was much more peaceful and I could be left alone.
Then in year 9 at the start, i tried making friends but it was hard because everyone else had already found their groups so it was back to the toilets for me. I said to myself I'd just do it for a week then I'd try again to make some friends. But it is surprisingly addictive because it's been nearly two years and I haven't stopped. It's better than me sitting on my own, that's way too embarrassing anyway. 

I only have a year of school left now but I'm struggling. My mental health is getting worse and I feel more lonely than ever. I have friends in class but they all have their own groups and I'm too nervous to approach them. 
I'm going to a different school for sixth form and I'm hoping to make some new friends there but I'm scared it will just end up the same with me hiding in the toilets again.

I don't know what to do.
"
440,2,I feel like I focus so much on making normal eye contact (and I never succeed) that I sometimes lose track of conversations. Like I can't maintain proper eye contact and process what I hear at the same time. How does it come so naturally to people wihout SAD. 
441,2,"My mom signed me up to be a camp counselor for little kids and the camp puts you in a group with other people around your age and a group leader. I went to the meeting for a few days ago, and it was mostly girls and some  boys I don’t know but tour them with friends and the other one looks really shy like me. I’m really nervous for when I asked you to start camp. Any tips?"
442,2,"My social anxiety started from bullying as a kid. The city I live in reminds me of my past constantly. I live minutes away from my elementary, middle and high school. When I apply at jobs I always worry I’ll work with people that bullied me. Anyways I always think that maybe if I’m alone in a new state I can improve my social anxiety. I don’t have friends either way here and my mom’s the only one I talk to, I don’t have a close relationship with my dad, sister or brother. Have any of you guys moved to a different state or city and saw a little bit of improvement with your social anxiety "
443,2,"I have courage, but my courage is not impressive. My courage is invisible.

I'm courageous when I step outside, because I get overstimulated easily and outside is bright with a million different noises going on.

I'm courageous when I ask the waiter for something, because im used to being grateful for what I get and not creating a fuss.

I'm courageous if I just say hi to a woman, because I used  to be too scared to even initiate a conversation with one.

As you can see I'm courageous in a few ways, but in ways the world wouldn't recognize and still have the audacity to label me as scared or weird. 

"
444,2,"Back when i was in high school, i was with a group of friends. As the time goes by, i feel like they became distanced with me and secretly annoyed/hates me? and i don’t why? I tried asking them and they keep saying that no they don’t. It affected me and I got a lower ranking during graduation.

I was thinking this might not be a me problem

College came and the situation is still the same. There is still certain people who are judging me and lowkey bullying me. It also affected me and I failed my course. That’s where i realized that maybe it was really a ME problem. I was the problem and NOT them.

I got transferred to a new school and it still happens. Even until I graduated and got employed, everything is still the same.

I hate everything. Sometimes I just wanna die. "
445,2,I have a presentation on Wednesday and this is my first time doing one alone. I really don't want to have a panic attack when I present. Does anyone have any tips that could make it more bearable?
446,2,"Trying again, bit by bit.

Sometimes I feel a little discouraged, especially after being on my own for so long. There’ve been a lot of solo moments — like hikes — and while I enjoy them, it can get daunting to open up to new people and experiences.

But today, I gave it another shot. I joined an impromptu hiking meetup in my area. The small talk still feels challenging — I kept thinking about my answers afterward. Like, did I say the right thing? Was it boring to mention that I’m not really a café person/foodie  when someone asked for local food recommendations?

Honestly, I opt for home cook most of the time. Eating out can be expensive. 😅

Still, being in nature is always healing. I saw lutongs (white-thighed surilis), which was amazing — though I missed out on birdwatching since we were moving as a group.

I think I’ll just keep going with the flow, trying things that align with my interests. I’d really love to connect with people in the cybersecurity field too, so I’ll start looking for related events. :)"
447,2,"I’m 21 and can’t still keep eye contact talking to others. I always look around and down to the floor, so I seem like I’m not interested at the conversation but I am. One reason I feel is a key part of this is my condition with alopecia. I have no hair on head or face, so I look very different from everyone else. So when I get eye contact with someone I talk to it feels like they can see my condition and when I look away it “disappears” for them and they can’t see my condition anymore. It’s hard to explain. 
I try my best to gain confidence to look in peoples eyes but it’s really hard. It’s not just randoms, it’s even my friends and parents I have problem to keep eye contact with. So something must be wrong. 
"
448,2,Idk but it's affecting me everyone thinks I am too dumb but Im not I am just anti social 
449,2,"Just about to turn 17, just left school. Im going to college on August but as of right now I have basically no one to talk to. My friends all stayed on for school which means im alone and ive never had a ""proper"" girlfriend. How do I change this? My town is empty so I cant just go out but I dont know what id do if I went into the city. Im alone and I need help."
450,2,"i am 39 and I am really struggling at the moment. I was thinking about going to group therapy (The only thing that's helped in the past) but there aren't any social anxiety groups here now.   
Is the Andy Man Club welcoming to people with social anxiety?

I went to a private group once and they weren't very understanding of social anxiety and kept telling me (not asking) me to speak in-front of the group. One person even said he didn't believe SAD was real and it was just ""Shyness"" -\_-. I only went twice. "
451,2,"Today's my birthday. I'm turning 21 and I'm supposed to feel happy but really all I feel is depression and anxiety. Usually I would go out with my 2 friends but lately theyre always busy and it's getting harder to see them. If they weren't busy we'd be out every week, but now it's.. different. Today, turning 21, I feel so so different. 

I hate this feeling. When it's my one of my family member's birthday, I would always be the one to make a reservation and set up a theme. But when it's MY birthday, no one gives a damn. And thinking back to it, I feel like if I were gone right now, no one would notice, no one would care.

I know it's annoying to feel this way, and yes, I might be deemed selfish. But is it so wrong to want someone to take care of me when all I've ever done is take care of them?

And not just that. Apparently, I am the ""driver"" of my friends, which they jokingly put on their birthday wishes to me. Not best friend, not even friend. Driver. That's what I am to them. All my birthday has been so sh***y so I'm not surprised that my 21st would be even better.

Anws, see you all on my 22nd birthday for another ranting. "
452,2,Like I cannot imagine being able to order at any of those places without them.
453,2,"How do I communicate to someone else what I'd want my hair to sort of look like when getting a haircut?

At a barber's for example, rather than describing what kind of hair style you want could you just like show them a picture to show them how you'd want it to look? 

I've had trouble in the past in which I was upset with how my hair looked after a haircut because I'm not able to convey how I'd want it to look to the person doing the haircut Where a lot of people sort of know someone personally that can do a haircut for them, I don't have anyone and being specific and pedantic about how I'd want my hair to look to a stranger, kind of makes me feel a bit rude sort of. I just wanted to ask how other people might go about this sort of thing. Thanks for your time."
454,2,"I have no idea how to fix this internally, but I'm horrible with eye contact. I'm so anxious I can't manage it with strangers. Then I think as a result if it's a repeated environment, people end up thinking I'm arrogant etc. Which is not the case, I'm just horribly anxious.

Anyone else bad with this?"
455,2,"I'm 20 and currently studying art at uni. Early on, I became friends with a guy in his 40s because I’m shy and don’t make friends easily. Over time, I started regretting it—he's extremely negative, complains constantly, is very passive-aggressive, and I feel like I’m walking on eggshells around him.

A recent example: during a group critique, I had to urgently use the bathroom due to at-home water issues and ended up missing his presentation. He showed up to class 30 minutes late and had already missed mine entirely, so I don’t think he had any right to be upset. Still, when I came back, he made a passive-aggressive comment about me not staying for his, and later he blew up at me, saying I always give him the cold shoulder. I admit I shouldn’t have lied about why I left, but I was embarrassed. I eventually told him the truth (being i had to go to the toilet, and also if i ever DO give him the 'cold shoulder, its unintentional as im generally just not good at talking to people, which he already knew in past discussion), and he ""forgave"" me, but honestly I wish I hadn’t said anything just so the friendship could’ve ended.

He criticizes all my other friends, our teachers, and even other students’ art. When he gets upset, he tends to say unnecessarily cruel or mean things—to me or to others—and I genuinely don’t feel emotionally equipped to deal with that. I dread going to class now because of him, and it’s affecting my mental health—art used to be my safe space.

I’ve tried distancing myself, but I think I’m the only person in the class he considers a ‘friend,’ and he follows me everywhere I go. The only time I can get away is when I arrive late and the seats are already taken—but even then, he still finds ways to talk to me any chance he gets.

I know I should just tell him I don't want to be friends anymore, but I’m terrified. He’s the kind of person who would explode and say awful things, and I don’t think I can handle that. I really need advice on how to get away from this friendship without completely crumbling.

thank you in advance.

forgive me if things dont make sense, i made an unneccesarily long paragraph on this initially and ran it through chatgpt to summarise it."
456,2,"My anxiety stemmed from my innate difference from “normal” people. In the 6th grade, people kept asking me if I was gay. Of course at the time I didn’t actually know, but that didn’t stop them from relentlessly asking. 

I never got along with boys, I always felt extremely uncomfortable around people. I felt this way because I could feel them viewing me, and knowing that I was different from them. 

In highschool I wasn’t bullied or anything, but it was the most uncomfortable place to be. I tried to be quiet, not draw any attention to myself. If I did, people would know I was different. (everyone knew who I was, what I was).

I hate my voice, the way it sounds, the way it is received. Walking down the hallway, my head would hang low and I’d be holding on to my backpack straps for dear life until the few short feet were over. 

The worst I’ve ever been “harassed” before would be from guys. I’ve been asked “what are you?” (I had long hair at the time).  Called “GAY” and “fa****”.

I feel 10x more safe around women than I do men, and I would say in some aspects I’m actually scared of men (people in general, but them more). 

I’ve always hated that word, gay. It sounded so hurtful. I hated that that was what I was. The way people said it, you would think they were talking about something that repulsed them. 

I had always been introverted at heart, but the last year of high school hit me the hardest. 

Nothing in particular really happened, but everything changed. I opened my eyes; my sick, deluded eyes and I saw the truth. I would never fit in. Ever. I would never be able to go anywhere and mind my business because people would be minding mine. 

Permanently on display. I hate being viewed. I get sweaty and hot in places with people, jittery. I can’t stand being in public around people for too long, it’s exhausting. 

I went to college, shaved my head, and basically quarantined myself for the whole year (never leaving my dorm room, except for food and classes).

I came home for the summer (now) and I can’t bring myself to leave my room. 

My mom and sister always invite me to go out, but I can’t, I just can’t. 

I’m so scared, and I don’t even fully know why, but I resent myself for it and everything comes full circle. 

I have no friends, or I won’t by the time summer is over. I’ve been ignoring them, cause I can’t lie one more time and say that I’m busy. It’s easier to just say nothing. To distance myself. 

And that’s what I’ve done. Since the summer after senior year… i’ve been gone. I’ve disappeared. I deleted all social media (I do really think that was for the best tho, it never felt right being there anyway). I’ve forced myself into an impenetrable bubble, and the only one who can pop it is me. 

I know I can’t pop it, I won’t. 

Maybe I’ll have a revelation someday.

I’ve had good days and bad days, but i’ve always ended my day in a bubble. 

Sad, but safe. 

I’m not sad because I’m alone, i’m sad because I can’t even be alone comfortably. 

I can’t even go to the store anymore.

The only walls I’ve seen for the last 6 months are the 4 walls of my room. 

This is entirely my decision, my fault (I know). 

I don’t think I’ll ever be “normal”. Heck, I never was to begin with. 

Pathetic. "
457,2,"Like I remember how before I could just have fun with my friends and focuse on them only, but now I'm kinda aware about everyone around me and it drives me crazy like I'm on a stage and everyone's looking at me. Has this happened to anyone else? Could you deal with it?"
458,2,how do i stop feeling immense guilt for cancelling plans i didnt want to go to?? and they didn’t respond after i cancelled so it makes it so much worse for me. I did it in efforts to protect myself bc im too tired but now im stressed :( its like a lose lose and so frustrating 
459,2,"I mean the kind of anxiety where your throat closes up and you end up mute and never talking people and wondering about where your life is going to end up because you know its either homeless on the streets or well, you know what. I already work a minimum wage job that's incredibly stressful and has left me burn scars all over my arms. I wish I could work a job that I didn't need to talk because I kind of already don't but it's just getting worse and worse nowadays because I really can't anymore. I don't have any qualifications except a high school diploma. I'm not physically fit enough to get into the trades or a warehouse, nor am I smart enough either. I don't know what to do. Please help."
460,2,"Whenever someone compliments me I don't know how to react. If readily accept it I'm afraid it could come across as arrogant. Also, I feel like I need to compliment the person back or else it will seem rude. This leads to me giving back compliments that I don't believe in.

I'm also scared that I might do something to disprove the compliment later on, and that fear makes me feel very self-conscious after receiving a compliment. For instance, if I'm playing a sport or game with someone and they compliment my playing skills, I start to fear that I will mess up my next move.

What is the best way you have found to respond to compliments? And how do you deal with the fear that you might do something to disprove them?"
461,2,"i want to really have a go at being a hotel receptionist only because i hear how laid back and chill it is and i can hopefully gain confidence in speaking in a public space, i literally have a fear of being perceived and my communication skills are so bad omg i literally have brain fog with every sentence i try to speak 😭😭

i don’t wanna hold back though, i need to overcome this fear and there’s no way out of it other than just throwing myself out there and experimenting with difference experiences!! 

"
462,2,"Have you guys given up or stayed away from multiplayer games? I used to enjoy playing them a lot (TF2, Toontown, SWTOR, etc.) until my social anxiety kicked up and kinda realized what's the point because I get a little bit of emotional pain awkwardly going through content with others. What have been your experiences with this?"
463,2,I find that I feel my fear and dread melting away almost entirely when I choose to face a social situation which I initially am afraid and dreading but as I choose to sit with the initial discomfort and awkwardness I feel like I grow more and more confident of myself and my ability to face such situations especially if the people in the situations aren't critical and unfriendly and I find that the next time I find it easier to face similar situation... Is there a chance that I can eventually get over social anxiety completely. But if the people in the situations are unfriendly and critical judgemental I can feel very conscious and nervous.. FYI I didn't had social anxiety up until age 17 when body shaming and belittling left me with low self esteem and confidence and social anxiety and it went like that for more than a decade..
464,2,"I get physically uncomfortable when people try to take photos of me, my muscles tense up and my face starts twitching and I can’t stand it. It makes it worse that people think I’m being attention seeking by not wanting photos but the feeling I get is equivalent to having cockroaches crawl on me. It makes me sad because I have no memories from the past 6+ years and my teenage years/early 20s are an urban myth at this point there’s no evidence of them "
465,2,"i feel like i've becoming the very sort of person i used to hate. i'm outwardly a pretty chatty and sociable person when i warm up to people, and i get invited to things fairly often, but the problem is i seem to have an inability to evaluate in the moment whether i actually have any desire or intent to follow through or not. i have a hard time directly saying no when i'm invited to something but i almost never actually want to follow through when the time comes and it's often a huge struggle getting myself there. i'll procrastinate, show up late, sometimes even cancel last minute... i don't want to come across like i just enjoy being flakey or don't care- it's quite the opposite, i always feel really ashamed and guilty. every once in a while i'll make myself socialize and i usually have a good time, but once i get home i'll look back on our interactions and find instances where i embarrassed myself or convince myself i was behaving inappropriately or making people uncomfortable.
i've gone through waves of this since i was in middle school (i'm 26 now) but it's become more severe/debilitating in the last few years. i'm just wondering if anyone else can relate or knows what could be going on?"
466,2,"Went to a Meetup social event and didn’t speak to a single other person for 2 hours. 

Nobody approached me, I didn’t approach them, I’m 25 now and seriously am going to live a miserable unfulfilling life.

I’m never, ever going to build up enough confidence to find a partner. I still live with my mother, no car, work from home and I don’t have any social circle.

I’m a energy-drain to be around. Im boring and somebody you wouldn’t want to talk to."
467,2,"Honestly this happened the other day and I'm not sure how to read it. I was in a gas station grabbing an energy drink and when I go up to the counter, the few seconds it takes me to reach it seems like she's staring at me. I have no idea the reason since staring can either be positive or negative. Then when she did talk it was in a super low voice and I couldn't hear what she was saying.

Anyone else have this problem sometimes? What do you think when it happens?  "
468,2,"Bit of backstory 


I left school , work and everything because of my fear of approaching women 

I have always been a sexual guy wanting to sleep with every woman so when I was at school and work and I seen so many guys approach girls and sneak around with them it really pissed me off so it led me to depression and anxiety 





Today I said enough is enough went down to a park and said this is my life I need to take back control 

I don’t know but somehting took over from me and I seen a absolutely beautiful woman going a run walk to me so I said fuck it I approached her and got her number 


I was so happy I started jumping around 


I tried another girl but you don’t win everytime she said she had a boyfriend so I said no problem enjoy your day 



What I am saying is embrace rejection you can’t be everyone’s type and if that was the case you wouldn’t be human 




Come on son !!!!!!"
469,2,"I worried a lot recently about taking someone's place by making an appointment or being judged because I used a website our country has for quick appointments close to us that are covered by free healthcare.

And what if someone needs the appointment more than me, to stop themselves from doing something bad.

I thought I could wait a few months but the offices don't take new patients; most not even on the waiting lists. 

And I have been thinking about quitting my job and moving away and all that stuff, which sounds extreme enough to warrant an appointment. 
Especially because the decision rips me in half. It would probably be better for me to do it. And I probably still will but it made me realise I really need someone to talk to and I have reached a tipping point in my life.

And for once I took it into my own hands and got it done. Not by a phone call or by being on a waiting list but at least I got it done.
"
470,2,Some people don't understand how much it takes for people like me to even stand infront of 30 people let alone speak like that.  Sitting in the front row and talking much worse laughing?? show some basic manners . Jesus christ social anxiety is ruining my life 
471,2,"Ended up at a place with a social workplace culture and in an industry I'm not interested in (but the work I'll be doing is mostly aligned with my goals). Feel like I ruined my first impression during the week and my anxiety was through the roof the whole week where every conversation and interaction was paralyzing. Missed a few social cues, the team meetings and group lunches with both the employees and interns I could only manage to say a few words or not say anything at all (and at one point I jumped in and it was super awkward). The week felt like being on autopilot with constant brain fog, like I couldn't focus on being personable and genuinely curious as I was so nervous about saying and doing wrong (and it would show in my facial expressions more than half of the time). Going into a first time job environment while learning new info about the industry, workplace, having to work on social cues, and being surrounded by all excellent communicators (which was a job requirement and it's beyond me how I got the offer) has physically made me ill so much I can barely eat during the day. Networking and connecting seems like the most important aspect of the job more than doing your work, especially as an intern, and with a bad first impression I've been stressing myself out on how to recover for week 2.

I've already accepted my status as the weird intern. The main issue is working on group conversations and just asking questions/being witty. What I've been having trouble with is staying grounded, and constantly being in fight or flight has made it so I get brain fog and dizzy and the ""what do I say next?"" feeling overpowers the ""oh thats interesting, tell me more about xyz"" and I end up not saying anything. My goal is to also be more conscious of my facial expression/body lang.

It seems so easy to be told ""just talk"", ""be yourself"", and ""just don't be weird,"" and it feels doable until I'm in the situation and can't mentally focus because of my physical state. Prior to starting I thought I made so much progress only to revert so fast. I do think a positive was this was an eye opener for me to take the anxiety I've had for years more seriously, and I'm planning to start anxiety meds plus hopefully therapy down the line.

I know improvement won't happen overnight, but any hard truths I need to come to terms with or other advice is appreciated. Thanks"
472,2,"Hey everyone, have you ever felt like you're the only one who has social anxiety? It's something I've noticed that seems like only I have, because I have family, classmates, and friends who don't seem to have it. What do you u think? Do you think maybe many people in our social circle have it but keep it hidden? It's a question I've always had."
473,2,"I suspect that maybe I have social anxiety? I know I'm introverted but I don't know if im socially anxious.
Whenever I enter a classroom for example I get slightly stressed thinking people are looking at me, and when I go to sit down in my chair im constantly thinking that I'm even sitting in the chair wrong.

When I'm talking to friends I constantly sweat even when im not stressed, it just keeps happening and its incredibly frustrating. 

When I'm with my close friends, even then I can't get a word in unless I'm feeling either really comfortable or someone chimes me into the conversation. If someone doesn't actively go out of their way to mention me I'll typically just stand there listening not talking, etc.

Am I just introverted? Or am I anxious, I really can't tell. It's like im weirdly extroverted and introverted at the same time. I have friends, I can talk to them, but when the group gets too big I just check out. 

Also, I'm a piano player and I've done many performances at recitals, sure I get stressed but I really enjoy them. It's hard to tell for me personally, but I've been suspecting I have some mild version of it for a little while, but I don't want to self diagnose. Anyways, thanks for reading.

"
474,2,"Im a student in tenth grade, and few months ago, there was a girl in my class who was pretty obvious into me, but I didn't communicate with her that much, and since then she's moved on. How do I try to reconnect with her? I'm pretty anxious when it comes to situations with people, especially girls. I have a few close friends, so maybe from the outside I don't seem like a complete loner to everyone, but when I talk to girls I get nervous and can't speak clearly or look them in the eye, and I can barely ask a girl for a pencil in class without making it awkward. She's also shy, but less so than me, or at least it affects her life less. Is there any chance for me?"
475,2,"I scored 110 on a social anxiety test but I never would’ve guessed I had it! I always knew there was something wrong with me because I’ve always been anxious but I thought it was just generalised anxiety. But it does make sense. Today I went to a bday party with friends I’m not too close with but I said thank you to one of them for making the cake in the groupchat and then she responded and i said something else but no one else did. I then sent one of my friends that was there an instagram reel that we thought was funny and she js liked the message. I then went numb and started spiralling and deleted all my social medias and started crying because I thought that they all thought I was a weird freak loser idk. I probably seem dramatic but I feel like this a lot. My room doesn’t have a desk so I have to go downstairs to study but I heavily dislike it bc the desk is in the dining room which is a shared space with my family which means I have to prepare to react to their social interactions and body language and expressions and engage in conversation with them which means that I can’t mess up otherwise I’m a bad person idk. I’m sorry it probably does seem like im reaching a bit idk but that is how I feel everyday and its so exhausting and i’m stressed all the time. The only person I feel safe around is my cat and that’s it. Idk where i’m going with this but does this seem like social anxiety or am I just reaching? I’m not afraid to ask for ketchup in a restaurant but I do avoid saying goodbye a lot to my family because I don’t wanna be perceived as weird, same with friends with thank yous and stuff as well which probably makes me seem rude agh idk"
476,2,"I went on a date today with a really sweet girl. It was one of the most daunting things I've ever done, and even though we ended up not being a match, I'm so happy I put myself out there. It's a cliche I never really believed would apply to me until now, but it really was so much less terrifying than I thought it would be.

I nearly vomited this morning fearing all the ways it could go wrong, but the actual date was pleasant, and I think I didn't even come off like a nervous wreck! 

I really think I can do this again, and it will be easier. I'm closer than I've ever been to living the life I thought social anxiety had taken from me."
477,2,"I can’t do conflict. 

I can be kind of high functioning but I fail in conflict situations.

We allowed ourselves to be pressured into a hire car sale and they say if we go next week we can swap it but weren’t nice at all about it so I am unsure if they will or how they’ll be. And I feel so stressed and anxious. I don’t have an assertive bone in my body and I hate it. "
478,2,"She said ‘hey i think you’re really pretty!’ And i don’t get compliments often at all so it took me back and I quickly said ‘omg thank you!’ But looking back i’m worried i was rude, should I have complimented back? That feels inauthentic to me but i dont want to seem cold or bitchy ahhhh i’m def overthinking it right now"
479,2,"Im 16F and i feel like every time i talk, it gets awkward. idk why but something just feels off when i try to say anything even to my classmates or people around me. I avoid eye contact a lot and then feel super guilty like ppl think i’m rude or weird or ive done something wrong even online i feel like i talk too much or come off clingy when i just wanna connect.I hate going out alone and i overthink everything and feel like everyone’s judging me even buying stuff by myself is really hard. i always try to keep convos going but end up saying random stuff and ppl probably think i’m annoying. Im just tired of feeling like this. I want to be normal like other people. "
480,2,"Basically the title. They're walking toward the road on the other side of the grass, then as I'm walking to my car it's like the old guy goes back to lock his car or something. And I get a weird vibe from him. I don't know, usually I'm fine around others but then there are situations like this that raise my anxiety. Not sure if that has to do with the fact that I walk alone and most people at the park have usually at least one other person with them (though not all). 

Anyone else have this issue?"
481,2,For me it was constant emotional abuse daily from friends in primary school (elementary for Americans) I was and still am but not as much a sensitive kid I would constantly be picked on I was the punching bag of my friend group to the point where I would go home crying from school I was a emotional train wreck by the end of primary It was the first and only toxic relationship I’ve ever had I infact became “friends” with them via them straight up bullying me in my first year. It’s been 4 years since primary and I still have the same friends although they have HEAVILY matured since then and have became genuine friends of mine they look back on what they did to me with shame the littles times we’ve talked about it. (I don’t like talking about it for obvious reasons)
482,2,"Hi I am going to fucking lose my mind if I don’t get help with this soon. For the past 2 years, I have been physically, LITERALLY unable to inflect my voice. I can do it fine in my head, I used to be a fine socializer, now everything is falling apart! My voice is constantly monotonous, and my social skills are gradually declining. Has anyone else experienced similar? Please, what have you done to overcome it"
483,2,"Hey. I'm twenty years old and just finished school. After summer break I'll start working in an inclusive primary school as one many assistants.
I was already able to join for a day and meet the class (third and forth graders, some with mental or physical disabilities) and really loved the school. The teachers are awesome and the children didn't seem to be bothered by me being very nervous and quiet. At the end of the day I broke down in tears, to my own surprise, after one teacher told me, they weren't sure if I could get the job because I obviously have to be able to scream in case of emergency. We talked afterwards and the teachers  offered me the job with less working hours and more freedom in choosing tasks because they were able to convince the managment to employ two assistants for this class.
I was really excited for this job and I'm really thankful for those nice people so I definitly have to take the chance.
However, I'd love to get some advice on how to prepare myself for what's to come. 
I've never had much contact with kids and after years of therapy and medication my social anxiety still makes it impossible for me to laugh loudly, jump or run around, scream at somebody (I think this won't be necessary though), make funny (entertaining) faces etc.
Ofc this is a huge challenge and I am well aware of my responsibilty and how children are affacted by for example nervousness of their caretakers.
I really want the best for them and wouldn't have applied to this job if I was too scared I couldn't handle it.
I am pretty sure I can help the kids with many things, mainly during lessons. I am kind and emphatetic, I know a lot of their struggles because I experienced them myself and have found ways to overcome them. My childhood trauma just sits so deep I still freeze in certain situations. I really want to work with kids and I want to work on my courage and social skills. I am very critical of myself but if the teachers tell me they'd love to have me I think this could work out.
I want to be the best version of myself for everyone involved.
Please don't tell me I shouldn't do it. As I said, I've thought and talked a lot about my concerns and sulotions.
I was just hoping someone on here had a similar experience and could tell me how they managed to work with kids and help them instead of being a concern or making trouble and how your anxiety developed with this kind of work.

English isn't my mother language. I hope what I said is understandable. Thanks for reading."
484,2,"Hi all. Just needed to get this off my chest.

I met my girlfriend’s parents and family for the first time this weekend. We went to a restaurant which has always been my kryptonite. I’m an older adult now, but for some reason, no matter what I do, I just can’t talk properly at restaurants. It’s like my voice leaves me. I’ve tried breathing techniques, medication, supplements .nothing works.

It’s not like I go completely mute. I’m just very quiet. It’s really hard for me to project my voice and speak normally in these settings, so I usually stick to small talk with the person next to me. It’s something that has absolutely crippled me for years.

Anyway  I met her family, and at dinner, I did my best. I smiled, made small talk with them, even tried to joke around a little. Afterwards, I actually felt okay and proud of myself for getting through it. Later we went back to their house and played games, and I actually felt really good like I’d done the best I could.

But two days later, my girlfriend called and basically berated me saying I was too quiet, saying she always had to tell me to go say hi to her parents, etc. It crushed me. I felt so horrible about myself. I really thought I’d done well given my limits.

And I know a lot of people will say, “You deserve a girlfriend who treats you better,” or “Find someone who understands you.” But the reality is girls don’t want to be with some shy, quiet, ""mute"" guy. I know that. It’s just my day-to-day. I’m not looking for a perfect partner. I just wish I didn’t feel so ashamed right now.

Anyway, that’s all. Just needed to vent. Thanks for reading."
485,2,"Suggestions would be nice, il let you know how it went. "
486,2,I feel anxious about playing with people online. Like I can’t even socialize with people online. Am I broken?
487,2,"so my feelings of detachment feel justified. i just can't think of words to say, in any given social situation. sometimes i do say something, but to me it sounds stupid because i'm not confident enough in what i'm saying, or it sounds pointless and like something nobody cares about. sometimes i ask people how they are or some other question, but i don't know how to keep it going. i feel like i don't know anything, and that i have nothing to say. i feel bad for smiling sometimes, because i don't want to be inauthentic to people, but the alternative is just zoning out and being noticeably detached from the situation. i can be near someone, in a car or wherever, for hours, and i won't say a word. the other person might. 

It's hard to have courage, if there's someone i want to connect with i just think about it instead of doing anything, and i hit a wall.

i cope with negative thoughts and feelings mainly by just scrolling social media, but for me it's an unhealthy coping mechanism that leaves me feeling empty and disoriented. 

When i talk to people sometimes i get jealous. i don't talk a lot myself, but hearing someone else go on about something makes me feel worse about myself sometimes. i could envy someone's ability to talk well, or their thing that they're talking about, like an interest or an achievement of theirs, but jealousy makes me feel like i shouldn't be around these people. id doesn't feel like direct jealousy or envy, i think i'm naturally turn whatever i can against myself. i'd really hate to be jealous of a friend, but listening to people sometimes makes me feel worthless. i know i shouldn't feel this way. 

today me and a friend i used to be kind of in a relationship with after high school hung out. at the end of the day, we sat in the grass and talked about stuff in between intervals of silence and of looking at the sky. because this is someone i can share things with. we talked about relationship stuff, and finally about how he would want to do a short term thing for the summer and nothing more, and i agreed. so we kissed for a while. the reason that relates to social anxiety i guess is because i guess i've told them i have trouble talking sometimes, i want to improve for this person, is it better to do things for yourself or other people? i don't do either

Idk how do you be authentic? and i don't want to smoke weed or do drugs to feel authentic anymore, i quit 8 months ago. I want to build something. i'm twenty years old, i want to create goodness in my life so i can be good for other people, so i want to be good to myself so i can be good to other people. idk what i want. i'm just stuck feeling negative. i feel like i'm oozing in black sludge like in princess mononoke, i feel like i'm consumed by a fear of my surroundings and of my inadequacy. 

so when i'm near someone there is an immediate internal conflict between the part of me that wants to be alone with my thoughts and the part of me that wants friends and human connection. i want to connect with people so bad, i love my friends, i ghost people that i really would like to hang out with, i just don't want to be afraid of what is good. i don't want to be afraid of appearing stupid in a conversation. i want to be the best version of myself

but all i do is think! i could think for hours, i could lay in bed and think about things forever. the thoughts i think suck, they go nowhere, or they are fantasy. and then when i go out in the world i'm bogged down because i'm thinking too much. but it also feels like i have nothing to say! t

theres a metaphor in this book the transmigration of timothy archer where the main girl goes to this class taught by a spirit guru or something, and he offers her a sandwich saying she can't eat words. i have a vague idea of what my sandwich is, i have hobbies and stuff, but i'm directionless.

i want to go to work towmorrow and connect with people. theres a girl who might like me. i'm working on accepting awkwardness, but after a while it feels like i'm just going to be awkward forever. 

i feeldepressed, i just started taking methylphenidate because i was diagnosed with adhd

kissing that friend felt kind of wrong, but i mean in my thinking in the past i've thought about just being casual with him andabout how it'd be fun. that is related to my social anxiety. 

bruh







"
488,2,"So I'm sitting here in my local deli eating a breakfast sandwich by myself and next to me is a table with a group of around 8 retired guys.  It's non stop talk and laughter over there.   It's mostly small talk and stories about stuff they know about.

I'm sitting here thinking about just how uncomfortable I would be in a group like that.  Not because I'm shy, but I literally have no clue what to talk about or say.   I would be totally quiet and feel out of sorts. 

TLDR:  does anyone else just not have a clue what to say to people instead of just being shy?"
489,2,"Just like in titile. I wonder where you feel relaxed. I for example cope with stress by playing video games. 

Btw
My therapist push me to write this post:)"
490,2,"Basically as the title says. I'm taking all online classes because it's both flexible and more convenient. I've already been dropped from a course because I couldn't muster up the courage to show up to the Zoom meetings. Several of my classes involve group projects at some point this semester and I know I won't be able to handle them.

My anxiety hasn't yet become severe enough that I can't show up to work, and in general it's technically much improved compared to how I was a few years ago, but I've noticed that I'm slowly becoming selectively mute again -- even my coworkers joke about how I only ever communicate by just nodding.

I can't bring up my worsening mental health problems to my family. I'm too afraid to see a doctor or a therapist because the last time I did, I was locked up in a psych ward for almost a year because I was deemed too ""dangerous to myself"". However, I can feel that I'm spiraling down again. My sleep schedule is a wreck because I'm constantly plagued by worries and fear. I can't bring myself to buy groceries anymore ever since someone loudly greeted me once while I was at Walmart really early in the morning and then they attempted to strike up a conversation with me... I seriously can't afford food delivery with my minimum wage job so I'm eating just one meal a day now since I've gone through all of the food in my kitchen already.

Today a repairman came in to check up on something in my apartment and I was too terrified to answer my door so I hid in my bedroom and pretended that I wasn't there. It really scared me badly. 

I don't know how I'm going to get through college this semester. Should I just drop out and work minimum wage jobs for the rest of my life? I think that's probably going to be the case even if I manage to graduate with a degree. I'm hoping that maybe in the future I'll be able to get a job that lets me work night shifts by myself. That's the only future I can imagine for myself."
491,2,"im 20m and ive always struggled socially. idk if its autism ive never tried to get diagnosed but i just wanna be able to socialise. i have limited friends and have only ever had 1 gf. i recently even tried them roblox games that pairs you with strangers and i was a nervous reck. im okay at talking to people through messages but still not the best, idk how to start conversations and am especially awkward with women. does anyone have any tips that will actually help or things i can do to grow out of this and meet people in a somewhat comfortable way? thanks :)"
492,2,I've never had friends or anything in life always been alone for most of my life. I work predominantly alone and am embarrassed by the way I look and the way I talk. I feel like I'll never make any friends or a girlfriend. I'm 27 so I'm past the age of going out to meet people at concerts and stuff and don't want to be seen as that weird old guy hanging out. Any advice?
493,2,"Why I can't be normal human? Everyone are enjoying their happy life while im struggling with making basic human interactions, can't make good impression on anyone and everyone looks weird at me. It always makes me sad when i see others spending time with their friends and just being happy while I'm alone. Why me. Fucking anxiety."
494,2,"
Someone approached me after class our very last class (and final exam day) and started asking me questions about the test, my name, where I was from. I also asked him questions too to be polite, hoping there were no other intentions. However, when I was about to walk out the door to leave, he asked for my number. I asked why? He said to keep in touch and asked me if I had a boyfriend. I said I wasn’t looking for one.

I never talked to this guy ever, not even for a group project, so I think you can understand why I would not want to chat or meet up with a stranger. They were in my class once a week and that was it.

Has anything like this happened to any of you before? I also happened to have borrowed a calculator form the library so I kinda had a panic attack (pacing up and down), but eventually got the courage to walk back in there to return it (and potentially face the guy I rejected again).

TLDR; a guy’s failed attempt to get a date completely out of blue on my final day of school making me feel tremendous anxiety and dread "
495,2,I always get so uncomfortable with eye contact with people because people always stare at and will not look away. I always have to be the one to look away and then I’m afraid of confrontation will start if I don’t look away and I can never stand up for myself or the people I love.
496,2,"I've faced a lot of social rejection growing up so now I just naturally feel unwanted wherever I go. 
I hate hearing advice that's like ""as long as you love yourself you don't need anyone 🥰🥰🥰"" No, I do in fact NEED people. We're social creatures. I hate being alone no matter how confident I am in myself. It's lonely and all I want is to be wanted by other people. But it just feels like noone cares and noone wants me around, which makes me feel worthless no matter how much self-love talk I tell myself. How do you get ""wanted""?"
497,2,"Long story short, my mom signed me up for this summer camp to be a counselor to raise my self-confidence and to help me get out of my comfort zone and I went to one of the meetings a few days ago and it was mostly girls and I knew them but I wasn’t friends with them. I just saw them in the hallways in school.

Anyway, it was really awkward because all the girls were sitting with each other and then it was just me and the other boys and two of the boys were friends, and then the other kid looked as shy as me. 

Basically what I’m getting at here is that I’m not 100% an introvert, but I’m not really an outrovert either and I’m really nervous for when the camp actually starts. The groups are gonna be changed each week and there is 2 to 3 people in each group, including a group leader. 

I’m still so nervous, any tips?
"
498,2,"with all the important things in life many are steps above me and i can't help but think that if they knew where i am now compared to them it would be met with pity or smug satisfaction from those i didn't get along with, like they knew i wouldn't go as far in life as them

ultimately these people aren't in my life anymore so it's none of their business, but my brain doesn't seem to care , i know really i should just let people from the past go and keep moving on forward but in low moments my brain looks back and compares

this is more depression post i guess, but the reason why i'm not getting ahead is mainly due to SA because a lot of accomplishment in life requires making and keeping a good impression "
499,2,"it’s been a year into the school year and i haven’t made a single friend and it’s all my fault, these two girls were trying to be my friend but i got nervous and made it seemed like i hated them. i do wanna be their friend but it’s my fault. idk what to do because i tried to talk to these girls and we had a bunch in common but im so boring and awkward and they just don’t like me. i don’t wear makeup like the other girls because im not allowed to. 

idk what to do everyone i wanna talk to is to cool for me and im boring and a loser who can’t speak to ppl. i just wish i can just be cool for once. "
500,2,"I have no idea how to fix this internally, but I'm horrible with eye contact. I'm so anxious I can't manage it with strangers. Then I think as a result if it's a repeated environment, people end up thinking I'm arrogant etc. Which is not the case, I'm just horribly anxious. 

Anyone else bad with this? "
501,2,"For context, I have ADHD. Have been in and out of treatment basically my whole life.

Things have been looking up in my personal life. I was bullied a lot as a kid. I was fired from my first job out of college. I went from a fairly abusive relationship, working a fairly toxic job, to moving across the country to close the gap on a healthy/loving relationship in January. I have been employed for 2 months at a new job.  The work environment feels functional and healthy. I get the vibe that my bosses respect work/life balance, aren't going to take advantage of me and that they value direct and clear communication. Woo hoo!

However, because of my past experiences, I constantly feel like the other shoe is going to drop. To give an example: next week, there's overtime available (working on the weekends, and the option to come in an hour earlier and/or later if you're available). I asked if I could take shorter lunches in addition to working an extra hour each day. My boss responded that she'd like me to take my normal lunch. She usually likes people to have more time under their belt before they make schedule adjustments like that. However, we could chat about it down the line once I've worked here longer. 

The logical side of my brain thinks that's a good thing. They probably want to make sure I'm able to do a similar output when I do OT. It's also better if I ramp up into taking on more OT so I avoid burnout (this is my first FT job after moving; to use a metaphor, you wouldn't just go to the gym and pick up the heaviest weights but gradually lift more. Same logic applies here). I also had a good first month performance review and people seem to like me well enough. Also having an hour lunch in the middle of the day means I'll get to relax more, do my hobbies, go for a walk... whatever I feel like!

The emotion side of my brain, however, is telling me that they're just waiting for a moment to fire me. That I broke an unspoken social rule and that's why my boss didn't approve of my idea. That they're mad at me for not taking on as much of the OT as I possibly could (which doesn't make sense lol), and that they won't let me take a shorter lunch as a soft form of control (another thing that logically *doesn't make sense* and feels paranoid).

I'm trying to read between the lines because when I haven't done that before, I've gotten in trouble. Or I'm aware of norms other people care about that I don't (like an unspoken rule in the office is 'say good morning to everyone when you get in'; I noticed that everyone does that, and I do it. It makes me anxious, I don't care if other people don't do it to me.... but I see how it makes people feel good and it takes no time, so I do it). But also some of my thoughts don't feel rooted in The Now and feel rooted in The Past. 

Has anyone else struggled with this? I don't want to just take what people say at face value (there's a lot of communication that's nonverbal; people can be manipulative; there's norms people care about that I wouldn't do naturally if I didn't pay attention), but I also notice a lot of paranoia in my thoughts that I'd like to get better at managing.

Tl;Dr struggling with social anxiety; not sure how to differentiate working in a world of neurotypical people who move through the world in a way I don't, bad past experiences and what feelings are rooted in reality. What has been helpful to navigate these feelings for y'all? "
502,2,"For example when an acquantaince is greeting me I sometimes have a delayed response. Not out of hate or anything but I'm lost in my thoughts most of the time. For me it happens alot, I end up fumbling when socializing with people. It's almost always that or whatever I say or do come out super awkwardly, and ironically I am not really animated in mannerisms but it's still pretty awkward.

I hate how some other people would try and villianize you for it or try to portray you as stupid/slow when that's not the case. When I'm in my thoughts I have alot on my mind. Lots of stresses, thoughts about the future. Pondering about the past still, unfortunately. But anyway the delayed response is not out of rudeness. I feel bad though because many people probably will take it as that. We already have a stigma of being seen as stuck-up anyway, especially us who have social anxiety and have a resting mad face.  I'm gonna be completely honest too—I'm always stuck in this thought process that ""everybody hates me"" and fear them thinking that I hate them when I really don't. I try not to hate people (although a few people make it hard for me). The other thing that I fear is fumbling the interaction and being unable to fix it and it eats me alive often about what went wrong.

I also dislike how social anxiety is sometimes potrayed as us ""just being shy."" It's not that simple—social anxiety is moreso based on the fear of judgement. I can be close or very open to someone and still face the anxiety so it's not even about shyness. "
503,2,"About 2 years from now April I start noticing my classmates who seat beside start covering their nose or moving away from me but I ignore it but the next day it happens again and again for weeks so I start noticing it. After school me and my sister went to dollar store and we were talking but all of the sudden she asked me if I fart I said “no”, the next morning at school it happens again so I start getting conscious so I went and ask my sister if she can smell something off on me and she said “no” cause I’ve been always hygienic, shower everyday, brushing my teeth wearing deodorant, wear different clothes everyday and I have dry earwax so maybe I have a gene that doesn’t make me smell bad. So I start thinking maybe the odour is coming from my nose because before all of this starts happening I had a really bad period cramps at school and I threw up and tried to hold it some come out in my nose. So I think the only way they wont smell me is to hold my breath, cover my nose when breathing so they won’t smell it or keep sniffing to the point my other period classmates starts getting annoyed but it kinda works so I got convinced that the foul smell is coming from my nose I do that everyday, hold my breath in the hallway for every room change break, sitting beside someone at public transport, standing in class and its tiring to the point i hold breath till my lips turn white and it’s exhausting,  so I always ask my sister, my mom, my friend and but they think that I’m going crazy I tried to believe them, maybe they’re right maybe Its just in my head not until I heard the guy who sit besides me whisper “It stink” to his friend. Start missing  a lot of classes, isolating myself crying in my room, overthinking what will happen the next day, social anxiety, I avoid events or people more often than before because Im really embarrassed when people rub or cover their nose completely when I walk past them or walk in front of them, seat beside them and thinking they’re talking shit about me but I cant blame them, i feel sorry for them they have to endure it.

I have 2 sisters they’re from overseas they visit for Christmas I asked them if I smell they said “no”, I thought its gonna be over once I heard that from them but its still happening all people I walked past they cover their nose, hearing people that I stink, laughing at me. Im writing this experience because I’m tired of it I did everything buy nasal spray, gargle mouthwash, spray perfume, spraying deodorant all throughout my body, drinking ginger tea every night, stop eating to make me less gassy , scrape my tongue, brush my teeth, visit dentist,  take very hot shower ever night in return I get anxiety, stress, cant sleep properly overthinking, stomachache, headache, become very gassy, people talking behind my back, laughing at me. I need help"
504,2,"I was always so anxious about making an account and following my classmates for some reason, but i finally did it today!! Its pretty embarrassing cause i have like no followers, but whatever. I was literally shaking pressing the follow button. SA really makes you worry about stupid shit 😭"
505,2,"I'm naturally an anxious person due to past experiences with unkind people. I probably feel things a little too much/deeply because of also potentially being(undiagnosed)neurodivergent on top of lived experiences. I 'do' love giving hugs though, and I love giving them to the point the people receiving them receive them long enough to feel the love/support/comfort. I've even had a friend introduce her dad to me when he came into town and said, 'she gives the best hugs, you should get a hug from her'. He did and he agreed with her.  I've recently met someone that probably has about as much anxiety as me and I want to do this for them. But I'm not sure if they're ok with hugs especially since they aren't the same gender, and I am older. Is it ok to ask them if I can give them a hug? I wanted to do that this week but then was feeling like I was getting mixed signals from them because they wanted to sit with me on our commute, and we talked during it, but they crossed their arms for part of it. I felt like the arm crossing was just taking the place of them not picking at their nails or doing some other anxiety coping thing though. I should not be this clueless, but I've spent a lot of my life not being more than superficial with most people because then there's less chance of doing something 'wrong', right?"
506,2,"I have a partner, a couple good friends, and good relationships with family, so I’m not saying I’m completely alone. I am grateful for the people I do have and for the fact that the people in my life seem to think I am a good person and take the time to make me feel that way.

But I have a few friends and family members in my life who are just surrounded by beautiful friends and have such sweet relationships with the people in their life. I see them post on social media and their comments are filled with people gushing about what an amazing and special person they are. Their friends go all out for their birthdays. They have people constantly talking to them and coming to visit them. Their college experience was so different from mine where they were constantly out having fun adventures with their group of friends. And sometimes I just feel so inferior as a person and like I am somehow less special because I struggle to foster good connections like that and because people don’t really ask me to do things like that. I feel like I have good friendships with the people in my life and that I am a generous and kind person. I try really hard to do nice things for my friends and family and to make people feel loved and special. But sometimes I feel like the years I spent being socially anxious and not really knowing how to make friends or be in a close friendship with people (because I didn’t have much experience with it) have prevented me from creating community like that and sometimes I have a really hard time not equating my self worth to how many people I have in my life wanting to make me feel special. It feels kind of selfish in a way but it’s a feeling I have constantly when I see other people seemingly fostering such beautiful community and relationships. Some of it is that I think I just wish I had people in my life like that and I crave that feeling of closeness with people, but I also think it sometimes makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me that people don’t like me as much. "
507,2,"I fucking hate getting talked to like a kid, it won’t be outright but I can definitely notice when people are taking to me differently, like in a way that I know they’re making fun of me but I can’t say anything because they’re “technically” not saying anything wrong, it pisses me off so much like I just want to be taken seriously, just cause I don’t want to talk/ I’m awkward doesn’t mean I’m any different, I want to be taken seriously and live my life"
508,2,"I don’t know if they’re anxiety attacks, but I have the strangest trigger that sets me OFF. Gas stations. I go to them regularly and sometimes I’m fine but other times my hands shake and my vision goes blurry and I can’t talk. It only happens when I’m paying. I would get like this when I would give speeches in school. It’s such an over the top reaction to something so dull. Does anyone else have a weird place or time when your social skills fly out the window and you go into a full panic? "
509,2,"this is just a rant, but i really feel like i did nothing the past four years. i’m finally graduating in about two weeks and i just feel so disappointed in what my high school experience actually was. this was never what i had envisioned for myself when i thought about what high school would be like for me. i didn’t even go to my prom. and i thought that would be one of the best experiences of my life. the past four years i have literally just gone to school and went straight back home. i wasn’t in any clubs, didn’t do any sports, and it’s not even like i have the grades to make up for it. i did get into my top choice for uni, so that’s good but that’s pretty much all i have going for me. and it’s not like i didn’t have any friends growing up. i went to the same school from kindergarten up until eighth grade, so i never worried about that. even going into high school i wasn’t worried since some of my friends from elementary were going to the same school. but then we just grew apart and stopped talking. i had never been in the position where i had to actually make friends so i just didn’t try at all. all everybody ever talks about is how great high school is and how it will be the best time of your life and to make the most of it, but i just barely made it through with what feels like nothing to show for it. and i just feel even worse because now i have an assignment for one of my classes that makes us look back on our school experience and what we did during this time, but ofc i have nothing memorable or meaningful to add (and there’s sections where we have to add pictures from high school with friends or wtv). i just hope my uni experience will be better because i do not want to go through all this again 💀. "
510,2,"I am an autistic person, and although I academically perform well, I basically just forget about almost anything, and that includes reminding myself to be careful about what to say to people when in conversations.

It's just, it irritates me so bad whenever I realize that I get loose whenever I talk to people I *think* I'm comfortable talking to, and then someone reminds me that what I did actually made that person feel uncomfortable and now I'm going into this downward spiral of self-doubt and wishing that I should've did it correctly without anyone feeling bad. It happened a lot of times to me.

So, what's optimally a better way for me to be careful about what I say in coversations as an autistic person?"
511,2,"I have a friend let’s just call him Chris I guess (pls don’t get mad for ”revealing his name” it’s not real) Chris is quite loud he’s autistic and is the type to do stuff in class and get in trouble. Since my timetable changed for the new year (it changes a few weeks before summer so we can get used to it) I only share maths with him now and tbh I’m kinda happy and sad about it on one side I’m sad because I have only one class with one of my friends and I’m kinda happy too because he would always include me in the things he did and I would get embarrassed it’s not really a toxic relationship he doesn’t really understand that I don’t like being the Center of attention like that and I’m too scared to explain social anxiety to him. The only class I share with him now is Maths and we sit directly in the middle of the room and as usual he gets up to antics and starts talking to everyone this Is the class I’m not really included in it so I’m fine there the only problem is that I start overthinking about what he could do and if it could include me because he’s so unpredictable. Another thing a few days ago we found a working speaker in a bin idk how it still works I was ok with playing music on it where we were because we were alone but now he’s saying he’s gonna bring it in on Monday and start playing music in fucking school not to mention I have a English presentation that I thought wasn’t happening so next week is just going to perfect isn't it…….

TLDR: I have an autistic extroverted friend who ends up embarrassing me a lot and he doesn’t understand I’m socially anxious he’s still my friend and I don’t hate him for it though."
512,2,"
Hi sooo I’m a super shy person... like extra shy. The type of shy that feels sorry just for existing :< I overthink every little thing and I have BPD (I do see a therapist btw).

Because of all that, I literally have no friends or anyone to talk to. I get too in my head, too scared to text first, and when I’m around people I act all robotic just so I don’t embarrass myself. I never act like me.

But I’m sooo done with that. I’m tired of feeling stuck. I want to stop caring what anyone thinks. Even if they say something, so what? I want to be free.

I always feel jealous of people who just live their truth, be themselves, and don’t care what others say or think. Like (entp/enfp/..) But today, I don’t want to just watch and wish. I want to *be* that.

I want to live loud, real, and free. I want to feel like me for once.

And honestly… I need help and guides walk me through what to actually do. 

I don’t mean advice like “just be confident” or “don’t overthink” I mean something real. Something that actually moves something inside, something that helps me break out of this cage.

I’ve told myself this a hundred times before. Made the same promises. But I never follow through. I don’t want to keep living like this. 

"
513,2,"This is just kind of a rant, but I need to get my feelings out. I’m 20, and I graduated from high school last year. Afterward, I started working at various part-time jobs, but I always ended up quitting soon after I began. Sometimes, I had valid reasons, such as starting university., but most of the time, I was just trying to rationalize or defend my decision to quit the job to others, when in reality, it was always the fact that no matter which job I had, they always made me feel anxious.

I tried being a waitress, which was too stressful, so I worked at a factory because I thought, “I’m just gonna be doing the same thing for eight hours; that’ll be fine,” but my sensitive ass struggles to handle even the slightest criticism or off tone, and I quit after a week. Often, I clean, which is what I’m doing currently. Cleaning is mostly fine, but I always dread going to work anyway. I’m scared I won’t do a good enough job or have to ask people for products. I’m also obligated to look for another part-time job where I work at least 15 hours a week, as I quit university a couple of months ago, but I plan on returning in October. So, until then, I literally have to do *something*.

The thing is, I know I’m making things unnecessarily complicated for myself. I didn’t have to quit uni, and I’m still living with my dad at the moment, so I don't even have to worry about rent at the moment. But I want to have enough money to buy things for others and myself, I want to help at home, I want to be able to participate in activities with my friends without always being in debt afterward. I don’t know. I’m sure I’m not the only one who has experienced this or is experiencing this currently. I also know there’s not a lot I can do about my anxiety. I’ve tried pretending I’m actually happy to go to work, I’ve tried staying completely neutral or letting myself wallow in it. I’ve tried just letting it be, and the dread never goes away. It’s just two hours of my day- not even every day- but I can’t stand it. I do go to therapy, but there's more pressing issues that we're discussing at the moment, so I haven't really talked about my anxiety related to work that much. Maybe some of you have found ways to cope with it. It just frustrates me. "
514,2,"
I don’t really know how to write in English, so if anything sounds off or weird, that’s the reason.



I planned the trip and was relying on the idea that only one person I like would be going, but what if that person doesn’t go? Everything will feel completely ruined.
Before even waking up for this, my anxiety already hit me, and now I’m stuck thinking about all the ways I could end up embarrassing myself there. It would honestly be so much better if I could just keep sleeping and skip the trip.
I keep thinking about what it’ll be like to cross the street, to get there and meet up with everyone to take the bus together, to walk into the school, and to feel everyone’s eyes on me.
I really regret it.
I wish people would give me tips on how to get through this trip and tolerate everything that comes with it."
515,2,feels like any bit of progress you have made over the years has been undone cause you are still awkward as hell 
516,2,"I was never a crash out person but I generally tended to defend friends and people from bullies. About 2 years ago I went in trouble against what you guys would call it a ""gang"" because I helped a friend who was getting bullied by one of them at the bar. After that I got a lot of fear going outside and having to face them. For almost 2 years I couldn't go out alone, I would have panick attacks and what not. Couldn't even go to the grocery stores by myself or even buy a book. I still have this fear that nobody would help me if I get physically hurt or if I have a panick attack. I discovered recently about exposure therapy and I'm forcing myself to do it step by step. I've been sick last week and this week I restarted doing it gradually but today (Friday) I feel so overwhelmed and exhausted.. Do you guys have any tricks about this? Is it normal to get like, rest? Thank you, I feel so embarrassed to write about all of this"
517,2,"I feel like I experience social anxiety differently than how it's described. From what I always read, overcoming anxiety is described as 'just finding the courage to say what's on your mind' but my problem is a bit more messy than that.

My issue is not 'having something to say, and not finding the courage to speak up.' My issue is that I get massive brain fog, and I can't think of anything to say whatsoever. Even if I *was* more outgoing, I'm speechless in-the-moment. Does anyone else relate to that??

I’ve spoken to therapists about this, and they all suggest practicing in public like in social-clubs, etc. But If I’m just making small talk with a cashier or in a club that I have no vetted interest, I can talk to them just fine. You'd never assume that I had social anxiety based on scenarios. It’s whenever I’m trying to get to know someone on a deeper level that a switch is flipped, and suddenly, I feel like my brain goes completely blank, and I feel like a passenger in my own body. At that point, I don't know how else I'm supposed to ""practice"" when I can't think of anything to say. 

As of the last few months, it's gotten especially bad, and I'd love any more advice than just 'practice.' Thanks! "
518,2,"I was always confused when people would just tell me not to worry about what other people think and just be myself and worry about my own actions. However, this doesn't make sense to me because there are things scientifically proving that we can do certain things to influence people in a specific way. Is it 100% absolute, no, but there are certain things you can do that has been shown in general to have a consistent effect. For example, if I want people to see me as a cheerful person, I would make myself smile and laugh a lot and more times than not they will. If I want people to think I'm anti social I would purposely avoid people and not want to talk to anyone. If I walk in a room with my chest out and head held high, especially talking in a confident assertive way I am controlling people to more times than not see me as confident. If I want to make someone feel a negative emotion like anger, fear, sadness, anxiety, confusion I would go and punch them. If I want people to treat me better in general, I would control their perception of me to see me more positively on average by improving the way I dress like wearing a suit compared to a dingy shirt with a stain and old ripped up basketball shorts. If we weren't able to control people, the whole concept of manipulation wouldn't exist.

There are many more examples and again I acknowledge you can't completely control anyone, a lot of us don't even have control over ourselves, but there are things that are proven you can do to help further your chances to get a certain outcome from people."
519,2,"So I'm forty now, have been for a few months. Anyways, I go to the grocery store to pick up some odds and ends, and there's this group of teenage dudes just being goofy. I try to avoid them and go the next aisle for a few minutes and when I decide to head to the counter I almost run into one of them, and he says ""sorry, sir"" and his eyes go to the ground.

I hate being called Sir. Honestly I'll always be a kid at heart and that really hurts me. Might be an odd post for social anxiety but I don't like thinking of myself as someone who isn't young, maybe that's because I didn't live my youth very much. Or barely at all. I get more depressed by the day thinking my youth is gone."
520,2,"Many people label us as rude because we tend to omit and avoid all kinds of social behaviors out of discomfort. In many cases, we avoid doing the right thing out of fear, not because we don't want to. We run away as if we were in danger from situations as simple as saying hello, giving up a seat for an older person, or even performing basic acts of kindness.

I'm sorry I didn't say hello that time. I swear I wanted to, and my brain was screaming at me, ""You have to,"" but I couldn't. I understand that you might feel offended; after all, we can't guess what that person is thinking, and I understand. But I also invite you to open your mind and consider other equally possible possibilities, like, ""Maybe the person isn't being rude, they're just very shy.""

It's not that I don't want to do it; it's just that it's quadruple the effort!"
521,2,"Do you recall when it started and when it became persistent?

On another note, it helped me a lot to be able to laugh at myself and my mistakes. Like if I’m having trouble getting out a word, I’ll laugh and say “wow hard for me to say that right now” but I’ll try again or keep it lighthearted."
522,2,"Well, it still exists with men. I feel like others are laughing and staring at me, and it often drives me crazy. But I've gotten involved in a lot of sports, made some friends, and my anxiety around men my age has generally eased. I still have difficulty with new people and strangers; I can't look them in the face or in the eyes, but it's much worse with women. If I enter a place where there are girls (especially those my age), I feel like they're staring at me all the time and laughing. Talking to any girl is one of the most difficult experiences I've ever had in my life, even to ask for a pen or something similar. Sitting with girls at school sometimes makes me look like an idiot. I freeze up and act very strangely, staring at the ground and moving around strangely. Although I have some female friends, it's usually a problem with strangers.

Is the solution to practice, as I did before with males? Would trying to talk or communicate work? I really hate this, I'm tired of acting like a crazy in front of everyone, everyone at my new high school made fun of me because of it "
523,2,"I have had anxiety since grade school. Just recently started medication for it last march and it has helped. Anxiety still there but not as severe. I have always had a hard time keeping a job. If there is any drama or conflict at work I don’t want to go in anymore. I end up taking a day off and then eventually end up finding a new job or quitting. I have had a lot of jobs. It’s embarrassing and I know my husband is disappointed in me. I’m so nervous to find another new job after I have my baby in August. I’m worried it’ll be the same old thing for me and so does my husband, he doesn’t have much faith in me at all. But it will be part time and maybe that will be easier for me than full time, maybe it will make a difference that I won’t have to be at work as much and will have time to decompress. It drains me so much being around people and working a social job with customers and trying to make friends with coworkers (which never works out for me, I’m too awkward to hangout outside of work) just really makes me burn out fast. No one seems to understand and I feel defeated. Anyone else feel this way ? I hope I’m not alone."
524,2,"There’s a fair in town that comes every summer and I want to go but I know no one’s going to ask me to go with them. So I want to go but idk how to. Should I bring my sister, but then I need to bring my family and they are obviously are gonna want me to pay for all of them. And I want to go alone but I don’t want to seem weird being seen by people at school because I’m alone. But at the same time it might be peaceful. But I also have like no friends to hang out with. So what should I do? Should I even bother going?

525,2,"I was reading about this med and I saw that at this dose does trasodone does not helps with Major Depressive Disorder. But helps with social anxiety and and mild depression: ""75 mg might help mild depression or as an adjunct to another antidepressant"". I am in the hospital and venlafaxine 75mg XR helped me a lot, Zoloft does not helps me anymore, so it was a switch. Psychiatrist 2 weeks after I started use venlafaxine, she removed 125-> 100mg and 3 weeks more she removed to 50mg (that was one day ago) and she will tomorrow remove to zero. But she will add in two days venlafaxine to 150mg XR. But she also added me trasodone 75mg for sleep, and I am interested in how much will trasodone help at tjat low dose!? Anyone has experience with trasodone?
Or even with this combo?"
526,2,Where I'm out alone I constantly feel anxious and that everyone is judging me. But when I'm with friends I'm super confident and outgoing. Idk why. I've found that being tired helps me not care what others think but that's messing up my grades. How do I manage my social anxiety?
527,2,"My nieces graduation party is sat and my sister invited our whole family. I haven’t seen some cousins/aunts/uncles in years. I know I’m gonna get asked what I’ve been up to job, relationship etc. i suck at lying and my sister has opened her mouth to my cousins and uncles that I don’t go out and I have social anxiety. I’m 30, unemployed. All week I’ve been so nervous. I’m hoping it goes well that day. I’m more worried about the blushing and sweating that happens when I get anxious.  "
528,2,"Times have been extremely tough financially and I've been forced to get 2nd job. Applied to almost everywhere for almost everything and I finally managed to land an offer being a server at a restaurant.

In the end, I accepted and I start next week cuz im desperate for extra cash. 

Is anyone in here a server and if so how do you do it? How do you manage? TIA."
529,2,"This isn't a specific situation. I have severe social anxiety and in turn, act very strange. Today, I saw someone who bullied me in school and she started laughing at me because of my weird mannerisms. This happens with everybody. I'm not well liked. I'm looked down upon and bullied by pretty much everyone. That whole incident almost made me burst into tears, but I didn't until I git home. Am I overreacting? 

Every social situation where someone shows even the slightest amount of dislike towards me, I get angry, scared or sad and ruminate on it for the rest of the day. I've been told many times before that others' opinions of me don't matter. I really want to stop caring what anyone thinks of me, but It almost feels impossible. It seems to come so easy to those around me.

My mom just laughs it off in a cocky manner, doesn't even give it a second thought. I really wish I could do that! 

Some guy that I've never known and who means nothing to me said ""I'm not with HER!"" and backed away from me after a desk lady asked if he was with me. I felt bad about that, but I don't even know him! I can absolutely despise someone and them saying something rude will get to me and I'll wonder why they didn't accept me as if their opinion mattered at all! 

How do I overcome this? I guess it stems from feeling bad because I was rejected by even that person I don't hold in high regard! It makes me feel awful and I feel that everyone else is more a part of society than I will ever be and being rejected by them is like being rejected by society as a whole.

"
530,2,"every time i go out on the street, i feel like people are laughing at my appearance. men and women. even though i don’t see anything wrong with how i look and i've received compliments in real life.

i literally record videos and take pictures from different angles and i see absolutely nothing wrong and i almost never use filters in photos, except the one i’m using here.

am i different in real life? i don’t know, i’ve asked a lot of people i know if i look the same as in pictures and videos, even people i'm not that close to, and they all say: dude, you look exactly the same in person.

but why the hell do people keep looking at me and laughing on the street??? especially women???

not long ago i passed by two girls and one of them said something kind of “smiling” to her friend. she wasn’t actually laughing, it wasn’t something obvious. but she kind of spoke while smiling/lightly giggling. and her friend looked at me, with a neutral and serious face, but didn’t laugh afterward.

what is going on? why do people laugh while they’re with friends and look at me?

people have never looked at me with disgust or anything like that, but it feels like they’re laughing.

someone help me, please share your experiences too!! i’m starting a new job soon and i’m afraid of being bullied because of my appearance (even though i’ve never been bullied before)."

532,2,"Edit: should say **induce in the title 

It seems I have anxiety in social anxiety. But I'm wondering if anyone has a similar presentation. 

When you're feeling social anxiety, how would you describe it? Do you have active thoughts and if so, are your thoughts negative self-talk and worries about what other people are thinking of you? And does body react and feel more 'activate' 

, or does your mind goes blank and floaty and your body gets rigid or feel like it's not in full control and unable to move normally or what feels like 'properly'?

 Is the latter dissociation as someone i talk to mentioned it sounded like? "
533,2,"Lately, I’ve been struggling with something that’s hard to put into words. I live with severe social anxiety, and it’s something that affects me deeply every single day. It shows up as panic attacks that come out of nowhere and completely take over. When it happens, my heart races, my chest tightens, and I feel like the world is closing in on me.
To cope, I’ve started isolating myself. I stay home as much as I possibly can, because that’s the only place where I feel safe. Honestly, I hadn’t stepped outside in four days before today. The idea of being around people, even just going to campus, feels overwhelming. And sure enough, not even an hour after I left the house, I had another panic attack.
In those moments, my instinct is always the same: to leave wherever I am, drop whatever I’m doing, and rush home, back to where I feel like I can breathe. And that’s when I usually reach for a drink. It’s become a coping mechanism, one I really wish I didn’t rely on. I hate it. I’ve tried to go sober multiple times, but when the panic hits, it feels like alcohol is the only thing that can calm me down.
I do have prescribed medication, but honestly, it feels like things are only getting worse. I feel more trapped inside myself than ever. And the hardest part is, no one around me, my family, my partner, really knows how bad it’s gotten. I’ve kept it all hidden. I put on a brave face, I smile, I push through when I have to. But inside, I’m always on edge. I’m exhausted.
"
534,2,"with a lot of mental health problems people say  that talking to other people about it helps. but whenever i tell people i am anxious or i have social anxiety they always don’t know what to say and turn awkward and it does not feel like a safe space for me to speak at all. so talking about it really does not help. but keeping it to myself is so hard because i am so lonely because it feels like i am so uninteresting and worthless. i’m just tired of feeling this way all the time. to combat social anxiety i push myself to do these social events and talk to people but all it does is make me feel worse because it’s always incredibly difficult for me and i come home thinking “that was awful and they definitely did not enjoy speaking to me”. i’m just so overwhelmed with being seen by people, i feel disgusting and worthless and i want to hide away so i don’t have to be seen again. it’s just hard because it’s not the sort of thing you can talk about, like i said, because it just becomes a cycle then because when people know you are socially anxious they start seeing you as socially inept and not someone who they want to be friends with. so i just deal with this alone. "
535,2,"(M16) So for as long as I can remember I was that awkward quiet kid who gets in trouble constantly with low grades. Never had any social connections and when I do talk it doesn't come out smooth which just makes it more frustrating. Struggled to communicate and get friends and even mocked by students and teachers. Girls would giggle at me when I walk past them and teachers would berate me constantly and would be such an ass when I'm just genuinely trying to listen and learn but would suddenly gaslight me into believing that I didn't actually listen and I could never say anything about it because I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TALK. LITERALLY. everyday is a constant struggle. I don't know how to vent because I don't have friends or ANYONE! to really understand what I'm going through and these teachers they really get into my nerves and I just can't take it anymore. I'm really depressed and exhausted and just contemplating about how my life would be. Life sucks rn, everyone is so judgemental except for a few of my friends. It's a huge struggle fr. If you're wondering how I got into this situation: I was raised in another country and English was a 24/7 language for me but then a few years later when I was 13 I returned to my native country and is now currently having generational aura debt. I just wanna end this and get the hell out of here and just finally improve my social skills. Anyone got any advice?"
536,2,"I've pushed everyone but my boyfriend out if my life, and our relationship is not going great either. I have two friends that I text but I never see anyone in person.

I wanted to be an artist but I can't help but hate everything I create, and my depression is so bad I have little energy to do anything. Does anyone have a job that doesn't upset their social anxiety? I also have a physical disability so I can't work in like a warehouse or something."

538,2,"Hello all,

I recently booked a group travel holiday for 24 says to Laos and Cambodja with a travel agency for people my age (20-30). I've done multiple group travel holidays with this organization in the past and always had some anxiety beforehand, bug it generally lessens and it has improved my social abilities. However this time I'm struggleing. We had a group of 3 men (I'm one of those) and 6 female participants, but yesterday one of the men is no longer going. I'm very concerned I will feel lonely amongst all these women and it's cripling me. Apparently there is no ""out"" anymore since the trip is within 4 weeks. The fact that the holiday is this far form home (Belgium) for this long makes it worse ofcourse. On previous trips I had 3-5 men and well balanced groups.

I've worked so hard to get where I am today. I really hope to find some motivation, tips and understanding here."
539,2,"I used to be the most social person around and knew everybody, but during university (3 years ago) I had a few instances where I tried to be funny or insightful but it just fell so flat and got such a bad response that it slowly caused social anxiety. 

I now no longer leave the house except for work and choose to have as little social interactions as possible to mitigate the damage it could cause me mentally. 

I watch people around me and how they get on so well. Through watching I’ve realised that people seem to like it when you smile and are quite witted/funny. 

Every time I try this and be funny or outgoing for once, especially over social media, I am aired or given an awkward expression/reaction. 

Does anybody else suffer from this? 

How do I fit in and talk to people again? 

I don’t want to be boring but find it to be the safest choice. "
540,2,I’ve been obsessed with how I look these days.
541,2,"I have no idea why but when someone asks me where I'm from either on online platforms or real life I get really anxious, knowing that not many people like my country and they might look down at me and won't try to get to know me as who I am if I tell them. Does anyone feel like this? "
542,2,"I started off a friendship on the wrong foot, and we’re both introverts. I got impatient and wanted deep conversations to fulfill my loneliness and it was wrong to think that. I don’t even know if this guy is even interested anymore. I carried a lot of emotional baggage when he approached me to try and talk to me of course he didn’t know this. He would always sit with his group of friends but after he met me he just sits by himself after me and him “used” to sit together until I had to distance myself due to my social anxiety and my mental well being because I did not know how to navigate this. Too soon too fast. It was very awkward and I always filled the silence with my bullshit and eventually I told him what I was going through by text message and even an attempt in person. One time I got so impatient about where things were going with our interactions and I anxiously told him that he wasn’t fulfilling my social needs because he was too quiet. I know that was the social anxiety talking because I also drank tons of coffee at the time so I could talk better but it made it worse. After that really awkward interaction I just don’t know what to do because we never approach each other at school now. He doesn’t like to text so it’s even harder. I don’t really have much social skills or social support either. Idk what’s gonna happen now."
543,2,"Was given propranolol 10mg to use as needed for anxiety. I feel like im stuck in fight or flight. Was told this med helps that. Would it be better to just take this daily for awhile then taper off it? The only downsides I’ve noticed is sometimes it makes me tired, but it gives me insomnia and I also feel like when it wears off I get angry and worse anxiety? Not sure yet if it from the propranolol.

*Do you think I should take it daily to break out of this constant state of fight flight freeze?

*Did you experience insomnia, anger, or worse anxiety?


I know everyone’s different. Just want to hear experiences. Thank you so much.

544,2,"Man, I hate staring because you can never know what it means. I went into a gas station to buy an energy drink and she's staring at me the several seconds it takes me to approach. And yeah, it definitely felt like staring because she didn't 'just glance' it was full on staring. And then when I reach the counter, she mumbles in a low voice.

I feel like people have this weird reaction to me and I can't quite place the reason why. Makes me feel like an oddball or something."
545,2,"I (m 32) developed an underlying social anxiety by some extreme events in the past and it represents as a ""shut down"" and musculare tension in my neck. I went to a lot of therapy and it helped temporary. By regaining cognitive abilities like reading, drawing and be around other people, i relearn to have nice experiences, but the freeze response is still there. Someone else goes through a similar experience or knows what could help in general ?"
546,2,"I have a week left before the end of my studies, and since I'm 16, I can get a job, even my parents are talking about it. but the fucked up thing is that I feel physically and mentally ill and it's hard to go to work. even as a fucking courier, I applied for several vacancies, I was afraid at the same time that they wouldn't answer me, and that they would answer me. I almost went to work as a Courier, even simple food delivery seems to be an impossible task for me, I gave up at the last moment, explaining to my parents that it was impossible to combine it with my studies. it's fucked up in one word. 
my english is bad and I couldn't find the right words, so it might be confusing and all that. Sorry about that. "
547,2,Whenever I’m overwhelmed by a large crowd of people my facial muscles just tighten and I either look like I’m on the verge of tears or holding a shit 😭 how to prevent this?
548,2,"Hi, I have terrible social anxiety as well as agoraphobia, and Im literally terrified to call the office and request an appointment because I struggle with not adequately understanding what the phone call script? I guess? Is going to be. I tend to have less anxiety and be able to move through the interaction better if I am properly prepared. Can anyone just give me a brief run through of what to expect when calling to make a dentist appointment? Like basic things such as what questions they will ask. 

Tldr: It would help me if someone could run through what to expect when calling to make a dentist appointment."
549,2,"I might be completely left-field here, but I just feel a sense of annoyance and envy every time she implies she has this.

Social anxiety has ruined my experience growing up as I'm sure it did for many, so maybe that's why all this negativity strikes me in scenarios like this.

She says she has it because she gets SUPER anxious talking to guys, but in any other scenario, she communicates without any anxiety whatsoever.

While I do believe she has anxiety, I don't think it's social anxiety.

She'll actively make conversation with strangers and give out compliments to any one passing by without batting an eye over the interaction.

Though, that reason alone isn't just it.

When I talk about my own experiences with social anxiety, she acts as if it's somehow controllable.
She tells me I don't really make an effort for it to get better and that I just need to try harder and go talk to people more often despite improving significantly over the last few years compared to the selectively mute hermit I used to be.

I feel like she doesn't get me at all, she acts like the solution is simple and that I'm being dramatic when I talk about things that I did that day that caused my anxiety to spike.

I just feel so isolated and alone when she doesn't understand why I feel the way do. If you have social anxiety then you surely can understand at least a little bit?

Haha, this was more of a vent than anything, I know it's wrong to say whether another person has a disorder or not, but I just really needed to air this off my chest."
550,2,"
So I ended up asking a coworker out to dinner. I do want to get to know her better. So she then asked “today”. So I thought. Maybe it’s a yes. I then texted back saying not today but “sometime” (because I got that text very late in the afternoon). she then asked why I want to go out with her. 
What does this mean?"
551,2,"No matter how much therapy I’ve gotten, how many meds I’ve tried, how many activities I’ve done. I still feel like I never have anything to say to other people. I’ve Been dealing with social anxiety ever since I was young and from then up to this point now, the only thing I feel that has really changed is my ability to sit with my discomforting emotions better. I rarely get overwhelmed to a point where I have to leave the setting altogether these days but my discomfort in these settings still linger to a point where I don’t really enjoy myself in the company of others.. I’m constantly in my head, feeling overwhelmed and struggling to relate to others, so much so that it just feels like I’m dragging along or “going along with it.” My mind just goes blank, my confidence goes out the window, and I feel like I’m improving my way through conversations instead of truly engaging in them.. 

All my therapist has been able to give me is “think logically and rationally” anecdotes which have helped with the coping part of it but not any change on the social discomfort part. I fear as though that this problem has gotten to a point where it is deeply embedded in my unconscious mind and I just have been acting out on a survival mechanism all throughout this time. Because this problem is an embedded trauma, I believe that I can no longer work on it on a logical level. It’s like an onion with many layers of you will.. 

All in all, this is frustrating and it’s made me doubt myself in ways in which I’ve missed out on opportunities, self sabotaged, and slowly became more distant from those that love me."
552,2,"The worst part for me is the anticipatory anxiety. As soon as I am invited anywhere I get a feeling of dread.
I actually like people and talking to them and I am usually OK there but in the lead up I feel awful. Nausea and tired etc. "
553,2,I spend most of my time playing videogames and listening to music and day dream like all day but whenever I go outside I get very anxious and just want to get home as quickly as possible and I always wonder if it's supposed to be like this or am I supposed to fight my anxiety 
554,2,"I want to give running a go but i tried it the other week and had a panic attack and had to go back home. Since then ive been struggling to even go out for walks again which i was doing good at first. I dont know how to get over this fear that someone will approach me when im out or that someone will say something its genuinely driving me insane i just want to live like, I cant even play music because ive got no data. 
P.S the panic attack was because someone yelled something at me and when i replied i was mocked and then couldn’t go back home because i didnt want to walk past again so ended up having to go a weird route that took 20 minutes."
555,2,I had a guy compliment me today while shopping. I'm sure he meant well but it made me feel really awkward. I just didn't know how to react and felt completely taken off guard. Anyone else ever have that experience? What are you supposed to say?
556,2,"hate being an introvert.
I know this phrase has been said many times, and despite stating it, I don’t mean it fully.
There are some aspects of being an introvert that I like, like the part where I get to prioritize my own alone time without feeling alone or lonely. The quiet times I have with myself are the moments I greatly appreciate. But the bad aspects of being an introvert greatly outweigh the good, at least in my life.

It makes me feel like there is constantly something wrong with me, making me question, “Why did I do that?”, “Why didn’t I do that?”, or “I should go and do that, but what if—”and obviously, the self deprecating comments that follow. I think a lot of it lies in confidence. Maybe if I were more confident, I wouldn’t be as introverted as I am. But even at times when I am sure of myself, without anxiety being high, I still feel the same way, I just can’t speak.

I’ve tried so many times and done so many things to put myself out there. But every time I do, it’s always the same result. I’m always the one in the room without someone to talk to, stuck there alone, watching everyone in their own groups, laughing, chatting, looking as comfortable as they can be.

It’s something I hate about myself, because it happens every time, and like I said before, it makes me feel like there is something seriously wrong with me

If you guys have any advice or tips that would be appreciated, thank you :))"
557,2,So I'm 18 and I've had social anxiety pretty much my entire life. I dropped out of school because of it and I'm in search for a first job. I did a try out day at uptown cheapskate and it was hell. I had to work the fitting rooms and it was very difficult for me to put on a nice face and do the whole customer service voice and lines while also putting clothes up on the racks. Manager told me after 2 hours she's sending me home because she realized that it wasn't for me. I almost cried so many times throughout the experience and one time I turned around and 20 people were waiting for a room and all of them were full. By then I just gave up. I want to move out asap but i don't know what job position would be good for me to actually work without feeling panic and I know some people say I should just expose myself to it but that's never helped me.
558,2,"Exposure therapy was kinda boring for me. So I made it into a game I could play everyday.

Drop a situation you're anxious about and I'll give you 3 challenges. You just have to promise to do one and tell me about it :)

EDIT: I more so meant to say it was hard to stay motivated while doing exposure"
559,2,"Just felt like saying this but it makes me feel good reading all the people on here talking about there experiences with anxiety. I overthink absolutely everything i do in life and i hate myself for it. Speaking to people in shops, fellow coworkers, sometimes friends and especially girls. The only place i feel myself is when im alone or around close family members. I really fucking hate myself for this and sometimes think of ending it all. Although i don’t really want to end it all as deep down i do like myself and i have to much to lose. It probably doesn’t help with the daily cannabis use but ive always been weird like this i think.
And if you guys feel like giving solutions like quitting smoking don’t bother as i’ve already tried and this is just who i am now and have been for the last 5 years.
It’s also shit how i don’t know anyone like myself. It’s my dream to find someone as fucked up as myself to be with. 
"
560,2,"Hey y’all,
I’ve been dealing with anxiety for almost a decade now, and even though the gym has been a part of my life for much longer than that, i find it’s really starting to get in the way of keeping up with my routine. I LOVE the gym. It’s where i go to get rid of all my nervous energy. Over the years i’ve been able to take my anxiety and use it to create a better physique, but holy shit some days i can’t even get out the door. Legit, my anxiety will turn me into a fucking statue that refuses to move. Some days are better than others, but i really want to know if im the only one who struggles with this, especially as it pertains to the gym. If there’s anybody who’s somehow overcome letting their anxiety keep them from their hobbies, i would love to hear what helped for you.
Cheers!"
561,2,So I’m 16 and going to a sleepover tomorrow at someone else’s house with one other person being there (so me and 2 others) and I am incredibly terrified. I haven’t been to a sleepover since elementary school and I have no idea about the norms/rules of high school sleepovers (am also suspecting autistic if that clears some stuff up). This sleepover involves going to the beach and I’m really scared. Does anyone have literally any advice on how to do this without being horribly anxious the whole time? What do I bring? What do I say?
562,2,"I’ve had a stutter my whole life. A few years ago, I came across Acceptance and commitment therapy ACT, and it helped me start accepting my stuttering as a part of who I am - not something to constantly fight against.

But it wasn’t until a few months ago that I began working with the Avoidance reduction approach. I started setting small, everyday speaking tasks for myself, and completing them as a way to **desensitize my fear of speaking**. I shared some of my story in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1l1na5l/ive_struggled_with_intense_fear_of_speaking_for/), and now I’d like to go into a bit more detail about how I actually practice this method.

Each practice starts with identifying a real-life speaking situation. Sometimes I write the task down in my phone; other times, I use the [Voice Journey](https://voicejourneyapp.com/), which helps me note:

* The task itself
* Helpful phrases or sentences to get started
* Instructions or reminders for myself

One example:  
About two months ago, I needed to call OBI (a hardware store in Germany) to ask if they rent out drills - I wanted to install a lamp in my apartment. Since I live in a German-speaking country, and German isn’t my native language, I knew I needed to prepare what I wanted to say.

I wrote down the task in Voice journey ([screenshot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YxTYRowED1vYrioWMjr9sZyvVmK9cDco/view?usp=drive_link))

Before making the call, I rehearsed with[ ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) in voice mode, which helped me test my German pronunciation and make sure I could communicate my message clearly.  
If I were speaking in Mandarin or English, I probably wouldn’t need this step, but for German, it really helps me feel more secure.

Once I felt confident (usually when ChatGPT understands what I’m saying clearly), I make the actual call.

Sometimes it goes well. Sometimes it doesn’t. Either way, I write a short report afterward to track:

* What went well
* What didn’t
* How I felt during the interaction

I noted down my experience in Voice journey ([screenshot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W8i_1yLyVJwbyoVcMe0EaRARpkoH9Lm_/view?usp=drive_link))

The call went mostly well. The staff member understood what I was asking and gave me helpful info - for example, that the drill rental doesn’t include the drill bits.

I was nervous before calling, and during the call I felt some pressure because the other person was speaking very quickly. That made me feel like I had to rush as well, and in the end, I didn't ask a couple of the questions I had planned.

But overall, I count this as a successful task - I faced the fear and completed the interaction.

This task-based method really helps me build confidence in daily communication. Even when I have setbacks - like blocks or freezing, I feel encouraged each time I complete a task.

I’ve also started shifting my mindset as well:  
**I try to treat each task as an experiment, not a burden**. I stay curious about how people will react instead of expecting the worst. This attitude helps me stay open and focus on what I’ve learned, rather than just what went wrong.

Other examples of tasks that I completed:

* Asking how much it costs to repair a phone (after dropping mine and cracking the screen)
* Explaining to the kindergarten teacher that we have a doctor’s appointment (for my young child)

Let me know if anyone else has tried similar exposure or task-based approaches. I’d love to hear your strategies and learn from your experience too."
563,2,"So, there's this person in university who I strongly suspect has social anxiety. I really want to get to know them. There's a presentation to be made and they are alone and it can be done in pairs. Although I've already done mine I was thinking about offering help to them as I myself have social anxiety but not with speaking in public and it could be a way to getting closer to them. The problem is: how do I offer help? I wanted to approach them in a way that they know that I too suffer from social anxiety and understand them, but I fear I may come off as pitying them, like I'm assuming they're incapable of speaking in public (or assuming they have social anxiety in the first place). How do I do it without making them think such a thing?"
564,2,"So I’ve recently cut out coffee (I’ve been drinking coffee everyday for 15 years) and I went through a hell of withdrawals.

But now I’m noticing my social anxiety has chilled a little? No it’s not completely gone but of course any type of relief feels great. 

I just wanted to share because it might help someone else. "
565,2,"I’m 20F and I live in a student house with 5 other people. My social anxiety has gotten so bad that I listen out for when people aren’t downstairs or when my one friend who I feel safe talking to is so I can go to the kitchen. Sometimes I won’t eat all day because I just don’t want to see anyone. The weird thing is I can talk to people if it’s a necessity, like I’ve not gone completely mute- for work or driving lessons for example. But in a room full of people I can hardly speak. My social anxiety hasn’t been this bad for a while and I’m just wondering what I can actually do to fix it because the whole task just seems overwhelming at the moment. I also get up for work at 5am every day which makes it challenging to go to social events in evenings. I’ve pretty much lost touch with all my uni friends. Not sure what to do, it’s one thing to reassure myself that I only have one year left of this but it’s another to just be able to live in the moment which is just not something I can do now. There’s a house party I’m going to with my house tomorrow but I’m just dreading it because I can’t seem to come up with anything interesting enough to say. I don’t know what happened, I’ve always been incredibly socially anxious but I appeared to be kind of getting over it only for it to just become 10x worse in recent years. Any advice would be appreciated "
566,2,"Approaching women

Hey guys, I've been on the verge to approach women in public this week.  But it seems like it is hard to find my type ,like some days I won't see my type and then other days I see quite a few of my type. So i was wondering if i shoukd maybe lower my standards or just practise approaching women that arent that attractive and build my way up. And should I not approach women when there on there phone as they are technically busy you could say and it might seem rude. Thanks"
567,2,"I worry I'll be alone forever, that no girl's ever gonna like me as the nervous wreck I am. I have barely any confidence and struggle immensely with talking to girls. I wish someone would love me and have a relationship with me. I wish I had a shoulder to cry on, someone to tell about my day, someone to kiss, hug, and cuddle, but I don't, and I'm not sure I ever will. I've prayed about it, but nothing so far.

Sometimes life just feels like it's not even worth living anymore. I didn't ask for any of this. I just wish I could be normal, but I never will be. I yearn for something I'll never have."
568,2,"Hello all,

As with most my social anxiety is crippling in so many ways. I have figured out how to talk to people online, that was difficult for a long time even.

I have been trying with limited success, take for instance yesterday.

I took two flights about 4 hours long each, the first one I was seated in the window seat to a nice slightly younger couple but I just could not work up the nerve to say anything even hello, and they were seemingly friendly, did not say hello either but maybe thought I just wanted my privacy, it was a red eye flight.

The next flight I was in a window seat next to a younger possibly couple, not 100% sure as they had some friction in their conversations where it seemed like the girl was going along with the guy, Caribbean destination, but he was being stupid, not noticing her when she would make herself pretty after having a nap, typical signs that an individual is wanting someone’s attention but never got it.

I was tempted to tell her or leave her a note saying that if he didn’t smarten up to send me a message and we could hang out and I would listen (no sexual implication). She just seemed like she was starting out what should be a fun trip in a bad way.

I myself am on a trip to rest and relax and refocus my brain because it has been hit hard for a decade plus and it needs unwinding.

Then I met a third lady, we kept running into each other getting off the plane at different points and I would let her go ahead of me and she was kind and thanked me. Fast forward 30 minutes and I finally got the shuttle I needed and 5 minutes later before the shuttle left she came onboard and sat beside me and we actually had a really good conversation, it was difficult at first with long gaps due to not knowing if I should say anything and being crippled with anxiety about that.

But by the time she left the shuttle, a different resort then mine, she had given me her number and we have been just chatting every once in awhile since.

It has been nice, and full of anxiety as well of course, but a step forward where it has been so difficult.

Of course that small victory has partially led to me being more of a recluse then I anticipated at the resort, but at the same time I am relaxing just interspersed with some anxiety 😂

I really wish the resort didn’t have a no-nighttime swimming after 9pm in the pool policy as that seems the perfect time to just relax in the pool and hot tub with the heat of the day waning a little.

Now thinking of getting a tattoo to remember my trip 😊"
569,2,"Anyone else struggle with confidence speaking to people? I’m in school with a new class thats already established so I feel like an outsider. It’s hard for me to speak up, or I do and I almost always regret it. I’m my own worst enemy but idk how to fix it. Has anyone been down this road and has advice?"
570,2,I am 22 extremely good looking and have a great career of service. For some reason I crave new connections and have paralyzing feeling when I go near a bar I'm planning to visit. I don't want to end up being a drunk or someone I'm not. I like my one wheel rides my career and spending time with parents. I question what kind of activity I need to connect with others and have my own work to do. I got new bowling shoes so I'm excited to try them this week. Maybe the bar isn't my activity. Maybe one wheeling is too isolating. I feel like I fit in nowhere except my career. I have a few highschool friends and that's it. No real friends for a guys night or anything consistent. Always up for a girl to enter my life but I am repulsed at a lot of options nowadays. I'm also gonna pick up the keyboard again and lift at home. Don't have tons of free time due to work. What answer am I looking for? I love my peaceful life and when I'm with friends or family going out to a bar or whatever is no big deal. I gotta figure something out. Wasted this evening being a bitch and not going into 4 separate bars. People bring me out I'm having fun. Alone I feel awkward because I'm the only loaner.
571,2,"So, the new doctor I'm seeing is an older lady who is very strict and stern. I went for a physical a couple of weeks ago and she looked at my chart and told me I needed to have a pap smear since I've never had one. I'm 25, I've never been sexually active, and I don't plan on being sexually active if I can help it (I'm asexual aromantic). I've been vaccinated against HPV. No one in my family has a history of cervical cancer or anything like that, which is why I've never thought about getting a pap smear. 

My doctor is kind and seems like a nice person, but she kinda forced the procedure on me, saying, ""I'm going to schedule you for a pap smear in three weeks"" rather than asking me if I wanted one. I could have said no when she said she was going to schedule me for a pap smear, but I was already extremely anxious because I hate interacting with people, especially strangers, and I've only met this doctor twice. I was shaking so bad, and I just wanted to leave as soon as possible. So I didn't refuse or voice my concerns or say anything. 

I wanted to just cancel the appointment, but tomorrow my mom's forcing me to go. She's even driving me to the place. Unfortunately, I also have to go there for my blood test results. I do want to know my results because I've been dealing with some issues for the past couple of months, but the clinic I go to does not do these kinds of things over the phone or online. 

I'm extremely anxious and overwhelmed because my mom is really upset that I'm acting like ""a child,"" and I also fear that my doctor would make a big deal about me not wanting this procedure, or be upset with me or not give me a choice. What can I do?? I really, really, really, really DO NOT want a pap smear.  Just thinking about it makes me want to die. "
572,2,"This is a bit of an odd one for me but I'm only just taking action on my social anxiety at 36 and have been doing lots of reading on the subject. One thing that sticks out to me is that so much talks about fear of being judged or what other people are thinking and how social anxiety can also be caused from trauma.

For me though, there are no thoughts. When I am going into a social situation, be it a party, seeing a friend, or even posting on reddit for example I have no thoughts of being judged. On the contrary, I've lived long enough to know that most people are actually pretty nice and aren't quick to judge someone who makes mistakes or is a bit weird.
I just feel an absolute fear, no logic to it, no thoughts on what a stranger might think, no predictions of how things will go, just pure fear and wanting to get out of the situation. Even writing this, I feel it but I know this is a community predisposed to NOT judging others. 

Am I alone in this? It's made me a little skeptical on going through CBT as it seems to me that it is more about addressing such thoughts rather than the actual feelings."

577,2,I really want to post on some subs because I think I would feel a lot more comfortable with ppl that are more like me and I feel like maybe I could be myself and talk with others about the same things but I feel really anxious in other subs or sometimes when I comment people don't upvote me and I just really want to be able to interact how I want.
578,2,"I'm in high school right now, and I've had a best friend since elementary. We basically do everything together and are comfortable with talking about and doing literally anything you can ever imagine.

Since we don't really have classes together, we both needed to find other friends in our classes. I noticed that she seems to be able to get along naturally with other people, and has found some friends where she can be goofy and laugh with, such as ""stealing"" each other phones to take randomass selfies, make random/weird jokes, go out to places together, etc.

However, the friends that I have are the very contained type, if you know what I mean. Like I would never imagine going out to the mall, making ""mean"" jokes, or hugging with them, because that would be very very awkward. All our conversations are just ""ohh how was your weekend??"", ""oh my gosh its so hot in here..>!!"", ""how do you do this problem?"", those types of awkwardass conversations.

I feel like it's a problem with me, where I literally cannot have a conversation without being awkward or not knowing what to say, but socializing was never really a problem for me when I was younger. When we're together with her friends (who are funny and silly), I find it hard to fit in with their personalities, even though thats the type of friendship i truly want. I feel like I come off as those boring or ""nerdy and quiet"" or awkward kids, but I really do wish I could make friends with people who are fun and energetic.

Does anyone know how I could become more open and sociable with people and start making friends that I'm comfortable with?"
579,2,"I'm decent one-on-one, but in a group of 4+ people I somehow become the person who just listens. Everyone else seems to naturally jump into conversations while I'm over here trying to find the right moment to speak. Eventually I feel overlooked or not involved in the conversation at all, making it even more difficult.

By the time I work up the courage to say something, the conversation has moved on. Or someone else says what I was thinking and then it feels weird to repeat it. It's really frustrating. I have things to say, but I spend so much mental energy overthinking that I miss opportunities. Other people seem to just talk without thinking too much.

It's especially tough in work settings where being vocal seems to matter for career growth. I'll sit in meetings with good ideas but never speak up, then watch other people get credit for similar thoughts.

Does anyone else relate to this? How do you handle being naturally quieter in groups? I'm trying to figure out if there are ways to feel more comfortable contributing to conversations without it feeling so forced."
580,2,"I usually go with my Aunt but that's only once a week at most, I won't see proper results then, I tried going alone today but it was filled to the brim of young and fit people, I felt out of place being weak and chubby, I went 5 mins on the StairMaster then went to the restroom trying to convince myself to keep going but I didn't want to take up space from others, the free weights were completely taken and it felt rude to stand around and over people waiting for them to be done, the machines were seemingly open? but it felt so awkward being the only guy on the machines when everyone else is on the free weights, I just get paralyzed by overthinking and lack of confidence.

I want to go again tomorrow but earlier in the day, around 11am when there are less people or mostly elders, I understand just going alone is a success but I still feel like I failed and fell short."

582,2,"my social battery is at an all time low. fuck social anxiety dude, its horrible at the very best. like, why cant i just be normal? interact with people and not constantly be hyper-aware, and burnt out from not even an hour long interaction? not fucking fair dude."
583,2,"This might be a bit of a silly question, I'm 20 years old and have never spent more than $200 on anything ever basically, I never learnt to drive due to GAD so I never bought a car, I've never bought a phone or anything expensive as all my stuff is old from when I was a teenager.

I'm looking to buy a pretty expensive iPad next week and I'm a little nervous about the actual process, do you have to let your bank know beforehand? Do they ask for ID and whatnot to ensure it's actually you making the purchase? I'm terrified of looking stupid in front of the employees so anything would help."
584,2,"i need help, i’m a 19 year old female college student and i don’t know how to make friends. all my life i’ve had a really low opinion of myself and i’ve struggled with insecurity and depression but it’s snowballing into outright isolation. i have one friend from highschool and a boyfriend but that is my only source of socialization outside of my family. my sisters have always been gorgeous and outgoing, they always have huge friends groups and active social lives but i cant seem to find it in myself to make friends. i go to school out of state and i only made one friend the whole year, my roommate moved out and left before the end of the first semester because she felt like i was suffocating her by being in the room too much. i have a low tolerance for being in a social setting due to my lack of confidence and anxiety i always feel out of place or judged when im in public so it was really hard for me to go places alone and try to interact with complete strangers. im transferring in state for this year to be closer to my family, the social isolation was significantly impacting my mental health. but i fear that i will never make friends no matter where i go. i want to give myself some grace and not feel like im giving up by transferring but it feels like im a failure in more ways than one. how can i stop being a friendless freak?? plz help me"
585,2,"I have social anxiety and one of my biggest problems is that my voice trembles when I’m anxious — especially in social situations or when speaking in front of others. It’s one of the most frustrating and embarrassing symptoms for me.

I also have depression, but honestly I feel like social anxiety and low self-confidence are the bigger issues affecting my day-to-day life. I overthink everything, worry about how I sound, and avoid situations where I might have to speak. It's exhausting.

My doctor recently prescribed me Pristiq (desvenlafaxine), but I’m not sure if it’s the right fit. I know it’s usually for depression, but I’m wondering if it helps with social anxiety and physical symptoms like voice shaking?

Has anyone taken Pristiq for anxiety or social anxiety? Did it help? Would love to hear your experience or if you think another med would be better for this kind of issue.
"
586,2,"So I always felt different from others. I notice more, I think in different ways and just I feel more. I’ve always been quieter around groups except my friends. Around people I feel comfortable with my words and thoughts just flow. I developed social anxiety and the fear of being perceived. Right now I’m going to high school and when I look at other girls my age or older I don’t understand how do they know what to do. Like how to act, behave, what to say and is it appropriate. Also the conversation topics are about boys, relationships, gossips and drama which is a huge change for me and like since when we’ve started talking about it. I feel like everybody moved on and I’m still somewhere behind. I feel younger in some way. When I was younger I knew how to talk with people not everybody but most and it was way easier. I don’t lack in social skills but my social anxiety and the fear of being perceived is more intense nowadays. Like even when I think about being stared at, being looked at and judged my face gets red and I’m anxious. WHY do I feel like that? I would be so happy to hear your thoughts on it and if you ve experienced the same thing. Like is it because of the social anxiety, my natural differences or something else??"
587,2,"TL;DR: *Every time I socialise with people, they usually get very angry. This feeds my social anxiety and leads to isolation. I've tried consulting friends and family but aside from finding my overall vibe to be off, they don't know what I'm doing wrong. I don't have ASD or any other diagnosis that may explain this. Does anyone have any ideas or similar experiences?*

This post is partly a rant, but I'm also very grateful for input or advice if you have any. There's something about me (23F) that infuriates people, and the result of this feeds my social anxiety. I find myself going through this constant cycle. I'll be completely isolated for months, then I'll throw myself into social situations in hopes of getting friends, a social network or whatever, only to have some negative experience that spooks me off and brings me back to isolation. 

This part will be lengthy, so feel free to skim through, but just to provide a few specific examples. I've gotten accused of being homophobic. Two guys (a few years older than me) moved into our apartment complex. I really liked their vibes and had a positive attitude to them. I figured that they didn't know who I was since they never acknowledged me and that was ok by me. A few weeks in, the ""boss"" of the apartment tells me that they've reported me for unfriendly behaviour that they believe is rooted in homophobia on my end. The ""behaviour"" in question was unspecified, but I clearly made them uncomfortable. This report was literally a shock as I didn't even think they knew about me, not to mention the accusations that I couldn't identify with at all. 

Furthermore, I've had several unpaid internships for a short period of time through my studies. I usually couldn't keep these for more than a few weeks before getting fired. The reasons were always very vague, and none of the other interns I worked with were fired. 

On a more general basis, people seem to have far shorter patience with me than with others. As for the internship, if I made an error or asked for directions, the managers would usually get visibly annoyed and snappy. One particular manager exploded at me after taking me to a backroom, simply because I asked where an item should be placed (after another person told me to ask questions if I felt unsure). Other interns from my group also made errors and asked for directions, but were usually met by ""Oh no worries!"" ""You're doing great! You're here to learn after all!""

I've always been told that in order to cope with this, I just need to be more social and throw myself out there *even more* as socially anxious people may come across as stuck up or lacking of personality. Hence, I moved to Australia all alone last year on an exchange program in hopes that this would force me into social situations, new cultures, form new connections and hopefully solve this ever persisting issue. 

For the first period of time, I had no success. Just like in my home country, people (both locals and other international students) were very dismissive and showed no interest in maintaining touch after a few rounds of small talk. I ended up doing most activities alone. However, I did meet a German girl who wasn't able to make friends either. She seemed to like me and invited me to travel with her during Christmas break. We traveled for about 10 days until she one morning just snapped in a complete fury and had a go about how I'm a ""stupid b#§@!"", ""useless"" and ""mute moron"". She then slammed the door on her way out and I never saw her again. 

On New year's that period in Australia I did another attempt at socialising. I went to a public new years party and hung out with a Chinese girl who was alone (but didn't know English). At some point a drunk local girl and her friends came up to me and said that I was blocking their view. I apologized and moved, only for them to follow me and keep going ""well now you're blocking THEIR view"". I kept moving away from them and ignoring them. Eventually the girl called me a ""selfish piece of shit"" who has nothing to do in public before leaving. At this point the Chinese girl made a very distraught face and left. I felt so uncomfortable that I just went home too. 

These are just a few among many incidents that occur pretty much every time I do anything involving socialising. I've desperately tried critically analysing my behaviour from an objective POV to figure exactly what I do wrong, but I just can't figure it out. I've had some people see what's going on and be like ""aweh ur so sweet, ppl r just a-holes ;("", but obviously this isn't the case. This is such a reoccurring incident so *I am* the problem, I just don't know why. 

I'm extremely lucky to have one friends and two parents that tolerates me and will give me honest feedback on these matters. I've tried asking them why this is occurring, but none of them can point at anything particular. When I told my friend (23F) about the incident with the German girl, she said that she could sort of relate to the German girl. My friend explained that sometimes she gets this feeling of unexplainable fury when hanging out with me. I asked her if I was doing anything particular that evokes this feeling. My friend said no, and said that I conduct myself if a very friendly and appropriate manner, but that it's more about my overall vibe that ticks her off. However, she also said that she knows I ""can't help it"", so she never acts out on the rage. Regarding the incident with the German, my mom said that she also finds me provoking at times, but couldn't put her finger on exactly how. My dad on the other hand says that he finds me great, but claims that my entire vibe changes in a bad way whenever we are not alone and that he can sympathize with people who feel provoked. Neither he could explain exactly what it was, but pointed at my posture and facial expression. 

It would be reasonable to conclude that my issue may stem from ASD or something else, but this was ruled out after a school demanded that I was tested for potential disorders. Neither my friend or family thinks that my behaviour resembles any disorders and they claim that I act pleasant and appropriate, but that my overall vibe is the issue. 

I really don't know what I do to repell people like this. It has bothered and followed me for literally all my life. Like, even in kindergarten my parents would get questioned about why other kids seemed to avoid me so much. I would do anything for someone to point out all my flaws so that I could fix them and eventually get the social life that I've so desperately craved for years. Idk if I'm seeking advice or just wanting to rant. Nevertheless, if anyone's experiencing similar stuff or know why this may be happening to me: please share. Also if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them. 

I'm so tired of this and I see no future anymore. I just want a life. "
588,2,I mean everyday i dress nice and look somewhat attractive but can't shake the feeling that people focus on me way too much anyone else goes through this ?
589,2,"I took the day off work and decided to go browsing in a few stores. My anxiety started to build up over time because I walked this whole store just looking at everything and picking up random things that I didn’t need. I feel like this is an okay thing to do but my mind tells me that the workers were watching me and think that I’m shoplifting, which I’ve never done in my life. 

So, I’m already anxious when I get up to the register and I could feel my face turn red and I’m sweating. I was buying this black dress, for no reason in particular, just thought it would come in handy to have and will bring on vacation. Conversation went as follows:

Him “This dress is so pretty” 
Me “Thanks”
Him “Do you have somewhere special you’re wearing it to?”
Me …pause that felt like eternity
Me “A funeral” 
Him “Oh I’m sorry is someone that you are close with” 
Me “My grandparents..but they’re not dead yet. I guess I’ll be ready when that time comes” 

What in tarnation. Why did that come out of my mouth. I was so embarrassed and can’t stop laughing at myself but then also wondering what the heck is wrong with me. I don’t want them to die. "
590,2,"So, I’m 17 and lost my wallet. No idea where it went. My only debit card and my drivers license were both in there and I have to get them replaced. My mom can’t come with me because of work and I have no idea how to go about getting anything. I’m terrified. I’ve cried about it three times already. I don’t wanna embarrass myself by being so clueless. I’ve looked up stuff about it, but I’m still so unsure. What if I don’t have all the right stuff? What if they don’t let me do anything because I’m not 18? My mom is mad enough at me as is and isn’t giving me much money for the time being, so if I don’t have enough, there’s nothing I can do. I know I’m pathetic for thinking like this, but I’m just so nervous. "
591,2,"it's exam season and today I accidentally went to the wrong classroom and it took me 20-30 seconds to realize. I just stood there like an npc looking around for my seat and then it hit me ""I'm not supposed to be here"". I don't know how this happened, I was on autopilot genuinely unaware of my surroundings and one guy passed by me and indirectly called me the r word. I only realized it after I went to my classoon and it kept me distracted for some time I couldn't focus on my exam. I keep thinking how they were probably thinking ""wtf is he doing here lol"" and there were also some friends who just stood there and said nothing

I already had a bad enough reputation for being awkward why did I do this
"
592,2,"Social anxiety can be such a difficult and isolating experience, especially when it feels like it’s impacting every part of your life—whether it's at work, with friends, or even just going to the store. I’m curious to hear about everyone’s unique ways of managing their anxiety, especially when it feels overwhelming in the moment.

For me, I’ve found that breaking things down into smaller, more manageable steps helps a lot. Instead of trying to push myself into big social situations all at once, I try to focus on making small connections or doing smaller tasks that gradually build my confidence. It could be something simple, like making eye contact or saying hello to someone I don’t know. It’s not about going all in right away but giving myself the time and space to feel more comfortable over time.

Another thing that’s been really helpful is challenging my negative thoughts  Social anxiety can make me assume people are judging me or that I’m going to mess up, but I try to remind myself that people are usually focused on themselves, not on me. I’ve also learned to accept that I might feel awkward or uncomfortable at times... it doesn’t mean I’m failing, it’s just part of the process.

What are your go-to strategies? Do you have any tips for calming the physical symptoms, like shaking or the racing heart, when you’re in the middle of a stressful social moment? Or have you found ways to practice self-compassion and reduce the pressure to be perfect in social settings?

I think the more we share, the more we realize we’re not alone in this. I’d love to hear what’s worked for you and any advice you can offer for others who are struggling with the same things. Let’s help each other get through this..

593,2,"

I'm 19. I've never had a girlfriend. Never kissed anyone. I don't have any real friends. Every day is like losing another step in life — and the truth is, I don't think I was ever meant to catch up. I feel like I was built wrong from the start.

I have extreme body dysmorphia. I obsess over each aspect of my face — my receding chin, my sloping forehead. It isn't insecurity, it's constant. I avoid mirrors and photographs because every time I see myself, I'm disgusted. I feel like a freak. Like I'm not human sometimes. It affects the way I talk, the way I walk, the way I live. I don't think I deserve to be looked at.

I also have a overwhelming inferiority complex. I look at other men my age — outgoing, confident, handsome — and I feel like I'm from another planet. Like I'm not even the same species. I don't feel like a man. I feel like a broken version of what a man is supposed to be. I'm anxious, introverted, overly sensitive. I can barely talk to people without examining every word, every pause, every facial expression. I always feel ""less than."" Like I was born to lose.

I've tried to reach out to individuals, but my pain has pushed them away. I lost one of my only friends I had after expressing suicidal thoughts too much. I wasn't trying to harm her — I was just lost and scared. I had no one else to talk to, and now I don't even have her. And I know that it was my fault.

I've let jealousy get the best of me and make me resentful. I've gazed at people who seem to have what I'll never have — love, attachment, self-assurance — and instead of reaching out, I shut down. I've written some angry, resentful things on the internet in the past, especially in earlier incel-type rants. I'm ashamed of those moments. They were created in suffering, but that's no excuse. If anybody was hurt by those words, I'm sorry. Deeply. I have to become more than the person I was in those posts.

I'm trying. I'm going to college. I'm applying for jobs. I need a future. But every day is the same cycle — like I'm just surviving and not living. I try to break out of it, but I always end up right back here: alone, exhausted, broken, and hating myself.

And worst of all?
I'm alone. I'm invisible. I don't exist to anyone.

I don't know what I'm hoping for in this post. Maybe I just needed to be seen. To be heard. If anything at all speaks to you.thank you for hearing me. Seriously.  It means more than I can express."
594,2,"Why my psychiatrist did this?

For many years I was fighting with pain in chest and throat, none of benzos, antidepressants, akineton, antiparkinsons, antipsychotics helped me. 

Finally I was put on propranolol 20mg at 9AM and 20mg at 2PM. And pain went away, my essential tremor was stabilized.

And then 3 weeks ago I was hospitalized and  here at hospital and she removed second therapy (20mg PM) and I have pain again and tremor.

I am angry at her."
595,2,"19F. I never had any friends ever, not even acquaintances. I was always that silent and awkward kid. Like, if I’d speak, I would ramble so much and make the most nonsense sentences and embarrass myself. If I spoke, I’d be overly nice and kind of self-sacrificing.

I was really always lonely, sitting alone in class, at lunch, during sports, just by myself all the time. No friends, no acquaintances, just me and my awkward silence. I always felt different, like, why can’t I talk to anyone? Even the most introverted people manage to talk to someone… I’ve never met anyone in my life who never made friends or talked with people.

I’m definitely an introvert, and I just can’t make friends. I wonder why I’m so different from everyone else, why I’m the only one who’s never been able to make friends or connect with people like it seems so easy for others. It’s really hard for me, and I wanted to know if I’m the only one who feels this way.

And the fact that I’ve always been like that, and still am, is quite concerning. I just wanted to ask if anyone can relate, and what kind of experience you’ve had.

598,2,"I started at my job over a year ago and noticed that I was having a hard time fitting in. I thought it was because I was new. But now, all that time has passed and it never got better. I thought it was me or something I was doing wrong. I tried smiling more and saying hi to people. But hardly anyone says hi back to me and most people just make a weird face at me. I tried helping people out more but that just led to people trying to take advantage of me and I'm never recognized or thanked for it. I tried having more conversations with others, but I still get ignored, like nobody hears me no matter how loud I talk. 

It's like everyone hates me and I don't know why. It's like they don't see me as one of them. I notice how they're all so friendly and talkative to each other but everyone leaves me out of conversations and nobody seems to respect me. It's also hard because everyone has this ""inside"" humor, I never felt part of it or knew how to join in. I feel miserable at my work and it's been so hard trying to find another job.

Hi there,

 This is my second post, I a few nice conversations but it faded out. I’d love to talk someone who is also serious about making new friends. 

I’m from Sydney & would love to maybe meetup or talk to someone around here who also experiences SA as we would be able to better understand each other.  I do need more time to open up for obvious reasons but I  enjoy having deep conversations once I open up. I would like  to make new friends & explore places in Sydney, try out new cafes/ restaurants/ go concerts if ur interested ofc but im looking to meet up with people around Sydney Aus (sorry if ur not in Sydney) & perhaps go out more  as we only get to live once. Also never had a bf & I don’t mind getting to know someone :) maybe you’ll find me cute ☺️ 


Send me a message if interested :) maybe u can start by telling me what’s ur fav show/movie, fav food or tell me lil about urself, it can be anything no judgement  :) "
603,2,"Is it okay that people seriously never talk to me and that I'm all alone? Basically mostly everyday? Because of my own social skill issues and cognitive flaws?

Though I'd like to have own my personal bubble space if I get overwhelmed.. I still want to talk to people when I can. I don't have the best social skills to even talk to anyone too, so it comes off as aloof or cold, and as small talk. Then I either get blocked or ignored for trying to talk.

It's like I can't make much friends at all with my social flaws.. really because my brain can't process to talk much in a conversation.

I really hope I would be so much better to talk to people, but really my brain doesn't want to become it's overwhelmed and overstimulated. I'm really sorry to those that perceive me as annoying, aloof, or as a bad person. I'm trying the best I can do."
604,2,"I (18M) have social anxiety but only in terms of eating with other people or going out to eat, I basically panic about throwing up, so before I even get to eat ill have lump in my throat and as soon as i start eating I cant escape the thought of being sick, (this is not an ED, it is just a fear from past experience) 
It makes me panic, and my girlfriend doesn’t really understand it, she is usually my comfort but when I feel like it I literally have to run away to the bathroom, if its bad I will actually be sick, if I can control it I’ll still struggle to get anything down without panicking.
I’m currently in a waiting list for help, but since I am going on holiday on my own with my partner for the first time tomorrow, I just wanted to see if i could get some help from the community?
Thank you."
605,2,"I don't want to discourage anyone, but I just want to explain and share my opinions. As I said in the title, I think it's impossible living or even surviving with social anxiety in today world. It doesn't make any change that how much you know, how talented you are, how good person you are and how you respect others anymore. It is not important that how you are good at your job. But it is just important how your social media account is. Just your network is important. People even doesn't expect from you market your product, knowledge, piece etc. but expect from you market only yourself. The only important thing is your instagram story. And it is not important what is there in it. Let's say you are a genius in your area, that is not important. My story, fulled with garbage and false knowledges, viewed from more people; I am right, you are wrong, I am succesful not you. And I live in a country even people don't what social anxiety is. Even after you explain them, they don't understand it. Everyone expects that people should fight for surviving, for just a simple life, life with human dignity. And it is not just about jobs or that stuff. Making relationships or friends are all the same. In today world we just have to sell ourselves.

606,2,"Hey guys, I know this might sound weird but I am really insecure about how plain my name is. I don't want to dox myself and say it but just know it's like, super plain.

My girlfriend says my name is ok, but I don't really buy it because her family might be connected to the mob. Overall the situation just gives me like a ton of anxiety for a lot of reasons, like potential ID mix ups, employment issues and whatnot.

608,2,"I'm a huge introvert and have always been labelled as the quiet one. For reference I'm a 26yr old female, and I believe undiagnosed autistic. I started a new job about 3 weeks ago. I always go for roles where I can work on my own, normally a cleaner/janitor role. I was unemployed and had an interview for a cleaner at an office block, I assumed it would be independent working. However, they told me it was actually working within a team in the sense that we all work the same shift but we work alone in separate rooms, but we can go to the others to ask for help if we need it. I was like okay, I can still work on my own but I don't mind working in a team in that way so I took the job. So I get there on my first day, and they are all close friends (team of 6 incl me) and are big talkers. 1hr of the shift had already passed and they hadn't started cleaning yet, they were still chatting in a group circle and they told me they do this everyday. We then begin cleaning and after an hour (the shift is only 3hrs long) they come to get me telling me to finish up and they then proceed to have a group chat for the last hour. Which apparently happens every day. Now, I'm the type that goes to work to work not to make friends, but with these people all being friends, it's hard for me to get involved. I get anxious when we have these chats so I mostly stay silent. But I'm worried that I'm being singled out for this. The supervisor already commented on how quiet I am. I have some trauma from a previous job where I was singled out, treated differently and called names infront of the group for being the quiet one. I'm finding it so hard, I'm crying most nights after work as I'm just so anxious at work now. Most of the time I don't even know what to say as I'm bad at small talk and I don't like telling people personal information about myself, I'm quite private. Any tips for ""faking"" not being anxious? "
609,2,"I guess this is partly looking for advice and partly to vent my frustration. Working customer service jobs has always been an absolute nightmare for me, but as a broke college student without much experience, there are really not many options. Eight months ago I landed a job doing I.T help over the phone. Surprisingly, this is okay for me. It was still really rough the first few months but nowadays I hardly feel any anxiety while working and I’m actually pretty good at my job. The fact that the customers can’t see me face to face makes a world of difference. 

Well, now my job is offering me a “promotion” to work in person in their store, alongside a pay raise. It’s a no brainer to accept— I could use the money. But seriously I am worried that I won’t be able to handle seeing customers face to face. 

My other jobs before this were fast food work, and I quit all of them within a few months because the anxiety was too much to bear. Every shift felt like I was going to war. Before work I was just thinking about how anxious I was to go in, after work I couldn’t sleep because I was overthinking every interaction I had all day. I would always get this terrible chest pain too and even start crying while working. Every time I got a new job I thought, I can do it this time, and every time I was wrong. I never made any friends at those jobs either which just made it even worse. 

Now I’m confronted with the chance to challenge myself again. I really want the raise, I really want to be able to make friends with coworkers and not sit behind my computer all summer. But my past experiences are telling me that I will fail. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I’m ready, if I have improved at all. I hate feeling like I’m holding myself back. But I also don’t want to destroy the peace I have right now. "
610,2,So im a Bit late because I just learned of this subs existence this all took place a while ago so to set the stage it was the last month of third year of high school (it works differently in the uk there’s no middle school so if I was American it’d be my first year) and I was content and happy with getting rid of my timetable finally until my English teacher assigns us a presentation I HATE PRESENTING WITH A BURNING PASSION IF I COULD BAN SCHOOL PRESENTATIONS I WOULD NO SECOND THOUGHTS anyways I did 1 already that year in a group and I did nothing but read one slide awkwardly it was still bad but this time I HAD TO DO THIS ALL ON MY OWN IN A CLASS WITH NO FRIENDS AT ALL and if this wasnt bad enough I had another for computing where we had to show a game we made the weight of having 2 presentations on the same day mind you had me scared shitless for the entire month I was staying up late just to extend the time as much as possible I soon realised i hadn’t even done one of them because I was too distracted stressing constantly over what others would think or what I would say fast forward to the day it was thursday all I could think about was the presentations and I HAD THE BIGGEST STROKE OF LUCK EVER BOTH MY ENGLISH AND COMPUTING TEACHER WERE OFF I genuinely couldn’t believe I was so fucking happy im still so fucking happy typing this it feels like some divine intervention even though im not even religious.
611,2,"I made a post about getting shortlisted for a job interview the other day and I’ve had a few more interviews since.

While the interviews haven’t gone terribly, I also can’t help but feel like I’m not the top candidate because I don’t have as much experience as others my age (I’m turning 26 this year and only had a few short-term gigs in the past and one kind-of stable job that lasted a year). 

And I know I have to start somewhere, but it’s a little disheartening and I can’t help but feel like I’m falling behind everyone else. "
612,2,"I feel so out of place when I’m among people, especially at social events. It drains me, and it invariably leaves me feeling like a freak of nature.
And maybe it’s just my distorted perception, but I feel like people do not take me seriously or warm up to me no matter how hard I try. Sometimes, they stare at me as if my face was messed up or I got the biggest zit on my face. 
I’ve noticed this pattern especially when I’m with my friend. People seem to immediately shift their attention to him, and I’m left completely ignored. When I try to chime in, it’s ineffectual, and I immediately fade back into the background.
I’m not jealous (maybe only a bit), nor do I blame him of course. Nor do I feel sorry for myself. I’m genuinely trying to understand why this keeps happening.
I’ve worked really hard on this, trying to sound more engaged, asking follow-up questions, genuinely attempting to have a conversation.
Another observation I’ve made is that this usually happens with guys (I’m a guy too). It doesn’t help that I have soft features and a not-so-authoritative voice. I wear glasses, and I’m on the (much) shorter side. I’ve been hitting the gym, trying to build muscle, but it takes time to see results, and I’ve struggled with my self-image for the longest time. 
And perhaps these two things are completely unrelated, but please tell me if someone else has noticed that taller better built guys are taken much more seriously. Pretty privilege is a real thing. 
Or maybe it simply boils down to charisma, of which I seemingly have none (again, an objective observation, not self-deprecation, I guess) 
Part of me doesn’t even care that much, but sometimes social events are a must, and it’d be cool to not feel like shit every time I need to be at one. "
613,2,"17F thinking of going on disability. I will graduate high school soon, I don’t know what to do after school. I’m not in any training, I don’t have a job, and I haven’t signed up for any colleges all due to my social anxiety. Does anyone know if going on disability is worth it? I heard it takes years to be accepted and the government can take the monthly income away if your bank account is above a certain amount of money. I’m in the US btw."
614,2,What do u do for work
615,2,"i’ve been at my current job for over a year and i NEED something else but the process of getting a new one is EXTREMELY anxiety inducing for me and it’s so frustrating that it is. you’d think those one-way virtual interviews would be better except they’re probably worse for me. i tried the virtual one for target and the physical anxiety was genuinely awful, my breath was literally getting caught in my throat as i was trying to speak…like girl YOURE TALKING TO A CAMERA. still no good.

the thing is, my current job is a cashiering job. so i have customer facing experience and i do pretty well at my job, its just that interviews are my weakness. first obstacle ive mostly been avoiding is calling these places i’ve applied to to follow up on my application. then even when i have established an interview, i'm just an anxious mess and im definitely getting rejected. the way my anxiety affects my speech and also my memory (my mind going blank) is insanity.

but the internal shame i feel for staying at this job is surpassing my discomfort surrounding new places, so here i am right now with my notebook trying to brainstorm interview responses so that when i call these places later to try to set up an interview, i won't be scrambling if they ask me to come in today. ugh. i wish i could just clock in and start, i feel like i really am a motivated person in the way that i DO want to be active and independent and just do my job. but social anxiety holds me back so much. "
616,2,i missed my whole year of being 16 
617,2,"I’ve only had 3 interviews in the course of a year, first one went so badly. I was visibly shaking the whole time. The other ones weren’t as bad but definitely not good, I would revise questions I could be asked but completely blank during the interview. 

I think I have a decent chance of getting the job but I’ll be working at the counter which is gonna suck. On top of that the place is a hang out spot for people my age and old drunk people lol. I’d like to say that it doesn’t worry me but it does, a lot. And my dad who I went no contact with lives right next to the place. I don’t really have a choice anymore though, I apply to every job I see and rarely get a response. 

I’m worried that if I get the job I’ll mess up and annoy everyone, I know it’s inevitable though. I dont know I’m just really worried and my heart is currently racing just at the thought of it, I can’t keep blanking during interviews "
618,2,I’ve been doing it for a minute. And while yeah - it feels good to function normally and go about my day - it sometimes feels like you’re living life 1000 miles away. The minute you stop disassociating - the anxiety comes back and you feel like an exposed nerve - at one point I felt like I was starting to be present without Social Anxiety but as usual.. I just self sabotaged myself so I’m back to square one.
619,2,"Even though this was sooo long ago I think this story was one of a few that really cemented my social anxiety. Here's what happened: I got dropped off at school early so the doors were not open yet. I'm waiting on a bench outside and I notice a kid pacing around the doors looking anxious. This person, to me, genuinely, looked to be no older than 12. So I walk over and ask if they maybe got on the wrong bus and need help. They start crying which I stupidly interpreted as them being scared or something so I say something like, ""Oh it's ok, let's find a teacher."" Then they tell me that they are in high school and my stomach DROPS. I immediately apologize profusely so many times over, people are staring at us at this point, but ultimately the damage had been done, you know? Anyways... I still think about that sometimes."
620,2,"People just don’t understand the extent of social anxiety or the issues that come along with it. if I’m silent people think I’m angry and if I’m laughing because I’m nervous people I’m awkward. When I’m by myself nobody approaches me and when I try being friendly and talkative people think I’m out of character. People make me out to be the one who wanted to be intimidating,  but everyday I’m on edge because I have to go into the world full of people that I’m terrified of. nobody understands how displaced I feel. What was once just social anxiety morphed into misanthropy. I was genuinely afraid to be around people but when they felt frustrated by my silence they made me out to be some type of criminal when I was pretty clearly uncomfortable and being angry in any of the contexts where it was assumed i was would make little sense. who would speak quietly to a random person they don’t even know just because they’re angry or rude? why is anxiety never assumed to be the reason. I’m tired of people."
621,2,Three people I work with are also going and I don’t have much of a working relationship with any of them but I can be around them for short periods of time (they sort of annoy me to be honest lol but they’re decent people). 
622,2,"I feel out of my league because she plays sports and is one of the popular girls. I mean, I also workout and I'm just kind of shy and timid and only talked to her a few times and even told her ""want to be friends"" in which she said yes. I thought that would give me more courage, but it didn't, lol. I geniuely don't know what to do since it's the home stretch till summer, should I just say fuck it and ask her to hang out?"
623,2,"Ive tried and exhausted most all ssris, snris, mood stabilizers …ect     Has anyone had luck with vyvance for social anxiety?"
624,2,"Hi. First post on here. I'm a young man with autism spectrum disorder, social anxiety disorder, and a few other various social impairments. I need an answer if any of you have managed to show empathy and kindness while being distressed, because I really don't get it.

I almost always avoid eye contact (common ASD effect) and when people speak to me in public, I usually freeze up, barely speak, but I do answer their questions. It *kind of* sucks being one of the only tech-savvy kids in my school, because the same kids who bully me every day will randomly pop an actually good question about it. I feel like I try my best to be kind, because that's who I am - I've always been as kind and respectful to others, especially in an academic environment. I believe the issue could be that my speech is rather terse, and I appear like I am actively trying to avoid conversation (I usually am). My sister brings a lot of friends over, and they're a prime example of this issue because although I don't need to impress her friends for any reason, it proves that this issue of people finding me rude or unpleasant is not just in school, but at my own home. I can't really think that is going wrong, or how to fix it, so I'm asking here so individuals with the same disorder could possibly give me some insight. Thanks.

Edit: adjective ""respectable"" -> ""respectful"""
625,2,Am I the only one who has a horrible anxiety attack about getting a job? I can’t even leave the house when I get a job and end up quitting.  
626,2,"Been thinking about this a lot lately - for me it's that replay afterwards where I think ""I should have said X instead.""   
  
What's your biggest struggle with conversations? Is it the before (preparing), during (finding words), or after (the overthinking)?   
  
Asking because I'm working on some tools to help with this and want to understand what would actually be useful vs. what I think might help."
627,2,"lately ive been feeling very withdrawn from everything. im naturally quiet, and i do have social anxiety, yes, but i feel ive always been pretty good at putting in the effort. i love to go out, see friends, go dancing, be amongst the crowd and take in the energy of those surrounding me. although its something ive always been anxious of, the possibility of meeting someone or experiencing something new usually outweighed the fear. 

but for the past year, ive just sort of been going solo and keeping my head down. i dont feel i have the energy to put in effort anymore, and would rather just go about minding my business. just been working my restaurant job that i dread every week, going home, working on my portfolio to try and break in the animation industry. my only focus these days has just been money and trying to find work. exhausted of being broke, working all the time, and still not having enough to do the things i want to do. ive fallen back on interests that i loved in high school, like reading comics, or watching old shows and cartoons. although it gives me joy, i feel like im remedying myself like im some sort of kid. 

ive stopped caring to reach out to friends and acquaintances. i dont want to be seen when im out, and ive noticed ive sort of become rude in my lack of bravery or initiative these days. for example i scoped a friend ahead on the sidewalk, but they were hanging w a bunch of people i dislike. i dont think they saw me but i just turned around and walked the other way. ive bumped into a couple friends that im not that close to anymore, and the interaction was quick, and i felt like i didnt give any time to do a basic catch up on each other's lives. ive been giving a lot of people low energy, and dont feel present in conversation. sometimes i feel like im villifying others in my head when they did nothing wrong. i feel estranged from my community, or my city, and i think im trying to make myself like being alone. i think that stuffs rooted in my wanting to fit in since i was a kid, but at 27, i dont feel like i can and should even be giving that want or mindset anymore energy.

i journal and meditate (usually before work), and it does help to an extent. to be honest, the only people in my life that i truly cherish right now is my mom, and my two best friends, who always lend an ear for me. but i feel like i bring negativity a lot, i wish i could have something new and exciting to tell them."
628,2,"i just want to share my pet peeve with some people.

Context: I'm a 6'2, decent-looking guy with an athletic build.

I have always had this pet peeve with the women I pass by, if they look away from me or something, I'd get angry and take that as they don't think I'm attractive but they should since I have all the physical attributes a woman could want nowadays. Even women have told me so yet when I go outside, sometimes I don't get that validation. I even went as far as just asking these women straight up what's up with that. "
629,2,"I feel like I come off as unapproachable online and in real life but I don't understand how or why. Like if I'm playing a game like roblox or something, literally nobody approaches me lol it's like I have an unwelcoming presence. I don't understand how it works."
630,2,"
I talk on the phone pretty often with my long distance partner and it's always kind of stress inducing. We're really close and I feel like I shouldn't still feel so much pressure over call to try to be entertaining and funny. I know I don't have to be that way, it just annoys me so bad that I can't be, because I AM that way with other people close to me. Every time we talk I can't think of anything to say because I'm focusing too hard on trying to think of something to say or that I'm not saying anything. With other people, I ALWAYS have something to say. And I know, like just stop thinking about it, but when I tell myself to stop thinking about something I just think about it more! It's so so frustrating. How do I fix this? I really want to get closer to him and to be myself around him, my brain just won't let me. I also have this problem with my best friend who I've known since the 4th grade when I go and see them in person, I just don't have to deal with that so much since they live so far away and we never call. But IDK, maybe I'd like to if I knew I could keep up a decent conversation."
631,2,"I've been doing exposure therapy for 10 years and it's changed my life. One of the first things that helped is to make it fun.

I'll turn your anxious moment into 3 challenges you can do. 1 easy, 1 medium, and 1 hard.

And if you do it, i'll write you an encouraging story you can take with you wherever"
632,2,"34M, and this is hitting me hard. I could barely make it through a haircut today - I had no idea what to talk about. It's weird, I've always been introverted, but I've never had this much difficulty being in social situations. I literally avoid certain situations that I think I'll have to talk and will be uncomfortable in and I don't want to live this way"
633,2,"I'm graduating 8th grade, so I know it's not really a big deal, but I get nervous even saying ""here"" during attendance. I have a little less than a week to prepare myself, but even thinking about it makes me feel sick to my stomach. What do I do? I stammer and laugh when I'm nervous and I don't want to embarrass myself in front of so many people. How do I do this without messing it up?"
634,2,"I have this issue where i am afraid i will show inappropriate affect, such as smiling in a funeral or when someone reveals something misfortunate about them. That my body language might make someone think i am disrespecting them. Does anyone face something similar?"
635,2,"Im a 20 year old man and dont know how to socialize. I always worry about what people think of me and how I present myself, even online, to the point I don't talk to people at all. I have no friends even on the internet. I wasnt like this when I was 12 - 16, it was easy for me to talk to people on the internet even though I acted weird, nowadays its impossible. What do I do? "
636,2,"Me and my friends were trying to get housing together but one of their former roommates ended up getting put into the same room as ours. My friend really didn't like them, and most of the other people on their floor also didn't like them. They're not a bad person, they're just very socially illiterate. 

Here's where I feel bad: I really pushed my friend to tell the housing people to change their room (we haven't moved in yet) because I felt like it would be really awkward if they tried to hang out with us, and I really didn't want to live in the same house as them. Thinking about just chilling in the living room and then them coming over and trying to make conversation with me makes me super uncomfortable. For context my friend doesn't like them because they were really loud in the middle of the night. I also don't want to live with someone who sings super loud in the middle of the night, but it wasn't really the main problem for me. 

Am I a bad person for not wanting to live with this person? I feel really bad because they already don't have many friends (I'm pretty sure they have online friends) but I'm also sure that they just need to find people who they vibe with. I also felt really bad for feeling so repulsed at the idea of living with them. "
637,2,I find myself preparing what I’m going to say to people hours before I see them. When I do this my prepared words don’t come out the way they are supposed to. Which leads straight to anxiety. I’m better if I walk into a people situation blindly. Is this just me?
638,2,Hi. So I am a 20 year old male. I've been using tinder and hinge for sometime now. I am kind of an awkward person and really unsocial. So when I get a match I dont know how to start a conversation and also when the conversation sometimes starts it just suddenly ends. I feel so guilty that I dont know how to talk. Also am I the problem or what is wrong. It just makes me so overwhelmed and stressed I dont know.
639,2,"For context, it was my (18f) brother's surprise birthday party day before yesterday and majority of my dad's side of the family couldn't make it beyond just my first cousins. So majority of my mom's side showed up. This includes some family from Ottawa and their parents who I met only a few times before. Much of the family members that showed up were people who I see maybe 2 to 3 times a year, but feel comfortable and safe with. But never all together have I seen them. 

Earlier last year, I created a jeopardy style game to play with trivia in 3 categories with my friends at my birthday party. And I remember getting stressed out and having to take so many breathers because I had 1 friend who was egging everyone on and was causing a lot of arguments. It was more funny than annoying, although some were annoyed. And I'm typically anxious with hosting, so I kept flushing and a few friends had to rub my back or tell me to calm down. 

I still thought it would be a good idea to play this game at the family gathering, because my mom was on my case to arrange the games with everyone. When it came time to do it, I was pretty nervous but tried to explain the game rules to everyone. But it was evident right away that people kept wanting to add their own jokes in the middle of me speaking, kept talking over me or interrupting. I think I started to get annoyed and kept looking at my mom for help. They would quiet down again, but then go right back into making jokes as if I wasn't speaking to begin with. Take in, there were about 20 people in the same small room, and 80% of them were speaking over each other trying to get a one liner in. 

We started the game and I had 1 aunt, let's call her Jay who kept egging me on. Telling me I was cheating again and again, obviously for jokes. But I think because she started, her group of 4 contestants, including my other aunt from Ottawa, my mom, and Jay's husband (My uncle) got so loud and kept arguing with me and fighting with me. I thought it was all jokes and I kept playing up with the jokes. But they kept doing it and I was starting to get stressed out. Kept delaying the game by yelling that I was aiding in cheating and abetting. Which was actually all jokes for sure, but it was delaying the game because I didn't know how to react so I'd react by fighting. And now I know that was really wrong. Or sometimes, my aunt from Ottawa who is really competitive would get in my face and tell me to reduce other team's points by a point. And my mom told me later that I kept raising my hand out almost like a block hand motion, and it looked really disrespectful. I didn't even clock it in the moment, but I saw a video that my mom recorded of the madness later on, and it actually did look really disrespectful and I've been feeling terrible about it. 

Another thing to be noted was that 1 of the categories for the questions I prepared was about my brother. But a lot of these questions I asked him the day of discretely so he wouldn't know what I was talking about. 1 of the questions I asked was what his favourite hobby was, and he told me that it was clubbing and going out with the boys. So I put both on the card in case anyone got it. I asked during the trivia game this question, and despite 10 answers being thrown my way - No one answered correctly. I finally revealed the right answer when they asked, and my brother screamed, ""It's not!"" And he started telling everyone that it was a joke when he said it, and he thought I would clock it. But I truly didn't know it was a joke, and I think he and my mom got really embarrassed by that answer and I felt so bad. Because I genuinely didn't know it was a joke, especially because he's been talking about clubbing with everyone for weeks. Anyways, he screamed that, and because of that everyone started egging on me. My dad's sister who sort of glazes my brother a lot got really pissed off because she thought that I said that to make my brother the brunt of the joke. When it actually wasn't. And she voiced it as such, and everyone started hopping on the train and started yelling about us both being implicit in cheating. 

I should note that we're from a desi household that often likes to do this at parties, where if there is a younger kid running the games - They like to yell at you, interrupt you, and call you out for cheating constantly even though you're not. So I knew what I was getting into, but not the degree of stress of it. 

After I asked my mom today if I was being disrespectful, I called my cousin brother who has grown to be very close to me in the last 4 years. He's 13 years older, so I tend to go to him for a lot of advice and help. And he basically told me that yes, I was being disrespectful. I was being aggressive over a family game when I should have been chill, was getting riled up, was using strong language, and was basically not being cool during something that was supposed to be fun. 

When I asked my 2 other first cousins about it, they said the opposite and that it's a hard situation to even navigate. I think I did act terribly, and I feel incredibly guilty. Especially because there were seniors in the game, and I've always been known to be the kind and soft spoken girl in the family. I fear that I'm going to be seen with an attitude, and I feel terrible for the way I acted. Should I apologize to everyone to make up for it? Or do I just sit with this and try to move on and do better next time? I'm having difficulty focusing on my work because I can't stop spiraling.

640,2,"I'm a F and in my early 20s I am a college student and the only job I have ever had was a research assistant on campus but I didn't even have to do an interview. Now that it is summer Ive been applying to jobs but have gotten no answer. And when thinking about interviews I get so anxious and scared that I'm going to say something stupid and make a complete fool out of myself since I've never had the practice. 

As a person with social anxiety how do I get though this obstacle of not wanting to do interviews or not even wanting to walk into a place where I can meet the manager personally and ask for an interview right then and there. My family wants me to get a job but there not really pushing me to do so but I still want to get one. My younger brother on the other hand is very extroverted and things come easily for him he's done interviews and has walked in to places to get a job. 

I get so embarrassed from this fact that I'm not going out and doing the same thing. How do I get over this and does anyone have tips on how to prepare/interview questions they may ask. "
641,2,"Hey. Something I realized from my interactions with others, whether positive, neutral, or negative.. 

I noticed that my thoughts surrounding this all revolved around me speaking negatively about myself in the end. Shutting down my own experience. 

How can I grow if I have myself saying “that was pathetic, embarrassing, not worth it”.. 

Those aren’t encouraging, affirming words. 

So, I began meditating and reading daily. 

Firstly, meditating helps to recognize those thoughts that you really don’t even they’re there.. (awareness/mindfulness) 

And then, I’ll read or listen to a spiritual book on growth, love, compassion etc. 

So now. When I know I have a day of social interaction I cannot avoid. I give myself compassion. I tell myself I’m going to do great no matter what, that I am great, that I am funny, and worthy of a good time. Regardless of being awkward or tongue tied. And you know what? At least im not beating myself up for small talk, or a friendly hello, or just walking the beach. 

It’s been a slow process. But this is really the only thing that’s worked as of late. 

I recommend reading radical acceptance by Tara Brach. As well as any of her podcasts/meditation. Truly an amazing human.

642,2,"Every time I talk with strangers, friends, or even family, I can't help but stutter and feel nervous. I hate the thought of people thinking I'm nervous around them. I wish I could just speak confidently and not worry about what others think. So, I'm curious, what do people generally think when I'm around?"
643,2,"M22. I downloaded Hinge, and you know how it is with dating apps. The rare match that dies down after 1 or 2 messages. I overthink the texting way too much. I'm not really much of a texter. Never really texted that much girls. The anxiety that I have is that I might see some girl that I matched with in public from where the conversation died. I won't really know what to do or say. It scares me because I feel like they might laugh at me for being awkward on the app or how I won't engage if seen in public"
644,2,"I used to have severe social anxiety to the point I just could not talk to people, make eye contact or function properly in a social setting, even amongst my childhood friend group whom I had know for 10+ years, I would get unusually quite and awkward. this anxiety would get even worse if I smoked weed or did acid (it was the worse on acid) even when sober, when with people, sometimes my brain would just freeze due to anxiety.

But I am a totally different person now, and I think the key thing to overcome anxiety or any mental issue for that matter is to overcome your insecurities one by one. we all have insecurities at a subconscious level weather we believe it or not. mine was that I wasn't very strong, talented or an interesting person, and I had acne all over my face. the first change was when I got my acne healed. the second was that I started working out and got in a better shape, and 3rd was that I got a decent job and started making good money. all of these provide validations which boost our confidence and help us get rid of the underlying anxiety. But I believe the single biggest factor which helped me and anyone to overcome social anxiety or any mental health issue is GO TO THE FUCKING GYM!!!! or do any hard intense physical activity. GYM is best as it makes your body aesthetically better as well and you just feel good for yourself. 

I am a totally different person now, deep down I think I am still an introvert, but I can be an extrovert and socialize with people, say what I want with confidence and just be myself, I love myself now, this version of me is a mfing G, and I am putting this out there to help anyone to whom it can be useful.

ps: I still get anxiety when I'm on acid though if anyone got the solution let me know below haha."
645,2,"would love to start going to the gym and exercising, especially since graduating from college, and on holidays. The only thing is I would be so nervous there, I never really been going to gyms and I don't think I would enjoys being around that many people, especially girls lol. Additionally, I don't really know machines and workouts, and I'm not really confident I feel like everyone would be looking at me and I would look stupid.   "
646,2,I don't know if this is a form of social anxiety but as a woman in college who is in her 20s I have never dated anyone or have had any college male friends. I can not talk to any guy normally without getting nervous or anxious even when I don't find them attractive. Most of the time the guys I may talk to are usually in the same club on campus or in a group of friends. I've reflected and come to the realization that I get anxious from the thought of guys thinking I like them by simply just talking to them. Ive been told that I am pretty but when I look in the mirror I do not see that I have low confidence about my appearance due to having been an ugly duckling growing up and being asked out as a joke etc. I feel like guys think I may like them by just talking to them and being nice then I get anxious that I am being to nice and they think I'm being desperate due to my belief that I am not that good looking. Does anyone else think this way or am I just a ball of irelevant anxiety. 
647,2,"Hello, I need your help community! One of my issues is that I get physical anxiety, symptoms of really dry mouth and lips and dilated pupils. Can you help me with what medication would at least help to minimize those so I don’t feel like people are as aware of how terrified I feel inside. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
648,2,"Hi everyone, I’m Alex Wong. I’m from Malaysia and currently living in Europe. I’ve dealt with social anxiety for as long as I can remember, especially when it comes to speaking. In my case, I stutter, which has made many social situations incredibly difficult.

Like many here, I’ve experienced the emotional weight of this: embarrassment, shame, and a deep sense of self-blame after struggling to speak. I used to practice for hours just to avoid messing up or stuttering during conversations or presentations. But even after all that effort, I would sometimes freeze or block completely, and then spend hours beating myself up.

A few years ago, I discovered **Acceptance and commitment therapy ACT**. It helped me start to accept that anxiety and discomfort are part of who I am and that I can still live a full life even with those challenges.

But acceptance alone didn’t take away the fear.

Even when I gave myself permission to be imperfect, I still felt overwhelming fear in everyday situations, like ordering at a restaurant, answering the phone, or giving a presentation at work. I realized that deep down, I was still avoiding speaking because of how physically and emotionally uncomfortable it felt: sweating, shaking, freezing, or mentally going blank.

Recently, I started practicing structured exposure through **task-based desensitisation**. Basically, I created a list of small speaking tasks that I could work through. For example:  
  
saying “By card, thanks” at the supermarket  
calling to make a doctor’s appointment  
giving a weekly report at work

Sometimes I just jot these tasks down in my phone. Other times, I use a small app I’ve been trying called [Voice journey](https://voicejourneyapp.com) that helps me track them. I also rehearse conversations using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) in voice mode, especially when I need to practice in German which is not my first language.

After each task, I take a moment to reflect on what went well and what didn’t. This helps me notice progress and avoid spiraling into self-criticism. It also shows me that even “bad” speaking moments can still be part of a positive trend.

One thing I’ve learned: doing easy tasks regularly makes the harder ones easier over time.

After a few months of this practice, I’m much more confident in everyday situations. In the past, even a phone call could lead to days of anxiety and procrastination. Now, I can usually just pick up the phone and talk.

That said, I’m still working on some things - like stuttering openly, or maintaining eye contact when I feel anxious. I think part of me still carries shame. Maybe true confidence will come when I can fully be myself, even during awkward or difficult moments.

I wanted to share this because I know how hard it is to break out of that cycle of avoidance. If you’ve had similar experiences with speaking, freezing, or social fear, I’d love to hear what’s helped you. Let’s improve together.

I also shared a version of this post in the r/Stutter subreddit, where I connect more specifically with others who stutter. But I wanted to post here too, because I think many of the same struggles and strategies apply to social anxiety in general."
649,2,"Let’s hope I don’t try to fake sick or something last minute to skip. I want to actually conquer it for once. It’ll only be less than 15 mins in front of the class, but in Spanish (😫 plus my voice is quiet). I’ll probably practice tonight. Wish me luck!… "
650,2,"I just recently moved into a room of a very sweet family of three. There are 3 floors (townhouse setup) and I live on the first floor.

My main issue is I am sort of mortified to use the kitchen. I went out and bought a small bit of groceries today (mostly non-perishable, I have a mini fridge in my room) but even being told that I could come make my own food at any time, I'm still tempted to just go without food or just live off non-perishables for the rest of my three month stay.

I'm just anxious because what if they expect me to eat with them? It wasn't stated in the agreement, and it wasn't a house rule. Though, maybe they don't want me to eat in my room? I think I am overthinking it, but I just really don't want to be a bother.

They are currently cooking for themselves, so I might try and go up and make some ramen once they are finished. I'm just scared to look weird or mess something up."
651,2,"Hello, I loved wearing a mask or balaclava in public that allowed less of my face to be seen and since I have stopped I am not really going outside nearly as much anymore. I was hoping that someone could recommend a mask for me.



It can get 100+ fahrenheit where I am at so it would need to be thin. But I wear glasses so it would be best if the top fit snugly against my face. It would also be nice if it was not suctioned to my face or looked out of the regular."
652,2,"Lately… or maybe all my life, I’ve always been quiet, shy, timid, gloomy, nonchalant. And honestly, I hate the way I am. If I could start over in life, I would. If I could erase all my memories, I would. I hate who I’ve become. I feel so pathetic. A loser. Awkward. Cringe. Everything I never wanted to be, I am.

I don’t know when it started, but I don’t find anything funny anymore. Like, nothing. I have to look for laughter — on YouTube, on social media — just to try to feel something. I keep hoping something makes me laugh because laughing feels good. But I mostly just feel empty. Like I have nothing going on in my life, so I just watch others live theirs. I don’t *live*. I’m just here, existing. Too lazy to move, too lazy to function.

Even around my own friends — and I only have like five — I feel awkward. Yesterday, we celebrated one of their birthdays. She used to be my closest friend for years. But when I saw her yesterday, I felt nothing. I tried so hard to make conversation so things wouldn’t be awkward. But there was no real connection anymore. And I think I'm just holding on to these friendships because they’re all I have left. Even if we’re not close like we used to be.

The birthday girl — my so-called ""main best friend"" — kept saying things like “Zoe?” because I'm not being talkative and hyper and maybe chalant like the other friends and laughing at how nonchalant I am and I just stood there quietly while they joked around. I’m not the kind of person who plays or fools around like that. And I hate that I get mocked for being how I am. I dissociated the whole time. I wanted it to be over. But we always celebrate birthdays at my house because it has an aircon, so I felt like I had no choice.

The truth is, that best friend connection we had? It was only real in 2018 and 2019. After that… I think we were just holding on to the memory of those years. I don’t even feel close to her anymore. Even when it’s just the two of us, it feels off. I feel like I bore her. And when her other friends are around, I feel like I don’t even exist. Like I’m not the “main” one anymore — just someone in the background.

I know I’m not their favorite friend. I have no best friend anymore. And I’ve accepted that. Just like I’ve accepted I’ll probably never be in a relationship. My standards are too high, and honestly, I’m way out of my own league. I’m awkward and socially incapable. Even in chats, I don’t know what to say. I hate myself. I hate everything that’s happened in my life that made me end up like this.

One of the reasons I don’t want to go to school anymore is because of *everything*. The anxiety. The numbness. The depression. I feel emotionally dead, like I don’t have real opinions or direction. I just follow whatever happens. I hate myself and everyone. I don’t want to beg for anyone to stay. I just want to be far away.

My dream is to make a lot of money and move abroad. Not even to have a perfect life — just to disappear. To live far enough where no one can contact me again. I’m done forcing myself into people’s lives. If our friend group fades away, then so be it. I won’t cut anyone off, but I know I’ll barely see them again. And maybe I’m the problem. Maybe it’s me distancing. But I can’t help it.

I just want to start over. Somewhere far. I honestly feel like nothing could be worse than this."
653,2,"That's a silly question but I think my SA would be much less pronounced if everyone in the world would feel the same.

Idk why but I'm pretty sure I would be less prone to get "" very uncomfortable "" within people if they would be like me.

If someone has a broken leg in the street everyone will notice it, if everyone had a broken leg nobody will notice it, I think that's the same for SA.

So, is it really our fault having a broken leg ? 

I don't think so, it's their fault to keep on perceiving us as weirdos."
654,2,"for the test, we have to do a 360 of our room and i really don't want to do that since it's a mess (some things i can't clean/move) and im just concerned of what the proctor is going to think of me (；′⌒\`)

  
"
655,2,So many artists coming to where I live and I would love to see but too anxious to go by myself. If I had a friend to go with it would be so much easier because I would have someone with me. But by myself I don't think I could do it. If you've been to a concert by yourself how was it ?
656,2,"I've taken Propanolol for about 15 years for situational social anxiety. It worked amazing at first. I remember taking a 10mg pill and feeling all SA symptons greatly disapear. Over the years I built up a tolerance and even when taking 60mg, it only barely muted SA symptoms (shaking, racing heart, blushing). I've never had any side effects from Propanolol, even at higher doses.

Would Atenolol or Nadolol be an effective alternative if Propanolol no longer works?"
657,2,"F(21) I recently got a sales job and it was a part time job with only about 15-18 hour weeks and 4 hour shifts sometimes 5. I didn’t even start the job I barely did the onboarding process but when I got home from that onboarding process my mind went wild. I had the worst anxiety attack of my life. I ended up going to the hospital. I started to worry about any little thing about the job. I was filling my head with these what ifs like what if I fail and I get fired? Or what if I get a bad customer and they yell at me? What if I can’t do what they want me to? Another thing is thinking about being at work while my friends or family are home is so hard it’s like my mind refuses to let me leave. These past couple of days have been hard I ended up quitting my job before my first shift and ever since I’ve been anxious. I can’t sleep, I can’t eat without getting nauseous so I haven’t eaten, I have about 7 anxiety attacks a day. I’m so terrified that I’ll never be able to get a job and then it spirals into I’m worried for my future because that way I see it I’m not going anywhere and I’m so scared I feel like I’m losing myself. At this point I don’t feel like I can get a job ever and that truly terrifies me. "
658,2,"This is one of the only things that I can remember that happened to me.

I was still in highchool, like.. year 10 or 11, pretty sure I was in year 11 and this guy came over, he was with a girl, either his girlfriend or friend and he asked if I was ok, me being nervous, jokingly said ""no"" (my tone probably didn't make it obvious if I was joking) and I remember him saying ""...mentally?"" Unless he said ""are you ok mentally?"" And then I didn't register the mentally until have but I have no idea, I've not forgotten it, I think its been.. maybe.. a year.. 2 years since that happened? I cant remember if I replied after he said ""mentally"" I probably awkwardly said yes.

I was sat alone reading my book I'm pretty sure. I kept thinking about it after 😭"
659,2,My 6yo is having his end of year party this friday and I dread going. I don't like being around all those people and I start sweating so badly. It's noticeable. At the Xmas party that happened and I was talking to a really nice dad with sweat pouring down my face and neck. I wish this would go away but it gets worse as I get older. And he wants to see his friends over the summer. But I also love that he's so social because I really am not and never have been. Any friends I made in the past we're made because THEY approached me and kept talking. What to do what to do. Just wanted a place to share my bubbling anxiety because I can't seem to explain to my loved ones without judgment.
660,2,"I'm about to go at several events where there are some people that I enjoy being around with. I was invited during for some of those events in 2023 and the experience has been great for overcoming my social anxiety little and little, but I have a big dinner party coming and I'm partially dreading it. I know I have been experiencing these uncomfortable situations for a while, but I don't know, it feels worse and worse being around people, so I wanted to ask how would you approach the situation in a place where you only know some people (but those are people that are like-minded in some parts)."
661,2,"I've started to notice some patterns about how I perceive other people and their interests. I was talking to some people online and I realized I approached talking about interests with a lot of uncertainty, like ""what would I even say to them about it?"" and ""will they even understand?"" and it caused me to reflect on my life up until this point.

In school I only hung out with my one group of friends until senior year of high school (and one of those high school years was during the covid pandemic), and as a child my parents would just bring me along to wherever they had to be. So that meant I would be around my parents' friends, coworkers, etc. Basically I was around mostly adults as a kid, and most of those adults knew nothing about my interests, so I think I've been conditioned to approach conversations about things I like as if the other person doesn't know anything.

Can anyone else understand or relate to this? Just curious."
662,2,Is there any methods and or training that any of you guys know that can help you overcome SA? I’m really tired of struggling with this please if you know anything let me know 
663,2,"I spent so much of my life, frozen inside the fear of severe social anxiety, always thinking it would never get better.

As a child, at home I was referred too as, “defiant, dramatic, sensitive, and just too much.”

In school, I was always, very shy and quiet. I never really fit in, and by middle school, I was on a laundry list of medication that did not help.

Teachers often did not like me, because I simply would not speak to them, if I was anxious, I was not going to speak, and to this day, will still not speak in an environment where I am very afraid and anxious.

By high school, I was in complete academic failure and was skipping school.

It wasn’t until my own child was diagnosed with autism, a social phobia, and selective mutism, that I learned I too suffered from severe social anxiety.

After my child was diagnosed, his provider, looked me in the face and said, “I don’t say this to be mean, but he got this from you.” & I then learned how it is often genetic.

The most improvement and relief, I have ever found was through medication and advocacy.

It took almost a year to find the right combination of medication, and a provider who is so kind, caring, and compassionate.

What I found in advocacy, in advocating for my child to not be treated the way I was as child, the way so many were treated, is that it gave me my voice back, it gave me my power back.

I, of course still struggle, but being able to finally acknowledge, understand, and accept that I am not flawed, was never flawed, and deserved better as a child; gave me the ability to work on my self worth, to finally love myself enough to get treatment, to be a person who loved herself.

You are not broken. You are not flawed.

You are worth everything life has to offer. You are worth love and kindness.

I’ve found, I do not like, crowded public places. I’ve found, I do not like family functions with people I do not know.

So guess what, I simply do not go to them. & the people who think, I’m mean, or rude, or any unkind word, I walk away from. Because, not going into environments that cause me turmoil, does not make me any of the things, I’ve been told I am, for refusing.

If I do not know someone, I am likely not going to speak to them. If I am pressured or forced, I will simply leave that environment, and not come back.

I seriously, once quit a job, because I was being written up, for not speaking to my co workers enough, even in the hr room of that meeting, I wouldn’t speak, and was chastised for not doing so. I quit that day.

Because guess what? Verbal communication does not have to happen, to live a happy, functional life. I will email and text anyone, but verbally speaking, it’s very hard for me, I’ve learned to do it more and more, by being able to script, but anyone who tries to force it, they are not someone I choose to have in my life.

It can get better. I promise. To the ones struggling, I’m so sorry.

No matter what, please know, you always matter, and you are always worthy, always. Just as you are.

If no one else has said it, I’m so proud of you.❤️"
664,2,"I’m 18 and straight out of high school, as I’m typing this I haven’t even walked the stage yet for my graduation and Ive been pressured into getting my first job. For background, I got into a very high ranking college that is 3 hours away from my home town, which I will be leaving for in 2 months. Knowing this, I didn’t feel like it was the right time to get my first job and instead get that experience on my home campus as it is massive and offers many opportunities. Nonetheless I applied yesterday for a small retail job in my towns mall, and I’m absolutely terrified in getting it. I did a walk in to ask about hiring (pressured by my parent) and I actually got along with the assistant manager their pretty decently, he even asked for my info and said he’d put in a good word. While I’m honored and appreciate the opportunity he’s already giving me in my first steps, I really do not want this job. My fears lie within my anxiety, social and just anxiety in general. I do not want to mess up, get yelled at, feel stupid and cry in front of strangers cause of being overwhelmed. Personally I never had time to decompress from high school as I took incredibly hard classes that stressed me out till the last day (all AP classes) so applying for this job just added more stress that I never recovered from before. I don’t know how to talk to people, and you have to be VERY direct with me when you ask me to perform a task or else I’ll think of every single way I COULD do a task and end up worrying on if the way I chose to do it is wrong, resulting in me getting yelled at. But, being realistic, I do realize that this is life, I have to do this at some point and I have to learn this experience, I just need help trying to calm my anxiety about this situation. I submitted my application a day ago and they told me they’d get back in a few days, so this morning I woke up in a panic to check my email. This application and potential job is the only thing on my mind and all the potential outcomes of failure. How do I manage this? How do I overcome this anxiety about pretty much every aspect of this job? I’ve only ever participated in volunteer work that was relatively easy and didn’t require much interaction with other people. I have no idea what I’m doing and I’m freaking out, how do I navigate my way through my fears?"
665,2,"I've been living with anxiety for more than 35 years now, and I prefer to be left alone when possible. I feel I need some place to rest and do literally nothing for a week because I don't sleep too well neither. But in every hotel I've been there's always someone knocking on my door at random hours and asking to enter for change sheets, etc. And frankly, this triggers me to the point I just want leave and go home.

Do you guys find this to be annoying too? Is there any kind of Hotel or Resort that doesn't do that? Thx."
666,2,"I've been seeing a lot of post here from people that started feeling social anxious fairly recent, like 3 - 4 years ago. I've in this journey since when i was at least 10, now I'm 27 years old, so lately I've been wondering if it's ""normal"" to be in this sh\*t for about 17 years."
667,2,"PREFACE - its like 2 AM for me and this is probably gonna read like word soup

i dont even really know what to put here. i just feel like even if i wanted to put myself out there again, im too far gone or that im a shell of who i am/was (shit, i dont even know who i am anymore) when you spend years too scared to make genuine connections and putting on a performance for a family you KNOW wants to help you but youre still too scared to be vulnerable in front of anyone just leaves you as a ghost roaming around in someone else's reality. im just so tired of being up this late with this tightness in my chest because im too anxious to ever let people in. i told myself i was gonna put myself out there this summer, but that turned into being too depressed to shave or brush my teeth, making me spiral about how im not cut out for life and sending me back to square one"
668,2,"Guys tomorrow is my first day of high school in 11th grade and I'm very scared because I'm chopped asl, I'm introverted, I can't hold conversations properly and half of me is brainrot😭 any help (except ""just be yourself"" istg) is much appreciated, thanks!"
669,2,"My parents have been urging me to get a job over the summer. They think it would be a good chance for me to get used to socializing more and make some money at the same time. I understand where they're coming from but I am horrified. 

First of all, I have never applied to a job before, and I don't know what to expect during an interview, so I am really scared of that. Even after the interview(assuming I even get hired), I know I will have to socialize a lot more than I normally do, because the whole point of me getting a job is to improve my social skills, and I don't really have the qualifications to work anything other than a minimum wage job. I feel like after a few hours in such a stressful environment I'm going to come back home totally beat every day. 

For those of you who have a job or experience, what preparations did you make for the job interview, and how do you deal with all the socializing?"
670,2,"What would be some good challenges or tasks to do to beat social anxiety

Please mention the monetary and non monetary ones

Also would love to be inspired from your experiences"
671,2,"So there is a cousin of mine with whom I spent my last summer holiday together for 20 or 30 days, and he is my fav cousin. But a strange thing happened last year, he was starting to annoy me as we were reaching our last days together, as he has never annoyed me before I thought it is strange and i was baffeled for a year about it now. Also we have lived together for a week or two in the past, but he has never annoyed me. Could it be because of him strongly changing and becoming super toxic after the long time in which we didn't see each other?   
  
The same has already happened to me in the past. When I was 6-7 y.o, my cousin(another cousin) got a surgery and was anesthetized, after which she became rude and not pleasant, and she also would annoy me. So now I'm thinking, if I answered my own question or not. This phenomenon also worries me about my future, for example, what if the same happens with my lover too: while we are a couple and not living together I would enjoy the time spent with her, and after the matrimony and living with and being exposed to her everyday, her presence would also bring me distaste."
672,2,"To me, AVPD seems to be just a more extreme form of SAD from what I've read. According to Wikipedia, personality disorders in general are inflexible though which would suggest that they're not completely treatable (?) but I wouldn't really see how that'd be the case with AVPD since it shares many of the same symptoms as SAD and SAD is treatable. "
673,2,"I've been told I gotta work on this, but I just don't know how to get rid of this terrible habit. I'm always worried if I don't keep my friends entertained or comfortable, they'll get cold, distant, and then leave. Say something not cool or funny enough? They'll leave. Have too many awkward silences? You're cooked. I'm so tired of constantly being on edge, only surviving, while doing things that are supposed to be fun with friends. I KNOW it's making me less fun and engaging to be around as well, because all I can think about is making it through the social game, putting me in a tired, stressed mood. I've tried challenging these beliefs, but my lizard brain completely obliterates whatever logic I put against it."
674,2,"I can't even fathom what it's like walking into a room full of people, strangers even, and being comfortable enough to talk. Being shy is living life on hard mode and I hate that I have a personality like that. It's just so hard to talk to people, much less make friends or date people, or just easily gain respect from others."
675,2,"I always fear that my friends secrelty hate me behind my back. If they poke fun at me, or tell me to shut up, even in a joking way, I start overthinking like I'm the root of all their problems. It feels stupid but that's just my thought process."
676,2,"I’ve been anxious about everything related to social settings since before I was even in kindergarten. Now im 25 and that’s the only way I really know how to be

The past few years I’ve tried therapy to get some independence from the anxiety and it has helped a lot in some aspects, like i can go inside stores, call people while im at work, and i have been working a lot on setting boundaries. I tend to not set boundaries and let myself get taken advantage of because of the intense anxiety that comes from that situation. However, i still cannot shake that feeling that every time i set boundaries, ask for assistance, point out something i would like addressed, i feel like i am starting a fight. And thats never been the case, I know that. I know that every time I mention things like that, it is almost always answered with respect, though not always followed through on. And i still feel like im in the wrong. 

Does that feeling ever go away? Is it just a permanent feeling from the anxiety that will stay with me? Is it less stressful to just stop setting boundaries or asking for behaviors to be reviewed or adjusted? Things weren’t easy before, but they were less complicated in this way"
677,2,"Hello, as seen on the title I will be going on my first date. I’m very excited but also very nervous. I’m 23 years old and I’ve never gone out on a date before and quite frankly, never talked to women before. That was until I met a girl online and started texting for a couple days, we have even talked on the phone. She has a beautiful voice and is very attractive. Im already working but she told me she’s pursing the same degree I got and she said she’s into gaming as well. So we have lots of things in common. But as mentioned, I’ve never actually talked and dated a women before. I’m very anxious of all the “protocols” to follow. For example, do I go knock on her door and ask for her. Do I hug her? How long should the date be? We are also supposed to go eat, obviously I I’m going to pay. Im also very shy and sometimes awkward so I don’t want to mess this up. I anyone could help me out, it would be greatly appreciated."
678,2,"I’m freaking out, what do i do? this is my 6th school, i’ve gone too, but my social anxiety has progressively gotten worse. I am nauseous, and shaking and i don’t know what to do. It’s tomrow morning. I don’t know what to do, it didn’t feel real till i grabbed my backpack and realised. I’m scared. Please reassure me it’ll be ok"
679,2,"So last few weeks I've been avoiding my usual time at the park because it seemed like a specific person kept trying to talk to me. Ever since then, I've noticed people are stopping and talking to each other, and this is going to sound crazy, but I got a distinct feeling they've bonded over the fact that I'm the neighborhood outcast who keeps to himself. Heck I actually caught the neighbors gossiping about me last year. 

Like I said, I know that sounds crazy and that there's no proof, but people initially think I'm friendly then find out that's not the case and then bond over the fact that they don't like me. Anyone else feel like they've had this intuition? 

Another moment where I got this is the old lady who lives in the house across the small path that separates our houses. She kept trying to talk to me and I'd be polite but usually when I avoid people it's sort of not subtle when I do it lol. Anyway, few days ago I'm driving into the neighborhood and she's chilling in the driveway with her grill and dog. Then after seeing me, she pulls it in the garage and closes the door. 

Point being I'm a loner and this tends to rub people the wrong way, over time I've learned to pick up on a vibe and trust it, even if I don't want to at all. So, anyone else out there that has had this intuition? Because I get a specific feeling in my stomach when this happens, and because of that I feel like I'm subconsciously picking up on a pattern. "
680,2,"Currently going through my second assessment. But also most people around me assume or think I am autistic. I am not driven by anxiety has much has I used to. So something like a few times a week, I have to be told that XYZ isn’t socially acceptable. But I never talked much before. So I just need to learn them I guess. I can’t really describe these emotions. "
681,2,"I never really liked socialing because i was scared but one month ago I cant talk normally in school, not even to teachers, the only few people i can talk to are my 3 closest friends and my parents, I cant ask or answer to teachers without my voice trembling and my heart beating like crazy. But im not afraid of being in parties or in big crowds, everything is ok except for talking. Does this even count as social anxiety and why is it so sudden, what happened to me, i wasnt THAT scared at talking to people before"
682,2,"so basically i built up the nerve to try therapy since i cried at my pcp office regarding wanting to get medicated and they said that should be the last resort. so i contacted a therapist i wanted to go to and they put me on a freaking waiting list which is really upsetting and my anxiety is only hindering me more and more, and tbh i feel like meds is the only way out of my social anxiety symptoms as i have anxiety that hinders me from being a functional human being and working on things i want to work on. so idk what should i do.. did you get medicated before therapy? or should i wait to see what a therapist thinks"
683,2,"I have just lost my brother. I can’t seem to tell people about my grief. I race out of church because I couldn’t bear the sympathetic hugs and expressions of condolences. This is a complicated grief, which makes it much harder to bear than other losses I’ve had in my life—but even then I tried to hide my sadness. "
684,2,"I’m a 20-year-old guy, and I have social anxiety. And it has ruined my life in so many ways. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. If I didn’t have this, maybe I could’ve been someone I’m proud of, someone with a normal, decent life. But I’m not. I feel pathetic most of the time.

I can’t go out like others, can’t enjoy anything, and I find it so hard to talk to people. Even though I have a few friends, we rarely meet now since college is over. I’ve graduated, and now I just stay at home all the time — either pretending to study for competitive exams or wasting my time glued to my phone. Most days, I just scroll endlessly or watch porn to numb myself for a while because it makes me forget how miserable I actually feel, even if it’s for a few minutes.

Truth is, I feel depressed all the time. It’s painful. I cry sometimes, thinking about how pathetic I’ve become, and how it feels like no matter what, nothing’s going to change. I feel like I’m stuck in a loop I can’t break out of. And honestly… suicidal thoughts cross my mind too. It scares me sometimes, but other times, I just feel numb.

I don’t know how long this is gonna go on. Maybe this is just how life is for me.

685,2,"""Hi, my name is Alberto and I've been struggling with Social Anxiety for 5 years. It's been really tough for me to make friends and I don't connect well with people in person. I've been looking for online friends to chat with, share experiences, and support each other - people who also feel lonely and like no one understands them 😔""

686,2,"Hi, it has happened to me for a few years now, to be very careful and receptive to the language of people, both the verbal and the non -verbal one, and I notice that, most of the time, especially at work, many people tend to give two/three coughs when they pass in front of me or when I exclaim a phrase, often this action of cough is also performed in a group, so it counts one person and immediately shortly after another, in addition to this they see Sometimes spitting on the ground when I am in my closeness.

Now let's put aside the discussion of allergies/paranoia or other because it is not any of these cases here, my brain instinctively tells me that there is something wrong and that I probably don't like these people, and the fact that they toxic, spit, or speak subliminally makes me think that they do not stand me at all or that they are targeting me in a group.

I am a neurodicinging person and I struggle to relate to social contexts and speak very little, but this thing begins to get nervous because I have not done anything to these people, but my instinct tells me that I have to see them as potential enemies, today I started doing the same too to reciprocate, but I think maybe I should be more asshole? Make me respect? I do not tolerate these behaviors and these gestures give me extremely annoyed, it happens both with people who meet outside but also at home and at work, and certainly linked to a psychological factor, it is not a question of paranoia or allergy, I repeat therefore we avoid such responses. Does it happen to you too? Do you also perceive something wrong? I sincerely want to compare them but they would never say what they think, tell me what you think and if you have a similar effect even."
687,2,"(19M) I don’t know if it’s because I’m awkward or just ugly, but I tried to ask a girl out for the first time and she called me a creep. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to start dating with social anxiety "
688,2,"I'm going back to work tomorrow, Monday. My anxiety is through the roof. Being away from people for a week is exactly what I needed. Something I know I need more of.

 I'm dreading going to work being surrounded by small talk, and being in an environment that just ughhhh! I just wanted to get that out. No need to comment. Thanks for listening. "
689,2,"(TW: suicidal thoughts) I really need to rant about this because I am so depressed and I am starting to give up. I don’t have anyone in my life. I can’t go anywhere by myself because of how bad my social anxiety is. All I want is to have friends, go out, go clubbing, meet new people, etc, but I just can’t. 

Being alone is so much more painful than it seems. I have always struggled with making friends and it has only gotten worse as I’ve gotten older. I don’t have a job either because of this. My social skills have plummeted and I am seriously beginning to give up on life. All I’ve ever wanted is to live my life but I can’t. I don’t see the point in living anymore because I know that I am destined for nothing. 

I want friends in real life so badly but I am just unable to make any. There is something about me that I think is off-putting because people have always struggled to like me as well. Idk what to do anymore. I can’t handle this. 

Someone please talk to me I’m starting to give up"
690,2,"Hey! 

I recently started dating a wonderful girl. Super smart, social, well spoken, kind, compassionate person. She ticks all the boxes for me. As well as challenges me with everything. 

A few weeks ago, it all caught up to me.. her intelligence is intimidating. Any deeper discussion with her is met with a swift response of knowledge that is impressive to me. 

We were having a conversation on something I thought I was super knowledgeable about, and she completely schooled me. The words  eluded me. I was a recluse for days. 

I realized, I only passively listen to podcasts/audiobooks. When I’m listening, I’ll grasp some things, zone out, miss the point.. have deep feelings on it, but when words come out.. they are lost. 

How is this related to SA? 

In my opinion, reading is possibly one of the best antidotes for it. 

If I can’t articulate a simple message on a topic that “I know so well”.. how will that make me feel in a conversation? Probably defeated. 

If I can’t connect/relate to any of the people around me. Simply because I’m uneducated, low-vocabulary, low comprehension. What am I doing here? I need to read to have opinions and healthy arguments on topics that matter to me. As well as educate others on what I value. 

If I just skim through Reddit as my reading material.. and sit at home. That’s all I will know. 

Until I focus, set time aside, and critically think about how a sentence is formed.. I’m really just at a loss for words. Which further disconnects me from everyone around me.

Maybe you feel the same way? 

I’ve been reading for a couple months now, and i think I feel a lot better.  

Just a small thought to a much bigger problem.

691,2,"I've never been diagnosed with any anxiety though I've never talked to a Dr about how I truly feel. I will get soo excited for events and be looking forward to then for weeks but then the day comes and I litterally start throwing up and my whole body is in so much pain I can't even leave the house. I really truly want to go to these events cause I was homeschooled and don't have many friends and anything I get invited to is such an excitement for me! I do hate how I look so it could be physiological but if I reeeeally have a desire to go despite how I look then how is this happening. I know people say your body confuses excitement with worry and can upset your stomach but then how do I stop this? I've missed 3 weekends in a row now due to this. If I'm not throwing up then I'm in so much pain and so tired I just can't get out of bed to make it. I wasn't depressed before cause life has been good but missing these events so often I'll eventually stop getting invited and then I will be depressed lol I have seen a Dr and gone to therapy for my body pain but they litterally told me they don't know how to help me after thousands of dollars and so many different treatments. I don't want to go back to the Dr cause they didn't help before ans I doubt they'll help with this they'll just label it anxiety but then my question is for anyone who might deal with this, have you been given anything that helps?

I also have an issue wanting to sleep all the time, I like my life but I LOVE dreaming and not feeling in pain ans I have the most vivid and intense dreams that lately cause of feeling sick each weekend I end up sleeping the whole time but having such fun dreams that it's almost making me addicted. I know they say you can't be addicted to sleep but with both being able to fall asleep at any moment, always being tired and in pain, plus having vivid and often lucid dreams where I can litterally fly and feel it so intense and remember the feeling when I wake up that it's making it sooo hard not to just want to sleep all the time.

I'm on the verge of giving up on being social at all cause of being sick evrrytime and sleeping/dreaming the weekends away when I've worked really hard from extreme poverty to get to a great life. It's so frustrating and it's started from my pain which makes it hard to workout which makes me hate my body but I've tried everything to solve that and been told there's no solution.
My biggest fear is I have a trip to Europe this summer and I'm scared I'm gonna get so sick or do something to mess it up somehow.

Please help with any advice or if getting help for anxiety helped make you less physically sick?"
692,2,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I've been in the online spaces for almost 20 years and I'm no newbie to online friendships. For many years I mostly interacted with people from various corners of the world and often we were hardly ever online at the same time. In the past few months I started talking to someone who lives a lot closer to me though and this person suggested meeting up, which I tried to politely turn down out of fear that meeting up would be anxiety inducing, awkward, plus I've never met anyone I've talked to online irl and I think I'd need more time or a different dynamic for it to not me so nerve wracking. They were nice about my decision but have since expressed the interest in voice calls and if anything is more nerve wracking than meeting people face to face, then it would be talking on the phone/voice chat.  

I like just messaging, I can take my time to think about stuff, reply when I feel like it, it's very low pressure and has worked for me with many people I met online for years. I worry that turning down these attempts makes me look weird/shady/rude or idk what else. This person claims to also struggle with social anxiety but perhaps in different ways than me, because I'd probably never ask someone to meet up or call. 

I don't know what kind of advice I'm looking for, perhaps just reassurance. I know that ideally I'd work on my social anxiety so that meeting new people and developing relationships with them would be something fun and not daunting but at the same time there is no requirement for an internet friendship to go beyond messaging and that brings me comfort. Whenever I have an awkward interaction with someone online (or irl, let's be real), I low-key just want to ghost/disappear/wish I never started talking to them, which is rude I guess? "

694,2,"I’ve lived in the same building for 7 years. I’m autistic and generally like being alone so I’ve never really known my neighbors.

Now I’m having to move (as a result of a bad property management company buying out my building) and I’m actually terrified of meeting my new neighbors. My parents are helping me next weekend but this weekend I’ve been slowly moving some stuff over. My new place is very small (only about 8 units) and I’ve seen a few people in the parking lot but stayed in my car to avoid them. 

I’ve now brought a ton of stuff over but have been sitting in my new apartment for the last 25 minutes just trying to build up the courage to go back outside. I need to move things. I don’t have time to be this anxious.

Im a single good looking dude but have been always TERRIFIED approaching a beautiful woman, my sis will point out a dime who wants me to approach her, but im like dude theres no way i can do that. but last night i Just sacked up and did it. She pointed out  this stunning girl out to me who was looking at me everywhere we walked around the bar, she hyped me up and told me to go and i finally said F it and went for it. I was scared for the first 20 seconds and then realized it was literally no biggie at all and i was just giving myself anxiety for no reason. She digged me, i digged her, and i got her number.

696,2,"Been living with SA for a few years now, and I leave the house like 2-3 times a month max. Never by myself. 

Now, whenever I HAVE to go out, there's one thing that just makes my skin crawl. What if I meet old acquaintances and they ask how I've been? They're probably interested in school or if I've gotten a job etc. I dont do any of that. How am I supposed to answer? The ideal scenario would be to just...start doing something. But it's really hard. I used to make art (my mood has been very low lately and I stopped that too), but here , art is kinda frowned upon. They'd probably think that if I have a hobby that doesn't bring in cash I'm just a dum-dum. 

Do I lie?(im a horrible-horrible liar) 
I cant tell them ""yeah, i have anxiety and i actually hope to 💀 soon ""

Instead of spending my time brooding and feeling crestfallen over my parents demise, I will most probably be angsty thinking about the eulogy I will have to give at the end of the mass/requiem. I am the only child so I am obligated to give the eulogy and cannot pass the buck to someone else(like a sibling). 

I also suffer from a speech impediment to boot which is induced by social anxiety. My brain just cannot function properly while giving a public speech. I don't ever  recall  giving a speech fluently and coherently which I have prepared beforehand. If its an impromptu speech, I can say a maximum of 2 lines at best. I just suck!!!!"

699,2,"One year ago my best friend asked me to be Toastmaster on his wedding. That started a year of anxiety and stress that begun in the morning and continued during the day. For a fucking year. I told myself that I would not back down this time and I FUCKING didn’t!

Just got back from the wedding party.
I delivered a speach in the church and the bridaltoast. Which then continued with presenting speakers at the dinner. 

I blacked out at church and don’t remember what I said, then every speach got a little easier. Halfway through dinner I actually had a little bit of fun. The bride and groom seemed really happy and thanked me and a bunch of guests shook my hand and told me I did great. One friend even asked me if I would consider doing it again at their wedding.

This is the biggest victory I’ve had, ever. I’m so proud of my self. The year of suffering is finally over and I can move on with my life. My god what a feeling….."
700,2,"So I am an adult (26F) and I do have some very deep rooted  issues with self esteem (to the point where i rarely go outside and when i do I have a mask on) that I am currently dealing with with my therapist. But today, I went swimming with my niece and my mom, and while I was in the pool minding my business this group of high schoolers literally called me fat out loud and i knew they were talking about me cause i looked and theynwere laughing and looking syraight at me . I am a big girl, always have been and I was bullied for it most of my life. It usually takes a lot for me to go outside because I am afraid of stuff like this happening I confronted them and asked if they were talking about me and it typical bully fashion they said no. But literally they were staring at me the whole time.. I even had took a picture of my niece and when I looked in the background those same girls were staring straight at me. I really wish this didn't effect me as much as it did, but i cant for the life of me unfestand why I had to be the target This unfortunately brought back feelings that I am working so hard to fix and i feel like at 26 I shouldnt be that effected  by what people say about me. But like why keep staring at me if I am not even bothering you. I had fun of course and I taught my niece how to swim, but its hard to look back on happy memories when it was plagued by this "

702,2,"I am aware this sounds dumb but I am really anxious about going to the hairdresser. It is my idea of hell. Small talk, full of beautiful confident people and mirrors everywhere haha agghh. 

I have a new job coming up so I have to get it done on Weds. I went for the first time in September since I was a child and I'm 33 now. It was awful- I left with a huge sweat patch on my back and just acted really weird. I did say I was anxious and it just made the whole appointment really awkward. I was forced to look at myself in the mirrors with their horrible lighting and watch myself overthink too haha.

Is looking at my phone acceptable or is that rude?  What is a normal thing to be looking at when looking at your phone cause they're bound to look? I don't have social media and have finished all my other work that I can do through my phone.... 

Thanks!

704,2,"Hi everyone, I'm curious to see how others have found a boyfriend/girlfriend or even just best friends, while struggling with social anxiety. 

I'm (26F) introverted and socially anxious, more so with males unfortunately, which almost always ruin things with them. As I'm just weirder, more anxious and super self conscious around the opposite sex. 

Due to past experiences I've been super closed off to others, regardless of gender or friendship roles. However I'm now starting to lean towards wanting to make friends or perhaps a boyfriend if I'm lucky enough. I've tried dating apps once before (am thinking of trying again, but have heard horror stories recently). The last time I got overwhelmed and I felt like I was being too swallow basing a person on their picture. Only ended talking to 2 people as that in itself was a lot already before giving up entirely on the app. 

I've never been in a relationship and feel like it's going to be so awkward being that up to anyone that I meet given my age (and its only going up further 🤣). I'm recently new to the town I reside in (QLD, AUSTRALIA). I have a few places I want to check out, however due to anxiety I've postponed so many times already. Now I've fallen out of speaking terms with my cousin (23F) who we'd planned to go out with together, so the only other person that I can take with me is my Mum, as I don't think I could do new places by myself. However I feel like that may be embarrassing and could lower my chances at meeting someone as well. 

I'm just wondering how others go about friendships or new relationships with social anxiety? Is there anything that helps you personally? 
Or any other tips or advice would be much appreciated. "
705,2,"I’m traveling in Italy at the moment and am not very good with Italian. When I talk to workers I get super nervous, I mean if I’m shy in my home country it’s extra bad now that I’m in a foreign country.

We were checking our bags for a church in Florence and the worker at the entrance (who was drop dead gorgeous btw making everything worse, idk why but judgement from beautiful people hurts most) was friendly in the beginning, and asked if I spoke Italian because I greeted him in Italian.

He helped escort us inside the bag deposit room, but when it came time to deposit my backpack, I didn’t know what to say other than “one” (in Italian). But then the entrance worker, who was now standing behind the counter workers, said “Per favore” (please), meaning he was asking me to add a please.

I keep forgetting to add please because in English it’s easier to incorporate into the sentence but I keep blanking out in Italian….

I always say thank you though, but maybe that’s not enough and I was being rude this entire time.

I’m so embarrassed and hoping someone will share a similar story so I don’t feel so alone, thank you in advance

EDIT: I made a typo in the title. I meant please, not thank you!!! I always say thank you, but I forget “please”"
706,2,"Hi,

I have tried so much for my severe Social Anxiety , Dissociation and Depression but I barely find relief.

Beside all the lifestyle interventions, relaxation techniques, proper diet, proper sleep, doing sports and lots of therapy (Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy and other stuff), I have tried almost every medication under the sun (and thousands of combinations thereof)

* All kind of **SSRI** (including Vortioxetine) and **SNRI**
* **Tricyclics** and other antidepressants (Doxepin, Trimipramine, Amytriptiline, Trazodone, Mirtazapine, Tianeptine)
* **Stimulants** like Bupropion, Modafinil, Methylphenidat, Lisdexamfetamine
* **Anticonvulsants** like Gabapentin, Pregabalin, Lamotrigine
* **MAO-Inhibitors** like Moclobemide and Tranylcypromine (Nardil is not available in my country)
* **Ketamine infusions**
* **Neuroleptics** like Quetiapine and Aripiprazol
* **Others:** Buspirone, Hydroxyzine, Clonidine, Propranolol, Kratom, Kava, Microdosing Psychedelics, CBD, Cannabis

Additionally I had Electroconvulsive Therapy and TMS

Blood work is okay: No deficiencies (including hormones like Testosterone or Thyroid)

High dose Psychedelics are no option at the moment. MIF-1 is no option because of the Kratom I take

I really dont know what to do anymore. The only things that keep me alive are **Clonazepam, Phenibut** and **Baclofen** (each of them every once in a while) **+ Kratom**

I know Phenibut, Baclofen and Clonazepam are addicting as hell but damn I really dont know what to do anymore....

If you have any recommendations, please let me know..."

708,2,"Is it just me or does everyone with social anxiety deal with this? Whenever I meet someone new and work up the courage to speak to them it feels like I am tucked away in a corner of my mind watching myself interact with them without audio because all here is me over thinking words but my mouth is on autopilot seamlessly connecting and holding a conversation but I have no idea what I am saying or what they are saying until the conversation ends and it always ends normally and nice. So after they leave I have no idea what we spoke about, I don’t even remember their name and I am exhausted. What is this? Why does this happen? Do you experience this as well?"
709,2,"Everytime I g eat invited out, I have to convince myself to go because socializing is good for you. However, my heart rate goes crazy and I feel sick. Afterwards, I fall into a deep depression and can’t get out of bed due to ruminating about everything that was said. Sometimes I will even hurt myself to feel better. 

My thoughts are: everything I say is stupid. For example, while playing beer pong I hear a group behind me talking about the economy. I turn to my partner and say, “They’re talking about the economy!” She stares at me like Im a bitch and goes, “Wow, great party talk” then does not say another word to me for the rest of the night. However, that topic was of interest, it just came out like I was bashing them. 

During beer pong she also got hit in the face with a ball and I said, “Theres only one time I like to get hit in the face with balls snd its not this time!” …awkward silence. 

All in all, everything I say is dumb and recieved poorly and it makes me never want to open my mouth. "
710,2,"I (24M) work at a “fast casual” restaurant and most of my coworkers are young college aged students (mainly 18 and 19, with some 20 yrs olds). It is a very sociable workplace and everyone there has great chemistry and hang out everyday after work. Many even went to high school together.

I just feel like I’m at a completely different age bracket though, which makes socializing with them feel uneasy, even though we’re only like 5-6 years apart. They constantly roast each other, turn everything into a giant meme, goof off, etc which sometimes makes it feel like a high school cafeteria tbh. Myself, on the other hand, prioritizes getting my work done before socializing. And because of this, I’m perceived by everyone there as a non-social loser, which just makes it even harder to form chemistry with anyone there.

I never really socialized much in high school (and am generally kinda shy and introverted), so that could also be part of the reason why I feel out of place there. "

712,2,"I’ve exposed myself daily for years, been in therapy but i’m not improving so it’s time to try something new. What medication(s) have helped you? 

"
713,2,"Went out with some friends I hadn’t seen in a while. Good people — I actually like being around them. But for some reason, it felt like a part of my drive was switched off. I was so damn silent, emotionally dull, had little to nothing to say. My brain wasn’t interested in engaging or connecting, I was just… there. Straight face, nothingness. No stories, no jokes, no memories coming up, and whatever I did say felt forced because it was expected.

4 years ago, I was the life of the room. I’d crack jokes, tell stories, pull pranks, start conversations effortlessly. Now it feels like my brain forgot how to think. Memory’s a mess too — can’t recall events, can’t make conversation naturally. Feels like my mind isn’t forming memories properly anymore.

Now to the point: I’ve been one month p\*rn-free after 6 years of compulsive use. I used it for everything — boredom, anxiety, sadness, you name it. Tried to quit for 3 years, and only when I dropped the triggers (social media, alcohol, weed, bad sleep) was I able to push past 100 days once a few months ago.

Some of you will say “see a professional” — I did. Saw a therapist 3 times, didn’t feel it was for me (maybe later, idk). Saw a psychiatrist twice — prescribed me magnesium citrate, then milk thistle. Not sure what he’s aiming for, maybe playing it safe or maybe doesn’t know what to do either. I’m seeing him again in 4 days.

I’m honestly terrified of meds. I’ve read so many posts about people regretting it, talking about being numb (which I already am), brain zaps, lasting effects even after quitting. It freaks me out.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but this isn’t living. Overthinking every interaction, analyzing everything, never in the moment. Missing out on life. I don’t approach girls, I feel detached from my own mind.

I go to the gym 4 times a week, eat healthy, read books, sleep well. Quitting p\*rn this past month has been emotionally brutal, which makes me think it could be withdrawals. But what if it’s something deeper?

Has anyone here gone through this? Is this normal for withdrawals? Or should I be looking at something else? Would really appreciate hearing from anyone who’s been there."
714,2,"Hi everyone, I’m normally a lurker here. For years I couldn’t even read a single page in public — I would suffocate and eventually panic. It started getting better with propranolol. I have an academic job but I thought I wouldn’t be able to function in this system because of public exposure. This week I had my first talk at a bigger academic conference and I managed to read my paper. It was nerve-wracking before and also I was terrified by the Q&A. People came to me afterwards to say they liked it. It was the first moment of my life when I felt good after public speaking. It took me so many years of trying and barely getting to the end, blacking out, stopping, hyperventilating. I still can’t believe it. Don’t give up!!!"
715,2,"I (22f) feel the same way I felt at 5 and 7 and 11 and 14 and 17 and 18 and 19 and 21… I never got a formal diagnosis but my parents were recommended to get a diagnosis for me and had the option when I was in therapy for other reasons when I was, like, 6 and they said no thanks. I wish they had, so I didn’t feel so crazy. It just feels like it’s my fault. My life feels like it’s constantly in this tenuous balance, like I have to “keep the ball rolling” on going out and doing things and having social self esteem, or else I’m right back where I started. 

I recently got out of a highly codependent friendship, where we would do everything together. Like actually everything. We lived together, took all of our classes together, I barely talked to other friends or even family at all, never had time in the apartment to myself, I didn’t feel like I could eat if she wasn’t eating, we even slept in the same bed together. Very dysfunctional. But in a way, it was a crutch. It got me through college, got me to my classes, satisfied (in a weird, unhealthy, and actually really unsatisfying way) my need for social connection, had me constantly socially stimulated so it was kind of an extreme long-term fucked up exposure therapy. I was really unhappy and isolated and finally got to the point just before graduation (literally the night before) of being able to break off the friendship. So I did. We didn’t really get closure, didn’t see each other again except briefly at the graduation ceremony, we both vacated our shared living space early and moved away from school and that was that. 

For the last two weeks or so since then, I’ve been doing well. I’ve been cooking a lot, eating a lot in a really good way (I lost about 15lbs in the last 6 months), going to the gym by myself, going grocery shopping by myself, finding things to do in my childhood home and hometown, even while knowing the patterns that usually bring me down while at home. Then, today, I was mentally preparing to go and visit a friend for the first time since being home. I’ve been doing pretty well with phone calls and facetime, so I thought maybe I can be a normal, functional human being who goes to see friends when they want to. But I hit the same old familiar block from all those times before. The deepset feeling that pops up when I get close to going and doing something that sounded fun when I agreed to it. The feeling that I don’t want to do it anymore. I simply don’t. As much as I love my friends and would probably have a fine and fun time hanging out with them if I sucked it up, I just don’t want to go and see them. 

I’m so tired of this feeling. I thought that I had grown some. A lot, actually. It feels like I’ve been in constant motion for the past 2-3 years, always in school or working, constantly putting myself in scary and vulnerable situations that I know are for my own good, pushing myself to grow and face daunting social situations. Now that I’m home and not working, even as I’m applying to jobs, it feels like I’ve just lost momentum. I’m trying not to catastrophize, trying not to listen to the voices that say “if you can’t even go see a long-time friend, how will you ever have a job interview, let alone a constant job, or a new place to live? You’ll never be able to do it if you can’t even do this simple thing.” But that’s what it feels like. It feels like if I can’t choose to do the small things, I’m not building up my tolerance to scary things, so I’ll never be able to do the big things. 

When I think about it in these terms I instantly feel so overwhelmed. The fact that everything could be riding on this little decision makes it even harder to do the thing, the fatigue of pushing myself into harder and harder situations and knowing that if I stop it will only get worse drives me to tears again and again. I don’t know how to get out of this loop. I thought I had grown. I don’t know how to maintain my social confidence without feeling like I’m constantly banging my head against a wall that will close in around me even tighter if I stop for even a second.

716,2,"I’ve always struggled with social anxiety, I honestly suspect at this point it could have been undiagnosed autism (due to a lot of other clues as well), but I’m an adult and I just feel ashamed and confused all the time.

Recently my entire family got invited to a wedding by the grooms side but the bride is someone from my class in uni that I recently graduated from. I only ever spoke to her occasionally, she had a big friend group that I was lightly associated with. I had really bad social anxiety in uni so I had like one friend and this group was just a group id cling to whenever I was forced to socialise bc they were the least daunting. But they were all close friends and I was just there, I felt like an unwanted outsider all the time. 

There is nothing that makes me feel quite so shitty as having to act ‘normal and social’ in certain situations. The relief I feel when I can get away for a few minutes and just be alone is so immense there is no doubt in my mind that this is just who I am naturally. I suspect that’s one of the reasons, coupled with my anxiety, that I couldn’t make friends for five whole years at uni. 

But anyway, really didn’t want to go to this wedding because the last thing I wanted was to be around people who I was not friends with and didn’t even know how to interact with, and that too around my family who is not very accepting and understanding at all. Well I went and sure enough, the brides friends from uni were there and were mainly huddled and whispering together with their backs directly turned to me while I kind of stood awkwardly not knowing wtf to do the entire time. I just decided to go back and sit with my family and it was because my mom called me piteously back to the table. My brother spent the rest of the night laughing at me and making things harder for me. I had to take ‘bathroom breaks’ half the night and stay outside the hall because even the beta blockers weren’t enough, I felt like I was doing something so wrong sitting with my family when my classmates were right there and yet it was because they were literally all huddled together discussing things in their phone and I don’t even know them. 

But things like that make me wonder: what is it that I’m struggling to do here? Is it normal to not know ur classmates on a personal level? Yes. Is it normal for the ppl who are best friends to want to spend time with each other and not have to accommodate for someone they hardly know? Yes. Does the natural solution end up being sitting with my family? I would think so. So what am I doing wrong? What would someone else have said or done? It makes me so confused and ashamed, although the older I grow, I feel less of that and more just anger and frustration at people who are immature and petty enough to have a problem with or judge people that are more withdrawn or introverted. 

Like I don’t get it. Why should I feel shame? Why should I feel shame for struggling with something? And since this has been going on since childhood despite not having ever been bullied, I’m convinced there’s some sort of neurodivergence going on. So if this has to do with something natural to my brain, what exactly is the fucking problem? Why do I have to feel like my world is fucking ending everytime I am not meeting social standards? Why do people take pity on me or make fun of me? It just pisses me off to no end. Why do I have to feel shitty because of the way I am? 

I feel so much peace whenever I get away from these situations. When I left the hall I watched the fish outside, sat in the quiet, the difference was like day and night, the tranquility inside of me vs the chaotic shame whenever I was in the hall, 3 hours felt like half a day. How do I remedy this. I’m tired of the shame. 

There are two mroe events in the wedding to attend and I don’t want to feel like this. I don’t know how to make conversation with these people, my brain literally shuts down when I have to. I don’t know how to be myself around them, but also ‘myself’ doesn’t really have a lot to say bc I don’t really know them and this is possibly one of the last times I’ll ever see them again. Arguing with my family about not going is not worth the trouble, given that they only ever make me feel worse because they don’t understand and make me wonder if I’m overreacting. It’s not a fun game. 

Even if there aren’t solutions, I think I just sort of need to hear that it’s all good. And I don’t know who else to ask

717,2,"So, around most people, I’m super quiet and barely talk, but I can be more open around my really close friends. I get more social around them, and I get really excited because of it. This leads to my issue. Because of this excitement, I can’t regulate myself as well and I’ll end up doing something embarrassing. Like taking jokes too far or messing up something. After that, I kinda shut down. I hate it. Does anyone else get this?"
718,2,"I don't have much time, and there's just too much background information give to truly understand what I'm talking about. But to keep this short, I'll just talk from the surface.

In the smallest nutshell possible, I have two personalities: One at school, where I'm talkative, exaggerated, and intonate my voice; whereas at home I'm the exact opposite where I'm quiet, speak monotone, and quite boring.

Today is my graduation party. Yay!! 🥳 Except, I'm not very excited. You know why? My friends are coming over to my house. Now- my twin brother is one of those people who doesn't change regardless of where he is. So naturally, he wants our friends over for the party.

This party starts in basically 2 hours, and I don't know what to do. For the past two weeks I have been feeling very anxious about this because this is something I have been trying to avoid for the longest and now it's actually happening. I knew it was inevitable, so why didn't I prepare?? Why should I have to prepare???

The two worlds I've been trying to keep separated are now coming together. The anxiety has died down tremendously though after having accepted my fate. All I can do is get through it at this point. And these aren't normal friends either, my friends are weird af.

If you have any questions, please let me know. I know this must be very confusing, but I hope you can get something out of it."
719,2,"Well I can't type much I'm shaking a lot but eh, my sister has a different dad and for her graduation she wanted our family and her other side to get together the issue is our side is very small. 

 Just the 4 members of our house my aunt and one cousin all girls and will most likely be focused on my sister. So idk I'm just very nervous of being lonely and awkward for hoursm Her other side of the family I believe is really big. 


Idk a part of me wants to ask advice on how to hide the other what's advice on just how to breathe and accept it."
720,2,"Some where in late June, one of my best friends is going to celebrate her 16th birthday, On that birthday she is going to invite me, my other bestfriend, a person I KNOW I get really akward around and a BUNCH of other people that I don't know. Just thinking about this party is drainning me, making me feel sick but this party (from what I can tell) means something to her.

The dress code is something somewhat fancy and it has to be black. The problem is that the only outfit that fits in that description is my black skin tight dress that I DO NOT feel comfortable wearing, espicially around people I don't know. Meaning that I would have to get a dress.

Now let's say I do go there, I would be there at around 5 pm so us girls (me, my best friends and some randos) could have some tanning time. I physically can not stand under the sun for more than 30 minutes before getting a head ache or sweating like a bitch and before the party that doesn't seem really appealing. Plus I would have to wear a swim suit which again I really do not feel comfortable in that. Then at around 8 pm the guys would come over. By then I'm sure my social batterie would be eradicated. And now the party would start. Ngl during this time I totally can see myself hiding in her bedroom or something. So with all of that combined I'm scared I would be a nuissance.

Now if I don't go, I'm scared I'll make her upset. This party means something to her, it's her 16th birthday and whatever. Plus I don't know how to turn her downif if I were to. And even if I do figure out a way, I probably will be too shy to do it.

Sooooo now I am kinda lost on what to do....."
721,2,"Hi, I’ve been reflecting on this a lot lately and I’m to figure out how to navigate romantic relationships with people who have social anxiety. Others generally describe me as a very confident person (and sometimes intimidating for that reason), and although I have a few of mental health issues/disorders, anxiety is certainly not one of them. I’m asking this question because I seem to attract a high concentration of people, romantically, who have social anxiety. 

Perhaps it’s an opposites attract thing. Regardless, I’ve started to become a bit frustrated with it recently, because i DO end up liking these people very much but our senses of confidence and outgoingness always clash at least a little bit. I think that it’s partly because I don’t know how to make people with social anxiety feel more comfortable or at ease, especially in situations that are highly social which I of course get into a lot and by extension end up bringing my partners into. I usually just try to give them advice from my perspective to calm them down. But I know that my perspective is completely different from theirs, and I’m wondering how I can make a bridge that would create a more harmonious and confident relationship for them. 

I don’t want to just refuse to date or make close friendships with people who have it, because I know it doesn’t define them and in my experience they are amazing people regardless. It would also just greatly reduce my dating pool, because like I said, I attract them a LOT. But I do want to find a way to blend or lifestyles in a way that is more conducive to mutual comfort and respect. Any tips or advice? It doesn’t have to have a romantic slant either, I guess any general advice would help. "
722,2,"I desire to talk to people and not avoid it as I would like to have more relationships with people, but it's not possible because most of the time I don't know what to talk about and I cannot start conversations easily.  My whole life it seems there has been a barrier between me and other people, which is that my introversion makes me enjoy thinking rather than talking.  If I could talk more I would, but I can't.  I am anxious about making situations awkward and people not wanting to be around me because of that. I don't know what to do except find some way to improve social skills but I don't know how to overcome this specific problem."
723,2,"Just drove into the neighborhood and I was actually staring in the rearview mirror and wondering why this old guy is idling on his lawn mower, then I snap back to the road in front of me and it looks like the two neighbor ladies are staring at me. I really hate being stared at. I've had SA since my early years and never know how to parse it. "
724,2,I mean I’ve noticed I’ve gained the slight bit of confidence in conversation over the year and what not but will i ever outgrow it and has it happened to you yet?

726,2,"I'm in my late 20s and i have been dealing with this since i was a kid. I can't do friend groups because i always feel like the others are closer to each other then i am to them. 

I had a bad experience with a high school friend group so I haven't joined any since then. I recently completed an undergrad program where i had a solid group of friends...or so i thought. Since school ended, I've been seeing them hang out on instagram and they haven't invited me. I'm a kind person, I'm interesting, I have my own merits. Why am i always pushed out? 

I wish it didn't hurt but it does. "
727,2,I don't know how to do it 
728,2,"Went to the mall today and when i was on the stairs i felt some drops of water on my neck. when i looked up pi realised that a group of girls were laughing and splashing water on me.  I  cant even understand why they would do that... i felt really embarrased and mostly just confused. Idk why but i have an intense fear of teenage girls, even though im not in school  anymore"
729,2,I can't speak my heart even to my family and feel like I am alone in this world. I don't feel like talking to anyone because I feel they aren't trustworthy and showing weakness is a blunder in this cruel world.

735,2,"It seems like both online and in person, people have become more impatient, less understanding, and some seem to actively get joy out of insulting others. The comments on TikTok keep getting more toxic which makes me hesitant to post anything even slightly personal. Irl, my brain works really slow for some reason and it seems like people glare at me more than usual when I take a few seconds to think of a response to their question. (That isn't even mentioning the increase in hatred and bigotry though we all know why that's happening.) It's so discouraging and it makes me want to self-isolate even more cause I genuinely can't understand why people love putting other people down so much. I know it sounds cliché but it's really so tiring."
736,2,"So is there anyone else wjo thinks this?
This is short story long, but I just needed to get this off my chest and see if anyone else has this issue.

The problem is that I have always liked things that are not for everyone.. I'm into historical costuming, I sing in a band (small.. only 3 people) and ideally my sense of fashion crosses somewhere between Helena Bonham Carter and Emilia Clarke in ""Me Before You""...
However, everything I just listed is messed up all the time because I'm afraid of everything. I know for a fact I have ADHD and social anxiety, but I'm beginning to suspect I may be borderline agoraphobic as well, since walking out of my front door is becoming my worst nightmare.

I would love to always wear my colorful clothes, but I have designated 'mainstream outfits' for when I meet people I've never met before. In day to day life I wouldn't be caught dead in jeans or sneakers, but my mainstream outfit consists of a blue striped longsleeve, a pair of jeans, and sneakers. Just to make sure people can't have an opinion about it amd won't find me ""weird"".
When I enter the office I work at. I feel completely terrible until I reach my department. Only then can I relax a little.

Our little band performs on a party here and there amd I love LOVE singing, but I dread it from the moment we accept the request. I can't eat a day in advance amd the day of the performance, the nausea on performance day is killing, and I dhake so much I can't hold anything because people might think I'm seriously ill... Until I've sung the last note. Only then can I look back and say: nice one, let's go again

I do have a husband (secured him 12+ years ago... wasn't as messed up as I am now) and a soon to be 2-year-old, and I don't want to leave my house with him if it's not absolutely necessary... what if he cries? What if I start being weird by having a panic attack/ hyperventilating/ crying/ just being my scared self really...?
I actually haven't wanted to leave my house in a long time. Sometimes I'm just standing in my hallway, doorknob in hand, waiting for a bout of courage so I can actually leave.. but unless I absolutely have to be somewhere, I don't go out. 

It's so exhausting to 
always pretend you're doing well.."
737,2,"Took a few days off walking at the park, then went back last day or two. This morning I went early to avoid people, and man the amount walking in groups was crazy. For me. I'll never be able to conquer this. I've been walking over a year now and can just handle walking by one person. Two or three feels incredibly intimidating. Maybe part of it is knowing how screwed up my life is due to SA, on all cylinders and how I'm an absolute failure. "
738,2,"
My (20M) biggest phobia, and one that fuels my anxiety is constant overthinking about whether or not I make women uncomfortable. My biggest fear has always been being a Pig/creep/weirdo to women and that thought has always held me back from pursuing relationships. Im also autistic and have difficulty understanding body language and social cues. I’m also pretty self aware, and I know that as long as I’m respectful, polite and NOT pushy and know to take no for answer, that I will be fine and im not committing some social sin by showing interest in someone and asking them out, which is a thought that’s took me a very long time to internalize as I’ve struggled with very low self esteem/ self-worth issues (honestly I still do sometimes but I’m trying to get better) 

One of the rules I have to myself is that if I like someone enough to work up the nerve to ask them out, (which is rare) I only do it once, and move on, I never ask again after that. I think this rule is good to have because after she already says no once, any attempt to date after that is pursuing, and that falls into creep territory which I precisely try my hardest to avoid. 

I’ve recently built up courage to ask a coworker out (18F) the thing is, we barely talked before that. We’d say hello to each other when we crossed paths and we’d have a few very brief interactions here and there, but for the most part, we barely spoken before I asked her out. She only works 2 days of the week I work (she’s part time, I’m full) So In the moment leading up to it, I definitely remember feeling a sense of “Okay, fuck it, do it now while you feel confident” and walked up to her and said exactly: 
 
“Hey, I know you barely know me but I was wondering if you’d like to maybe get some dinner some time?” 

She stood there frozen for a second, looking confused, before saying she’ll think about it. Without even thinking I hastily replied with:

 “no worries, you don’t have to give me an answer now, just think about it and let me know, okay? 

To be honest, in the moment when she said she’ll think about it, I seriously thought she meant that she was gonna think about my proposition and come back to me with either a yes or a no. only hours later I realized; “ohhhhh, that was a rejection! she just didn’t want to hurt my feelings!”
I also realized I didn’t even ask for her number, or leave her mine because my anxiety was through the roof in and I didn’t even fully realize what I was saying/ how weird I was acting. I was more focused on getting the words out without being off putting. I’m a chronic overthinker, so for some reason my dumb brain placed emphasis on the part specifically about going to “dinner” and came to the dumb conclusion that; “okay, it was weird for me to ask her out to dinner, that’s WAY TOO straightforward… I’ll apologize for being weird and offer to grab just a quick coffee instead!” (Which is also the wrong conclusion but, my brain thinks slow about this type of stuff and realized that too late)

Fast forward a week later, which is the next time I see her. She came into work, we exchanged hellos as if nothing happened. Later in the day I approached her and say exactly this; (I practiced it in my head days before hand lol) 

“Hey, remember when I asked you out dinner? I’m really sorry about that, that was much too forward of me. I’d still like to get to know you better for sure but maybe not over dinner, just over a simple coffee or lunch instead? 

Her reply was; “I’m busy with things, I don’t have time to go out with you, sorry” 

I immediately sensed that I was being a nuisance to her so my mind backpedaled into overly formal mode which is something I tend to do frequently, and replied with; “that’s completely okay, thank you so much for being nice about it, and im so sorry for bothering you in the first place. I hope I didn’t creep you out or anything, I know we have to work together so I’m sorry for making coming to work weird for you if I did. I hope we can still be friends or acquaintances at least but that’s up to you of course” 

Again, only hours later after thinking about it more I realized; “holy shit, I broke my rule! I asked her out twice! The first time to dinner, the second to coffee!” This also sorta explains to me why she was much more serious sounding the second time around, as to say “if ya didn’t get the message I’ll say it louder and clearer dumbass!” which is actually exactly what happened now I say it haha. It’s been a few days since this happened and I know I should just accept it as one of many social hiccups I’ve had because I didn’t realize fully what I’d done till after but I still feel a slight sense of guilt/shame come over me whenever she comes into work. The Thing is I’m self aware that it’s all in my head. She most likely doesn’t think I’m some weirdo creep when she sees me, and she’s most likely forgotten all about it anyway, and I should too, but my mind won’t let this go for some reason. 

I don’t know what I should tell myself to make these thoughts disappear because I know I’m only doing it to myself, I’m sure I did nothing wrong but for some reason the more I think about it the more I feel like I was creeping her out which shames me and makes me never want to attempt anything like that again in fear that I scare someone. It’s kind of hard to say this without sounding at least a little pathetic, but I always thought it’d be nice to have a girlfriend, and Id like to get one if I managed to somehow earn one, but it’s the stuff like this, my low self esteem, and the overthinking in my head about what to say and the right way to act make it so hard for me to do so, it’s already bad enough for me as someone who struggles with understanding social cues and unwritten rules in conversations. 

Sorry this is a more of a vent post then anything but please I don’t really have any friends to talk with this about so any thoughts that anyone may have, please feel free to share (brutal honestly is appreciated as well, no holds barred!) thank you. "
739,2,"Hi, I think I just want to vent. Three weeks ago I met a girl here, the first few days everything was perfect, we talked a lot, she answered me very quickly. It can't be my fault because normally if I connect well with people I'm too affectionate and even if it's because of the distance I always worry and try to do everything possible to make that person feel good. Then she started walking away, telling me that she is busy and spends little time here. After this, she texted me that she has social anxiety and that my messages were overwhelming her. I apologized and told her that if she needs time, I understand and that she can write to me whenever she wants. I was the first person I knew who had social anxiety and I had no idea how to treat people with this stuff. He just ignored my message, after a week I decided to look at his profile and realized he just blocked me. I know that to many it will seem silly that you feel this way about a person you barely know, but it really hurts me and I feel bad. I think I would feel better if he gave me some kind of explanation or told me directly that he doesn't want anything to do with me. I don't think there's anything more to add, I just wanted to express how I feel, so thanks for reading. Although I think the only thing I can say, if one day she decided to come back and talk to me, I would be happy."
740,2,"am 20 years old, prepared for neet this year. This was my 3 rd drop. My father died in covid. I have short height, ugly face, big teeths, I literally looks like a joker. I have no one to talk to. I don't go outside because of I try to I think that all the surrounding people are laughing and gossiping at me, I start sweating and my heart beat goes higher.i was in my 12th when my father died. At that time I was good in studies not best Or topper. At that time i dont know what to further in my life and I still don't.from the day my father died and till now I don't know what happened to me, I just sit all day pretending to be study in front of my laptop, don't do anything in it.I just think about past and of all the different possibilities in which me and my family living happily.Ii think about these things all day 24X7.i follow same pattern from covid daily-wake up, pretend to study and go in the loop of possibilities and thinking, go to gym for 30min, come back, pretend to study and go in the loop of possibilities and thinking, and then sleep. 

I know that my mom cries at night whenever she misses dad, I don't know how to console her, whenever she cries orbecomeu upset or she is in bad mood, I just feel stoned and angry. I know I should go to her and make her feel comfortable but I feel angry and stone.i become so angry that I just want to beat myself at that time. I don't k Oe why this happens to me and why I can't go to ny mom and just stop her from crying. 

I have no one to talk about all this things. I dont know what to do but I want to get out of it. I want normal life. I cannot cry and tell my mom because she is already mourning on my father's loss. Now my body is slowly starting to restrictmany type of movement and I just wanted something to happen. From past 3 months I am starting to feel to suicide but I cannot do it because of my mom. I can do nothing about my current situation. Due to my this daydreaming problem I cannot focus on studies. I literally don't know how to communicate to people and how to make friends. I justlstay in my home. 

I don't know what is it, is it anxiety, depression? 
I can't go to doctor, can't tell anybody. Just sharing it on reddit in search of geniune answer of what is happening to me and what can I do to overcome it."
741,2,"
I ask because I couldn’t relax even though I went there for almost two years. I just can’t do this with anyone. There are people that I’m more relaxed with but I don’t share everything with them - just what I think they would approve of. I really wish there is a person somewhere on this planet that I would feel comfortable enough with so I can relax and have a safe space. I think that would be the thing that will heal the social anxiety. 

For those of you that go to therapy - do you feel you can relax in front of your therapist? Are you close to them? Do you feel you need to mask? "
742,2,"Idk how but I'm always by myself and I don't talk, whether if I'm in school or work and people just gravitate towards me. 

I was sitting in my car today on break alone because I'm scared to talk to people and one guy saw me and and was like ""yooo thats a nice car!"" And he saw a basketball in my car and he was like ""why didn't you tell me you play ball?"" And he is a very talkative person and because of that his friends came over and all of a sudden a group conversation started which was very overwhelming lol

Don't get me wrong I'm super grateful that I have people to talk too but, i've had multiple situations like this and I've always wondered why does anyone want to talk to me even though I'm super quiet? "
743,2,"I was seeing this guy for about four months. He was the first person I’d ever really been with, and from the beginning, the chemistry between us was amazing. I felt safe, comfortable, and genuinely happy. We never even fought once. It felt peaceful and easy.

But things got complicated when he introduced me to his friends and his cousin. That was a really tough experience for me. I struggle with social anxiety, and in those situations, I tend to shut down. I didn’t really speak much, and I could feel how awkward I must’ve seemed. 

At the same time, I couldn’t help but wonder why, after four months of dating, he still hadn’t asked me to be his girlfriend (in his culture, it’s expected that the guy asks officially).

Not too long ago, we had a serious conversation. He told me that it really bothered him that I couldn’t be myself around other people. He emphasized more than once that it was a big deal to him, something that really mattered. And even though he tried to say it gently, I could tell he was basically saying that if I stayed the way I am, he wouldn’t want to continue the relationship. I told him I couldn’t just change overnight. I wish I could, but that’s not how it works.

Later, he admitted that this was the reason he hadn’t asked me to be his girlfriend. That really hurt to hear. I thought about it a lot afterward and talked it through with some friends. The next day, I brought it up with him again. I told him I understood how important his relationships with friends and family are, and I respect that. But I also said I don’t think I can meet his expectations in that area. I said that if he finds it hard to accept me and love me as I am, then maybe this just isn’t going to work out. It took me a year and a half to even get to the place I’m in now, and that in itself was a huge improvement. I know I still have growing to do, but I also need someone who appreciates me for where I am and who I am today.

He was torn too. We talked about whether there was anything we could do to work through this, but in the end, he said he wants to be with someone more extroverted. And that’s how it ended.

Now I just feel crushed. I’m so sad. My anxiety has already made so many things hard in my life, and I really thought I’d found someone who made me feel understood and safe. I find it hard to open up to people, but with him, it came more naturally. And now that’s gone too. I’m scared I’m always going to be alone. It hurts so much that he couldn’t just accept me as I am. I feel completely heartbroken."
744,2,"I have prom tomorrow and I’m really not looking forward to it. I only bought the ticket because I didn’t want to experience fomo. I’ve never been to any of my high school dances. This is my first dance and I’m really nervous about it. I’m an introvert so I didn’t really make many friends in high school. I have social anxiety so talking to people is not really my thing. Don’t have any friends going to prom. Idk what to do, I’m scared I’m going to be the lonely kid at prom sitting by himself at a table. I’m I doomed?"
745,2,"I joined a random group who's planning a meeting for tomorrow. Nobody knows each other yet, it's a new group. There will be around 10 to 20 people.

On average, the group's average age is like 10 years older than me, so I feel a bit out place which makes my anxiety worse. But I just wanna meet new people, improve my social skills and have fun!

But I'm also very excited for it honestly. It's a big leap for me, a nice challenge for sure.

Whatever happens, happens. The only way I can lose is by not showing up. 

Wish me luck! 😁"
746,2,"In my office they share a lot of personal info,  doctors appointment details, relationship drama and friendship drama in and outside of work, details about their families. Then they sit and gossip about each other behind each other's backs all day and yet I'm the weird one because i don't participate. Why would i want to talk to people that i know will take any info i share and weaponize it and talk about me behind my back? And yet apparently,  this is a normal form of human communication,  especially for women, which I am. Uugh it gives me so much anxiety just being at work.  I get paranoid constantly that they're talking about me which I know I can't control but thats why i don't talk because that's all i can control is what i share and how much I open up but it's miserable being so guarded everyday but i just can't being myself to open up and I've been here for 3 years. I really think its them though,  not very friendly,  very catty, mean girl energy. I am contemplating a job move but every job I get there's always people that really trigger my anxiety with their noseyness and digging with their intrusive questions. I just don't get why there can't be a strict divide between work and personal life. "
747,2,"(Im a girl btw) The other day i saw a BEAUTIFUL girl working at the mall and she IMMEDIATELY caught my attention because she was EXACTLY my type. My exact type is super rare to come across and she really ticked all the boxes (based off looks anyway.) Couple weeks later i went to the mall with family and wanted something to drink and turns out she works that stand too! I was hanging on for dear life mentally😭the interaction was pretty straight forward but i think i was kinda checking her out the whole time.

Anyway, i couldn’t stop thinking about her, so much so that I considered going to the mall alone just to possibly ask her out. Idk if thats super weird tho. I know these days people don’t really just ask out strangers anymore. Im also conflicted because i believe i have a skewed sense of reality because of my social anxiety, so this hyper-fixation on her and asking her out, may be ridiculous.

I’ve been trying to take steps forward and start my journey to overcoming social anxiety. Im currently at the very beginning of my journey and this whole debate also got me thinking about how if she said yes, how the hell would i go about that relationship..? The reality is im nervous and gonna shit my pants when im NOT hanging out with a beautiful girl, so I can’t even imagine the anxiety when i AM. Also, im extremely avoidant, so the minute id have to meet anyone in her life or go somewhere super busy or social with her i would likely fall apart…

Is it even realistic to be in a relationship at this point in my SA journey? Should i be waiting until farther in my journey to seek romance?
"
748,2,"Ok guys, I need an external opinion about this because I am sure I am not being objective. I will try to be as brief as possible. 

There are several things to take into account. First, I have good relationships with most people in my friend group. However, there is one girl (F26) that always tries to exclude me (F30) from every conversation, when I am talking or telling a story she always talks over me. When it’s only the two of us with a third person she always talks to the third person (whoever it is) and totally ignores everything I say, she acts like I don’t even exist. When it’s only the two of us she is looking at her phone. She is super nice to everyone in the group except from me. When I share an opinion she always tries to confront me and prove I am wrong. I sometimes try to talk to her and be nice but it doesn’t work. I just feel so bad when she is around and the fact that she is friends with everyone else except from me makes me feel even worse. 

Secondly, I have been dating one of the guys from my friend group (M27) for three months, then I ended things with him because we were not fully compatible. Basically, he was super nice to me and treated me so well in all aspects, but I didn’t like his texting habits since he would always take a long time to respond, even days, and this is important to me. Even though I broke up with him, I told him I want to be friends, and he agreed and said our friendship is important for him, so we ended in good terms. And even though I don’t show it, I am still SO into him. 

Today all of us from the friend group went to a party. At the beginning I thought I would have a lot of fun. However, the night went on and turned out to be awful. The girl that usually ignores me spent all the night acting like I don’t exist, even more than usual!! And the guy I dated (and still like a lot) spent all the night talking to all my girl friends except from me. He literally talked to everyone in the group except from me and even kinda ignored me as well!!

At the end of the night everyone left except me, the guy I dated and the girl that usually ignores me, it was only the three of us left and we stayed for one hour more. During that hour, he spent all the time talking to this girl and ignoring me, and she also ignored me (as usual). Consequently, I felt so bad. 

Just to clarify: I am not jealous because they were talking, I know he doesn’t like her and she is not his type. What bothered me is that I hate being ignored. When I was a kid I was an outsider and most girls in primary school would exclude me and bully me. As a consequence, being ignored really triggers me and makes me feel awful. 

At the end, I had to leave the party and when I arrived home I started to cry. 

I just don’t understand why they treat me that way. I know there may be many factors affecting this situation, but still it’s difficult not to fall into the trap of believing that I am just unimportant to them and not worth a conversation for them. "
749,2,"Sometimes I wonder how something as invisible as social anxiety can feel so heavy on my chest. I don’t know when it started exactly, but I’ve carried it like a shadow for years. It shows up uninvited, especially in situations with more people—especially academic or “intellectual” settings.

The moment I’m surrounded by people who seem more educated or confident, my body starts reacting before my mind even processes anything. My heartbeat speeds up like I’ve just run a mile. My hands shake, my voice trembles, and it becomes hard to breathe. It’s like a panic switch gets flipped inside me.

Whenever I have to speak, even introduce myself, it feels like standing in front of a firing squad. My brain goes blank. I forget basic words. And I know others notice. I see their confused or amused looks, and it confirms the fear inside me: that I don’t belong, that I’m not enough.

Even writing this is difficult because part of me is scared someone will judge me, or think I’m exaggerating. But this is real to me. I avoid so many opportunities—presentations, group discussions, even making friends—just to escape this constant war inside me.

Sometimes I wish I could just be normal. Talk freely. Be in a room with people and not feel like I’m going to explode. I know there are ways to manage this, and I’m trying. But right now, it’s hard. And exhausting. I just want peace.

If anyone else feels this too… how do you deal with it?




"
750,2,"Hi guys, I am not sure if I have social anxiety or not but i seem to not enjoy around people , when I am out there I just have the urge to leave 
Is it okay to be like that? And never make any friends or do i have to change?

"
751,2,"Okay let me explain what happened. I got invited to my one of my good friends Birthday party, I was already a bit nervous since I didn’t know who was invited and I hadn’t necessarily hung out with her outside a school setting. I got ready and wasn’t feeling nervous at all. Keep in mind, I only have 2 friends at this thing (birthday girl and J). I walked up there with my other good friend and got a look at who was there. It was her other friends, ones I’m not friends with. I don’t mind that, but they all started laughing and giggling together, I felt really left out. The whole time I felt like crying, but I kept trying to at least laugh and somewhat engage in the conversation (which didn’t work out). It was a golf place we went to, and it was my turn. I had never really played golf so I actually sucked at it. After that embarrassing attempt at getting no points at all I overheard one of them say “don’t be mean!” Lord that’s when my face turned REALLY red. I went to sit down at the sofa which was already really cramped and nobody moved. I had to wait for this girl to get up and once she saw I was in her spot, she ended up squeezing herself elsewhere as if trying to avoid sitting next to me, even after I moved over enough to where she originally was. 

I was trying so hard to fight the tears, but in the end I couldn’t hold them back. I asked my good friend (j) where the restroom was with my eyes all watery and voice trembling(which was worse), after a minute or so of trying to figure out where it was, I got up and kept pretending that there was something in my eye. My good friend J joined me and kept asking me questions. I kept up at the whole “I have something in my eye, that’s why I’m crying” act. Her mom joined us in the bathroom and I kept trying to lie out of it, just counting down the minutes of when my older sister would get there. She took her sweeet time getting there 😒. Anyways after I was in the bathroom I just felt embarrassed the whole time, I kept wondering “why couldn’t I have just held the tears back?” I left with a sweet treat from the bday girl and I just felt bad the whole time. Just for reference I have been this way. My family would get invited to parties and I would cry from the pressure, I didn’t want to cry and I felt embarrassed and felt bad the whole time, but it’s like I can’t control it. 
Also I’m a very shy introverted person, but I shouldn’t be this way at parties but i genuinely can’t control it, does anyone know how to get rid of that anxiety? Or just ways I can overcome the tears in public?

"
752,2,"please help, i need some tips. i can’t afford therapy my mom refuses it and just thinks im shy. i wish i had a friend im just crying so bad now. i tried really hard to tell people i had social anxiety like my teacher but she thinks im shy. in my new school i just feel so bad because the only people i can talk to are the people who dont know english or the “weird kids” im so sorry but i genuinely dont wanna talk to them.. i feel bad even labeling them that. i did talk to them and they were annoying me and being rude to me. 

i just want friends i dont know what to do. "
753,2,"Lost more than 15kg in a year after this one time a total stranger made the weirdest comment abt my appearance tht rlly got to my head. Starved myself , jogged 2 hours a day(fyi I used to be a couch potato). I do think i look much better now but my personality is j so shitty and boring nothing can make up for it😕"
754,2,Please does anyone relate to this? I sometimes often overthink how I swing my arms and how I walk when I'm walking in public to the point my arms will stop swinging and I walk like a robot does anyone else do this? How do I overcome this ridiculousness??
755,2,"So i’ve been trying to get a job for a long time and only just got this opportunity, I know how important this is to my life because i’m so broke and just can’t miss this chance. 

It’s just i have terrible social anxiety, i haven’t worked in a while and i have no idea what to expect. I’m going to be working as a front of house greeting people, wiping tables, etc but is there anything else i should expect? Will they tell me what to do or just expect that I know? I’ve never even eaten thai food like I feel son unprepared. I’m 15 and also super insecure, so this is really freaking me out but i really need the money. 

Should i drink a little bit before to ease my nerves? I genuinely feel like i’ll just have a panic attack beforehand and not be able to do it. 🙃🥲

"
756,2,"My family will label me all sorts of things before acknowledging the obvious about my situation. 

That I am lazy, weak willed, and basically have no life aspirations. It's sooooooo obvious I have massive difficulties interacting with people. But no...... just keep blaming and shaming. They are the reason I have this disorder in the first place!! 

I am working on it, definitely more active these days. But who's to say it will last. And all for what, just to work myself like a horse to pay bills and have basic human autonomy when I'm already an adult!!! "
757,2,"i try to push myself to talk to others sometimes, because i want to reduce my social anxiety. but everytime i do it just makes me worse... i tried talking online cause i thought if i didnt show my face it would be less scary, but i couldnt even get any words out for a few hours. when i finally did i got told ""ur voice sounds r******d"" and now im self conscious about my voice sounding weird.. 

i always mess up every conversation too because im panicking so badly that i cant think straight and just say the first thing that comes to my brain and then they think im weird and never talk to me again. i always end up regretting the conversation, because i always say something wrong.

also, after i got sick and was stuck in bed for a couple weeks, it became more difficult to go outside at all. i cant think straight, all i can think is ""dont look at me"" over and over again. i just want to hide somewhere and cry. why cant i just be normal? im tired of acting so weird... aaaaaaaa"
758,2,"My social anxiety calls out to people and asks them to do one of two things.

1. Please confirm I’m am unworthy of x

Or

2. Please confirm I am worthy of x

But, there was never a need to ask. 

I’m older and wish I could I start over knowing that. I’m still sore about it. 

But I’ve been blessed with many good things in my life and blessed by so many bad things that did not happen in life. So many are suffering of things that I’m not. Things I would not be able to handle. Not in this lifetime. 

I’m am grateful that social anxiety is one of my bad things. On a higher level, I know I chose it becuase I could overcome it. Social anxiety will now serve me. 

There’s a well full of love within us. 

There’s no need to continue to ask, to seek outward for my self-worth, for my self-love. The well is there. We are only one thought away from the well. A thought structure we created. 

The well has been blocked for a long time, there’s going to be some pebbles and some stones to deal with but the water will rise to help us with those. 

The well is there, we were born with it. You know people who are tapped into the well. It’s our turn. It’s time.  

It was always a lie that we weren’t worthy. 

Put your hand on your heart. The spiritual heart.

I am the well. I am the well. I am the well.

Let go of the shame. Let go of the guilt. Let go of the judgement. Let go of all the weight. 

Breathe easy.

I am the well. I am the well. I am the well.

Much love brothers and sisters. This is serving me and I hope it serves you.

I could be just overreacting, but I wanted to see if anyone had any advice on how to deal with this, any help would be appreciated.

760,2,"It’s so silly. It takes a LOT for me to post. I want to post, I love taking pictures but that validation means everything to me. I’m putting myself in front of a crowd it feels like, many of are from back home whom bullied me or knew me when I was mute. I don’t want to be “that girl” or the center of attention, I just want to be different to them. I want to be normal. I want all those little likes so I can say “see? I’m different now” 

I moved to a European country. I’ve modeled. I’m a writer and in college. I just finished traveling through 3 diff countries for a week and still I’m concerned about the amount of likes on a post for OTHERS to see. About people from back home perceiving me positively based on likes on a post.

761,2,"I made a reservation at a restaurant earlier today which wasn’t a problem but when my gf asked me to reschedule it for a later time I couldn’t get the words out on the phone.

I called the restaurant only to hang up the first time. Then tried again and explained that I’m struggling to speak to the person on the phone but still couldn’t get my words out and hung up. The person working was super nice and encouraging and told me I can call back when I’m comfortable which was very kind but this feeling is horrible.

Has anyone experienced anything similar?"
762,2,"It will prevent you from enjoying your life. No travel, friends, nobody to share anything about your life. No GF. hoping some girls will accept you as you are and accommodate, but that's just wishful thinking.

Emotions become overwhelming when it has been suppressed for so long. Somewhere deep down, you understand you want to scream and vent, but you are forced to shut in. You can't speak up for yourself. You imagine doing all sorts of heroic stuff, but that's just a dream. In your job and schools, you comply with whatever others say, never question, and never initiate anything. Getting jobs without referrals or nepotism becomes tedious, as navigating through the HR round is so stressful.

Too critical of yourself, in anxious mode from the start of the day till night. At night, you scroll through media and see all people challenging, expanding their horizons, and achieving success and that makes you incredibly insecure. You start hating them for apparently no reason. You start victimizing yourself by pinning the blame on society. All these happen subconsciously and would just fuel a vague, fuzzy thought that keeps this cycle going."
763,2,i’m on 10mg propranolol for high heart rate (mid 90s to 115 sometimes) & pots. i’ve seen mixed reviews on drinking alcohol while on it. i try to avoid alcohol in general but was wondering if it would be okay while on propranolol? i miss having a drink or two now & then. how long should i wait until after taking the meds? just anxious about it & wanted to see people’s experiences. thanks in advance!
764,2,"Why can’t I just die if I don’t belong anywhere in this world ? Everywhere I go it’s always the same thing, I end up being made fun of, rejected, hated… I wish I could just stop existing, not just physically, but completely. I wish I never existed. We should have the choice to be born or not. I hate life. It doesn’t give me anything good. I hate being alive."
765,2,"I need to be put on something ***now***, I feel like I’m losing my mind (for non-social anxiety reason/other mental health reasons). My therapist is talking too long to get a referral and my doctor gave me the option to wait for the referral and then 2+ months to get tested or just get meds now, and now that it’s been a little under a month with no sign of a referral for testing, I just want to be put on something now before I actually do something to myself. 

But I don’t know how to call in and ask to see my doctor for meds. Phone calls are humiliating, and I don’t have a script because I don’t know what they are going to say so I don’t know what to do. 

What do I do to make the phone call? What do I say? I have no script to follow so I don’t know what to say or expect them to say. I don’t know how to schedule a doctor’s appointment over the phone. "
766,2,"The main reason why I am doing this is that, I have a 12 hour day shift job so I can't socialize by going out, until I quit this job, but it's not possible as of now, I can only use my smartphone on my workplace. So...

I see there are good groups on telegram, where people talk a lot on Voice that, I am new to reddit. So I don't know if there's any such features here (or if there are any good groups). 

I'll create a completely anonymous account just for the purpose of practice speaking with people on voice chats in groups. If any of you have any groups such as related to books, or any other hobby please let me know.

By being anonymous, I know that if something goes out of zone, I can anytime delete my account and recreate a fresh one.

768,2,"I mentioned today to a friend that I struggle with SAD. We started talking about it and at some point they started giving me conversation tips and telling me I just need to try talking more and things like that. They meant well so I wasn't upset but it just hurts that they really didn't get it.

I already understand how to converse with people thats not the problem. The problem is my brain shuts down so much sometimes I dont remember how to respond to ""how are you doing"". Sometimes im so paralyzed with fear that words feel literally heavy and I can't force them out. Sometimes my mind goes completely blank and I can't think of anything.


They also mentioned how social anxiety doesn't trigger your flight or fright response. I thinking no thats actually exactly what it does! But I couldn't say it cause I fear conflict. Its just so frustrating.


 I wish I could just fix it by taking people's advice on how to talk to people byt the issue isn't that I don't theoretically know how. Its in the moment that horrible fear that drives out all thought and any social skills I might have. And it's so saddening that nobody gets that.

769,2,"as a biomed/neuroscience enthusiast, i’ve read many papers on pretty much every topic i’ve been curious about and i’ve looked at how green tea helps tics. 

so when i’m in a silent room, my chest tightens and i start gasping for air and there’s this sound that comes out because i get nervous. it was gone for a while because i wasn’t as stressed, but now it’s coming to exam weeks i’m more on edge than usual and it’s harder to breathe - not quite sure whether anemia affects this also. 

but when i socialise i always get very tired and my eyelids grow heavy. i’m always attentive and listening but it feels like i want to sleep because i’m anxious. so i rapidly blink and it’s annoying because i know i’m anxious. my brain would practically scream for “help get me out what’s gon come next” so that’s what causes the blinking. 

anyone got any idea on how to get rid of this?

thanks :)"
770,2,"I got invited for a farewell gathering from one of my colleagues who is leaving. I accepted because I declined the last time (I had a different commitment).

The thing is, I have been haunted by the thought of it for the past week… Most of my colleagues, who are all older than me, will be there as well, as well as some of his friends.

One on one I have nice conversations with them, but in a group I become awkward and kinda retreat in my shell. I’m pretty sure my colleagues think I am quite an introverted person. It’s strange because when I am with friends or people I don’t know from work I am very outgoing and extroverted (generally there is no social anxiety there).

Do you perhaps have some tips or motivation for me to go? I will go, and in the end it will probably be alright, but the idea stresses me out - and I am afraid to be all awkward when I am there."
771,2,"This is kinda out of the blue for me since I hardly ever get crushes anymore but I’m a senior in high school and graduating literally next week, and there’s this guy at my school who I’ve become kind of interested in recently. I’ve seen him before throughout the year and it's really easy to spot him in passing because he’s insanely tall but I’ve also been running into him a lot because when we did senior testing he was right next to me twice, and then again for our graduation practice since our last names are super similar he’s kind of next to me but there’s one guy in between us.

Anywayy, today was the last day of school/graduation practice and I actually got to sit right next to him because the other guy wasn’t there today, but I didn’t get a chance to speak to him at all because I couldn’t find an organic way to to about it + I was really scared about shooting my shot with a bunch of people around in case it didn’t go the way I wanted.

I was thinking about possibly going up to him at/after graduation maybe?? I’ve never approached someone I’ve been interested in before and although I’ve been getting better with my social anxiety and interacting with people if they come up to me, I still have a really hard time being the one to initiate an interaction. I know that I’m pretty good looking because I’ve received attention from people in the past but I still get really self conscious about how I look so I’m super scared about getting rejected or just not being his type and all that TT 

I still really want to push myself to talk to him because this is literally the last time I’ll ever see him so it doesn’t hurt to at least try, but I just don’t know how to go about it. Like, should I directly ask for his number or insta ??? Or just be upfront and say I think he’s cute/compliment him and see where that goes ??"
772,2,"Just wanted to make a post on here as again today I was reminded of how much Zoloft has absolutely changed my life for the better. Before Zoloft I would have panic attacks that were so bad I would literally black out, but today, situations that would have triggered such panic attacks trigger mild anxiety instead which is easily controllable and ignorable, albeit slight uncomfortable, but 10000% better than what my life was before. It isn’t without its side effects however, I don’t sleep as well as I used to and some days my emotions are so dulled that I feel like I’m Patrick Bateman from American psycho (minus the serial killer bit), but the positive effect it’s had on my life has overwhelmed any negative. If you considering trying Zoloft please give it a go. Don’t get caught up on internet horror stories, life is all about risks and for me this is the best risk I ever took.

773,2,"I'm halfway through my college degree and I just want it all to be over. Everyone seems to think uni students have life so easy and I shouldn't take this time for granted, it's the best years of my life sort of thing but I just don't get it. I have a terrible time making friends, almost everyone I talk to just ghosts me at some point for some reason. I'm told that these people are garbage and not worth it but there's one common denominator and that's me :/

I can't go to my classes, I bunk like half my classes because there's nothing scarier than being in a room alone in the massive noisy crowd. God forbid we have to do a group activity. I tried participating in the drinking/hookup party culture at uni but I'm somehow just as awkward inebriated as I am normally. Also \*hormonal cystic acne\* (I want to die) so I get social outcast points for that too. I'm on accutane but by the time my cycles finished there's gonna be 6 months left in uni at which point I will have successfully wasted my ""best"" years.

I really don't know how I should approach this. I don't want to look back on life like I've wasted it, but I also want nothing more than to just be over and done with all this shit that people seem to call the ""college experience"". Haven't had a single positive experience even remotely related to this. The only joy I have in this life is my single player minecraft worlds."
774,2,Feeling like a burden in everyone's life there's no reason for me to be happy I am the worst 
775,2,"I've never checked this sub before, or anything even remotely related to my condition, preferring to instead hide it away and pretend it's not a problem.

It's been quite a cathartic experience reading so many posts and seeing so many people dealing with the same thing at all different stages of improvement.

I've had crippling social anxiety for as long as I can remember, i never spoke to anybody about it or properly acknowledged it, i just kept making excuses throughout my life to deal with it, almost always leading to severe long term consequences.

it ruined my schooling, i'd always come up with some way to avoid going, to the point where my family had the education department constantly breathing down their necks and a very serious threat of child protective services stepping in - looking back i still don't know how we avoided it because i didn't spend a single day in proper education from ages 12-18. to this day i haven't finished high school nor do i have a general education cert, never learned to drive, although i'm looking into that now. that's not to say i'm uneducated, i'm just not officially educated. i'm just self taught thanks to ten years of unrestricted internet access, curiosity and a desire to learn, just not if it meant interacting with other people.   
  
it ruined my social life and social skill development, which is obvious. lost the last of my IRL friends when i was 12 shortly after it started, spent 8 years mostly alone, didn't have another person i could really call a friend until just last year. this person has helped me in ways i can't even express, and I've now got a sizeable group of people wanting to speak to me every day, but our little group is spread across the globe and only really know eachother through online gaming.

I've spent the last nine, nearly ten, years caring for my disabled mother and elderly grandmother, unofficially at first but once i turned 18 i signed up for the carers payment the Australian government offers, we were eligible and I've been living on that since. now my mother is beyond my care, she requires three active carers available at all times due to her size, she's now in assisted living, and my grandmother isn't far behind.

I'm still struggling with SAD every day, it takes everything out of me just to manage quick shopping trips for basic necessities, but thanks to my aunt i'm improving, albeit slowly. i do plan on therapy eventually, since really that's the best way forward, as much as i hate the idea and it scares me more than i can express, although i'm sure a lot of you get that.

i guess what i'm looking for here is advice on how to even start? general education cert, drivers license, everything on that front I've got covered thanks to my wonderful aunt swooping in to assist me now. but i'm not sure where to start on the social front. i figure i can't really just go out alone and speak to people, that seems so strange, it's such a foreign concept to me. my online friends suggest going out to clubs, bars, what have you, to meet people there - but how does one do that alone? it just doesn't seem right. it often feels like you need to have friends to make friends at this age. oh yeah just meet people at parties, at clubs, at bars, just while you're out. what parties? what clubs? bars, alone?

i'm just not sure how to start, or if i even should if i can't even handle walking through a shopping centre. but the loneliness is starting to become unbearable. my complete inexperience with interacting with people doesn't help."
776,2,"I (29M) traveled alone for the first time last year. I have been straggling with social anxiety since childhood, and taking this step was a really big deal for me.

At the time, I just really wanted to feel like I'm making progress and getting out of my comfort zone. So my mindset was: I'm going to take a flight and go to the hotel, and in the worst case scenario I'll be too anxious to do anything or go anywhere, and I'll just stay in the hotel room. It will be a waste of money, but I'm willing to lose this money in order to take this big step.

Well, in practice things were not so bad. I did go out and wondered around, and even went on a few short group tours (long ones were too scary because I guess you are more expected to get to know the people in the group).

The problem was however, while it was a nice experience and big step forward, I felt incredibly lonely the entire time. Connecting with locals or other travelers it practically not an option, it's just too hard for me.

Going back to the present day. I'm starting to think about taking another trip. But I worry it will be lonely again 😔.

I know there are many platforms that help you meet people to travel with. The thing is, I'm too anxious and socially awkward for that. I'm sure I'll feel like I'm just a bother to the person that will travel with me. And we won't actually enjoy each other's company because I'll just be too anxious all the time. And there will be activities that the other person will probably want to do, but I won't be able to do them.

Ideally I would like to find someone else that is also with social anxiety and is looking for a traveling partner. But it's really difficult to find. Because many people with social anxiety are either too anxious to travel, or not so anxious so they won't understand me or enjoy my company 🙁

I'll be really interested to hear if anyone here can relate or have any advice.

And on the off chance that someone from here is actually interested in an anxious traveling partner, please reach out, that will be amazing 😃. but I'm not getting my hopes up because I know it's a long shot."
777,2,"i hate that this is my life now. it went from not being able to order food, to isolating myself in my apartment— ordering take out— and just avoiding human interaction.  just… how was this even possible?? how did I let it get this bad?? like sometimes at night I just have to.. rethink my life. think about the times I embarrassed myself, stuttered, or just existed.

not only has this disorder ruined my school life, it’s also ruined my life in general. I’ve been told I dont know how to set boundaries for myself therefore it’s my fault each time someone takes advantage of me emotionally. I don’t know how to talk to people, let alone.. set boundaries for myself!! and it pains me so much when someone says they have social anxiety yet they’re just shy. I know everyone deals with it differently— but there’s a difference. There’s a difference between getting butterflies in your stomach when giving a presentation and then there’s heart-racing, nausea, and getting a headache when you’re just.. talking with people. Or maybe it’s just me, idek if my feelings are valid anymore.

Therapy is an option, and in fact, im going to my first appointment in a few days. It took me a lot of time to even think about going to therapy, talking with a person… being vulnerable. How can I stop caring about what others think about me💔
"
778,2,"A while ago at my old job I guess I came off as a creep and made someone completely avoid me because… I don’t even know. I was just trying to act normal but I guess I didn’t come off that way. 

I was one of the younger people there and there was one girl in my department who was my age. Didn’t see her much and didn’t talk to her, but at first she’d say hi, and was pretty nice and everything. She was somewhat attractive but I didn’t have any romantic desire or anything, I was just indifferent. 

Then one day we were paired together to do some stuff, me being me I didn’t talk unless it was necessary, and she seemed pretty quiet too, but there was still some communication.
I thought I did fine. It seemed normal. I am always extremely anxious but I feel like I put up a good front, at least when there is limited interaction like in this case. 

But after that day she actively avoided me. I never talked to her again. I’m pretty sure I saw her change directions when we were walking towards each other as well. And there was just a strong gut feeling of all this 

This is the kind of stuff that really hurts, because it just proves I’m doing something fundamentally wrong. Despite trying my best and feeling like it went fine, I somehow messed up so bad I came off as a creep. These experiences just make the anxiety so much worse, it sucks. All this happened like a year ago but it still pops into my mind sometimes. Wish I could just not care "
779,2,"I’m an extremely awkward and introverted person so i don’t make many new friends. In one of my classes there’s a girl who’s super cool and has similar interests as me but I’ve always been to scared to talk to her. Eventually she came up to me and exchanged socials and stuff and I got her number. We have barely talked so I invited her to go to the mall and just like hang out but now I’m freaking out. It’s in a few hours but I’m so scared, we like a lot of them same things so there is a lot to talk about but we are both very introverted and I’m so bad at holding a conversation one on one. If anyone has any advice please share!!"
780,2,"Recently, I was on a PACKED bus with my friend, she was talking pretty loud and the whole bus could probably hear our conversation and I was so embarrassed. I tried to talk quietly but she didn’t get the hint but I didn’t want to say anything so I just really anxious and tried to shrink in my seat and hope no one was looking.

One time I did tell my friend that she probably shouldnt talk about (unhinged) stuff really loud in public. She responded with, “It doesn’t matter, people don’t care anyway.”

But in general, when we’re out in public I’m always so paranoid other people can overhear conversations and they think we’re annoying and inconsiderate, I feel bad thinking this because I don’t think my friend’s annoying.

What would you do in this situation?"
781,2,"I really want to post on some subs because I think I would feel a lot more comfortable with ppl that are more like me and I feel like maybe I could be myself  and talk with others about the same things but I feel really anxious in other subs or  sometimes when I comment, also I try to be myself but im so scared about being judged that I end up seeming boring and cold (or maybe I am idk) so people don't upvote me and I don't gain karma :/"
782,2,"So i just graduated from uni and said goodbye to many of my classmates and i just feel so guilty. I feel like they were nice and helpful while i was awkward and isolating . The same thing happened to me when i finished high school . I liked my classmates but was physiologically unable to show that . And ive been numbing myself since then . Im too sensitive and dont want to be hurt in any way so not interacting with anyone is what’s safe . Im so sad rn . Mostly because i dont know how to fix it and becuase of that , this will be my life for a long time . Me ruining my own life over and over and feeling more and more shame . I tried over the years , then i didnt . Sometimes i feel like i dont even have a problem . My life is too empty and im over exaggerating normal things to give my life meaning . Anyways , i just felt like saying something to someone that might understand me . "
783,2,"I asked for advice for dating as a plus size women. I recently gained a lot of weight I’m not used to because of heavy medication. I was basically in survival mode for months and was kind of on the fence if i should try to date. Then I got the following comment:

„The lie is: there are millions upon millions of men who like their women plush.....
This is the lie. They will tolerate and date those women but they will not take them seriously and commit to them in a serious relationship. That's also the reason why
""plush women"" have an abundance of men that want to ""date"" them. It's because they are easy ""prey"". They have a smaller chance of getting married than a woman who are of average size. A lot of men love to date and sex fat women but the better men will not marry them. Maybe the men that don't have a good life. Those men have options and they will not choose a fat woman. Just like attractive women have options and will not choose a loser man.“

I don’t know but it got to me. I’m sitting here sobbing. There was another dude who basically called me ugly just because I’m overweight without knowing how I look. I struggled all my life with social anxiety which became better over the past years after finding the right friends. It got worse after I moved and struggled with my mental health. Now I just want to stay in my room and talk to nobody out of fear of being judged.

Worst part? I struggled with an ED all my life and the urge to starve myself is.. high. I feel so shitty.. 😞"
784,2,"i graduated high school last year at 15 and moved 3 states away. i was abusing drugs pretty hard before i moved and i went cold turkey. i developed a lot of social anxiety at that time because my self perception was so fucked up when going through withdrawals. i wanted to get back on my feet and thought i would be fine once i got a job. i started working but it didn’t really do much for my social life (housekeeping isn’t exactly a social job). i also started going to a youth group and i was talking to kids my age and it was great. but i could never fully connect with people, because our life experiences were so incredibly different. i should also say i moved from a big city to a small town and the normalities of gangs and drugs and even different cultures were nowhere to be found. i could never open up to the people there, the the times that i tried i was looked at like a different species. i eventually found some friends, but it lead me to start abusing drugs again and they were just nasty people all around so it didn’t last long. i don’t want to stoop back to my old ways just to be liked by people who don’t really care about me. i then started college and thought for sure id find people then, but that created its own complications. i’m 16 now in an environment with 18-25 year olds and making my age known immediately disqualified me as someone to form a connection with. i can’t be mad about that, what adult want to be friends with a literal child. anyways, i guess what im asking is how do i find genuine people, who don’t have an ulterior motive to connect with?"
785,2,"So recently I met a new girl at work. We’ve been chatting during office hours she even grabbed my phone from a coworker to call me and I’ve helped her out with some tasks at her desk. We’ve started flirting a bit, too. She mentioned she’s not from around here, so I offered to show her the town. She suggested going to the game zone, and I said I’d love to go sometime.
Here’s the thing I’ve never dated before, and I’m pretty insecure about my height. I’m 5’6″, she’s around 5’4″, but I feel like I look like a kid next to her. I’m told I have a “typical Chad” face, and I tend to act extroverted to hide my true feelings. In fact, I often ignore girls who show interest in me because of my insecurities.
should I ask her out and just have fun? Or would it be weird since we work together? Any tips on dealing with my height anxiety?"
786,2,"Hi there,

I’m from Sydney & would love to maybe meetup or talk to someone around here who also experiences SA as we would be able to better understand each other.  I do need more time to open up for obvious reasons but I  enjoy having deep conversations once I open up. I would like  to make new friends & explore places in Sydney, try out new cafes/ restaurants/ go concerts if ur interested ofc but im looking to meet up with people around Sydney Aus (sorry if ur not in Sydney) & perhaps go out more  as we only get to live once. Also never had a bf & I don’t mind getting to know someone :) maybe you’ll find me cute ☺️ 


Send me a message if interested :) maybe u can start by telling me what’s ur fav show/movie, fav food or tell me lil about urself, it can be anything no judgement  :) "
787,2,"""I'm sorry. Words are... difficult for me. They never fully weave What I Wish to say. If you do not like my answers, then you need not ask me questions."" 

Maybe not the last part so much but this quote really resonated with me. I just really like the wording of words not fully ""weaving"" what we wish to say. 

I feel this often when getting so anxious about how to words things, always editing and retyping and rereading a lot if it's online.. and I still feel like doing it all wrong. (I'm so doing it right now lol.) 

The game is ""Slay the Princess"" By the way and this might be one of my favorite quotes by the character that says it now. "
788,2,"I’m engaging in hobbies online but if I go anywhere alone I just feel way too visible and I can’t stand it. 

Waiting on the street for an Uber is unbearable. Sitting alone in a drs waiting room is unbearable. Buying something at a store is unbearable.

I feel like I’m wearing giant neon sign that says “I DON’T BELONG OUTSIDE UNSUPERVISED”

If I had a bf I could go places and if I got overwhelmed he could give me a hug and I could hide my face against his shoulder and no one would think anything of it. But on my own there’s no way to hide my face without looking weird and so I just stand there looking terrified and the fact that I know I look terrified ensures I keep being terrified."
789,2,"I’ve always had intense phone anxiety —the second I have to call someone, my heart starts racing and my brain short-circuits. My mom asked me to help switch her Wi-Fi provider (she’s not very tech-savvy). I called the old company to cancel, but halfway through the automated phone tree, I panicked, hit zero too many times, and somehow ended up confirming a cancellation *immediately* — without even lining up the new service. So she’s been offline for 3–5 days. I felt so guilty I couldn’t sleep that night.

Been trying to figure out workarounds for calling people, as I really need to get over this fear. Lately, I’ve been either asking my brother to make phone calls or using altodial to call customer service for me. Ultimately, I just want to be normal and make phone calls without freaking out every time. 

I still feel pretty bad about cancelling my mom’s Wi-Fi. My mom was pretty chill about it (she just asked if I’d take her to Panera so she could use their Wi-Fi lol), but I hate how something so small can spiral when anxiety kicks in. I just feel like a mess and am overall super pissed off at myself. Anyways, that’s enough venting. Any advice or wisdom is more than welcome.

790,2,"*VENTING*
The only people I've been hanging out with are my nieces at the moment. They are the only ones that don't mind my personality and have time for me. So I've been struggling maintaining relationships with my generation, they're good people but it has been exhausting more than chilling. Like I'd literally be drained of energy. I'm a social butterfly but not for long, I end up wanting to be at home either gaming or drawing or watching anime. I'd get anxious not knowing how to keep up a conversation. I have tried changing the crowd I hang out with people who are closer to my hobbies, but it always gets too serious or competitive. Just for my sanity, I've been getting on twitch watching people do art and finding that as comfort to fill my loneliness when I work on my projects. Friendship is a hit or miss."
791,2,I am like hella bored 
792,2,"I’ve (21f) developed this new fear of people looking at me. It’s gotten so bad that holding eye contact with a stranger will ruin a whole day. I don’t freak out on them or say anything, but I’ll go and find a place to cry for a while. It just started in the past six months. I look weird and I feel like that’s all people think about. I can’t even go to the bar with friends because I’m horrified at the idea of being the only one not talked to by guys but horrified at the idea of being talked to. I don’t know how I’m supposed to do things. I wish I wasn’t so ugly. It hurts"
793,2,"What do you do when the bus is crowed enough that there's no seats not beside someone? Do you just stand, do you reluctantly sit beside a stranger or what? 

I have no idea what to do in this situation sometimes lol. Like I'd rather stand than sit beside someone, I'm fine with that but what if I get in someone's way because I'm standing? Where exactly should I stand? What if the bus shakes and I bump into someone or drop something? What if people are wondering why I'm standing when there's literally seats available? 

Another thing that caused me anxiey yesterday, the bus stopped (last stop) and the second doors didn't open (or rather they opened for a second then closed.) Stemmed there was a issue or something idk. The bus just sat there doors closed and I was like how do I get off? The front doors were open (soon after) but the bus driver was there and I'm supposed to get off at the second doors so like...what do I? I literally have an appointment to get to. 

..It was literally just easy as walk up to the bus driver at the front doors with clear intent to exit, and...leave with him moving slightly to make it easier. 🤦😅"
794,2,"I'm not in school anymore, but I still get mad anxiety if I attend any sort of event where it's someone teaching a small group of people. I get so anxious that I'll get called on or if everyone else is talking a lot/asking a lot of questions and I'm the only one not saying anything, so much so that my self-consciousness makes it difficult to pay attention. I also get super self-conscious just sitting there if I'm not in the back because I can feel myself being Perceived. It takes me a while to get comfortable around strangers and it freaks me out when they all look at me when I say something, so it really sucks when I can't enjoy events because I struggle to speak up. I don't even have much to say most times since I prefer to listen. My whole body tenses up and I give off a weird vibe because of the anxiety. How do normal people relax in these situations?"
795,2,"Sometimes — especially right after waking up or before going to sleep — I feel so fucking lonely to the point where I just don’t know what to do with myself. It’s like everything I’ve been trying (like therapy, exposure and such) isn’t making any real difference.

How do you cope with it? "
796,2,"Am I the only one who literally internalizes everything and uses it as a weapon against myself? 
For example, if I walk into work in the morning, and my coworkers don’t say hello or talk to me within the first hour of arriving, I sum it up to, “They don’t like me.” Instead of, “They probably didn’t sleep well” or, “Maybe their day is off to a bad start.” Obviously everyone has bad days. But I am so quick to make it about me. 

If I sense, in the slightest, someone’s mood is off and they’re not chatty, I will avoid talking to them. I feel like if I “check in” with them, I am bothering them—especially if they don’t maintain eye contact and I catch them looking away or fiddling with something while I’m trying to talk to them. I pick up on every little detail of every social interaction.. so much so, that I’d just rather avoid social interaction with people because it always leads to me thinking something is wrong with me. 


"
797,2,"I’m 19 and about to apply for my first job, but I’m honestly not sure how I’ll handle it. I’ve been dealing with social anxiety for a long time, and the past 5 years have only made it harder. I did high school online, barely went outside, and got way too used to being isolated because of COVID. Now, I don’t have any friends—online or in real life—and my social skills are basically nonexistent.

I get really anxious around people I don’t know. I avoid eye contact, I get shaky, I stutter, and I start sweating during conversations. I also have ADHD, so I’m worried about zoning out during something important and someone getting mad at me for it. I’ve dealt with confrontation before, but it’s always really difficult for me, and I don’t feel confident in how I handle it.

I’m planning to apply to retail or food service jobs, but I’m nervous about how I’ll handle the social side of it. If anyone’s been in a similar situation or has tips for managing social anxiety, ADHD, and tough interactions in retail/food service jobs, I’d really appreciate it.

"
798,2,"So, I have pretty bad social anxiety and in particular I have an intense fear of learning new games in front of new people or playing games where you have to think on the spot around people I’m not fully comfortable with. I’ve had a couple of experiences before where I was at a social gathering and everyone wanted to play party games like Jackbox and I just kept freezing up every time I needed to come up with something on the spot. My anxiety would make my mind go completely blank and I would get so self conscious and worried about it that I felt like I was about to burst into tears and would then have a hard time recovering from it and acting normal the rest of the night. Does anyone have good advice for how to handle that when invited to a dinner with some people you don’t know and people want to play party games? Is it completely lame to just say you’re gonna sit out if it’s a game where you have to think of something funny or witty on the spot? I’m usually down to try something new if it’s relatively easy to learn but I am so stressed that if it’s a party game like that, I just can’t think under pressure and based on past experience, I know if I give it a shot it’s very likely I’ll end up having a panic attack in front of everyone. "
799,2,"I had four sessions, starting  a couple of months ago and ending today. I never opened up. Every time she prompted me I just went inside my head and tried to think of something to talk about about but everything I want to get out makes me want to burst into tears and I’m deeply ashamed to do so. So we just sat there in silence for minutes until she said something else. I barely said anything over four total hours of therapy. Today she asked if we could do a ‘walk and talk’. I said maybe. I liked the idea but I thought she’d be uncomfortable walking with me outside the building. She didn’t talk further on that idea after I said maybe. Then she grabbed a box of fluffy toys and sat them beside me in case I could ‘use them’. I felt humiliated.

I have a history of crying in front of people. Almost anyone I know well I end up crying in front of them. I feel like a sook every time. 
The therapist politely suggested I come back when I’m ‘ready’ but I think opening up is beyond ‘being ready’ for me. It’s like the trauma of those crying episodes has built in a safety behaviour of avoiding opening up to people. I haven’t talked about how I really feel to anyone in years. I have no friends. Never had a partner. Can’t open up to family because they can’t keep things confidential. 

I need to tell someone how I feel. "

Everyone I’ve talked to has told me that there’s no way I couldn’t have seen it and that I was either not paying attention or driving impaired (which really pissed me off - I literally dont even drink). The worst part is that it was at my kids baseball game, so the other parents saw and I’m just so ashamed. I know this might seem insignificant but I already struggle with people not taking me seriously or thinking that I’m a compete mess. I literally feel like dying.

807,2,"I am a third year university student majoring in a highly extroverted program. I work with athletes as a healthcare professional, providing adequate treatment and rehabilitation. As I mentally prepare for my upcoming practicum- I am super anxious that I won't be able to meet expectations and form meaningful relationships with athletes.

I realized that much of my anxiety is stems from my ongoing struggle of social anxiety. I often engage in negative self-talk and overthink my interactions, replaying conversations in my head and second-guessing myself. Meeting new people and asserting myself in unfamiliar environments can feel overwhelming. Despite knowing I’m capable, I constantly question whether I’ve said the right thing or come across the right way. 

  
No matter where I am or what interactions I've had, I keep experiencing this deep-rooted anxiety that I’m being judged. I really want to make friends and build meaningful relationships with my athletes, colleagues, and mentors. I don’t want to be seen as some weird, isolated girl who keeps to herself. I don’t know how to overcome this issue, as I always seem to fall back into the same pattern of overthinking and withdrawing. "

How can I try to meet people. I'm kind of socially akward, all I am able to really talk about it cars, girls don't usually want to hear about that. And anytime I try to add people on snap it's always someone ghosts me or it's like an only fans bot and I just want to meet people. Like I'll go on these subreddots that talk about how they want to meet people on snap and I'll add people but they're almost always bots. And it feels kind of desperate to do that but I guess what I'm typing right now is also desperate. "
809,2,"Anybody have this issue with “Adult” phone calls. Basically phone calls to offices to do with your work, housing, health, finances, you name it. I’m a young adult now and naturally I’m finding myself having to make more and more of these. Any time I need to ask important and necessary questions to these places I’m always so nervous and I end up structuring my speech so poorly because of my anxiety and it’s so awkward. On the other end, because of how bad I speak, many times they just talk condescendingly to me and it makes me feel so dumb for even asking, as if I’m asking things everyone should already know. I’m sure people without social anxiety also experience this but for me it’s such a killer and reinforced a lot of bad things I think. "
810,2,Idk it's too difficult to live with all these insecurities and anxieties I just wanna have some peace 
811,2,I feel like im more afraid to be myself around people i know than people who i dont know sometimes. Im basically a closed shell in home. 
812,2,I really don't know how I will survive 
813,2,"I have really bad social anxiety. I have no friends and NEVER have. I am so lonely. I have felt like I can't stand being alone anymore. But I can barely speak, let alone make friends. At school it's like they don't even notice me and I always feel like no one wants me 😭 EVERY SINGLE SOCIAL SITUATION IS A NIGHTMARE FOR ME. I am the one at school who almost never talks and is always alone. I have no self-confidence, I honestly hate myself. I feel worthless. Sorry I'm desperate"
814,2,"
I am alone as fuck 
I am trying to care but it’s hard to care about anything when you don’t even try anymore
I have social skills and don’t even have immediate anxiety like I used to I just have been so convinced I am deeply flawed and different for so fucking long since a lil kid I just avoid the effort to make relationships happen 
It hurts to much but it’s all I want

815,2,"I graduated a year ago from college with a degree in healthcare (Kinesiology). Got my certification in phlebotomy. Done a few internships from Athletic Training, to Physical Therapy. And I still can’t find a job in my related field. No matter how hard I try. And it’s extremely demoralizing. And you know the supposed reason? Cause I’m not “networking”. Networking makes me want to actually kms and someday I fear it might. I didn’t interact with anyone in college because of my low self esteem and social anxiety. And it’s all coming back to bite me in the ass all because of a mental ailment I have. There’s no succeeding in life for people like me. I don’t know what else to do. I feel so lost. "
816,2,"I noticed I will sometimes get kind of numb on a first date. I think it’s the mix of it usually being evening, alcohol, and an unfamiliar place with an unfamiliar person, which makes it numb for me. I hate this though. I hate that I feel kind of cut off from myself and my emotions. Maybe it’s the nerves too, but I’ve gotten this way in other social settings too — like getting with friends in the evening to do an activity, my brain sometimes just checks out. I hate it and want it to stop. It scares me. How do I make it stop? I want to feel alive, especially when I’m dating. It’s supposed to be enjoyable and this makes it difficult for me to fully enjoy. Does anyone else feel like this? Or is everyone else just having a great time where they’re fully “present”? I want to enjoy alcohol too but I feel like all it does is numb me further. 

I noticed it’s usually better on a second date because I’m more familiar with the person, but I don’t often get past a first date with most guys. "

819,2,"Hi so me and my girlfriend have been dating for 9 months and generally things have been really good. However a major problem recently is that my girlfriend wants to meet my best friend, which is extremely anxiety triggering for me. Me and my best friends relationship is really strange as I have severe social anxiety and he has autism, essentially we never speak about anything about our real lives, we just play games together and that’s about it. I usually play games with him for about 3 hours everyday so naturally my girlfriend wants to meet him. I literally feel like it’s impossible though and it’s making her feel terrible and I don’t know what to do. Sorry if this is terribly worded I’m stressed out but I would appreciate any help or anything.
"
820,2,"For the past few years, I don’t know why, but I feel I just don’t care about anything in my life anymore. I tried so many different things, medication, therapy, weed, supplements but nothing seems to help. Every time I see almost any other person who isn’t my family my heart starts to race, I start sweating, shaking, and I can’t speak. I just feel like at this point I give up. I can’t make anything of myself, or at least make the life I want to live, without the ability to communicate normally with other humans. I just want to smoke weed in my room all day and forget about this life until it’s my turn to die. I honestly wouldn’t care that much about doing this if it wasn’t for me being a disappointment to my parents. They spent so much time, effort, money to make sure I would have everything I need to be successful. And I’m wasting all of it. I wish they could have had a better son who would’ve given them what they wanted"
821,2,"Hey Guys. I’m a (14M), and I’ve felt invisible for a long time. I don’t really have friends. No boys at school like me or want to hang out with me. I get overlooked a lot, and sometimes bullied—nothing super obvious, just the kind of stuff that makes you feel like you don’t belong anywhere.

I don’t even talk properly. My voice is really quiet and shy, and it feels like when I try to talk, no one listens anyway. It’s like people made their mind up about me already, and I’m stuck in this box of being “weird” or “boring,” when deep down I know I’m actually a kind, creative, and funny person when I feel safe.

Some girls at school invited me to be part of their friend group recently, and I know they’re trying to be nice, but I just can’t open up. I feel like a robot at school—sad, tired, and awkward—even though I’m really passionate about music and lighting design outside of class. I want to connect, but I also don’t trust people anymore. I've been rejected and left out too many times.
My teacher told me it’s kind of my fault for not joining in when classmates invite me to play cards or whatever, but honestly, I just freeze. It’s not that I don’t want to join—I’m just scared of being judged or not wanted. That fear is so loud in my head, it keeps me quiet even when I want to speak.

I’m tired of going through school feeling like I’m not really living, just surviving. Life feels like a constant headache instead of something I’m excited about. Music is the one thing that helps me feel something real—but even that sometimes doesn’t feel like enough.

So yeah, I guess I’m just asking:
* How do I start trusting people again after being hurt so much?
* How can I feel less invisible, especially when I’m shy and soft-spoken?
* And how do I make life feel more passionate or hopeful when it just feels empty?

Thanks for reading. I really don’t talk about this with anyone, so it means a lot if you made it this far."
822,2,"I'm (22f) the type of person to beat herself up a lot when it comes to embarrassing social interactions: when there are days I feel pretty in my looks, I don't consider these social interactions embarrassing and just brush them off but on the wrong day, I can ruminate about it and suddenly beat myself up mentally about it to the point I physically wince very hard and all my thinking is on that one specific interaction. I constantly think that anyone who's in my surroundings are only tolerating me because their circumstances have put them there in my life and not because they actually might like talking to me that they're still in my life. That's when I shut out and sometimes even ignore people I normally talk to or say hi to, and then these same people think I'm doing this because Im evil and want to make them miserable or they think Im just using them when I just get so unbelievably anxious about what they think of me, and just end up avoiding them altogether. Now I have never been diagnosed with social anxiety, and I don't like to self-diagnose so truly I dont think I have social anxiety but the bad days hit really hard for me more than most ppl. My ways of being, as you see, are results of anxiety and stress and overthinking so sometimes I do realize when it's not real but I feel like now it's mostly real. I can't tell if it's the reality or just me 80% of it "
823,2,"Just what the title says. I had rehearsed bullet points and anecdotes with the other groomsman and shared them with the groom beforehand. When it came time to do my speech I was questioning my prep and decided the notes wouldn’t be useful. I thought I would try and speak from the heart. Big mistake. I got about 5 sentences in (and sounded confident/rehearsed). Then I completely froze up. Absolute silence and I couldn’t get another word out. I started panicking and eventually just muttered “I’m very honored to know you both” and sat down. Absolute disaster and it looks like I didn’t care at all. The bride and groom and everybody was super supportive and I was even told by a few people that it came across as “emotional” and “endearing”, but I can’t help thinking that I really let people down. The thing is, I’m normally a very competent public speaker. I’m a lawyer so not new to speaking extemporaneously on the spot, and I gave a well-received high school graduation speech. Anyways, I’m spiraling and hope someone can maybe sympathize."

825,2,"I know, wrong sub to be asking, but one of the things I hate most about my anxiety is the paranoia… I cant just relax and be myself I feel like people are always staring at me or judging me and its so discomforting.

The problem is that I'm REALLY, REALLY terrified of actually doing that, i have no idea what to write to not make it sound weird and the whole situation is awkward because i switched schools in the past and it always causes some awkwardness when interacting with people from there.

Can you guys help me overcome the anxiety and write the message? Thanks in advance."
829,2,"1. A guy came up to me and asked me how many sets I had left. I said 2 more and he said ok, take your time. I finished, and then he was nowhere to be found, and so I left to use another machine. Later, he comes walking by and sees the machine taken by someone else and looks at me as if I betrayed him or something...
2. I asked a girl how many sets she had left. She took out her earbud as if I were bothering her and said 3. I am a gay male but I don't know if she thought I was hitting on her? I think my voice conveys my gayness very well.
3. I asked a guy how many sets he had left. He said 2 more. I said ok and then I asked if I could work in with him since he was just standing near the machine. He said fine, as long as you clear the machine (I had no idea what that meant). He had his phone on the machine so I had to balance not to let it fall off, then he realized and took it off. I did my set and put the weights back to where they were as he was using. He does another set. And we rotate, no problems, and then he actually did 3 sets instead of the two he said, but midway through the third set, he stopped, took his things, and left. Usually don't people acknowledge the other person after they're done?

By the time I finished with the other machine, the girl who said she had three sets left was STILL on that machine.

I just am very annoyed by all this. I don't want to bother people in their workouts but it was very crowded and there was no machines available."
830,2,"im someone who definitely suffers from social anxiety masked as plain introvertedness when i was younger. everyone thought, including me, that im just merely shy and quiet which i am rlly. but beneath that ive always been anxious about everything. i wasnt just being aloof and lonely in one corner because i feel like it, im actually anxious and nervous with ppl and crowds. 

now that i am a young adult and im about to graduate, i feel rlly honestly overwhelmed and scared of the real world. i stopped using socmeds when i was in highschool and ever since then even when i sometimes fantasize about making some sort of comeback, i couldn't anymore. even if i wanted to have a string of connection with my peers from college, friends as well, it feels so impossible because im someone who cant use socmeds rlly well. im anxious about everything. a single like on someone's post, more so a comment. im like how am i supposed to strengthen and continuously build relationships when im like this? 

im afraid ill grow lonely, lyk im not already lonely now (lmao). even so i just want to express and rant my heart out cause ever since im young, ive always felt different from other ppl of the same ages to me. it feels like im meant to be alone and lonely, something along these lines.

idk..... my thoughts and emotions are scattered i just wanna let them out here. "

Last time I cried in front of the evaluator and he said I definitely need to see someone about my anxieties.

833,2,I recently start new job I m scared of those pepoles working for 10 hours in that environment really feels so hard for me so anyone have any suggestions or experience of it
834,2,"everything is so hard i feel insane and i know factually it can’t be true but emotionally i literally feel like the scum of the earth, like i’m the worst person alive. i don’t feel worthy of anyone’s time or love and i just feel like such a loser freak even when i’m alone and i really want to stop feeling like that. i have tried in the past with self help techniques and i’ve tried positive self talk for a while but i can’t ever get myself to believe it, or i’ll be having an ok time and then something minor happens that knocks me and i’m back on the floor. 

i feel so embarrassed about feeling like this because it’s like it’s unjustified, on paper i really do have a good life, and it’s making me hate myself for hating myself. i just want people to like me but i am painfully boring and shy and i know if i met myself i definitely would not like me. 

i don’t understand how i became so dysfunctional. everybody else i see says they feel similar to me inside but they can still function so well, and relate to other people. i have friends but i don’t feel entirely connected and safe with them which is definitely my own issue, and i struggle to make friends with new people because i think i’m internally judgemental and because i’m boring. it has often happened that i’ve met someone more than twice and the next time i see them they don’t remember me. 

i feel like i missed out on key milestones in life because i am the way that i am, and it’s making me worse now because of it. i also just have an anxious brain and tend to overthink about consequences and disasters. i really really want to stop feeling like this but everything i’ve tried hasn’t worked or i hated it, so what can i do? "
835,2,It's taken to 35 and a lot of recent solo travel plus therapy to realise my social anxiety has (for the most part) gone to the point where I'm now confident relaxed and give good eye contact. I feel like a different person. Did this happen to anyone else at 35?
836,2,"hi, i'm 22F, and i recently had a bit of a discovery in the way i handle socializing with people i don't know and already know. i completely freeze up if i'm tasked with trying to talk to someone, stranger or otherwise. in most cases, i feel completely ill, as in sick to my stomach and at the verge of vomiting, whenever i have to bring it upon myself to reach out to someone.

  
i just wanted to know if i'm not alone in this feeling? i'm not even sure about what to call it, but i constantly feel this way about everyone i meet or come into contact with."
837,2,"Yesterday I (24F) got the job I wanted. I go to this cafe where I met a lot of people that I consider some to be my friends. I was super happy from hearing the news and I came in super hyperactive and happy, which made me crash down quickly because as someone with ADHD, I will feel my emotions extremely which wont last long and will drain my energy quickly.

I am aware of how I came out, so the way I was feeling made me uncomfortable and I tried calming myself down and adapting to my surroundings, but the rest of the people were also chaotic and hectic today so the whole vibe was off, basically it was a little draining, so I wasn't the only issue so to say lol.

So in the evening me and the two friends (24M & 32M) that I really like went out to get drinks. I asked them if my energy was an issue today. The conversation shifted to how I am generally manic and I seem like I act out of anxiety most of the time and that it will cause people to ""advantage of it"". (I dont know how that would be) I listen and I respect their opinions because I want to be as self aware as I can. But then one of them (24M) calls me ""good but dumb"" and it instantly gives me the signal that I am not welcome. I question the reason as to why he would call me that, and he says that he knows I am not dumb, he just thinks its okay to say that when I do dumb things, half ass apologizes that he ""made me feel bad"".

We split at the end of the night. We drop off one pf my friends (32M) in-front of his house, I hug him and he says ""it is too much"". [Has not texted me since.] We walk home with the friend who called me dumb, I questioned his intent telling him; he should realize that we just met and for me to call him that would make him just as uncomfortable, that I am not dumb nor did I do things that I think would make me dumb, that I wouldn't treat him that way, and that in my opinion this shows me he doesn't respect me the same way I respect him. He seems apologetic that I ""misunderstood"" his intentions, saying he is working on ""being too honest"" in therapy lol. I tell him we can talk about this when we are sober and I go home.

I haven't talked to both of these people, I feel like I did something to embarrass myself and cause people to think badly of me. I don't know if this is a sign I have some kind of behavioral issue that I am not aware of, or that these people are not treating me as true friends. I am lost and ashamed."
838,2,"It's been months since I interacted with people other than my family, and the last time I did go out I had a panic attack at the grocery. Clearly staying indoors has not done me any good.

 A family that is friends with my family came by recently. My brain completely shut off when I was greeting them, awkwardly standing and nodding and saying single word responses. 

When I finally left the room, I realised how utterly drained I was of energy. My brain was in a haze I didn't notice it had been in, and looking back I realise it's as if part of me gets buried when I have to socialise. I become a shadow of myself, almost devoid of emotions or animation or soul.

I smile, of course, I try to be very polite. But I feel so soulless, and I don't know what's wrong with me. It feels so painful to have to pretend to be a person?? Idk how to put it into words. 

I'm usually very energetic and lively and talkative when I'm with my siblings or my friend. I feel human when I'm with them. But with everyone else, suddenly I'm outside of myself. I'm swimming around in a viscous liquid and I have no control at all. 

After socialising for 5 minutes, I have to run to somewhere safe and isolated, and gather back myself and my strength. I feel like a robot, it freaks me out how much it feels like the part of me that deals with feelings is shut off. 

But then I listen to some music and clean or cook, and suddenly I'm myself again."
839,2,"I get shy and anxious around others, even with friends I've known for over a decade. I want to talk about life with my friends but I end up not doing that because I forget or hold myself back by telling myself I'm being awkward or I'm making things about myself.

I didn't have strong feelings about my social anxiety before, but after this year I've started to genuinely hate it, because I've grown so much. I made a lot of friends, bettered my mental health and put myself out there more than I ever have in a long time. I even signed up on a dating site for the first time. But even so my anxious thoughts are still there, pushing me back, trying to get me to believe it's all a fluke.

I don't want to think this way anymore, because I now know I'm better than it."

How much time you guys needed to feel benefits, and does it help with unipolar depression and bpd mood swings?"
841,2,"I've been trying to solve this issue for years. It only happens in casual conversation, usually when im not really into the conversation. I try and think of something and then when I set up to start talking, theres like this performance anxiety that takes place and my brain just shuts off the train of thought, sometimes I can recover, sometimes not. Even if I do recover people are put off by it, then theres like this awkward funk with that person and it becomes like a self fulfilling prophecy. Every time I talk, I feel that past awkward moment in the air, I think (oh they probably think im going to freeze again) and it makes me almost freeze again, its like OCD or something. Thankfully this doesnt happen when the conversation is about work or a common goal. Its almost like when the current goal is to relax and bullshit with someone, my entire being just goes into fight or flight. 

I've never been a big talker, I think part of the reason I freeze up is I'm self conscious about my lack of conversation. Like if I don't say something interesting right now this person is going to think this conversation sucks and then they will think less of me. That gets the performance anxiety going and again, self fulfilling prophecy. I will these brain freezes into existence, and even though I understand how it works, it still happens sometimes. 

Can anyone relate?

842,2,"i turned 18 in december and i started community college at 17 and i've been wanting atleast a part-time job for so long now. i haven't applied or done anything since i've been struggling with school and my mental health, but i feel like i'm running out of time. 

  
my social anxiety is so bad and i'm so afraid of being interviewed because i hate being judged. i did work a few days at my dad's pizza store washing dishes and i did try to take some orders but i absolutely hated it. (i didn't mind washing dishes and doing other tasks but i didn't like working at the cashier taking people's orders) i don't really know what jobs would even hire me because i have like no work experience and it's going to be obvious that i have no social skills.

Will they just have me demonstrate my cpr on the dummy and tell them that I would first assess the situation and call for help? I am literally so stressed about the idea of having to pretend to call for help. "
844,2,"I've been struggling with social anxiety
since I was a kid. It's not just about feeling
nervous  it affects many parts of my daily
life. I find it hard to smile in public places,
and if I do, I end up feeling uncomfortable
or even guilty afterward. I can't eat outside
because I feel too self-conscious, and using
public restrooms is almost impossible for
me.
People often say, ""Smile for the photo,"" but I
genuinely dislike it. I don't take photos at all,
and I don't believe smiling suits everyone 
at least not in the forced way people expect.

847,2,"Feeling a lot of shame and embarrassment right now. I’ve struggled with anxiety my whole life and I screw up a lot of things because of it including this. The story is; I just landed an interview, after having graduated college this month, for an accounts receivable job with a construction company, and was preparing for it the past two days and all of this morning just for me to get flustered and leave after the second question (it was a zoom interview). I’m just feeling really defeated and like there’s a massive wall in between me and finally taking the next step as an adult. I do have a job currently but I hate it and I can’t live off of the income from it, so I was really excited about this opportunity.

Has anyone else dealt with something similar, and if you did, how did you end up overcoming it?"
848,2,"I’ve been really wanting to get a job, but I’m just too scared to take that leap. My mom and brother offered me a position as a dishwasher at a local bar/restaurant. They even brought me there for dinner so I could get a feel for the environment. But it just didn’t feel right for me.

We went at night, and the place was packed. After I finished eating, I had to go wait in the car because I started panicking from how crowded it was. My mom and brother told me that I’d be working the day shift, which is a lot less busy than the night shift, and I know that would probably be more manageable for me. Still, something about it just doesn’t feel like the right fit.

I’ve been wondering if there are any jobs better suited for someone with social anxiety. What I really want to do is photography. It’s something that genuinely relaxes me, and I enjoy it more than anything. I just wish I could turn that into my job—be a freelance photographer and not have to stress so much about finding something else."
849,2,"19M. Coming up on the end of my first year of uni. I have spent the past 8 months pretty much just sat in my room. I can get out on walks, mostly because I desperately want to lose weight and I'm afraid of going to the gym. Somehow I've been fine with previous summer job (going back next month) despite the need to interact with people. As soon as it comes to people my age however I'm stuck. I manage to force myself though stuff if I have to but end up terrible afterwards. I feel like I'm missing out on the things other people my age are doing. At the same time though I can't bring myself to do those things. Haven't made any friends at uni so just talk to the few friends I have from before. Unfortunately I think I'm kinda stuck in a vicous loop. Depression makes me want to try things that are supposed to make me happy but the anxiety stops me which makes me depressed etc. Sorry. Think I've just started rambling but sharing things and getting responses from a small group of strangers online helps release stuff a bit without being overwhelming"

i’m absolutely terrified but i know i need to stop avoiding the situation. i know that im going to be a complete mess on the day and this will just make my anxiety even worse so i really am in need of some tips for how to deal with this, as i dont think my usual solutions will even touch the sides.

854,2,"I accidentaly pressed the call button to a friend and i closed it shortly after and it just made me stressed because i entered to prepare mentally to text her and now i feel very shitty about it, in one hand i know she hasn´t blocked me or something, in the other one, if she changed her number then i have literally no way of contacting her unless we go to the same college i guess since i just ended highschool, it just make feel sad about it either way"
855,2,For nearly 3 years now I’ve been feeling nauseous and vomiting when I go out in public and I’m around other people. It’s not every time but usually I feel a bit sick and every so often will actually be sick. It’s been a horrendous time for the last few years but I’ve just been given sertraline (50mg/day). Has anyone else been on sertraline because of anxiety induced nausea and can you share your experience with me
856,2,"This honestly might be a rambly post since it is pretty late, but I feel like I need to get this off my chest.

I am an introvert, I like being alone and most of the time, I don't feel too lonely, or at least not lonely in a bad way.

But, and this is where the issue starts - I kinda want a gf. But I have come to terms with the fact that that's just not gonna happenany time soon. In all honesty, I know that it would be a bad idea to start a relationship now because I will be moving to another town for Uni soon and a lot of things are going on in my life rn. Point is I am content with not being in a relationship *most of the time*.

But this is where the issue starts. Sometimes (like today) I like to go out partying to a club with some friends. And every time - without fail - I always have at least a small ""episode"" where I genuinely just feel terrible emotionally. It just is the combination of feeling like I don't fit at all (like I'm the 5th wheel of the group) and seeing my friends just having a good time and interactiong with women no problem, while I can't even dance along with my friends to the music. I know this sounds really stupid, and I know I shouldn't be jealous or upset that my friends are having a good time but it somehow still makes me sad.

And I know that I shouldn't be upset and that I am unreasonable - after all I often times refuse to really get involved with anyone. I can't really muster the confidence to dance. I just stand there like an NPC that wasn't programmed properly. But it still feels like I'm missing out. In these moments I'm not content with being alone, but I also don't have the confidence or the skills to change anything about that. I just get completely overwhelmed and feel like I look stupid no matter what I do. I stand around doing nothing and I look stupid, I try to dance with my friends and I look stupid. I just can't do it.

And again - after I'm back home and reflect on the whole situation I see it differently again. I'm not really that sad anymore and I can get over it pretty easily, but in the club, at that specific moment I consistently want to jump off a bridge.

This is probably really stupid and I know for a fact that it is my fault and my fault only, but at this point I genuinely think I am hopeless.

TL;DR:
I’m an introvert who’s usually fine being alone, but whenever I go clubbing with friends, I feel out of place and overwhelmed—like I’m missing out while everyone else has fun. I want connection but lack the confidence to join in, and in those moments, I feel pretty hopeless, even though I’m mostly okay once I’m back home.

This post is probably riddled with typos and grammatical errors, but I cannot be bothered to correct them rn."
857,2,"Sometimes Random girls wave at me or shout to me in public
Its been happening for a while ill say like in the passed 2years now and it can make me very anxious to go outside becouse of the attention I get it's annoying I can't go outside without some random ass boy lifting there head to look at me straight in the eyes and girls sometimes even wave or shout gibberish to me, once i was rideing my bike down the hill and two girl put there arm out in the bus stop like they want to cacth a bus when i passed, i then looked back to see if there was a bus coming and there wasent and they were laughing and looking at me like why the hell is this always happen like should i go up to them to see what they want.my worrie is should i love it or hate it, after these moments happen I go to my house mirror and look at myself and wonder if its my looks is it how i dress?

859,2,"For context, I re-injured my shoulder and I booked an appointment with my physiotherapist (very scary). 

A week goes by, and the pain is basically gone and had to call AGAIN to cancel it because I figured there’s no point in going if it’s feeling better. 

Another week goes by and it’s feeling very weird again for some reason, and I’m thinking that I should call my physiotherapist to see what’s going on but the problem is that I have to call again to tell them “oops lol nevermind my shoulder hurts again I would like to book an appointment with yall” and the thought of doing that is probably 100x times worse than the other phone calls I did. 

I’m just panicking and stressing to make this phone call. I’m scared they’ll judge me, or think I’m an indecisive b-word. 

I want my mom to do it but I feel like a little baby who can’t face her fears like an adult should (I’m 20).

860,2,"I have dealt with social anxiety all of my life due to a shitty childhood in which Dad was not around and mom blamed me for everything and treated me like I was worthless. Yes, this does effect how you view yourself in life and no, turning into an adult doesn't magically make in disappear.

I have been to therapy off and on for decades. I never find anything useful just canned advice like ""don't worry. No one is paying attention""  and power posing.

I have also read self-help books and frankly, most of them don't do much and are padded with drawn out explanations on the roots of a problem(can't change the past) and use worthless acronyms such as B.L.U.E. which fail if you're someone who tends to get confused when you start analyzing every thought in your head.

862,2,"I (18F) have struggled with social anxiety disorder for a large portion of the past 6 years. I only got diagnosed last year, but boy oh boy that era had to be my worst of the worst moments of my whole life. I didn't say a single word to anyone in school for a whole week, I couldn't bring myself to even text friends without crying, I bombed all my midterms, and my family situation was incredibly stressful. On February 28th, 2024, four days after my 17th birthday, I attempted to take my own life because existing and feeling like nobody cared about me just got to be too hard. 

After that moment, my parents forced me to get help. I got sent to the hospital to an outpatient treatment facility and went on some new medication for social anxiety disorder. I kept working and working at my goals, even when things got hard. And now, 1 year and 3 months after that dark Wednesday night...
I've graduated high school with a 3.6 GPA, had the BEST school year of my whole life, fixed my friendships, made tons of great memories, and got into my dream school. Sure, I still feel socially anxious sometimes, but if you told 17 year old me that I would be that this point she would FREAK OUT.
Basically what I want to say is keep fighting, because life gets better. 😊"
863,2,"I’m finding myself feeling embarrassed more often than not when interacting with my bosses and it’s really damaging my self esteem and confidence at work.

I will be speaking to my boss on certain projects and they will ask me a question I know the answer to with some thought but instead my anxiety will spike and I’ll blurt out answers without thinking it through. I can tell it’s driven by my anxiety and perhaps partly related to ADHD, but I know I don’t interact the same with my coworkers (I’m confident and think things through). 

Has anyone here experienced this? Can you offer some tips or advice?

This keeps weighing on my cause it’s making me look like I don’t know what I’m talking about to my bosses."
864,2,"Hey guys ( sorry if somethings written wrong english is not my first language) 

I‘m invited to a birthday party that is later today and that is really hard for me but on top of that I‘m sick (flu). In a normal world i would just cancel but my brain and anxiety is telling me that i‘m not really sick enough to cancel. And thats always like that. I can never rest. I always feel like people would think I‘m lying. Right now as I‘m sitting here and writing this I really start to think I‘m pretending to be sick and it‘s just an excuse that i dont need to go.  But I really have the flu. Its so frustrating. I feel so alone in such moments. Does anyone know that feeling? "
865,2,Some context: In my country University Department's hold their own parties for graduation. I only have two friends that i am close with and see outside of classes and they are both bringing their partners to the party. I don't want to be alone sitting on my chair so i decided not to go. Did you guys experienced something like that and regretted it? Or when i look back i would regret not going more. Normally i do these kind of things even though i don't want to just because they are once in a life time events but the party is on a boat which will sail for 4 hours so i won't be able to leave if i feel bad.

867,2,"For three and a half months, my family kept it a secret that I was going on a nine-day vacation by plane, even though they know very well that such situations are extremely stressful for me and I hate them. I was scared to ask because I had a feeling something was coming, but at the same time I hoped I wasn't being dragged into it. I ended up finding out only when everything was already booked, without any chance to comment. My mom was torn between pressure from my stepfather and his daughter wanting to go and what she knew about me. She was basically backed into a corner and didn't have much choice. I understand that it wasn't easy for her, but I still feel betrayed and voiceless. This isn't supposed to be a ""vacation"" - it's psychological coercion for me. Im scared of everything."

I have been feeling very self critical and every single thing that I say, I scrutinize. And it's not like I can't listen to what I say because I have ears lol. How do I stop being so self judgmental?

874,2,"Sooooooo. I've been struggling to find a job and decided to apply to this cashier type position. Landed the job fine, but I absolutely hate it. It is super fast paced and will require constant social interaction under pressure. I know first days are rough and I do plan on going in tomorrow but the stress has been making me sick. Literally. I have been incredibly nauseous all day. 

The thing is, it was honestly way worse than I was expecting and usually it's the opposite, because usually anxiety lies to you yknow. The thing is this was actually worse than what my anxiety was telling me it was gonna be like last night. Even though my main coworkers were all lovely today, the job itself is just too heavy on social interaction and the atmosphere is horrible (I am intolerant to certain stimuli present such as blinding artificial lights). I can handle some level of social interaction but I just really feel like this job is not a good fit for me. I don't think I can do this 5 days a week.

Literally have a headache from crying and sleep deprivation rn. I have some stomach issues in general and I have no idea if my body is gonna survive. 

I'm genuinely thinking about quitting even though it's literally been a day. I'm going to try and go tomorrow my alarm is set but we'll see.

My question: Is it okay to quit after less than a week??? And if I do, how do I go about doing so? Should I just text the manager and onsite supervisor and say it isn’t a good fit? I'll feel so guilty because my team are actually good people."

881,2,"Hey everyone,

I have a cousin I used to be very close with since childhood. We were casual, frank, and spent a lot of time together—especially on Sundays when I’d visit his house regularly.

However, a few years ago, our parents had a major conflict and stopped talking, which meant we couldn’t meet in person anymore. Despite that, we stayed in touch through phone messages, casually chatting about our daily lives.

After about five years, our parents reconciled, and I finally saw him again at a family wedding. That’s when I noticed something strange: while he had been perfectly normal with me over texts, in person he avoided talking to me and wouldn’t make eye contact. Since then, this behavior has continued.

Whenever I visit his home, he either leaves the house or the room I’m in, making excuses, and doesn’t return until we leave. He avoids standing near me or even being in the same space. Over time, he has also stopped messaging me entirely.

This behavior really bothers me. I’ve started to feel like I did something wrong, even though I can’t figure out what. I can’t ask him directly because he’s changed his number and there hasn’t been any opportunity for a private conversation.

For those who have social anxiety or have dealt with it—could this be what’s happening with him? Or could it be something else? I’m genuinely confused and hurt by his avoidance, especially since we were once so close.

Would appreciate any insights."
882,2,"I’m not sure how to explain it as im already constantly non stop anxious and panicky , however , when I get really stressed or in a social situation that makes me anxious, I get this crazy sensation like my muscles in my head and neck literally contract and tighten up. Like I get so tense I thought I was going to pass out or have a stroke. Idk how else to explain it besides saying I think my muscles all get super tight and then my head is full of pressure. I’m assuming this is a fight or flight response. But it’s really ridiculous. I’m seeing my psychiatrist in the morning. Mind you, I still had this happen even with propranolol and clonazepam. Idk what to do, I can’t live like this anymore. I’m always in a state of panic and fear. "
883,2,"I know autism seems to be “trending” on social media, but I seem to relate to a lot of the points these posts bring up.

I’m 26F & didnt struggle w relationships in childhood. But in HS I had an onset of severe OCD & ive never been the same since. Social anxiety developed around the same time. 

Since then social interactions have felt so complicated to me. I’ll sweat, I’ll blank out and stutter, but more than anything i feel disconnected. I learned about the term masking and i relate so much. Every interaction feels like a performance. I even feel anxious with my mom. My best friend that ive had for years, ive never felt comfortable with her and it kills me, it feels like a lie. I hang out with her so much less now it feels like i cant handle it anymore. I try to make new friends but the anxiousness does not fade no matter how many times ive hung out with them.

The only person i feel okay with is my boyfriend. Even then sometimes I feel off with him. 

Ive been in therapy for years without any great progress. Ive brought up autism to my therapist but she says its unlikely.

I dont know what i need, maybe i need different style of therapy, maybe meds, maybe psychedelics i dont know.
I think im reaching a place of hopelessness i havent felt before. 
I feel lost and alone but ive felt that way for years and i dont know if i can take it anymore. "
884,2,Ive been very curious about relationships for a while now but I'm too anxious and insecure about my appearance to ever try making a conversation with a girl so I try my hardest to just do what I have to as quick as possible 
885,2,"You’re going to be okay. In fact, you are okay. 

I know you’re ruminating about what other people think about you right now. You might’ve called off of work today because your anxiety was so bad, you couldn’t get out of bed, and now you’re worried about going into work tomorrow to face everyone. You might’ve said what you thought was the wrong thing to a stranger, and now you’re ruminating about whether or not they think you’re weird. You might’ve stumbled over your words while ordering at a drive thru, and now you’re ruminating about whether or not everyone thinks you’re dumb because of it. 

I’m here to tell you that none of that is true, and none of it matters in any way. 

There was a study done where a makeup artist was hired to put fake scars on a woman’s face before a job interview. The woman would go into the interview and report back if she was treated differently because of a facial disfigurement or not. Before the woman went into the interview, the makeup artist told her that she needed to “make a few adjustments”. She then proceeded to remove the scar without her knowing. The woman came out of the interview really upset.  She claimed that the interviewer kept making snide comments about her face, and kept hinting at a disfigurement through hand gestures.

This really puts into perspective how powerful your mind really is. If you believe something to be true, your mind will search for evidence trying to prove your belief. Even if it’s 100% untrue in reality. No one thinks you’re embarrassing. No one thinks you’re weird. No one thinks you’re annoying. It’s all in your head. People are so self centered, 99% of the time they’re worried about the same things as you. I promise, no one cares about anything but themselves. Even if you did do something “embarrassing”, everyone will forget by tomorrow. Seriously take a second and try to think about a time when someone you barely knew did something really embarrassing and you constantly think about it and judge them for it. Can’t think of anything?

Try to calm down and realize that nothing is that serious. We could all be dead tomorrow and none of this would even matter. Take care of yourselves, and it’ll be (it is) okay :) "
886,2,"Hi

So social anxiety is sometimes a misdiagnosis for autism yes? But social anxiety can still be a part of one's autism.
My question is, for those who were misdiagnosed, what did the diagnosis change to how you deal with social anxiety? Is it a different outlook? Different techniques?

I'm asking bcs I think i might have autism, but i am not able to get diagnosed for a long time (long waiting lists, like years long). My social anxiety seems to be getting worse with time (i'm 25), and idk what to do about it anymore.
I see a therapist regularly and I've started exposure therapy, but I'm worried that I'm missing out on some advice that would be given to me if i were diagnosed with autism.

So what do you think? Does an autism diagnosis change how you deal with social anxiety? And if so, how?"
887,2,"I just tried this out. I dance in public act cringe do zesty TikTok dances the orange justice, do zesty stuff on purpose. Im actually bi and dont really come out I just do zesty stuff and make jokes then be subtle. I like women mostly thoughhh. I get called out on it as a joke but people still respect me more than when I try to fit in then I’m called weird. This is why acting like your weirdest self works so much lol. Ima probably try to do some weird ass pickup lines like YO SHOTTY WHERE MY HUUUUG AT. Sike aye what’s ur name? Lemme get ur number rq” lol. Or i might say “Im from I block breezy the third nah fr I’m michaelzowski straight as private school from the Lillie dillies. I could really be both for you if we were together.” It might work . I have inattentive adhd and the only way I can be extroverted is showing my kinky/ weird self to an extent. Also acting funny or corny on purpose may make people underestimate u which is a good thing but in jobs and stuff ima act normal and professional obv.also for people with ocd u should share ur funniest intrusive thoughts straight faces then laugh . It’s cringe but people don’t mind corny people. People much rather deal with a blatantly unhinged person than someone who seems to be hiding something. I’ve seen girls date literal nerdy e boys with crazy haircuts bc of this. "
888,2,"I have to do the absolutely worst group project ever. I have to work on a video presentation with 4 people I don't know and it's literally driving me insane. 
Being in a group project itself is already overwhelming enough for me cause I just can't be around people ever since I was a child. Ever since back then I avoided being around others to the point where I completely isolated myself for literal years. Now I'm in Uni and have to interact with people my age for the very first time again. This group project has to be recorded and uploaded but my issue is that I'm very insecure about the way I look and my voice. My voice was always sth people were confused about because I have a typical gay voice that I'm so ashamed of. There's no way I will be able to do this video presentation and watch it afterwards. How am I supposed to overcome two obstacles at once: 1) working in a group 2) recording myself talking?? I just can't wrap my head around it. 
But now comes the worst part: Each member of the group has to grade the other members based on their participation during the group project. The thing is, I'm unable to participate in any group activities. I'm so paranoid in group settings that I can't even attend real life meetings. This is just so unfair. People who struggle with socializing are always seen as lazy or unproductive but that's not the case at all. I'm just severely anxious which holds me back from participating in group activities. I have the feeling that my social anxiety is also ruining my grade this time. It robs me of all opportunities in life. I will always have a disadvantage and a handicap because of it. "
889,2,"Wanna see if anyone else has experienced this for all my socially anxious people in relationships. By myself I do alright in social events despite my anxiety because I know I can leave whenever I want and dont feel as much pressure. However, as someone who is beginning to commit more to a relationship with someone who is more outgoing and enjoys social outings I've found that I struggle much more both with the pressure of that role (being the partner of someone with lots of acquaintances and a higher social drive) and feeling more obligation to stay because my partner wants to socialize longer than I typically do. 

She is amazing and we are both quite fond of eachother but today we were talking about how she wishes she could take me to social events without me ending up feeling anxious. (I usually end up sitting somewhere on my phone or ""getting some air"" which bothers her because she would like to attend these events with me without me getting anxious. Im at a point in my life where I would rather face my anxiety than sit in my comfort zone but this is one piece of the puzzle that I've struggled with for a while. Any advice from my fellow social anxiety sufferers is quite welcome 

"
890,2,"sometimes I feel like I perceive time as taking longer than it really does in social situations. more specifically, I feel like it takes me forever to formulate an answer to someone. I'm not sure if it actually takes me an abnormally long time to answer or if it seems that way, because I run through so many options in my mind (sometimes seemingly all at once) before I finally answer. does anyone relate? anyone have any insights about this phenomenon?"
891,2,"I dont know if this is normal, but I feel like I am being left behind by everyone I once knew. My friends, my best friend, part of my family from my father side, cousins from both sides, even my favorite cousin who I used to spent all the time with, etc. I am anxious to text them bc last time I did they just left me on read, some dont even read it, or they just give it a like and nothing else and dont even answer what I asked. I am even doubting if they even liked me to begin with, and I was bothering them all this time. I stopped to think about this after seeing my best friend at my job, she told me she would text me after going to her sister's prom. She did not text me back, and after considering to reach out I did after a week. She answered and I told myself that she probably forgot bc she was occupied with work, but she texted me with just one text and didn't even use any stickers or emoji like we used to. I told myself it was the same thing, work. I asked questions, used fun stickers we used, etc, and waited for her to answer, the thing is that she never texted me back after that. This month I also saw a friend at a restaurant she is working in, she passed in front of me and I greeted her, but she just passed right by me. I felt so ashamed bc my family was also there watching, but she passed so close and I was loud enough and even said her name :("
892,2,"i suffer from unexplained fatigue despite all my blood tests are okay except vitamin d ,everytime i get outside home i return back very tired full of sweat ,dizzy.

could this fatigue is  in my head??."
893,2,"There are times when I would like to say something to someone who's not acting right or call someone out on their poor behavior but I know it's just going to escalate to this insane argument, nobody really takes responsibility and instead people just scream and yell and escalate things, you always hear stories in the news of people killing each other for the stupidest reasons and I'd rather not take the chance. But then I realize I need to deal with confrontation to get through life and it's so hard. "
894,2,"Hi I (23M) need some help talking to a girl. For background, I have literally no experience with girls besides 1 date I had a few months back. That date went horribly and absolutely nowhere. I was super awkward, quiet and extremely nervous the entire time. It ended pretty quickly. I couldn’t even be genuine and force a smile. I felt “scared” almost. I know they are human as well, but I pretty much feel like that with most new people I meet. I also am horrible at story telling as well, I go from topic to topic and always try to think of what to say next 

Flash forward to today, I have a crush on a girl that I really like and have asked a mutual to set me up if she’s interested. I believe she brushed it off when they asked her, but I have also never spoken to her before though. We will be attending the same event in about a week or so and the mutual said that they will think of something to help me out and potentially introduce us to each other. I want to shoot my shot at least once and if she’s truly not interested then leave it at that.  

Thing about me is that I am very quiet until I get to know you. Takes a long time to get comfortable. Not only that my social skills / introductions are horrible. I start stuttering , get a shaky voice , turn red easily and cannot hold eye  contact at all. The previous bad experience confirms this for me. I am pretty sure she likes more outgoing people from what I’ve seen. I have little to no expectations for this but every time I think about this I almost feel sick to my stomach and want to skip the event all together. I feel like I am older now and should suck it up but in the moment my body just doesn’t let me think rationally. I know I have social anxiety for sure and don’t want medicine or have time for therapy right now. 

Looking for advice on how to go about it / prep myself. I really want to make an attempt but I just know I will fail miserably and be embarrassed of my myself. Not even sure if we are in the same league to be honest. "
895,2,"I am wondering how do introverted boyfriends treat their girlfriends because I notice my boyfriend (22) hasn’t made any effort yet except giving his time hanging out with me at home but he always looked lazy whenever we do something else. I think I’m the only one giving more effort than him, like everything to make the relationship alive. (He’s currently looking for a job) So I was also thinking that maybe he’s just really an introvert who doesn’t know how to express himself well, but honestly he was outgoing when we first met for a month. And suddenly he became like this, seemingly uninterested or I’m just assuming things? we are now dating for almost 3 months. He still tell me he loves me and reassures me that he’ll be with me for a long term. Can someone please tell me what to do as well to reduce my anxiety or stressing myself over this that maybe my boyfriend is losing interest in me? "
896,2,"Ive always been quiet and as a kid i would space out to make time go by faster in school since i had no friends. It’s not like i’ve never had friends, but its always been hard for me to keep any. I get nervous when a get together is coming up, even if it’s with someone I’ve known. In public settings I fear everyone is looking at me and evaluating me. Everyone says Im very pretty and that may be why I feel the stares, but it scares me. Talking to a person one on one is terrifying to me as well. Even if it’s behind a screen, even my own mother. It’s the eye-contact, and the fear of not knowing what to say fast enough. Often though I have a pattern of getting close to a guy and only feeling comfortable with them. Why is it that I cling on like that? I feel unfixable. I’m so tired of this. Can someone help me find out what’s wrong?"
897,2,"I have so much social anxiety it’s unreal, like I just can’t do it, no matter how well I dress, how I take care of myself, I just don’t have it in me, I know part of the reason is that I’m still not in the best shape physically, but I know confidence matters more and I swear I think I’m losing my mind, I always have something planned inside my head that I’ll be able to approach them but I never do, and it’s really aggravating, I even thought I should just approach older women and even them I have a hard time approaching too

I’m really losing my mind"
898,2,"I have presentation on friday and its 3 mins and in front of like 45 people im so scared im actually gonna shit my pants😭 yall help plss give me some tips 

I'LL KEEP YALL UPDATED

UPDATE: IT WAS GOOD I WAS BIT SHAKING AND MY VOICE WAS SHAKY BUT IT WENT GOOD. IT WASNT EVEN AS BAD AS I THOUGHT. TY EVERYONE FOR THE TIPS <3 "
899,2,"Growing up in an Asian country, I often saw how qualities like ""leadership skills"" and ""strong communication"" were praised and encouraged during school.  
  
After entering the workforce, I continued to come across interview tips and articles that emphasize the importance of good interaction with the interviewer, praising candidates for their witty responses. Even when we’re fully capable of doing the job—sometimes even better than the more socially skilled ones—these stereotypes still make job hunting and workplace interactions more stressful for me.   
Sometimes when I act like a “normal” person, I overhear people talking negatively about those who don’t really socialize ( and it immediately sets off my anxiety, haha )  
  
I’ve been thinking a lot about how this world really needs a huge amount of tolerance, because everyone is just so different."
900,2,"I've been suffering with SAD a lot for ages now. I've liked a lot of other girls over that same period, but I never made a move or something like that, because I just felt too anxious.
Recently tho, I'm becoming more outgoing, and this girl has been giving strong signals that she liked me, until she practically confessed to me today. I just felt so shocked. Like a reality check. I never thought about myself as attractive, I actually really think otherwise, and I struggle with masculinity issues.
She's always been on my mind, but not really in that way. But I'm catching feelings for her.

But anxiety just prevents me from doing what I really wanna do.
It's telling me she doesn't really love me, she's shy aswell, and her self esteem is getting better, and I just feel like she's gonna use me like a tool. I'd consider myself a prime target for that, I catch feelings too easily.

Then I feel like our friends won't approve of this relationship.

I just want to have a normal relationship without having to worry about all of this.
I'm lucky to have this happen, I don't want to let it go like that."
901,2,"As far as I know, I do not have a diagnosed social anxiety disorder, but I guess I count as high functioning. That said, I tapped into the root of how mine and many of yours manifests: the ""sorry to bother you"" paradigm. Here's my story...

  
I don't feel like I belong anywhere. I'm trapped between fitting in and standing out, but I recently realized that I quietly seek the permission of others to invite me into a group setting. I scan for commonalities in presentation, voice, and perceived interest. I very often forego joining conversations because of a perceived lack of experience, age, race, lifestyle, etc. I have found myself waiting on the sidelines hoping to be seen, trying to ""play it cool"" and not bother anyone with what I have to say. 

  
I know where it came from; my first experiences being social with other people was that of rejection, embarrassment, and threats of exile, so to speak. My first friend was a jerk to me and would undermine my desires for his own. I've been pushed out of a literal circle of friends in middle school. I've been, what I call ""booed"" by groups for what I had to say. I loathed my existence in school and I never understood what the problem was. So from a young age (9-12), I figured my presence was either insignificant or even contemptuous. 

  
This has become a CORE belief, THE core belief I've centered my entire life around. This paradigm that I'm not welcome anywhere has stifled my social skills. I'm 26 years old now, and I realized that all the cope I'll say to myself about how i'm introverted, this particular group is this or that so I don't want to be a part of it, I don't like authority, is quietly ruining my life.

  
This is no way to live. All of the things I want to do and experience is on the other side of this paradigm. It's an outdated thought process and needs to be replaced with something a lot more empowering. I do believe it's possible to recover from trauma if you decide to step up to that plate enough times in the right way. Hope you all support my journey."
902,2,"Whether that's in your family, circle of friends, they'll eat you alive. Seriously. I used to have more faith in humanity but not anymore. People are assholes, and sometimes those are the ones closest to you. Showing low self-worth tends to make you a target."
903,2,Does anyone have any tips for social anxiety I have severe anxiety and hate public but I go out alot is there any tips I can have to help me over come my anxiety because people I don't know really scare me and it sucks because it's makes people call me weird and a loser for hiding my head in my hoodie who my fav older bro gave me even in 30 degree heat does anyone have any tips please I am super desperate 
904,2,"I'm graduating high school in a few weeks, I thought I'd be happy, but I feel like I've just wasted these 4 years, don't really have much friends or anything, I'm regretful but I know it's my fault. Should I just wait it out and disregard these feelings?"
905,2,"Today, I walked past a car. there were a handful of teen boys in there and they all stared at me while driving by while saying some swear I couldn't understand. I didn't know them, they didn't know me. I thought it's common sense that harassing strangers is the absolute worst but I guess not, does anyone have this happen to them as well??? i honestly looked totally normal too, nothing extraordinary about my clothes or anything...

Another instance of this bullshit is where a few years ago, I was waiting to cross the road when I saw 2 grown-ass men laughing at me and doing some mocking gestures while driving by. please tell me if this happens to everyone or am i really that ""weird"" or vulnerable-looking?
"
906,2,"people always tease me because of it and i really dont like it. this school year ive cried during every presentation i dont even know why i cry but my best guess is that i do so out of fear. I try not to but I always think that people are silently judging me or making fun of me and tears always fall. im just so scared to be out there I dont know how to explain it.i get so nervous. dont even know if im on the right subreddit to ask this question i just need help because im gonna have to present a project me and my friend worked on in a few days, maybe even tomorrow."
907,2,"People often try to comfort anxious people by saying ""don't worry so much about that thing you said or about making a fool of yourself because the truth is people are too busy thinking about themselves to be thinking about whatever you did.""  

But the problem isn't people thinking/caring about what I did, it's *being associated with* a particular thing. For example, if you're at a party being quiet and hanging out by the snack table all night, sure, nobody's going to care or think about it later, but they might form a quick judgment of you and association of you with being quiet and socially anxious when they DO think about you, or the next time they see you or when you come up in conversation."
908,2,"I was wondering if anyone relates to this. I will typically get really fatigued and start yawning just before attending parties/social gatherings where I don't know a lot of people. 

Even before an important conversation or  something else nerving wracking like getting a tooth filling. Does anyone here get this as a symptom of anxiety? Social or otherwise."
909,2,"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety 2 years ago now and it's been an interesting journey to say the least. I was such a confident young kid who couldn't care less what anyone thought of him and I honestly don't know where all of that changed. When I hit highschool I got a lot more quieter but I wasn't anxious to talk to people, hell I was still able to make friends easily. I did notice overtime that I got more nervous but I just thought it was more so to do with being nervous about school work and things of that nature. Before I knew it I struggled to talk to people, I'm good at covering it up but it doesn't mean that it's not eating me alive every second I have an interaction with someone. I've always been so confused on why and when it changed and the reason I'm making this post is to ask if anyone truly knows the answer to this and also if any of you are able to help me deal with social anxiety. I know it's way easier said than done but I've gone to therapy and that made it worse and its gotten in the way of my life for over a year now."
910,2,"(18) i know no one cares unless it's something to give in return, please please please don't say im ""too young"" and have a life a head of me because this is not how it works! First My english is shit my vocabulary is very limited and my speaking skills are those of kindergarten kids, second I have horrible horrible self-esteem it's to the point of wanting constant validation from strangers or i have the need for any possible attention and i hate that, i just wanna be normal.

 I don't know where to start im a big coward to even kill myself, I HAVE ZERO FUCKING FRIENDS no one checks on me, my mom has social anxiety and she passed it down on me, thank you k and i shouldn't rely on her for anything but can't even make a phone call, i developed something probably what i found on google is ibs and its cause was unhealthy food and bad anxiety, i don't have a job never applied for one and can't drive, can't raise my voice can't, can't earn my own money can't make my voice sound clear, can't feel ok about myself, can't go outside without feeling like the entire world is staring at me can't start a conversation can't think clearly can't focus, can't have ideas can't be normal, but WHO FUCKING CARES WHO THE FUCK CARES NO ONE CARES PEOPLE CARE ONLY ABOUT THEMSELVES AND WHO THEY LOVE IF ONE PERSON CARED A BIT FOR ME BUT NO ONE NO ONE NO ONE EVER EVER TRIED TO HELP ME OR SUPPORT ME IN ANYWAY. I STRONGLY CONVINCED MYSELF NO ONE GIVES A DAMN PEOPLE ARE FULL OF THEMSELVES."
911,2,"I’ve been dealing with social anxiety for majority of my life but it only got worse around 5 years ago. Since then the quality of my life got so much worse, it’s actually unbearable. I think I’ve lost the ability to normally function in society. I’m only able to do very few things, like go to school or go shopping but even those stuff fill me with so much anxiety. I’ve lost almost all my friends and I’m unable to make any new ones, which results in me spending all my free time at home. Even though I feel safe in my own space I can’t stand being there pretty much all the time. After all those years I’m just tired. I don’t feel alive, it only feels as if i’m just surviving every day. I went to therapy six months ago but it was useless. It was my third therapist. I thought that maybe if i’ll get help things will get better, but oh i was wrong. Nothing has gotten better for me. Today at uni i’ve heard people talking about going out, what fun they’ve had together, etc. and it honestly made me go spiral lol I truly wish i could also normally talk to people without being scared and overflowed with anxiety but it seems almost impossible. I truly do not think i’ll ever get better. I don’t know what to do anymore. It makes me so sad thinking of all those opportunities, all those friendships i’ve lost due to my sa. I truly cannot believe that this fear of people can have such power over me"
912,2,"Hi everyone, I prefer to write here rather than my main account to remain anonymous. I'm a master student (not in US, so it's a bit like 4th year of bachelor or 1st year of PhD) and I find socializing so stressful and even a bit boring.

It's been a problem for quite a long time from highschool that I foind it not easy to talk with people. Everytime I became super nervous for no reason and can't speak a single word. Besides this I believe I have acted not properly with people so they usually have negative opinion, even speak badly of me. I'm aware of this but I can't tell what's really wrong with me.

I have been seeing psychiatrists for solving it and we have made quite some progress. She suggested me find some real friends but it's still not easyfriends. Recently I tried to join a hiking activity with an acquittance and his acquittances, but my problem of being super nervous reappeared and I fucked up the whole day. I'm pretty sure these people would rather not see me again. It's s my bad but it's almost like I can do nothing about it.

Then I started to doubt if I really enjoy socializing and the answer is a solid no. In fact I realized that every time I was expecting myself to act properly in social activity, which gives too much stress. What's more, it's like I join the conversation with a goal to find a friend while I'm completely not interested in the topic. 
It turns out I'm not enjoying hiking and this explains why this hiking turned out to be a nightmare.

The psychiatrist told me I should talk more and join more activities as an exposure therapy, but now I feel like if it's not an efficient way to solve my problem. The thing is, when it comes to some topic I'm crazily interested in( for example in some academic activités at college), there's no chance for me to even stop talking and this might offend someone and I didn't really care until after the conversation. I feel like too much socializing is a bit meaningless and only brings more stress to destroy me.

For this reason, now I start to think that the exposure therapy with too much socializing is not really working. To make myself live and feel better, I'd rather stay home for weekend and only join some activities when I'm interested. It's not like a friend will appear for nothing, to find one I have to be patient and try not push myself too hard.

I'm writing this just to say them out. Tbh if I had a good friend I'd rather not share this with him/her :)
If you have read til here, sorry for your time and feel free to share your opinion or suggestions. Hope you have a nice day!"
913,2,"I can’t seem to enjoy anything , going to the gym , going on vacation, going on the cinema or restaurant because people are staring at me. Does anyone relate?"
914,2,"i’m panicking.  There is only 4 weeks left in the school year, yet i have no option.  (I’ve been homeschooled for about all of this school year. I only was able to do in person for a month this year. ) I got accepted into a charter school and i have to start this week as it’s the only way to secure my spot. I am so fucking scared. I’m a sophomore who goes into a new school at the last month, and as a sophomore?? Totally weird I know. I don’t know what to do. "
915,2,"Does anyone ever feel anxiety while walking down the street? For me the worst is when me and another person are on the sidewalk walking towards each other from opposite directions, I don't know what to do, where to look, how to walk, etc. Once I lock eyes with someone I don't really know what to do, so I just keep looking at them which makes it more awkward lol. I hate situations like those. Whenever I'm out in public I feel like everyone is staring at me. I'm so self conscious about my walk. I tend to just scroll through my phone (spotify not weather app lol) just to avoid eye contact, also because I have bad eyesight and don't wear glasses outside, on many occasions I said hi because I thought it's someone I knew turning out to be a random stranger, now I don't even try to look up anymore. Many friends will then be saying to me that I walked right past them without saying hi... sorry I'm too scared to look up lol. I don't know what to do with my hands when walking. Doesn't help either that my default face in public looks like I'm going to beat someone up, not that I would of course. My therapist says that it is a defence mechanism to scare away potential danger that I must have learned when I was younger from trauma. I don't want to look pissed off the whole time, I wanna look normal, walk casually along the street, even say hi to someone or smile, but my brain panics too much and won't let me..."
916,2,"
For 3 years, I've been having health issues with my nerves. I've been to doctors, but none of them have been helpful. Some days are fine, but some days are bad. And I usually hide the bad days from my wife because I'm worried about her getting sad or scared about what's happening to me.

But yesterday I opened up and told her the truth.

Not only did I feel relieved, I actually didn't feel alone. Weirdly enough I actually felt better even though nothing in my situation had changed. I'm proud that I didn't hold it in.

917,2,"Sometimes I have this odd ""imposter syndrome"" when it comes to my social anxiety. Like there are certain scenarios where I ""benefit"" from it in certain ways in interacting with the government and healthcare providers and stuff (things like doing stuff remote). But today I was reminded of how real it is.

I have a smart watch. And today a stranger from the government had to come over to take care of something with me. And I looked back at my heart rate.

My average, resting heart rate is about 70bpm.

When they first called and said they were coming in about an hour (I already knew in advance they probably would come today but not for sure) my heart rate, while I was just sitting at my desk, skyrocketed to 100-110.

Then when they actually rang the bell my heart rate skyrocketed to +130bpm. It peaked at 144bpm.

In other words, my heart rate nearly doubled despite me doing no exercise whatsoever.

I sometimes feel that ""imposter syndrome"" like I'm getting ""benefits"" I don't deserve since you can't see social anxiety. But moments like that where I can see it in black and white reflected on my smart watch are a good reminder of how real it is.

I hope I can get on propranolol though. It would be nice for this to improve. But it interacts with one of my antidepressants, so my GP said I should talk about it with my psychiatrist first. And my psychiatrist isn't available for the time being."
918,2,"I have always been quiet and afraid to communicate with others. Now, more than ever, honestly because I'm trying to change that. I have an image of the perfect version of myself, prettier but more importantly, social and funny. But, no matter what, I can't seem to replicate it. And I hate, really hate myself for that. I feel horrible whenever I'm alone but whenever I talk to people I feel like someone who isn't wanted or enjoyed to be around. And, when I don't I feel like a burden. I wanna be a person that's essential to the family. That if I were to leave I would be missed. For a weird reason, I get anxious more when I think about talking to people than when I actually do. Which completely ruins my chances of communicating. Even with the people closest to me from birth. And I find myself accommodating a lot of others because I think they deserve better. And for some random reason, no one EVER wants to be my friend. I think I try to be a good friend, even though I can't really call anyone that. I always text first, and they never try to continue the conversation, and I don't wanna look like I'm kissing their ass so I let the convo fade cause like obviously you don't want to talk to me so why should I keep you around me? If that makes sense. And that's just in summer, but during school at least, I'm around these ppl and I can have convos with them. It's like they switch up completely when I'm at school vs. when we aren't. They talk to me in school but they won't after and it's so confusing like I thought we were friends but you don't even wanna check up on me? Idk maybe I'm asking for too much but I just want someone to care for me. Most summers I'm alone cause of that. But this summer, my super social, super pretty, and WAY better company cousin is staying over at my house the whole year, and the contrast between us is debilitating. She's everything I want to be. (Ofc not everything, she has her downsides) Whenever she isn't here the house is quiet and when she is it's fun. And... I'm jealous. She had a better childhood back in Ethiopia where everyone loved her so so much and where she had many friends and people to talk and play with. Contrasted with me, I grew up glued to the TV, never outside, and always the quietest in the room. Maybe if I grew up more outside and unafraid to play, or if I had better friends and enjoyed school I would be way different. But I didn't, and I don't want to be stuck on that fact. So I'm on Reddit because there's nowhere else I can go. Any advice for this lonesome teen?"
919,2,"It could be at school, work, etc."
920,2,"Not actually sure if temporary is the right term, or if it's some type of trauma... 

I get really nervous and tense around strangers ever since last month.

I was in a place where the landlord was trying to illegally evict me and 7 other people, and I stood up for myself and was attacked. I turned around after conversing with him and and telling him I wouldn't take this and I would dig up his name and take him to civil court .

I turned around and I get smashed with something on the top of my head, it was a TV. I was fucked up dizzy, even still I was able to snag my spring loaded knife and stab him and get away.. but my tendons, neck and back are fucked up.

What I want help is why do I get social anxiety around everyone? Even women now, I can't meet strange women either I get extremely nervous. Idk if subconsciously it's because I'm injured and can't defend myself so I'm avoiding people or what. But it sucks. 

I got on anxiety meds again yesterday and just not only chatted up my manager, I smoked a joint with her...

Wtf is going on?"
921,2,I want to be social and hang out with people more and talk to new people but every time I do I just like freak out and don't because I just think about all the bad things they might be thinking about me  even though most of the time they probably aren't. I rejected a girl because I didn't want her to be me as I dont think i not very good looking evem though friends and other girls said I look fine and I also didn't want her to feel lonely or feel like I don't want to talk to her and meet up with her. I can put on a facade for a little bit and be really social and smart for a bit but then my social battery dies after about 10 minutes and everything goes wrong. How do I remedy this or fix it?
922,2,"I overthink CONSTANTLY. Especially as someone with OCD and social anxiety, the way I think is just inherently different than normal people. Like I genuinely can't comprehend how little others think/overthink it's actually crazy to me. This is the entire reason my confidence is awful, I can't speak in large groups, and genuinely struggle so much socially. I have the right things I would say in my mind but they come out extremely quiet and mumbly and usually no one hears it. Every single little thing, from what someone will think of me when I pass them in the grocery store, to talking in a group causes me to overthink tremendously. It's all these constant what if questions I ask myself and have to fight. I'm tired of everything being a battle. I just want to turn these thoughts off. "
923,2,"I (18F) have always had pretty severe social anxiety but by 16 I was beginning to forcing myself to be more outgoing and started to actually enjoy being a teenager.

But then, around this time last year, me and my friends were arranging a sleepover and a guy (who I atleast considered an associate i.e. We talked semi-regularly and had the same free periods together) goes through the list and asks who some people are in front of the group, since some of the people going weren't in our friend group. He then read out my name and ask my friends who I was, as I was sitting directly next to him, like I had done almost everyday for the last 6+ months. Everyone stared at me and I pretty much had to stop myself from crying on the spot. Since the sleepover was later that day I was battling to keep my feelings to myself for hours while the rest of my friends thought it was funny and lightly reassured me that it was 'just how he is'. I barely even remember what happened the rest of the night because of how upset I was. 

It's not even because of that friend not knowing who I was specifically but it's the concept of someone considering you so unimportant that you didn't even know their name after 6 months of knowing them. And the fact that I considered him important enough at that point in contrast because I even remember the names of people I barely talk to at all so it was so insane to me even after he apologised. I honestly haven't been able to let it go at all despite him not saying it maliciously. 

I'm 18 now and that one sentence was such a large blow to my self-esteem that it practically reversed all progress I'd made. I barely talk to people without them speaking to me first, I constantly feel unwelcomed and unwanted even if someone's being nice to me and I'm not close at all to many of my friends like I was before because of this as I always have this lingering feeling that they don't actually care if I'm there or not. Now that I'm going off to Uni in September I have no clue how to recover and make friends at somewhere completely new. I keep repeating that I just need to let it go but for some reason I just can't. 

It's funny how one thing that one person says can set you back that much I guess haha"
924,2,"I have to go to the library today to ask for something and I'm scared. How can such a small thing be so big for me, we'll most likely only exchange a couple words but even then it's too much. (⁠･ั⁠ω⁠･ั⁠)"
925,2,"Hey everyone, 
I'm sorry for the post, I'll be honest, this is the first time I've spotted this page, and I'm glad I have. I guess I'm looking for advice, or just some like minded peeps :) I've always known that I have anxiety/s of some kind, but because of other bigger personal problems, I've never tried to deal with them or look too closely at it, because 'what's the point in taking care of myself when I have x going on'.

I've had my one and only friend group for about 5 years, they've known about my anxieties and my self-depreciating side, they've had their problems with it, feeling like they've had to step around me or cater to me, it's caused Fallings out, but it wasn't something I realised was such a huge thing. 

That is, until one of those friends told me yesterday that they felt closer and more comfortable with a stranger we met on a holiday we've just gotten back from, than they have with me in the 5 years we've known each other, that because of my anxiety, and having to worry about me, that they have to go the extra step to include me in everything, they've never been able to get close, that my quietness is a big problem. I just don't know what to do, I'm pretty lost right now.

I'm fine online for the most part, just in person I find it really difficult to talk, it's easier one on one, but in a group, there's just no chance, my mind just goes completely blank, although I'd love to talk and join in on the banter, I just can't, the lights are on but nobodys home. And that infuriates me sometimes. So I just sit there, throwing in the ocassional 'oh yeah' and so on. 

I've been told that they're no longer comfortable spending time with me in person, online is fine - chatting and playing games, just not in person. When they're such a big member of the group, and we use their flat as a base for our meet ups, I just don't know what to do.

I guess I just wanted to ask if that sounds about right for social anxiety, I've never been a good talker, I was a late talker and always tended to stick to myself even when i was little, always avoided night clubs like the plague,  always did things worse when being watched. I want to use this to kick myself into taking better care of myself, partly for me, partly to prove to my friend that I can get better, to see if they'll accept me back. It's not the only reason they're avoiding me, but it's one of the main ones, i made some mistakes. I know that isn't healthy, I just don't have anyone else other than that group.

I'm sorry for posting, ive likely vented more than i shouldve here, im sorry., like I mentioned, I'm just trying to push myself to reach out more, to realise they're not the only friends I can have.

I'm not asking anyone to diagnose :) any help or suggestions are hugely appreciated, or to find some like minded people that won't take my quietness as a red flag, or a negative they need to be wary of. Even if its to chat in these comments for a bit, there's no pressure for anyone though. Even just posting this is a step in the right direction for me. Thank you sm for making it this far, it really does mean a lot, thank you beautiful stranger! 

Thank you! <3

926,2,"I have severe social anxiety and since I started going to college, it's affecting my academic, personal and social life alot. The issue is that I try to fit in, make useless jokes, make fun of others, smoke and vape and talk about useless things with class fellows just to feel less socially awkward and isolated. I am practicing silence and mindfulness to manage my depression and anxiety but since I joined college, I'm very stressed, even after coming back from college, I feel drained and less motivated to do anything. How can I develop enough self esteem to learn to say No and stay quiet and focus on lectures instead of making fun of myself and others and engaging in harmful things just to feel less socially awkward in college?"
927,2,"Disclaimer this paragraph is basically brain vomit . 

I'm 21 (F) and feeling stuck. My life feels stagnant, and I'm worried I'm failing myself. I'm falling behind, struggling to hold conversations and participate in basic interactions, and finding it hard to make friends in my twenties. Living where I do doesn't help. I’ve tried apps like Bumble BFF but Ive had no luck . I enjoy being alone but I hate feeling lonely. But god I'm so lonely, but I'm scared well for better phrasing I struggle to put myself out there. I've lost touch with my personality and feel like I'm weirding people out with my quietness. I overthink everything and self-isolate due to fear. I spend so much of my time  reading and maladaptive day dreaming . I hardly leave the house and when go to school. Its been like this for three years I'm scared I'm completely losing myself, and I feel like I'm slowly removing myself or excluding myself from the world. I don't want to do it, but I see myself falling into these habits unintentionally often self-sabotage and isolating . I'm becoming so anxious and antisocial. Everyday interactions scare me, and sometimes it's so bad I go mute. I'm desperate for help – I just don't know what I’m doing with myself. I haven’t always been this way that’s what I don’t understand, Ive been this way for so long I can’t even give myself and everyone a clear explanation for why I’m like this and I hate myself for it . I want to be myself again and I don’t know how . "
928,2,"When I was younger, and still now sometimes, I felt that I just didn't belong in this world. It always seemed so strange to me that everyone else behaved so naturally and normally in social situations meanwhile I felt like I was only posing as human. 
All my actions around other people never go on autopilot and I have to manually do and say things frantically trying my best not to seem weird to people. But it seemed like everyone else was made to be social and everything they did flowed and fit so easily into interactions and conversations.

Does anyone else feel that way? Its such a lonely feeling and I always thought I was the only one who thought like this."
929,2,"I've tried putting my self out there constantly but every time it ends up going terribly and the only thing I get out of it is something new to constantly look back and feel embarrassed about LIKE BROOOO I try participating in class but it goes terribly bc the teacher will just be like ""ok."" or literally just act uninterested like Idk how to explain it. I try joining school clubs but everything always goes terribly in them and im trying to do leadership roles but those go terribly too so im like freaking out bc I feel like my social anxiety will never get better bc Everytime I try to put myself out there it makes it worse. Like im trying to think about the fact that literally nobody cares and nobody will remember how I embarrassed myself but like still.....I'm trying to get a job this summer to hopefully make my social anxiety better like it's making me miss so many opportunities bc Everytime I do take an opportunity to volunteer or smth like I said, it goes very bad. I'm just trying to get rid of my social anxiety before high school ends bc they say high school are some of the best years of ur life and that it goes by super fast, but my social anxiety is not letting me enjoy it 😭 I've tried all types of exposure therapy I feel like 

Sorry this is written terribly "
930,2,i want to get a pedicure but i HATE feet and i hate when mine are touched. i’ve never had one and im so nervous. what shoes do i wear? what do i expect? i feel like i just need a run down to prepare myself. sorry this is so silly!!!!
931,2,This was a looooong weekend. Friday I went out with my bf to celebrate our anniversary. Saturday we went to a friend’s get together. Sunday we went out with different friends. It was a lot of socializing and I was probably anxious as I normally am. BUT THE ANXIETY AFTERWARDS is strongggg. It’s almost worst then the anxiety leading up to the social events. I keep replaying everything in my head and convincing myself that no one wanted me there. I cannot stop thinking of every reason why these people would never want to see me again and that they just felt bad for me. Anyone else?
932,2,"My social anxiety has always been so bad that I couldn't even talk to people online, let alone IRL. Coop games are my biggest fear in this world, even if they have nice community. Have you experienced something like that? Got put on medication this year (including Lyrica), but it seems that it's just built in my brain at this point."
933,2,"My most feared question is when someone asks me ""what are you doing?"" This scares me because I truly don't have an answer to that question, let alone a answer I'm proud of. I'm currently 19 turning 20 in October and I've honestly wasted my last year and a half since graduating from highschool. 1st year after graduating I literally did nothing. I hungout with friends and that's it, I couldn't cope with my soical anxiety and still can't to this day. Then earlier this year I got a job for a little while until I had spinal surgery which I'm currently still recovering from. Every time I see my family or friends I get the same question and I'm sick of being asked it. It's not on them but it's annoying because I'm ashamed of where I'm at right now and feel like a failure who is falling behind. I had a plan to go to uni and I still am wanting to do that but with how my recovery is going I'm only going to be able to do that next year when I'm 20! I'm eager to get a job but I really want to get one where there's little to no social interactions which seems impossible to find and I don't know how to tell anyone that."
934,2,"You start texting a girl. You thought she wouldn’t even reply because she’s way too hot and 100% your type, but she replies. You find out you have similar interests, goals, views on life, humor, etc. Over time, you both start liking each other a lot.

You begin thinking about spending your life with this girl, but unfortunately, you have some insecurities that start creeping in. You tell yourself there's no way she could really want something more with a guy like you. You toy with the idea of asking her out, but you don’t.

Eventually, she asks you out. But because of those insecurities, you make excuses. You worry you'll embarrass yourself if you meet her in person, or that she’ll notice that one thing about your looks that you can’t stand, and reject you. She asks you again, two or three more times. And then she stops.

She gives up and moves on.

Later, you see her with another guy, and that’s when it hits you.. you lost a chance with someone amazing because of your own self doubt. And now, years later, you still regret never even trying."
935,2,"Hello everyone I'm 24 years old. I have social anxiety I want to make friends but I don't socialize and I can't talk to strangers. I want to have a relationship but I'm scared approaching anyone. I wanted to improve myself so I'm making this post. Drop your suggestion what shall be done to overcome this problem.
"
936,2,"I’m new to this sub-Reddit but the first time I stumbled across a post here I felt as if I could have wrote that post word for word. For context I’m a 20M in college. I definitely feel like I have moderate social anxiety but at the same time I don’t 100% relate to every post on here. for example, I can go to the gym by myself and work out completely fine BUT the moment I have to speak with anyone at the gym is where my social anxiety kicks in. I have trouble looking at people in the eyes when I talk even if they are family or close friends . I definitely get that feeling of fight or flight whenever I’m in social situations with strangers like in the beginning of the school year where we have to introduce ourselves to our classmates. With that being said, I’ve also made very close friends throughout my life and there were points in my life where I was somewhat out going and actually interested in people to the point where I would talk to strangers just to learn more about them. I feel as if my social anxiety has gotten worse and worse throughout the years though and I believe it’s because I started talking to new people / strangers  less and less … I want to be able to hold a convo with a stranger and actually look at them in the eyes , I have missed so many opportunities to “have fun” and “experience what it’s like the a teenager” because of my anxiety… I truly just hope I can turn my life around because after reading some of these posts I’ve realized that if you don’t regulate or try and fight back against your S.A , it WILL get worse but I’ve also done enough research to know that if you do fight back and genuinely try to get better that there’s a chance it will get better. Thanks for reading… I don’t think I’ve ever been to apart of the internet I’ve related to this much ever."

To anyone who doesn’t have the energy to see it, I’ll give you a recap. The girl there basically talks about how social anxiety isn’t rooted in anxiety but actually in shame. That whoever has social anxiety, it’s because they’re ashamed of they are and they’re scared of people realizing how “awful” they are.

When she said that, it really hit home. I had a time where I was more confident in myself and felt a lot more comfortable and that’s when my anxiety really went down. I’m now in a place where I’m really ashamed and it’s really hard for me to talk to others because of it."
938,2,"I am with my boyfriend at his university, with his friend group, which is really large. I really feel uncomfortable. I can’t talk, I think that I am taking up space and prefer to leave them alone by sitting in a corner. idk what to do, I just want to be seen as funny, confident, but I am not. I want to be able to talk, I really do, but it really is difficult. can someone help? "
