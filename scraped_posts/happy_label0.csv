1,0,"This might be a common experience, but there's always more to it:

I didn't expect to live this long. I come from a rough childhood with little support and a fragmented family. Being able to say I've lived this long and accomplished something worthwhile with that time above ground brings me to tears. I'm grateful my parents got to experience convocation. They deserve it far more than me, and they are the only reason i got this far. I am merely a manifestation of their effort and commitment to having a child. Neither got to have their own education and have struggled along in life to support me. Now it's my turn to help them. I won't rest until they have retirement funds saved and ready for them. That's the least I could do to repay them for their sacrifices.

I figured I should share my brief little story to maybe help anyone else out there wondering if there's a light at the end of the tunnel, after childhood trauma, generational trauma, and strife. It won't just be handed to you, but that light is always waiting for you to dig deep, have some grit, and get after what you want in life. Having a ""rub some dirt on it and move forward"" attitude is a must when life keeps kicking you down. It sucks and isn't fair, but you have so much potential that you don’tneed the world to be fair to have success in life, and more importantly, your potential is potential for many others to have happy and full lives. If you are depressed, struggling, and tired, know that you can have your moment of glory in the sun, too. Life is waiting for you, so get after it."

4,0,"* I took my son to a new barber today, this guy was so cool. I asked if we could stop when it looked like my son had a mullet so we could prank my wife. He was totally on board. Even took the cape off him and said he'd take the picture! My gorgeous wife fell for it and messaged instantly! Worth it!
* I got two really nice messages today from the Rotary members, one was an email saying how happy they are with the effort I am putting in and the other was a Google Review. She went above and beyond. I was so overjoyed. I thought I was just doing the right thing.
* When I showed my friends they instantly thought there was sarcasm in the email and had my back. I had to explain that it was sincere and they apologised. But I loved the fact they had my back right away, no mucking around. Just on my side instantly."

8,0,"I follow this instagram influencer, I have been for over 8 years! She is a really cool person and I have always admired her and her business sense. I work at a movie theater cleaning theaters. I saw this family walk out of a How to Train your Dragon showing and recognized her immedietely! I said Hi, of course she was there with her husband and kids, including her one year old daughter. I just said  brief Hi and told her who I was, when I said my username she knew who I was instantly! I said something like ""It is nice to actually meet you in the flesh!"". I then said ""Goodnight"". Her daughter said ""Bye"" to me! 

Me and her then had a cool conversation over Instagram! 

It is honestly really nice to meet someone in person like that. I didnt think I would ever meet her in person really. She is even more beautiful in the flesh TBH! After that I went home and had a big smile on my face! I hope me and her can meet each other again in the future!  "

Initially, I wasn’t sure if the medicines would help and was afraid something terrible would happen to me. But look at me I am still here! Feeling so much better than I did then and you can recover and feel better too. Even if it won’t be immediate I promise you will make it.

Hopefully this is an okay post here! I just feel probably the happiest I’ve been in awhile!"

16,0,"At the start of the year I was in full burn out mode, quit my job, uprooted my life and left everything to travel. I am now mentally healthy for the first time in my life and a few months ago I signed up for a free college course to become a mental health first aider. I also started editing a book I had written for fun years ago as I now had the time. 

Well today I received two emails, one telling me I had passed the first third of my online course. And the second was from a publisher wanting to sign me as an author and publish my book.

Two days ago, after my last class, a guy who I had known for years kissed me (after very sweetly asking if I was single and for my consent), and now we have a date planned for sometime next week.

The future is so so scary and uncertain, but it’s so so bright, and I can’t wait to see what unfolds next. I can’t wait to live some more."

The weather was nice, the coffee that I got from the place close to my work was amazing and even the work itself wasn’t a mess. I even had time to unwind after work with some music and a couple rounds on this chill casino that I play sometimes (rollingriches) and it's not even about winning it's just part of the vibe. It wasn’t a “big day” by any means, but for once nothing went wrong and that felt amazing. I forgot how good it is to just exist without stress for a little while!"

22,0,"I love spoiling my boyfriend so much it's genuinely one of my favourite things ever. There is nothing I love more than seeing the smile on his face when he sees that I've gotten him something nice or made him something sweet.

Yesterday I was meeting him from his work, and since I got paid the night before decided to treat him. I got him his favourite sweets, and some other sweeties I thought he might like, and some small gifts like some amibos, Lego flowers, a Nintendo gift card and a few other things that I knew he'd like and quickly assembled them in a cute little bag like a minute before I met him. He was so surprised and blushing and smiling so hard, he looked so cute, I love his smile so much it's genuinely the cutest thing I've ever seen. I then took him out to lunch and he definitely enjoyed it haha. 

I got a job recently, so I plan on doing something big like this once a month when I get paid, and obviously smaller things throughout the month. 

I'm trying my best to study as hard as I can so I can get a good job too, I'd love to be a breadwinner for a house, specifically because I want to be able to give my boyfriend the comfiest and loveliest life I possibly can because he deserves it. He's such a sweet person, and so caring. He'll sit up with me all night if I'm sad, if he sees I'm in pain he is instantly looking for pain killers for me and trying to figure out if there's anything else he can do to ease it. He remembers everything I say, and every action be dose feels so meaningful and full of love. He is genuinely the light of my life, and I'm so grateful that I get to spoil him the way he deserves. Nothing makes me happier than seeing him happy 🩷"
23,0,"We became friends online though TikTok when I found him posting video online as Slick Skills. He’d post random drawing vids but eventually started drawing people to get better at drawing and once he thought he was “okay” he starting giving out drawings to people since he’d rather the person that was drawn have it instead of himself.

After some positive reactions from people I told him to start filming it as people like myself would love to see the reaction and eventually he started getting some hits! You’re welcome Max💅

Since he was gaining thousands of people online he made the decision to do it as living but unfortunately wasn’t able to maintain it due to there being no creator fund in Canada and he had to rely on commissions which took a lot of time. He still makes videos on occasion but I really wish he’d get back into it as I know he loves doing it.

I miss the videos like this and I thought I’d share them here to see if I can get him back into it if more people want him back at it. I know it does come down to $ in the end as all of us have bills to pay but maybe people here will check out his shop or maybe some brands or media companies will reach out to him for some paid work 🤷‍♀️

Love you Max. Keep being the wholesome dude you are😘"
24,0,"It’s a little early as it’s only day one but I have been prescribed modafinil and I felt great all day long! I’ve always had issues getting up in the morning and moving very slowly and feeling horribly for years I dealt with it. I’m 40 now and I decided to go to the doctor about it. They did a sleep study and turned out I had pretty bad sleep apnea symptoms. I don’t have that many events, but my oxygen levels go down very low. I initially got me a CPAP machine and my symptoms got so much worse I was prescribed modafinil. I did like other people on Reddit suggested and took it first thing on my first alarm ring about 15 minutes later I was ready to go getting up to get in the shower. It was like a new me! I don’t drink caffeine because it makes me way too wired, but this was nothing like that. Just alert and ready to conquer the day. I hope it continues to work like this because this was amazing today! I hope all of yall out there are doing well!"
25,0,"Almost two years ago I recieved the job offer of my dreams, a company that wanted to hire me for a job in Australia, and actually pay for me to move there (from California) and sponsor my visa. 

At the end of may, the contract we were hired for (as full time employees) didn't renew, and the group of 5 of us were given ""at risk"" notices and told the company would attempt to re-deploy us elsewhere in the company, and if that didn't happen by the end of June, we'd be made redundant (laid off) and they would only pay for a plane ticket back to the United States.

Overnight I got a letter from HR saying that I would be placed within a new team in the company. My pay remains the same, and the job fits my skills beautifully. Even better, I don't start this new position until 1 July, so I have the rest of June as effectively a free vacation (with the caveat that we just need to 'make yourselves available for potential meetings'). It's a huge relief to know that my Temporary Residency path will continue uninterrupted, and come February 2026, the company has committed to filing for my Permanent Residency. "
26,0,"I’ve been an aunty since I was born (I’m 21 and the youngest out of a lot of siblings, they’ve had kids before I was even conceived-long story) but with my other nieces and nephews I never had that much of a connection or relationship with them. With my great nephews I did, but then when my niece had to move our relationship fell. 

My best friend had a kid this year, he’s a couple months old and they told me by saying that I’ll be an aunty. Best way to announce a pregnancy tbh. I was able to visit them in the hospital when he was born (on my birthday of all days too!) and i immediately fell in love. Since then ive been there with them for a lot of things, helped out with their move when they had to go back to their parents, helped with the newborn stage etc. they told me over and over I never had to do any of that, but I told them that I didn’t take on the aunty role lightly. I also told my best friend when we found she was pregnant and scared, that I’d be there for her through every step and hardship. 

She’s finally been able to see that, and is taking more of my help. Which I see is helping her overall, her and her bf was so overtired and stressed with a lot of things. Lately they’ve been leaving their baby with me for a couple of hours after work so they can go do things on their own together. Before they took turns on staying with baby, but now that he’s older and sleeping more he’s able to stay at my house. 

This is the thing that makes me the most happiest (sure sharing a bday is the best thing ever to happen but anyway) my nephew was able to sleep easily and deeply at my house while we hung out, something he had trouble with cause he was used to going to bed at home. Lately I’ve adapted the extra room in my house as a baby room, it makes me very happy that he’s able to sleep well here and that I’m able to have enough room to have him in away from all the hussle and bussling. 

My best friends left their swing here, cause they’ve never used it at their house and he sleeps well in it here, it’s not for long either. He also has a bed, a white noise machine and recently I added in fairy lights so he doesn’t wake up in complete darkness. 

I love that they feel comfortable enough to leave their baby with me, im so happy overall with all this. I’ve never been so involved with my nephews/nieces so this has been so nice for me. I just find it crazy that I feel more of a relationship with a 3 month baby than my other nephews and nieces, some older, younger or same age"

I thought that I've tossed it away, but turns out it was just hiding in a drawer that I never really open, but I was searching for the left headphone that I wasn't able to find and idk why my brain told me to look there lol. I was already having a chill afternoon like I was playing a few relaxing rounds on grizzlysquest while cleaning and this random rediscovery just made my whole day! The best thing was that it was in a very good condition so it just needs a proper wash and I'll be able to wear it again! And it still fits perfectly :D"

32,0,"No dramatic story here—just one of those small, beautiful moments that sneak up on you.  
I was sitting on a park bench, taking a breather from a rough week, when I saw this older gentleman sitting next to a young boy (maybe 6 or 7). They didn’t seem to be related. The boy was struggling with folding a paper airplane, and the man offered to help.

What followed was this incredibly sweet, patient lesson in paper airplane engineering. The boy listened so intently, and when they finally threw the plane together… it *soared*. They both cheered like they’d just won a trophy.

The man gave the kid a high five and walked away with a smile. No phone, no rush—just pure human connection. It reminded me that there’s still so much quiet goodness in the world.

Anyway, just wanted to share that. Hope someone else needed that reminder too. "

Made my final student loan payment this morning ($47,000 total nightmare officially DONE) and decided to celebrate by going to this bougie coffee place I've been walking past for years but never felt like I could afford  
  
Ordered their fancy signature latte ($8 which used to feel criminal but today felt like freedom lmao) and when the barista handed it over she'd made this perfect little heart in the foam. Told her it was my ""debt freedom celebration coffee"" and she got so excited and congratulated me 💕  
  
I'm sitting here sipping this overpriced but absolutely delicious coffee, watching people walk by, and just feeling so freaking grateful. Like yeah it took 6 years of ramen dinners and skipping nights out but I actually did it?? The best part: Checked my bank account and for the first time in forever that $340/month is just... mine now. Already planning to put some toward savings, some of few sports parlays on Stake and half toward actually living like a human instead of a broke college student at 28 😂  
  
Nothing groundbreaking happened today but somehow everything feels different. Even bought name brand groceries earlier without calculating the per-unit cost and it felt absolutely wild lmao

35,0,"I’m 17, just graduated high school, and I have never felt so grateful for my family.

I have friends, but ever since we graduated high school 2 weeks ago, they never usually hang out with me unless I’m the one who invites first. Usually this makes me pretty upset, seeing all of them hang out without me, but my younger brother is always there and willing to hang out with me, whether we go eat trash food or we go shopping, we always have a ton of fun just laughing about random things. My other brother (they’re twins) spends the majority of his time with his friends, but whenever the three of us are together, we laugh so much about childhood memories we shared together.

I also love my mom a lot. She’s basically my best friend, not in a way that she’s irresponsible and let’s me do whatever I want, but in a way that she’s always helping me out, we go shopping together, we love crafting stuff, watching the same TV shows, etc. I love hanging out with my mom. We have recently started planning and buying stuff for my 18th bday party, and while she was at work, she FaceTimed me while I was shopping for my party supplies and I felt so happy.

My dad is a little more shy and reserved, but he’s also so funny and always makes my family laugh. He works so hard, I think he wakes up around 3/4 AM to get to work at 5am and doesn’t get back home until 4pm, and even then, he works hard around the house fixing and building stuff that my mom needs or saw on the internet. Sometimes I feel bad because it seems like he can never rest properly, but every time he does get the chance to rest, he rather gets up and starts doing some other stuff instead.

I’m so happy I’m choosing to stay home for college.
I know a lot of people say they got really lonely while commuting to college, and for a bit, I was bummed that I wasn’t going to experience “the college life”, but I think a bit more and I realize I’m so happy I get to see my family every day and have my parents’ home cooked meals and I get to hang out with my brothers so often. 
I may not have many good friends, but I love having my family and I can’t imagine my life without them :3"

The cinema was mostly empty, but there a few people in there.

It took ages and I felt guilty that he’d driven up several hours to visit and we had to work on my project rather than having a chilled weekend. I’ve been struggling recently with my mental health and had fallen behind. Not only did he insist we go for the second day so I could get more data, but got involved himself and took the time to look up different species and download identification apps and told me to not apologise because it didn’t matter a bit what we were doing, he just loved spending time with me ❤️ Ended up having so much fun, feeling more confident with my project, and feel very in love and lucky to have such a supportive partner.

39,0,"I landed in California with nothing but a suitcase, a little cash, and the kind of courage that doesn’t come from safety—but from survival. I didn’t have a home. Not a bedroom. Not a couch. Just concrete and air, and for once, that felt like enough.

Because I was finally free.

I had no plan. No one to lean on. No promise of comfort.
But I had me.
And for the first time in a long time, that was more than enough.

I chased my dream like I was running out of time—
because I was.
Running out of time to keep pretending I didn’t care.
Running out of time to let the fear keep winning.
Running out of time to not become the woman I always knew I was meant to be.

So I modeled.
I showed up to castings in worn-out sneakers and oversized hope.
I did shoots in alleyways, back lots, and borrowed gowns.
I walked Los Angeles Fashion Week.
And nobody knew I was sleeping outside that night.
But I walked like I lived in a penthouse.

And in a way, I did.
Because I lived in a dream so high up, not even rock bottom could touch it.

⸻

Even now, I look back and wonder how I made it.
How I didn’t fold under the pressure.
How I didn’t sink beneath the shame.
How I didn’t give in to the voices that told me “you’ll never.”

But I did.
I became.
I rose.
I walked.

I was homeless.
But I was never without purpose.
And even if the world tried to ignore me,
even if the runway lights never caught the truth,
I knew who I was becoming.

And I wouldn’t trade that girl—
that dusty, glowing, fearless, forgotten, powerful, faithful girl—
for anything.

Because she is me.
And I am still walking.

41,0,"I have been on a journey with my psychiatrist of almost two decades, doing daily art therapy journaling. We analyse my artwork weekly on Thursdays. At the moment, a lot of my pieces have overarching “happy” themes and I wanted to share them with you - because I didn’t just make them for myself. 

I made them to inspire myself, to remind myself where I’ve been and also to help others see the wonderful things in life. 

I’ve been documenting my process online, and so far it has been an extremely rewarding process. The feedback I’ve received so far has been so positive and I am so grateful. 

I hope that these pieces of art bring you some happiness! "
42,0,"I love making her smile.

My wife is the most endearing person I know.  She never hesitates to make me feel good about myself, even though she herself has dealt with a lot of medical issues and trauma from her past that you think would impede the sympathetic side of her.

Since the day I met her, I live to see this woman smile.  She didn't have a privileged childhood and had to sacrifice a lot to get to where she is now.  Meanwhile, I grew up having nearly everything done for me.  She's helped me discover that doing things not out of necessity, but love, is an incredibly rewarding experience.

On my days off, I clean the house for her, make her dinners, and always welcome her to a home she can feel comfortable in because she deserves every second of joy I am able to provide her with.  The level of pride and contentment that washes over me when she hugs me and tells me, ""thank you"" is immeasurable and can never be taken away from me.

I'm so thankful to have such a strong, loving bond with someone that allows me to not only be a better person, but to have the drive give her the life I know she deserves.  She makes every day worth waking up for."
43,0,"I’ve never been in a position to treat my parents to anything growing up cuz they were always the ones covering everything even when things were tight. Last weekend, for the first time in my life, I told them not to worry about the bill. It wasn’t anything super fancy, but it was special. I’d had a bit of extra cash from a lucky night on jackpot city and I figured there was no better way to use it. It felt way better to spend it on them than anything else I could’ve bought for myself. They smiled the entire time and I'll never forget their faces when I told them I'll take care of it."
44,0,"Went to my first book club today!! I love to read, and since graduating high school last year I’ve really struggled with meeting other people and being social. I was really nervous, especially since we read a book that is usually out of my comfort zone (The Teacher by Frieda McFadden), but it was so much fun! I loved talking to other people, and I loved that I read something I would normally not pick up. So grateful for this experience and I’m so excited to go again!"
45,0,"I've had a couple of serious secondary health conditions and ongoing symptoms for the last 25 years due to undiagnosed celiac disease. Didn't have health insurance when it all started, but no doctor I've seen since has been able to tell me what the problem was. Well, I finally figured it out myself (with help from r/celiac and other online resources that weren't available to me back then) and thankfully it's something I can manage on my own. 

I'm coming up on one year of being gluten free now, and I actually feel like a functional person again. I really didn't know if I ever would 🥲. There's still room for improvement, but it's an incredible relief to feel such a vast difference. I'm especially grateful to have energy again. 

I'm working hard on getting stronger (I'm also recovering from a repetitive strain injury, that my condition likely predisposed me to) and eating healthy. I'm getting my house back in order, working on home improvement projects, and doing my hobbies again. I look forward to each day now knowing that I can accomplish what I need to, and also what I want to. And I'm motivated to make the most of every day.

It's been a long time since I've felt hopeful, let alone satisfied with my life. And rather suddenly it feels like my shackles have fallen away, and the world is my oyster 🥹

I'm so happy to feel alive again 😊

Thanks for listening ❤️

46,0,"I worked as a janitor for a year before I started pipelining, and I was 130 lbs. I couldn't lift more than 170 lbs without extreme struggling. Today, I am 180 lbs. Today, I lifted a 9 meter piece of pipe off of the pipe rack, and I didn't realize how heavy it was until the superintendent said, ""Oooh, you're strong. God damn."" It was written that it was 10.25 lbs per foot on the pipe.

9 meters x 3.281 = 29.5 feet.

29.5 feet x 10.25 lbs = 302.375 lbs.

I lifted 302.375 lbs with relative ease, multiple times today. I am so proud of myself for the work I've done, the work ethic I've gained, and the absolute unit I've become. 

Keep working on yourself, keep your heads up and never give up. You'll get there!"
47,0,"After I lost my right leg, shortly after my divorce, I had convinced myself that I was never going to be whole again. (Who would want a wheelchair bound, ex-alcoholic, 30 something, divorcee with a bad liver and a broken heart?)

I had all but given up hope that I would ever be loved in the way I love. Then she came into my life (via TikTok message 😅), and despite living in different states, I found the girl of my dreams. It's now been over a year of traveling back and forth and across the country to spend time together. 

She makes me a better man. She repaired a heart shattered into a million pieces. How lucky can a guy get?"

54,0,Tomorrow is my Birthday!! I will be officially 40 years old!! I know it’s strange but I am really excited about it. Tomorrow I’m going to take the day off and do whatever I want. Right now I feel really good about myself. It does feel a little odd to know I’m 40 but not in a bad way.
55,0,"I feel very happy even though I am poor. I am probably the poorest I have ever been.

I even didn't have the money to buy rice last days so I had to just not eat. And I don't care. I know it's temporary. Pain is mandatory, but suffering isn't.

I'm gonna move back to my mom's soon. This was something I couldn't ever see myself doing. It felt shameful few years back. And now I am even happy to do so.

I came to another country 2 years and a half ago for a relationship that was the best of my life. It ended last summer. Since then I was a bit lost, I lost 2 jobs, I got really sick. It was a rough patch. Not as rough as a few years back when I was deep into depression and wanted to quit all this out of suffering. But still, I had to work a new job, was in a country I'm not really fond of, lost the sense of meaning my relationship gave me.

But then listening to Alan Watts and taking shrooms 4 months ago completely cured any small area of darkness inside my self. It's not a magic pill. I don't even know why this time out of the 3 times I took it it had such an intense and positive effect on me.

Now I have 0 sense of meaning in life. Not that it's a bad thing. More that it's miraculous that me, a collection of billions of small ""spheres"", is just moving and somehow experiencing all those emotions and thoughts. It has 0 meaning other than the one I want to put into it. It's a game. A wonderful intricate and complex game.

I don't give a f*ck about money, status, politics, religion, or any thing. I am of course very lucky and privileged to have been born in Europe with an absurd amount of material abundance. And I feel so grateful for everything that we usually take for granted. 

For the last 4 months, I've never felt this free, this happy, this light. I also don't fear death at all anymore, or loss, or anything sad. I also never have been this much in a problematic financial situation. For some reason, because now I see money as something so unreal and akin to human psyche, why should I stress about it? Of course, the body can be stressed by a lack of food and shelter. But your mind can't. And I can never explain it quite well to people. Life is just so great. 

Every time I'm thinking that people might think I'm in denial of reality or something. But the thing is, I just can't explain how I am feeling. People just don't understand how happy I am. 

I just feel like this is all an illusion and a big game we play all the time. And it's fine. It's fine to believe in the drama, because it's fun. But it's not real. Nothing is real. And it's just absolutely OK. 

There is nowhere to run, nothing to escape from, nothing to attain. If you believe there is, it's just a story you make up in your mind. And it's absolutely OK to believe in it. 

I don't know how to explain. I just feel happy. Now I'm definitely an outcast I guess lol. But yeah... it's great.

I only wish everyone happiness and an end to their own suffering.

EDIT: It's just crazy to see how 5 years in life can go from deep depression to completely happy. Even last 2 years of my life were the greatest ever, and it's only going up. I'm 27. Can't wait"

57,0,"We were playing a two player video game together earlier today and the game asked for the player's pronouns. I am comfortable with they/them and he/him pronouns equally but I chose they/them because in my native language there are no neutral pronouns and every word is gendered so I really wanted to enjoy the rare moments of being able to use these pronouns. At some point we had to stop playing and the game reset, and many (around 6) hours later, he remembered and chose my settings by himself!!! I felt really seen and understood and it really felt like he doesn't just see me as eiter just a man because I only use he/him pronouns in our language, or a woman for being afab. Anyways I am really happy and thankful my partner is so sweet and understanding "

61,0,"Alongside my therapist of almost two decades, I am on a creative journey, documenting my art therapy journaling process on TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest and Instagram.

I film and post making each piece from start to finish, and do a voiceover with my journal entries. 

Each Thursday, my psychiatrist and I go over my art therapy pieces and analyse and dissect them. It has been a hard process but it has been extremely rewarding and therapeutic. 

Between the ages of 18-24 I was hospitalised due to an eating disorder and I did *a lot* of art therapy during that time, and I also have a background in visual communication. 

If you’d like to follow along on my journey, I will leave links in the comments. I hope that your day is as wonderful as you are. "

He's been saving up from his part time job at the grocery store but kept having to dip into his savings for other stuff. Anyway, I told him I needed help setting up ""my new computer"" in his room. He was confused but helped me carry all the boxes upstairs. When we got everything unboxed and I told him it was actually his and he just stared at it for like 10 seconds in complete silence. Then he started crying. He kept saying ""are you serious?"" and ""I can't believe this is real."" I had a bit of extra cash from a lucky streak on jackpotcity over the weekend before (nothing wild just enough to finally justify going for it). He's been playing non stop for three days now and keeps texting me screenshots of games running on ultra settings (ryzen gives crazy fps I have to say).

68,0,"My mom has been working two jobs to support my younger siblings and never complains, but I know money's been tight lately. She always puts everyone else first and never spends anything on herself.  
I ended up with a bit of extra cash this week after the stars alligned on grizzlysquest lol and instead of blowing it on something stupid for myself, I decided to do something that would actually matter. Went to the Loblaws and filled up two carts with all her favorite things and showed up at her house and just started unloading bags. She kept asking what the occasion was and I just told her 'no occasion, you deserve it.' She actually teared up a little when she saw I remembered to get the specific tea she likes but always says is 'too expensive.'  
It felt so good to be able to give back to someone who's always given everything to our family. The look on her face was worth way more than whatever I would have spent that money on for myself."

I stick it under his coffee mug before he goes to work so he’ll find it when he picks it up. I’m always gone by the time he sees it, so I never knew what he did with them or if he even liked them. He’s never said anything about them. 

Today I found a huge pile of them, including the first one I ever drew, and they were in a place where I know he looks every day. 

I really didn’t think he kept them. I’m so happy. "

71,0,Life is really pretty. It took me years to slow down and really figure that out. Hard to feel down and out after a nice long walk to a pretty view first thing in the morning.

I hope all of you guys get to feel as grateful and happy as I am right this moment. I love you all friends!!!

We went to Black Beach to let the pups play in Lake Superior, and then over to Gooseberry Falls where we climbed the falls together. Then it was a trip to Two Harbors for ice cream and pup cups. We spent the day seeing the beauty of Minnesota. Then we drove home through areas that had the recent wildfires, showing us the ugly that is possible. All in all, a wonderful day with my wife."
73,0,"Today was such a great day. I (33F) feel incredibly happy and hopeful. Over the past five years, I’ve been working on my mental health: talk therapy, changing jobs to reduce stress, adding medication, and leaning on the support of my amazingly supportive husband (33M). And now, I’m finally starting to feel truly happy.

This afternoon, I got back from reffing a youth lacrosse game. Last night, I played in my adult field hockey league. And tonight, I was hit with this nostalgic memory—showering after a long, fun, hot summer day. I came home to a dinner made for me, and now I’m just relaxing, listening to the sounds of summer outside. Life feels light. For a brief moment, I feel hopeful and happy—for the first time in so long.

74,0,"* We had a new guy come on shift for overtime, so I got to meet someone new. He and I have a similar sense of humour and we watched a new Netflix comedy show that had us laughing all evening.
* Getting to know my crew members on shift better every day, today was a great bonding session over Incident Management Training, it is weird, but we just bond over learning things.
* I had a good catch up with a friend, we haven't caught up in at least a week and it was great talking and sharing pics and catching up on gossip. "
75,0,"Basically for some reason since December, my hygiene  and grooming have just sucked.  This recent grey weather has just now added layers of  the blehs and depression to that. My caregiver is coming in today and I asked if she can help trim my hair. And she said: no problem...but shower and wash your hair first. So I told her: Ok, no problem. 

So much better!

Also  coming up to first full week of having just a plate of food. I'm trying to help myself shed a huge amount of weight.  I've been on Cymbalta for years. And during that time I've steadily gained weight. Part of that is from mis-guessing how much i'd want, another. Today I made a nice little thing of a portebello mushroom burger using lettuce, just a small amount of Aioli dressing with  cheese and a pinch umani flavoring. (not msg) 😁🤣Surprisingly satisifying."

These folks work their ass off during the morning rush and always remember to ask about my weekend or how my work is doing. The manager even remembered when I mentioned my dog was sick last month and asked for updates which was fucking awesome.  
After getting a decent bonus at rbc and pulling off a sweet win on grizzlysquest, I decided to leave them a tip this morning with a little note saying thanks for always brightening my day. You should have seen their faces like they were very happy!"

79,0,"I’ve been writing a sci-fi- comedy series of books for YEARS.  I edited them and re-edited them over and over again. Never feeling like they were good enough. In a moment of inspiration last month I decided to just go ahead and publish and I published three in the series.

They’re free on Kindle Unlimited and to my absolute astonishment they’ve actually been getting some views here and there! It’s been so inspiring and motivating and I’m really truly happy. 😊

If someone out there is constantly second guessing yourself, just do it. I was my own biggest critic. And if I kept waiting till it was perfect in my own eyes, I would have never published anything!

Now I’m working on three more for the same series and I’m working at lightning speed!"

I just wanted to say that after 3 years of being depressed and self deprecating I finally made a change for myself and IT WORK, I got my grades today and I'm moving to my last year of high school!

81,0,"I dont know where to post this but I really love my wife. We started as an LDR when I was making 30$ per month 5 years ago, yet she still wanted to be with me. Fast forwards after a few years i was able to escape the financial situation in my country and get on my feet elsewhere, met my amazing wife and proposed, then married her a year later almost 9 months ago.
This woman is the reason i decided to not let myself get ruined due to my dreams not being achieved. She is the reason i am where i am today even if she denies it, i wouldnt have been doing well if it wasnt for her help and support. 
We are now more than 5 years into our relationship and finalizing closing the gap between us. I told her since day one that ""even if you have issues I cannot solve them for you, that's your own battle. But i will always be there to cheer you on and support you through it"" and we stuck to it, we both did that and more. I am proud of her beyond belief and she is asleep while it is almost 5 AM for me so i am unable to tell her. I think about her in every small thing i do and it has always been like that. Whether im eating or laying down or walking outside or doing whatever you can think of, my primary thought is ""hmmm i think this would be better if she was around to share this moment with"". She is my mini me and my little minion. Never thought i would be so obsessed about someone like this ever, i love everything about her even when she doesnt love herself. My perfect soulmate. I have not even given her justice with my love for her because I havent been the best husband but i try to be that every day. 

I thank you for reading if you reached this far i Needed to get it out of my system. 

PS : I dont really recommend LDR, just saying it doesnt work for everyone. "

84,0,"I started doing this a few months ago and it's honestly become addictive in the best way possible. I was having a particularly good day after a football parlay hit big (shout out Inter vs barcelona and grizzlysquest lol) and I was in line at my usual coffee shop just feeling grateful for how things worked out. The person in front of me was this older woman counting out change for her coffee and I just had this impulse to cover it. The look on her face was priceless like she seemed genuinely shocked that a stranger would do something nice for no reason.  
Ever since then, I try to do it at least once a week. Sometimes it's the tired looking parent juggling kids and a complicated order and sometimes it's just whoever happens to be in front of me. The reactions are always amazing cuz some people try to pay it forward immediately and others just light up with this huge smile.  
My barista at the regular spot has started giving me this knowing look when I walk in, like she's wondering who's getting the surprise today. It's become this little ritual that honestly makes my week better than theirs probably."
85,0,"I have had a tough go at relationships in the past, I’ve experienced a lot of abuse and general trauma. 
But my current boyfriend is so different, he’s reliable, trustworthy, loyal, kind, funny, handsome, caring and so much more. 
He doesn’t understand a lot of what I go through and have been through but he makes an effort to be there for me regardless. I love his smile when I can tell hes thinking I look pretty (he looks pretty) the way he looks when he cuddles me/ lays on my chest. I love his presence and when hes gone I realise how much he fills every room we are in together. 
Everyday I look forward to spending time with him, may it be in person or through the texts we send eachother- sharing our days, sending memes and planning our futures. 
I am so lucky and so grateful. 
I wish everyone could find someone like him. And that you both treat each other with the love and support you both deserve. "

87,0,"My husband and I have been married 7 years.
We have two little girls, one is 4 the other is 2.
I've been a stay at home mom thier whole lives, mostly so my husband can finish school, but also because I really, really love being a mom.
I've wanted to go into the medical field most of my adult life. My mom was a nurse for some 30+ years, and hearing her stories has always fascinated me. I also spent a lot of time in and out of hospitals as a kid, and always appreciated my nurses, and wanted to help people the way I've been helped.
I realized recently though, that I want more than that. As I head into the medical field and prepare for my nursing school entrance exams, I finally admitted to myself that really what I want is a doctorate, and to fully dedicate myself to saving lives. It's always been in the back of my mind, but I have a tendency to hold myself back and not try as hard as I really could. Fear of failure and difficulty have held me back from a lot of things over the years.
I hesitantly told my husband today what I wanted, and all he said was,
""If that's really what you want, let's make it happen.""
He didn't ask about the kids. He didn't whine about the time and commitment. There was no talk about who would take care of things at home. Just complete and utter support.
I just felt so loved. I know this journey will be hard, and long, and difficult, and challenging and I may change my mind part way through. But knowing that he's willing to help me get through it makes it seem 1,000 times more likely. I'm so grateful for him."
88,0,"I 22F, finally bought my first car. After years of relying on Ubers, Lyft, family members and friends. I know many people get their first car in their teen years but I had absolutely no help from my family. I had to start paying rent and bills since I first started working at 17 so saving was hard. Then last year I actually purchased what was supposed to be my first car in a big and pretty popular car lot here in Texas which has shut down since then. However I ended up getting scammed. I had bought a 2012 Chevrolet Cruze for $3,200. The owner of the lot and I had agreed that he would fix the ac and then give me a call to come pick it up when it was ready. But a few days later he called and said that the car ended up being no good and that he had already spent the money and would be paying me back. I broke down crying. I cried every single day because only God knows how long it took me to save that amount of money. Till this day I am still waiting to be paid back. I have had to wait in the cold, rain, and heat for up to an hour daily to be picked up outside of my job standing alone in the dark and I usually cried silently as I did. But those days are over! I just bought a 2004 Toyota Camry for $2,000. It’s very beat up and old but it’s reliable and that’s all I ever wanted. I am now offering my coworkers without cars rides every chance I get."
89,0,"My girlfriend has been obsessed with James Blunt since she was a teenager and always talks about how she's never seen him live. When I saw he was doing a show in Quebec this June, I knew I had to make it happen, but decent seats were like $130+ each which was honestly stretching our usual budget. Been working very hard especially on the second job over at lightspeed and figured this was the perfect opportunity to do something special with the extra cash so I got us the tickets (have to thank jackpotcity as well for the win the other day lol).  
I printed out the tickets and left them on her pillow this morning before work. She facetimed me crying happy tears from our bedroom. Apparently she's been following his tour dates but couldn't justify the expense, especially with the drive to Quebec. The show is next week and she's already made a playlist of songs she hopes he'll perform and keeps showing me videos of his recent concerts. She's been singing you're beautiful around the house nonstop and planning what to wear lol.

91,0,"Long story short, a friend of mine got into a fight with a mutual friend of ours, this leading to them leaving our group chat and blocking everyone. Recently my Discord got hacked and I had to create a new one and took a gamble. I sent them a message but feared they would just block me on that new account too but they didn't.

they explained they needed space. that they felt like they weren't good with fighting amongst friends and did a cowardly thing (their words not mine). but they were happy for me reaching out and apologized for blocking me without explanation. We kept chatting talking about how things were, updates after almost a year of silence and more. and it was amazing!

I learned they were doing WAY better emotionally and mentally, told them about developments in my life and such and just enjoyed chatting... it was nice. I admit I spent ages worrying about them for months of radio silence. so it was nice to see they were doing better with their life.

Anyway, it was nice to speak to them again after almost a year of them being totally silent. Seeing them doing better with their life made me happy."
92,0,"I'm 43, and the new kid I trained thought I was 21-23, then the next day an old guy in another dept asked me what school I'm going to during the day. I said ""What?!"" How old do you think I am? He said 20s, I said low 20s or high 20s? The old dude said 22. That made my night & Im still happy about it.

So I'm training this new kid to work in another department, this is his first night shift job and out of the blue as I'm showing him how to fill out paperwork,this 21 yr old asks me, ""So what's your major?"" I said what do you mean?"" He said, ""You know, college."" I responded with, ""Oh, I have a year an a half left to become a teacher."" He goes ""Really?!?!"" ""How are you graduating so fast while working overnight, are you going super full time, taking a lot of credits?"" I said, ""What do you mean?""

I had no clue he was gauging my age with the graduation time. I told him, man that was like 20 years ago. The dude thought I told him a bold face lie lol. He yelled, ""I thought you were like 21, 23 man!"" 

Then the next day, an old guy from another department who I rarely speak to tells me that kid called off and told me, looks like I'm going to be alone all night. I told this old timer, I'm alone every night, they don't give me any help and that I was training him for another dept. Then this old guy literally said word for word, ""So do you go to school during the day?""

I said, what?!?! School? How old do you think Iam, the guy said in your 20s. I asked, high 20s or low 20s? He said, 22. I said, awwww come on, you're just trying to charm me. He goes, ""haha no I'm dead serious.""

Well that made my night. It gave me flash backs of when I was 37 and a 19 yr old had the hots for me, she thought I was 22 and when I was 40, this 21 yr old had a crush on me at work, she thought I was like 24. I can go on and on. What happened the other day made my night because its been such a a long time, like a year, since I heard someone complimenting my youthful look. 

As happy as Iam I just want to take this time off to praise Jesus for giving me this. Jesus is the creator of the whole universe, every dimension, space, time, matter, He is the Word that created all these things and I just want to thank Him for giving me this miracle.

A miracle is something that's less likely to occur and according to the math, the numbers show it being highly unlikely that it's going to happen and when it does, its a miracle.

Most 43 yr olds have gray hair, receding hairline, look old, wrinkly face, saggy face, the ones that do look young look like they are in their 30s and not early 20s. Now, if you look at the dating market, men have it bad. There was an article about a male loneliness epidemic, alot of them are single and are stuck in a form of escapism. Just go to malemwntalhealth sub reddit and you'll see all those lonely guys there longing for a companion.

What are the chances of a 43 year old looking like he's in his early 20s, steps in a room and is able to get at least 1 woman in her 20s to not like him, but have the crush/hots for his looks even though she has no idea he's 43. Very slim, this is truly a miracle from God.

Thank you Jesus for letting me experience this. And for the record, when I see these young 20 yr old women who like me, I don't entertain them at all. I never slept with them, never dated them, never manipulated them, I just lie and tell them that I'm married and that I'm 43 and from there, admire their beauty from a distance while praising Jesus for that experience.

I remember turning 1000 bucks to 14k overnight awhile back, that feeling still doesn't trump the feeling I got when a 20 something yr old thinks I'm 20 something and has the hots for me. Begging and praying to get my dream job and eventually getting it still doesn't trump that feeling. The only thing that felt better than this was when my cat went missing for many, many, many years because a new Tom Cat spooked her away and I prayed to Jesus every night to have her be around people who will love her as much as me. Some nights I lost hope and thought she was dead but I said the same prayer every night and the  out of the blue, many years later, I saw her run across the street in another neighborhood location and I was so thrilled. I don't think anything is going to top that feeling, not even hitting the lotto. She was skin and bones but I trapped her and brought her home.

You guys may all think I'm nuts but I'm just giving glory and credit where it's due and that's to God. I know there are miracles in your life that you may have overlooked, God may have not blessed you with the gift of beauty, but I know He gave you something equal or better that's a miracle in your life."
93,0,"I’m close to sobbing. I only have one left. The other I lost as a kid and ever since I’ve become so attached to the remaining one I have panic attacks every time I lose it.

It’s closure. I can’t afford to buy the replacements yet, but when I do I’ll probably cry tears of joy the moment they arrive. I’m crying out of joy from even the notion of being able to see them in their prime again. The one I still have is almost twenty years old after all. But it’s over. Months of looking are finally over.

The remaining one is so worn down it’s falling apart, it needs to retire. I’ll probably frame it somewhere. To keep the memory while making sure it’ll never have to worry about the elements again. I want it to be happy too, it’s served me years of late night crying and cuddles. It deserves it.

I can’t wait to hold them in my hands again. This goes out to six year old me after he lost the first one. You’ll find them again. You’ll hold them again. You got this buddy. You’ll see your friends again."

97,0,"For context my (23y) best friend (24y) ws always a console gamer. I gad a pc and prefered it, we even 'battled' eachother (classical console vs pc fight) when we were in 7-8th grade, but obc. a good gaming pc is a massiv investment.

I used to have a ps3 so we could sometimes play together on that plattform or on his wii / later switch when I was at his place.

Due to going to Uni he uses a laptop more and also found joy in playing games on it (mostly old rts like stronghold, because limited power)

and, i realized that I have an old 'serverproject' at home; when I last upgraded my pc I had to go from an old cpu to a new cpu with new mainboard, going from ddr3 to ddr4 ram,

and I essentialy grabbed a new case, a PSU and turned all of the old components into a dedicated server....

Until I realized, I dont actually like the idea of a pc running 24/7 in my home while I'm at work.

Yesterday I finally offered him, that he could have it if he wanted to. I suggested that I wanted to get a new graphicscard in the near future anyway and then we could add the old one to his tower... until then the integrated cpu graphics would still be better than his laptops...

and he was super excited!

I'm just so hyped to finally be able to play eecent games with him. Plus he's a rather 'lazy student', so I think I will have ample opportunity to play with him after work or on weekends/holidays <3"

99,0,"For a bit of background. For many years I've creeping up in weight. IIRC waaaaay back about 2012 I was around  200 pounds. Then between depression, and minor injuries, and 2020's plague event.

I had been using instacart to save on gas, that turned into everything named Stouffer to pizza. because it's all I could afford, and pay for instacart and all the dumb fees them and Kroger and smiths would ticky tack on. Suffice be said fam said: since amazon finally got around to getting off it's sitting bits to actually do wholefoods delivery to our zip code, if you pay for it, make a grocery list and menu, we'll happily help by sending wholefoods to your house.

101,0,"At the start of the year I started attending kickboxing trainings. At the end of March I quit 2 addictions that made me suffer mentally and made me waste lots of time on them. My mentality became soooooooo healthy. Recently I bought some keychains with Madoka and Bocchi (they're all pink if someone is unfamiliar) and attached them to my messenger bag, also I bought these round brooches with pins with Miku and Teto on them, I attached them too. I was kinda shy about wearing them in public, but, strangely, wearing them made me more confident. I have a dentist appointment in a few weeks to fill my last 2 holey teeth and I can finally get braces, I'm gonna look so dorky in them and I love it. Also today I went training outside, which I'd never do in the past. Like DAMN I feel so happy. I just wanna share it with someone, but I don't trust my parents and my friends, so here I am. I just wanna squeeze someone tight because of how happy I am. Still, I am far from success, I'm still awkward and kinda scared of girls, but I'm working on it.

104,0,"I just paid off my lease.

Moved in here with gf (ex now) and out of my parents house 4 years ago. 

We were splitting the bills at first,
But after the first year I started paying the full 1700$ myself, and let her buy groceries. and she was saving money for us to buy a home.

But we broke up 6 months ago, she left and took all the money that was for ""us""

If you share pets, and they take the pets, there's nothing you can do about getting visiting hours for your babies, and nobody cares. They tell you ""they're just cats"" and law looks at them as property.

Landlord told me I have to pay in full on my own or he would be forced to put an eviction on both of our records.

But I made it through on my own, paid the lease and got groceries too.

Some great things:
I started working out again
I quit alcohol
I quit videogames
Cut down on ordering food and eating junk food tremendously
I'm more confident and happy in general.
My apartment stays fresh and clean now that she's gone.
Healthy Meals are prepared instead of sweets and fast food.

She wanted to leave me in shambles, but I rose from the ashes like a damn Phoenix. 💪

The one she left died on this apartment floor with a handle of tito's vodka in his system, and I rose from his pathetic corpse, to take my life back.



Shout-out to all the fellas out there who have been fucked over by the lie known as love, and are currently healing in silence.
The pain is tremendous, nobody understands your grief, I know I didn't until I went through this.

Sometimes we lose everything we love, everything we live for, and it's the hardest thing in the world to pick yourself up off that floor and try to keep going, to find something else to live for.

Now I live for myself, put myself first and trust nobody.

And as dark as that might sound to you, I am all I have now, and honestly I'm way happier now than I ever was with her.

To start, my girlfriend has had one kf the hardest starts to life, and has never been able to get the things she's wanted, having had things on her wishlist for 6+ years and never looking like she could ever afford them.

Recently her work has been going well enough she can support herself and she's started saving. I have been meanwhile working endless over-time and night shifts to work as hard as I can. We are long distance and in different timezones so it hasn't affected our reletionship much.

Recently we found her her trip to see me and meet my family isn't looking possible for her, so I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to surprise visit her for a couple of weeks. I organised flights and where to stay, even contacting some of her friends and sisters to help me with organisation. 

In the lead up I thought since I had been working so hard and saving, it would be perfect timing to get her all the things she wants and truly make this the biggest and best surprise ever.

I've bought her some Gucci shoes she has wanted forever but are staggeringly expensive so never did, a loose certified diamond as she collects gemstones, 3 gold rings of varying colours and gemstones as she loves rings and wanted more, a totem that is significant to her culture, a locket with a photo of her dog that Recently died, and a few other small things.

These are all items she's longed for, for such a long time. Being able to get her all these and surprise her in her own country is one of the most exciting things I've ever experienced jn my entire life, I love her so much and the thought of how happy she will be makes my heart race.

Thank you for reading my ramble, I'm just so happy she can finally get the things she wants."

Every time I have had to take a train in the past, especially by myself, things don't go very well and I typically breakdown at least once

But I had to go to a physio appointment today that was 3 hours and 14 minutes away by walking (at least according to Google, I did in in 2 hours and 20 minutes). And while I walked there, I knew I couldn't manage walking back, so I bit the bullet and took the trains. Originally it wanted me to take both trains and buses, but I found a route that was only trains, taking a train and bus was too much for me

I had to go on 3 different trains, and though I got lost at the first change over, but I didn't panic, I stayed calm, and I went up to someone and asked for help! And yeah! I did it! I stayed calm the whole time, and made it back home without incident! For me today has been very successful! I walked all the way to the hospital without getting lost, and I managed the walk. I did my physio appointment and managed to do that. I then took the trains back home. I managed to talk to a stranger to ask for help. And I did it all without panicking or getting over stimulated and breaking down! I am very tired now, I did nearly 22k steps today, but I am proud of my accomplishments today! I managed multiple tough areas for me! I saw baby coots and a wild pheasant on my walk :3"

123,0,"I’m Indo-Australian—my mom is Indonesian, my dad’s Australian—and I grew up in Canberra, feeling somewhat disconnected from my Indonesian side. As a kid, it was hard to find an identity for myself. I wasn’t fully white, but I wasn’t completely Asian either. I got curious looks and questions like “Where are you really from?” because I didn’t fit neatly into either box. That confusion followed me through my teenage years, and I often felt like I didn’t quite belong anywhere.

A little over a year ago, I decided to move to Jakarta to reconnect with my roots, learn the language, and see what life’s like here.

I honestly thought it’d be a short stay, just to dive into my heritage, but Jakarta surprised me. The chaos, the warmth, the affordability, the vibe—I started building a life, made friends, explored every corner of the city… and then my boyfriend joined me a few months in, and it’s almost been a year for him too now.

One thing I’ve noticed is how different people are here compared to Australia. In Australia, the vibe is often laid-back and casual—everyone’s generally more reserved and not super into showing emotions. But here in Indonesia, people are incredibly warm, open, and family-oriented. There’s this strong sense of community, and it feels like everyone’s really connected, whether it’s through their traditions or just everyday life. At first, the directness was a bit of a shock, but I’ve grown to love how people really see each other here. It’s a refreshing change from the more independent, private Aussie mindset.

Jakarta isn’t perfect—traffic is wild and it’s humid 90% of the time—but it’s alive. There’s art, music, community, late-night food, and this constant buzz that keeps things interesting. For any other third culture kids or people thinking of “visiting” their roots—I can’t recommend it enough. You might end up finding more than you expected! :))"

130,0,"Getting better at managing money

It's 10 days till payday and for the firts time in months my balance is not close to zero. I have difficulties managing my spendings due to ADHD and eating problems. 

But this month I started to log what I ate, which helped my binge eating and my wallet, and I follow my spending closely with Revolut. 

There is further room for improvement, but now this achievement makes me quite happy! And I am excited for the next paycheck and the new methods I want to try out to get even better! "
131,0,"I’m (30M) trying to juggle life, work, and pretending I know what I’m doing, but today, something simple made me really happy: a phone call from my mom.

It wasn’t a deep conversation. We talked about her garden, her plans with the neighbors, and how she’s just can't figure out how to text with two hands. But somewhere in the middle of all that she said, *""I hope you know I’m proud of you.""*

And man, that just… stuck with me. It reminded me that no matter how much time passes, or how grown-up I’m supposed to be, hearing your mom say she’s proud of you hits different. Recently, I've been plagued with a lot of loneliness and this is just something that made me feel better.

Just trying to be extra thankful today and not wallow as much as I have been. Moms really are something special."

- My wife and I met up with some friends for dinner, that we haven't seen in such a long time. We spoke about so many things, but we had to laugh because the bar lady was fixated on my arms. My mate kept making jokes about it and it was really funny how obsessed she was with them. She even came over to our table at one point and apologized to my wife! "

Earlier tonight I was at work at a movie theater and I randomly did it and went up to the concession stand. The assistant manager sally, my cowrokers Nat, and Rachel were also there. I spoke and they all looked at me, let me tell you the look on their faces was priceless! Sallys face is the one I remember most!

Sally and Nat both said ""Michael you have something on your forehead"" and I replied ""no my forearm is fine"". And I messed with them for like a minute before I smiled!

I LOVED THAT! Wish I could have recorded it! Its moments like this that I LOVE! "

This old post just popped up in a flashback and so I just wanted to add to it that things have continued to be awesome! Still go the pub and have so much fun, sing often! Joined a softball league to make friends and that worked, got some besties out of it! Work is amazing and my co-workers are the funnest and kickass! Got my dream truck and my dirtbike back up and running so about to have some adventures! Met the love of my life and we now live together!!

I never could have imagined this epically awesome life 5 years ago when I was trying to get out of my shell.

Thank you all who have posted fun and happy things over the years and being an inspiration for me!! 🩷

144,0,"My son officially told me he’s too old to hold my hand. Naturally, I responded with grace and maturity. (Just kidding.I contemplated crying into a bowl of Goldfish crackers.)

But then, without missing a beat, he said he’ll never be too old to make up rap lyrics about ketchup, mustard, and other random things we come up with at any given moment.

And just like that, my dad heart was both devastated and completely fulfilled.

Guess it’s time we get serious about our first EP. Working title: ""Beats & Burgers: The Lunchbox Sessions.""

Moral of the story? Joy sneaks in. Even when you’re feeling all the feels, and even when your kid is growing up too fast.

Hold tight to the weird and wonderful, especially the mustard-fueled bars.

145,0," I'm planning on soon flying to France to meet the love of my life for the first time. This isn't the surprise. we are both working very hard together as a team for months to make this happen.

The surprise is that he has no idea that i'm going to give him a gift. It's a custom little leather notebook engraved with a world map with hearts in both of our countries and a dotted line connecting them. I'm planning on adding some cute little personalized artwork, writing, and map cutouts inside representing our journey. He's a huge map nerd, so I think he absolutely is going to adore it!!!

What makes this so special to me is just how hard i've worked to make this happen. We both had not the best lives filled with many challenges, to put it lightly. This isn't just a love story, but a part of my own. I went from someone who was mute, anorexic, unable to even step a single foot outside of my house due to  disabling mental health conditions, to somebody who has faced some of my biggest fears (such as getting a job in retail), takes good care of my body, and am truly now see life through eyes of optimism and hope. I did this all on my own, but my soulmate was my inspiration that helped give me the inner strength to make all of this happen. 

Never in the world have I ever would've thought I would be living such a fantastical reality such as this... But here I am. Life truly is beautiful."

It's just the two of us at this little plumbing company that I started last year, and we have both suffered tragic/unexpected loss recently. Sounds funny, but it feels like we've been taking turns keeping the other strong when those hard days hit. 

We were chatting before heading to separate jobs on Monday morning, and he closed with ""I love you, man.  I hope you know that"", and has been ending some phone calls with a casual ""Love ya"".

It's just nice, and it made me happy. That's all.

148,0,"Not an involuntary celibate anymore

Hello folks,
I hope it's not my last post though i thought that many months back.
I'm not going to give you the context of this post because it's easier to go to my feed and read my posts gives me all the mystery and efforts to know about isn't it?.
So I was in this god forsaken place spamming my internal lonely thoughts every hour seeking attention or maybe someone to talk to.
Broke financially and mentally but somehow physically fit due to my drunken gym sessions early mornings.
I was here all the time seeking attention or chatrooms online.
Some said they are in love with me that too one claimed to collect money to visit my country through part time p***titution another one was a trans woman not able to understand I'm straight and bullying me afterwards , and few men roleplaying as girls and a moody middle aged lady.
All these things i don't know why and what I was doing.
Things changed when I got a job and moved to a new city.
Looked promising with new job and place.
At first i got attention of women due to me having a tall and lean physique and smoldering looks.
Then these things just faded and the past started catching up.
I started drinking and sulking again, started to miss work and what not.
I thought I was never going to seek love online.
But destiny had another plans.
I joined a book club and I'm not going to mention platform.
There I met a girl who spoke very little but very beautiful.
I was lucky that she loved to read and i love to write.
Slowly my wordplay got up to her and in a month or so she confessed that she likes me.
Long calls , texts and gifts from her be it flowers , chocolates , books and even a meal when I used to hungry.
After alot of uncertainty from her side i finally went to meet her travelling miles and taking off from work.
It was a weekend, summer days and a dreamy Airbnb in a costal city and good food and vibes.
She came to my Airbnb in the morning and used to stay until dark.
In between we would do what couples are supposed to do inside a dreamy Airbnb all alone.
I would move around without clothes around her and she would treat me normally.
Lots of moments in those days.
Cuddles , hugs , kisses and whatnot.
Felt surreal and hours felt like minutes.
Felt like I was in some kind of rom-com.
I was not here to share my story.
I was just here to say when you have your bad days just tell yourself it will pass and it does eventually with lot's of waiting and hope.
It's absolutely never perfect but you will have peace and greatfullness of whatever you have and you have paid your dues.
I have a long way to go and alot to do.
So i rarely sulk thinking my life is over.
But I count my blessings everyday.
And I'm very thankful to God.
I'm just posting here to tell all those online bullies that I'm not a Involuntary celibate anymore.
And i have no hate in my heart.

Thanks 
Travis."

Truth is I hated most things about me.

158,0,"(For context me and the stranger are both women and we were both customers.) I went to McDonalds for the 2nd night in a row. The first night there was a woman there who I honestly did not pay much attention to at first until she started to talk to me.

She saw me and my son (20 months old) and told me ""His outfit is cute."" I said ""Thank you."" And I noticed she kept staring at us.

The next night when I went to McDonalds again I saw that same woman. It took me a second to recognize her. I kept staring at her to see if she really was the same woman from yesterday. I also noticed that she looked really sad this time. I also started to realize that both of the nights that I saw her she was not eating anything. Then she noticed me staring at her and then she waved at me (I guess she recognized me too) and then I just impulsively asked her ""Do you want something?"" As I was pointing at the front counter. Then she said ""Are you sure?"" I said ""Yes."" Then I walked up to her table and asked her what she wanted. She said ""I guess either a chicken sandwhich or chicken nuggets."" Then I went up to the counter and ordered her the 10 piece nugget meal. Then the cashier asked me what kind of sauce. Then I looked at the stranger I was ordering for and said ""What kind of sauce do you want?"" Then she said ""Ranch."" Then after I was done ordering for her I handed her the cup that came with her order along with the reciept. (mcdonalds was still in the process of making her food and handed me the cup before the rest of the order was ready). I immediately left the restaurant after I bought her the food and handed her the cup and reciept. I never told her my name. Idk why. 

I felt like she was either homeless or at least very poor. Or maybe she was just sad maybe she was waiting on someone who ditched her. I have been homeless before and I guess she kind of reminded me of myself. "

They had so much fresh fruit and different types of fruit and vegetables, so much variety. They even had a full week of cheese where you could cut a while week of cheese if you wanted to.

170,0,"I love his artwork after seeing his first solo exhibit in Baton Rouge.  They really struck me.  There were two prints in the giftshop at the museum, but I was on vacation and didn't want to be carting around expensive prints, flights and stuff, and figured I get them online when I got home.  NOPE!!  I searched for days and they were totally sold out and the museum wouldn't ship them.

So far, I had bought 4 of his signed and numbered prints, one of them is hand embellished by the artist and there are only 10 of them.

Anyway, she came over on Mother's Day and gave me a bag of various goodies, beauty, hair and skin stuff.  Chase had just released two new signed and numbered prints and I bought one of them, Chasin Rainbows (top left).  It's already sold out.  I told her that I was only getting one because things are a little tight at the moment.

Well, she texts me later that she bought the other one, Riverboat (the alligator), for me!  My heart does a little flip every time I think of it.  Can't wait to see them in person.

172,0,"Please celebrate with me because this has been one of the most demanding, intense, and challenging developments ever! Last year, I overcame the struggle of unemployment and food insecurity and got a job in, of all places, the Empire State Building! (That was actually my last post here lol.) The job allowed me to get above survival for the first time in my adult life and fall asleep in peace - a dynamic that evaded me for years - especially during the pandemic. 

While it was a massive relief to have a regular paycheck, it still wasn't enough to really thrive, especially because of cost of living increases, inflation, you name it. I also had almost no time to paint and began searching for a way to self-express and develop my art while pressured from a day job. I shared my story with one of the interns who wanted to meet to see if we could work together to build a project on the side. ""I've always wanted to have a client,"" she said. ""I love consulting!"" 

A few days later, we met in a coffee shop, opened our laptops, and I shared my ideas for taking the art that got me through the pandemic and turning it into a store; a space that would offer products with my art on it. Neither of us knew what we were getting into. I certainly had no background, knowledge, or expertise in starting or running a business like this. All I knew how to do was.....paint 🥲. 

That initial meeting turned into another, and then another, until I had chosen a manufacturer and secured a website. Next came the designs. This part took months because it was necessary to choose which products to offer. What did people like? I had no idea. What should the prices be? Again, no idea. The worst moment came one afternoon when I had finished uploading all 200 designs. The manufacturer messaged me to say an error occurred with the final product. I figured it was just a technical glitch. Nope. All 200 products were designed and uploaded incorrectly, meaning they all had to be redesigned with the 'correct' DPI (dots per inch.) I fell to the floor in exhausted frustration. Weeks upon weeks of work, useless.🫠

It had to get done though, so I stood up after drying my tears and got back to work on product number 1 of 200. Several weeks later, they were done - thankfully, correctly! And after weeks of calls and emails and research, shipping and rates were settled. I couldn't afford to hire models, but my friends stepped up to the challenge by volunteering to help. Their empowerment has made all the difference in the world (you'll see some of them in the pics, with their consent given) and this was only possible because of their empathy, solidarity, and decency. 🫂

My hope is that this post and these words encourage you to pursue your goals, align with your vision, and most importantly, to push through the hardship - whatever form that takes for you - because you deserve to be happy. Even if you have to start from 1 out of 200 all over again, and even if you have no idea how it's going to happen, you can do it because your happiness is worth it.

Have a great week and thank you for reading about my journey. Sending joy and strength to those who need it ✨️🙏✨️ You got this!! "
173,0,"Hey everyone! Just wanted to share a little milestone. I’m officially two months sugar free today! It’s my second time going through a sugar free period, and I’m feeling really proud of how far I’ve come.

The first time around, it was tough, but this time I’m finding it a lot easier to stay on track. I’ve noticed more energy, clearer skin, and a better sense of overall well being. It’s not always easy, but it’s so worth it. I’m excited to see where this journey continues to take me!

* We went out to get dessert after dinner and we had a young lady ask us some questions about working as a firefighter, we spoke about what is involved and how we are always looking for more women to join the brigade.

175,0,"There are so many people who come into our lives and leave beautiful impressions.  
They don't have to be your partner or best friend.  
Just simple people, whose simple actions leave a deep impact on your life.

I want to share one such story.

Yesterday, my old tutor visited us. She taught me from Grade 1 to Grade 5.  
In the country where I live, private tuition is common — students go to a tutor's home or office and learn in small groups from different schools.  
So I started going to her when I was in Grade 1. She was very strict, yet loving. My mom always thanked her for helping me excel in academics. Once, my mom even invited her to my birthday party — she usually declined such invites, but she came that year.

After Grade 5, I moved to another tutor since she only taught till Grade 5. But I met her several times on the road over the years, and we’d talk.

Yesterday, after many years, she came to our home. She’s moving to Dubai with her daughter and wanted to see ""what her baby is doing in life.""  
She had also tutored my younger brother, who hasn’t been doing so well academically and has picked up some unhealthy habits. When she learned about it, she scolded him out of concern. But later, she spoke to him with love, asked him to promise that he'll start making better choices in life. It was such a warm moment.

I teared up twice just seeing her again. Before she left, she hugged me tightly. We exchanged phone numbers, and I told her I’ll come to visit her one day.

This quote reminded me that Yes she really shaped me into the person that I am today beyond just teaching subjects and I am very grateful

“Children are humanity in the making. What a teacher makes of them when they are in their hands is one of the greatest responsibilities and privileges a human being can have. Teaching should not be a profession – it must be a passion. Only then can education move from imposition of facts to exploration of truth.” – Sadhguru     

TLDR:  

My childhood tutor visited me after years, and her words still moved me. She cared, guided, and even now, she met her before moving out of the country

176,0,Repost for title being too short 
177,0,"Just wanted to share how amazing my husband is when it comes to my diabetes

I’ve been type 1 diabetic for almost 10 years now, and I’ve been married to my husband for 2. We live with his parents and sister, so they obviously know about my diabetes, but no one else in his extended family does.

Despite that, he goes above and beyond for me. He’s learned what to do when I’m high or low, helps me work out my insulin doses for meals and corrections, and if my CGM alarm goes off at night and I sleep through it, he’ll wake me up and check I’m okay.

When we go out, he always has sugar on him — even when I forget mine — and he keeps emergency snacks in the car just in case. He’s even gone out and bought me stuff like cooling bags for my insulin without me asking.

Managing type 1 can be overwhelming sometimes, but he actually listens, asks questions, learns on his own, and pays attention to the little things I say. It honestly means the world. I don’t really talk about it much, but I just felt like giving him a little appreciation post. He really is the best.

Any other type 1s out there with partners who just get it? Because wow, it makes such a difference."
178,0,"I did it. I finally came out as bisexual—and honestly? I’ve never felt more confident or true to myself.

For the longest time, I kept it all in. I was scared of being judged, misunderstood, or even invalidated. But deep down, I knew. I’ve always known. And now that it’s out in the open, it feels like I can finally breathe.

Being a bi girl isn’t a phase. It’s not confusion. It’s real. And I’m so done shrinking myself to fit into other people’s ideas of what I should be.

To anyone out there questioning or holding it in: I see you. Take your time, move at your pace, but please know that there’s nothing wrong with who you are. You deserve to live openly and love fully—no matter who that love is for.

Just wanted to share this moment with people who might understand. I’m proud of me today."

I am very proud and hassle him about it because he is a mate. I asked him if I need to kiss his ring when we catch up!
* I spoke with a client about ongoing SEO work and he just said ""yes"" - just like that! That is awesome, I will help with build his reach and get found on Google and I will also add to my monthly retainer client base.
* My wife gave me lots of big kisses when she came home from work. She also put her hands under my shirt when she gave me a hug and I tingled. She is so great and I love her so much.
* I asked my sone to help clean the kitchen and he just agreed and kept cleaning until it was done. No arguments, no whining, nothing, Just a ""Yes Dad"" and done. Made me very happy."

I’ve also started doing kinda slightly well in school which is genuinely huge news for me saying I missed half of the last year and I was getting 1s or 2s in all my classes.

182,0,"Okay, so, all my life, I thought I was aro/ace because I've never fallen in love once. I've been in relationships before, but they were always just because the idea was so cool, not because I actually loved them. Anyways, a few months ago I met this guy named Maik! Maik me and Maik hit it off immediately, and we became friends super fast. We had the same sense of humor, we had the same struggles, we were comfortable around each other in ways we weren't with anyone else. Anyways, YESTERDAY I was really upset about being Aro/ace because I WANT a relationship, but I'll never be able to fall in love, blah blah blah. And he took that as his cue to confess that he had feelings for me, and ARGH that made me realize I had feelings for him too. Turns out, I'm not Aro/ace, I was just waiting for him. Also, just as a joke, I decided to see if our star signs were compatible, and I found out they are the #1 most compatible star signs? I don't believe in that star sign stuff, but it made me warm and fuzzy inside. Then I remembered that one trend that's like ""if your moon phases on your birthday complete eachother to form a full moon, you're soulmates!"" AND OURS COMPLETED EACHOTHER??? Again, I don't believe in this kind of stuff, but still! Once is happenstance, twice is coincidence, and three times is fate. Just waiting on that third thing to fall into my lap. ANYWAYS, HERE'S SCREENSHOTS OF US DECIDING TO DATE EACHOTHER!! (also, side plot so you understand what we're talking about in some of the stuff, I was basically a lifeless marionette whose only function was to perform, but obviously it didn't have emotions, but that was just until I met him. Also the person whose name I blanked out is the name of my best friend, and also we agreed to call of the ""don't tell people"" thing because we both really wanted to brag about eachother"

* I was called big and intimidating which is kinda what I go for. So I was happy that I have been going in the right direction!

Guyssss!!!! Yesterday, May 11, was his birthday and HE LOVED THE BOOK!!! We were on a video call when he unboxed it. After seeing it, he couldn't stop smiling, and what I mean by smiling is, literally laughing. He couldn't take his eyes off the book. 🥹🥹🥹 I even screen recorded his reaction.

For the first few minutes, all he kept saying was ""Whattt"" and ""Woahh"" and extremely surprised. I think, he wasn't able to digest all of that, haha.

He was veryyyy happy, happy like a kid the whole time. He hates book (I knew it when I started creating a book for him), so I told him to read it in 1-2 months peacefully and give me a review at his pace, I didn't expect him to read it any sooner.

But he finished reading the book in less than 2 hours and even gave me a review.   
The book was perfect. He loved every single page. He thanked me for being so thoughtful. It was probably the grandest gesture anyone has ever done for him. He thanked me again and added that he was truly lucky to have me.

I replied that he deserved all that, he is worth doing grand gestures for. I also said ""Mutual feelings"" for truly lucky statement.   
  
He said, he didn't know why but he couldn't stop smiling, even after 2 hours 😂😂 and it was incredibly sweet of me.

I was veryyyy happy to see him like that. After our convos got over, I couldn't sleep for next hour cuz I was extremely happy that he liked the book thatttt much that he finished reading it the same night, in less than 2 hours. ✨✨✨

It went really well that I am feeling very peaceful and happy. 🍀🍀  
This early morning, he had to go outstation, so yesterday the whole day we didn't talk much. I knew he would be busy in packing and all, but I guess, we will talk about it peacefully once he comes back home. (We both are from different cultures and different states)"

Hope you are doing well. Just got some life changing news today. I will receive a free Burning Man ticket for 2025, normally priced around $600! Also received a free beard trim from my favorite barber, which was kind of him to do! 

I wasn't sure if I could go to Burning Man this year as I'm saving up for an apartment but this miracle happen, on my birthday weekend no less. This is the first time I am crying happily in a long time. I didn't think this would happen again as I don't get lucky very often but the universe has other plans. Thank you to the Burning Man Org. and the universe for this incredible early birthday gift. I am most grateful and will sleep very well tonight. 

Have a great day wherever life takes you and take care!

I have a lovely family, friends, love, health (not right now but overall), just enough to get by (even though no savings or wealth etc), I like where I'm living and the sun is shining today. I know this is not going to last, I have been suffering for years and years and most times I feel like I don't deserve to be happy. But I enjoy it while it's here. I just felt like expressing it somewhere and I'm glad I found this space to do so. Reading about other people's bliss is also a beacon of hope amidst the dark abyss that surrounds us, these days.

My tech friend took me to Best Buy and helped me find a new Alienware gaming laptop. We found one that was ""open box"" but in excellent shape. Meaning it was originally $2k but because someone already opened it and returned it was now $1.5k even though it's in the same condition.

We spent hours updating and fine tuning it and I couldn't be happier! Considering I spend most of my time on the laptop and call it my ""electronic bf"" this is a win for me. It plays all of my fav high end games at the highest graphic settings smoothly. I never had that before because I always bought cheap laptops."

      Is this what made her fall in love wirh me? No. Probably not, but it definitely enhanced her love.

6 May 2025

      After an 8 hour long trip we made it to the hotel. Things were a bit awkward with her, since she admitted she liked me at the same time i liked her. Also knowing she does like me rn. Either way i was determined to confess my love to her asap, knowing that she also was convinced i didn't like her. So when we headed to bed we started talking, and talking, flirting a bit more with each message until we realized that we were in love, and damn it felt good.
       Talking about our love for eachother was so amazing there are no ways to describe it, but if i were to describe it it would sounds something like this ""a rainy night, midnight even, sitting alone watching thunder pour down on earths gaze while you watch the city illuminating the sky with a warm, dim yellow light. Worries are a thing of the past, you only live the moment. Thinking about the future is your favourite activity. You think about your future with her. You feel as happy as you never were. You fill full once in your life again"". 
        Opening up about our feeling was the best thing ever and i don't regret a second of it. Will tomorrow be akward? Yes, totally. Will it be one of the most precious moments ever? Yes, again. My love for her is deeply rooted in my heart and i could never make it go away. Sending her a simple poem that was copy pasted from Metallica is cheap, but makes a hell of a difference. 
       Setting her finally being happy is nothing short of magical. Seeing her happy is the spring to my winter. She could easily repair my issues just by being there and that's what i love the most about her. 
       On a random rainy day of late-October i met her. A drawing course. I went there to learn some stuff here and there but i left with someone so precious i could never afford to lose.
       In a couple of days is our first date. I can't wait."

My whole life I figured I would get a bachelors degree so I didn’t think it would be that big of a deal, but I’m so happy. I’m a first generation college student. And I’m so grateful for my family, my dad cried at my graduation, and my family just kept telling me how proud they were. My mom also told me she was so proud of me and excited for me because I’ve done something she was never able to, so she gets to keep watching my journey and live vicariously through me. My grandma also always tells me how excited she is and proud of me because I have so much going for me and I have so many opportunities. And then apparently after my parents when home my dad came up to my mom gave her a big hug and was like, “we did it, like we raised a good kid I’m so proud of her”. I didn’t realize how much this meant for my family and I’m just so grateful to have such a good support system and I’m proud that I did it. My parents didn’t have the opportunity I did. I wish I knew how to show them how much I appreciate them and how they’ve cheered me on. I’m hopefully on to PA school next, but they just never stop telling me how proud they are and I just love them so much. This post doesn’t have much of a point I’m just so grateful and full. I didn’t realize how much this would mean to me. "

221,0,"Myself (23f) and my partner (23M) have been seeing each other for nearly a year and a half now.

Before him I’d been in some pretty awful relationships. I was treated like a mother rather than a partner in one and abused in another. 

I’ve known my current partner for 3 and a half years now and we’d always danced around the idea of trying a relationship but for many different reasons it didn’t happen. I’d really liked him on several occasions and him me too, but I was so scared of commitment and being abandoned that I didn’t want to try things. But at the start of February 2024 I had the sudden realisation that I was pretty much in love with him and if I didn’t act fast I’d lose my chance with him. So I called him up and asked him on a date. Thankfully he said yes.

We’ve been seeing each other since then and I have never been in a happier relationship. I’m glad we happened at the time we did because by then we were both ready for it and were able to be the best people we can be together.

I’ve been pretty much star struck since we started dating that he’s actually *my* boyfriend but last week it’s like my love clicked again. I’m so unbelievably in love with him. I’m no longer scared of losing him or feel he could leave at any moment. I feel so secure and happy it’s wonderful. 

He is the first thought I have in the morning and the last one before bed. He makes me laugh at times I just want to never do anything ever again. He makes me feel beautiful and smart and I genuinely think he is the most sweet and incredible person in the entire world. I love making him feel that way too. We’re starting to look at houses to move in together in the coming months and I just can’t believe how lucky I am.

From someone who once felt unloveable, deserving of abuse and had completely lost hope in the existence of love. I promise you it gets better. Love is out there and it’s incredible.


TL;DR, If you love someone do something about it. They could be the love of your life."

So I have my headphones in listening to the Smith's and I kinda just look up, and dozens of purple strings shoot out in the sky lighting it up for a second before disappearing. It was so beautiful and I was a little awestruck, just wondering how many beautiful moments I've missed simply because I chose not to acknowledge them. I didn't witness world peace or do something I loved, I just so happened to look up at the right moment and watch a lightning storm and I'm very happy I did and just wanted to share lol"
223,0,"We lost our home to hurricane milton. We got a new trailer but it needed alot of work. We had been staying with friends so I had access to a shower but since we moved in to the trailer all we've had was sponge baths then cold showers. Today we installed a used water heater. I took my first hot shower in five months and I think it restored my soul. 

Hot showers are one of my things. Those things that make life worth living. Worth going to work for. Worth putting up with stuff for. And to go that long without one was definitely a trial. 

In addition to that in our last home (rv) we couldn't even use the shower so while we had hot showers they were in the camp showers and shared with fifty other people. And only had one shower for women and one for men. 

So I haven't had a hot shower in my own home in probably six years. The idea that I can at any moment just get up and go take a hot shower is mind boggling to me. 

Some weeks during the winter we only showered once a week because we couldn't handle the freezing water. Or took sponge baths. 

It's the small things that make life worth living. "

230,0,"I (26F) have had a few relationships, only two lasting over a year, with the longest being 3 years. All have been with men that were just plain wrong and bad for me, at best negligent, at worst manipulative. I made my mistakes, had poor judgement, stayed when I should have left, and had PLENTY of short term complicated casual affairs (situationships). I had this love inside of me that I just wanted to share and feel that kind of pure love in return. I felt hopeless and finally read ‘the unexpected joy of being single’ (MUST READ) which caused a short but complete break in dating of any kind and decided I was ready to break this cycle and try again, try to find the real deal.

The first man (28M) I met after this break was completely unlike anyone I had ever dated, or ever imagined dating, and we have had the most beautiful and real 8 months together. It’s early days, but this relationship, even in difficult times, has been the healthiest and most genuine relationship I could have ever imagined. I’m in therapy which helps, but we communicate, take space, celebrate, laugh and have so much fun together. He is gentle and patient with my traumatic past and I’m in awe of it all.

He is asleep in my lap while I watch a movie and I’m in heaven.

I hope this post is well received, I just want to share that better is possible and waiting for you, even if you feel hopeless. Even if we don’t last forever, this love has changed my life and given me faith in love again.

TL;DR finding real love is possible even if you’ve never felt it before."

Once in October 2024, he mentioned that if he becomes great someday, he'll publish his quote book. But I think that he's already pretty great, so why to wait 5-7 years for a book?

I starred that message back then in our chat, and now after all these months, I've made a hardcover casewrap book for him.

His bday is within next 10 days, but he might leave early so I'm gonna wrap it nicely and give him before he leaves but I'll tell him to open only on his bday . 

I'm veryyyyy excited for his reaction when he'll first unbox his gift and will find his book. 🥹🥹🥹"

235,0,"My husband and I made up The Brownie Rule™️ early on in our marriage (over 10 years ago). It’s been over 5 years since it’s been used. The rule is, when there is an odd number of brownies, I get the extra. 

We got an order of Domino’s brownies with our dinner this week, and he did the divvying up of the brownies. He gave me my half and said, “There, we’ve followed the brownie rule!”

I had totally forgotten, so he reminded me. He is always honest with me, and thinks the world of me. He makes me smile every day, is a great communicator, a fantastic parent, and so driven to take care of our family. 

He has been by my side as my best friend since 2010, we’ve been together since 2011, and got married in 2013. I was 19, and we were so sure of each other, and everyone saw that he treated me so well, that there weren’t any actual objections to us getting married so young. When I wound up with schizoaffective disorder, I was just a shell of a person and was not the most pleasant person to be around. He was there by my side, encouraging me to keep going, taking care of our son and home, keeping up with my medical stuff, and doing whatever he could to keep us afloat when I was unable to work for a few years.  

We have our home, our son, and our wonderful family of blood relations and soul relations. We have a fun dog, a running vehicle, and a whole lot of love. He is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I just want to tell how much I love him to the world. "

It is wild to me that in the past month, i have spent about 7,000, granted i had to pay rent twice in a row which does not help, but even after all this i still have a few hundred in my pocket which will be used to get me to next payday, then i can actually start to retain money, prob about 1500 a month ill be able to get my accounts healthy, get my utilities paid current, start making payments to my friends and family to get them the money they have loaned me over the past year back.

Ill finnaly be able to just...get food without needing to check my bank, or transfer $40 from savings to checking so i can buy food to last me another week. I still have a ways to go, but i can actually see a light at the end of the tunnel for the first time in years."

240,0,"When I was pregnant with my first child in 2017 my mom gave away my dog and wouldn't tell me who so I thought I would never see him again.

The day before my birthday I took my kids to the park and noticed a dog that looked similar to my current dog an Australian Shepherd.

My daughter said the other was a shiba inu so I looked closer and noticed it was a large yorkie without a doxxed tail.

I thought of my old dog but it didn't click at first! Once I realized there probably aren't a lot of giant yorkies running around I took a closer look.

It was him! I gave him some snuggles and added his owner on instagram and took a picture (he was giving me a kiss). He is well groomed and well trained. I am so happy I got to see him again and he is happy/healthy.

He is 10 years old now!"
241,0,"This may seem like a small achievement to some, but to me, it means the world. 

I grew up pretty poor and never learned how to ride a bike, but I’ve always wanted to. My dad was very good at it when he was younger, but unfortunately he had his bikes stolen before I was born. I always admired him for his skill, and wished I could be like him someday. 

Well, I’m 22 now and one of my relatives who no longer rides decided I could have their bike. It needed cleaned and a new chain,  and I did that. I’m overweight and my balance isn’t great, so for the first two times I tried learning with the help of my roommate I got very frustrated and just could not get it.

But today, I tried yet again, and of course i couldn’t get it no matter how hard I tried and I was getting so incredibly frustrated, I thought it must’ve been because I wasn’t talented and just could not get it.

But suddenly, right when I was about to quiet, a few young men in a nice grey sports car rolled up to the parking lot and rolled down the windows and shouted “YOU’RE DOING GREAT! YOU’VE GOT THIS!” And then drove off. And honestly, this helped so much, I think it was the last push I need - I immediately put my all into my next attempts and I DID IT! I fucking DID IT, guys! I’ve been wanting to do it for so long and I finally managed to ride it! A few more tries with my roommate pushing me, then I managed to do it myself several times!

The neighbors of my apartment complex who were outside at that point even cheered me on and gave me tips, and it was so awesome to be able to do something I’ve always wanted to do.

I know this really is a small achievement, but I already feel myself wanting to get back on and do it again tomorrow. I have a feeling this will help me get out of my depressive episode and finally help me get some exercise. It’s a huge achievement for me and I’m so proud of myself for it.

To whoever those young men were in the grey car, thank you so much - you gave me the final push I really needed to finally be able to move forward.

Every time I ride now I think of my dad - thank you for everything and I just wish you were here to see me now. "
242,0,"Yesterday, I went to the supermarket with my kid. Before that, we had gone to see his dad (his office is nearby) and I left everything with him (backpack with keys, his change of clothes, etc) before going to buy the stuff we needed. 

I got to the register and a lady behind me was looking kinda nervous with a sole bag of rice. I thought she was maybe going to ask me to go ahead of me, I had probably 10 or 15 things, not much, but still, I was going to let her go first, I was in no hurry. Then she asks ""Could you please save my spot? I just need eggs"" I assured her that would be no problem. My kid, being the goofy kind soul he is, started to march around her bag of rice that she left so that on one would take it either. She came back not a minute later, grateful and talking to my kid for a bit. 

Once my things had been checked, I realized I had left my wallet in the backpack! I kinda panicked. I could use a QR code to pay, but I had not enough money in that account and my second account didnt' work with the QR code. I called my husband to ask him to pay, that I would send him the QR code, but the lady at the register was already giving me the stinkiest eye ever. 

After 3 minutes of waiting (I checked) and husband not being able to pay and also getting worried on the other end of the line, I told the exasperated woman behind the register to just cancel the whole transaction and I would be back within 10 minutes. It is then that the lady behind me said ""Hey, I can pay it for you and then you can transfer the money. That okay?"" I was like ""Yes! Thank you so much! Give me your number, I'll do it right now. Thank you again!"" She was all smiles and told me it was no problem. She paid my bill, paid hers and then I transferred the money to her account. 

It was such a nice moment for me. It left me smiling for the rest of the night. "
243,0,"I've been faltering on my diet and had gained all the weight lost and some more, but I am hoping to get back on track. This is me testing if doing it for vanity and validation can keep me mentally motivated to stick to my journey :)"
244,0,"I just wanted to come on here and document one of my most healing moments l've ever experienced-even if it happened over a year ago now, I still remember it like it was yesterday!

For context, I used to have trauma relating to physical touch from my first relationship (among other things, but that's not relevant for this story), where one of the results was in a fear of kissing.

With that being said, here's my story:

After taking years to heal from my prior abusive relationship, I (22F) finally felt ready to enter back into the dating scene. After searching (for surprisingly not a long time), I matched with my Fiance (27M), and we started going out.

I was very much a slow burn, and I warned him as much. Once we were a few dates in, he asked if he could kiss me for the first time. Of course, with me being a slow burn and having a reluctance towards kissing, I politely turned him down. But I also made sure to reassure him that I was definitely interested in him, just that I needed more time.

Now, after a few more dates, I was really starting to fall for this guy. After a particularly lovely night where he took me to a concert and the night was filled with laughter and conversation, he asked once more if he could kiss me, right as I was leaving his car.

I looked at him, and just felt so in awe of him. I thought, ""Man, I'm really starting to like this guy. I think he's earned it- he deserves at least one wholesome peck."" More importantly, I wanted to give him a kiss.

In the abusive relationship that I was in, I always felt forced, manipulated, or bargained into giving physical affection- particularly with kisses. The first kiss I ever shared with my ex gave me the worst gut feeling I have ever felt in my life. I truly believe that feeling was from my guardian angel, and that I was being warned about the relationship I was entering.

Anyways, back to this newfound healthy love!

We leaned in and shared the most wonderful kiss. I cannot stress this enough- it felt unreal. It couldn't have lasted for more than half a second, and yet time genuinely seemed to stop for me. I experienced the most intense feel-good butterflies l've ever felt. It seemed just like the movies and stories l've read; sparks seemed to fly around us in that moment.

It was such a beautiful, healing moment for me. To go from such horrible, gut-wrenching fear and trauma, to feeling over the moon in happiness is something I'll never forget."
245,0,"I gained a lot of weight after graduating high school and stopped fitting into most of my pants. After almost a year of having almost no actual pants left to wear and just dealing with awkward-fitting pajamas, I went thrifting, picked up 5 pairs of pants, and they all fit amazingly. I have pants! I like dressing nicely, so I’ve felt so insecure not having any clothes to wear apart from one ill-fitting pair of slacks and two pairs of sweatpants that are way too hot for my climate that I just gave up on the way I dressed and have largely stopped going outside or visiting people because I don’t have enough clothes to pack for more than a day or two at a time. This is huge for me. I no longer have to cycle between sweatpants that make me heatsick and a frumpy, too-short pair of slacks. I. Have. Pants! And now if I decide to lose weight, it’ll be out of choice, and not out of absolute necessity of needing to be able to fit into clothes that won’t make me heatsick when I go outside."
246,0,"The best way to keep happy calves is by providing them with hoppy entertainment, a young farmer says. Irish man and farmer Philip Stewart, 28, has come up with some creative ideas to keep his farm animals in high spirits.

His calves love to play with massive red space hoppers- which are usually used by children to bounce up and down on. The third generation farmer says toys that keep his animals occupied are paramount to their happiness.

He also fills small holed balls with hay so that the young cows have fun while feeding. The farmer, who has a Youtube channel documenting the antics of his family’s 400-acre farm, said: “Happy calves need enrichment, and the Temu space hopper - usually a children’s toy - is keeping the bulls entertained in the barn day and night.”

After completing his farming qualifications in 2016, Philip runs a farm with around 250 dairy beef calves. He wanted to put his own stamp on the family business - and one of his ideas was looking at different ways to acquire bulk products needed for its everyday running.

The farmer buys many supplies from online shopping platform Temu - including the space hoppers and hay balls. He also purchased products from the site that he found hard to access in the Irish midlands, such as a vaccine gun, 20 syringes and several bottles.

Philip said: “We use a large bag of syringes and bottles every week for multi-mineral shots and vaccines. But the local co-op usually sells vaccine consumables in batches of five or ten.

""We just need consumable quantities that work for our commercial scale – Temu had them and we got them fast. And when our dosing gun broke, we had spares ready to go. It was a lifesaver.

“Our friends and fellow farmers were sceptical at first, and now our friends are asking where we got everything.”"

Hi everyone. I am 23 M, been single all my life due to poor life choices and an unhealthy family setting but that's in the past. I've always run for stuff like it would complete me but never really knew what I actually wanted in life. 

Tried therapy and everything and the biggest question ever lingered - What did I truly want from life? 

The answer was seemed complex to me, maybe money, maybe fame, maybe attention and I ran in search of it - read books, watched videos on how to be a rizzler and some weird and embarrassing stuff then I met someone. We're not a thing atm but it made me realize what I wanted in life. 

The biggest question of my life was finally answered and it was something so simple I dismissed it casually but it was Love. 

Never got the love from my family that I needed nor from anyone else but this girl made me realize is that I do not crave superficial stuff but love and affection and someone to call my own. The post may seem cringe to many but I'm smiling while laying in bed with this thought in bed and happy that I finally found what I lacked in life. 

TLDR; Guy troubled entire life, doesn't know what he wants realized he needs love."

269,0,My loneliness can get the best of me but that feeling when I post and then start to have dialogue with another Redditor makes me feel so alive and human in a way that makes my heart leap. I feel seen and connected. I’m so thankful for this massive community of humans connecting with humans in ways that matter to one another about topics we enjoy. There’s really nothing like Reddit. And I’m thankful to the kind souls who reply to comments and say one things or write great advice or encourage you when you’re down. There are a lot of beautiful humans in the world and Reddit lets me find some of them—often at times I’ve needed it the most.

- I had a breakfast with my old firefighting crew after the dawn service. It was ice catching up with them and seeing what they're up to.
- My gorgeous wife and I went out to grab a cheeky acai on a cheeky acai date. It was nice spending time with her on a nice sunny day. A couple sat next to us and we had a little chat about their speciality made ANZAC biscuit/ custard creations. "

272,0,"The leaders were absent, living in their own bubble, and I've had too much work to do for too long. This was due to many new employees that were replacing the good colleagues I once had. The good work environment we once had was gone. 

After I resigned I'm so, so relieved. I feel physically better, my tension in neck and shoulders are almost gone, and I'm mentally much more at ease.

My new job pays less, but enough. Health and family time is more important. Many of my old colleagues that I loved working with is in the same, new company where I'm starting. "

275,0,"Wanted to take a moment to appreciate my happy annoyance and overstimulation.

I had a really *really* long and tiring day today, filled with cooking for fun for me and my lil cousin (stuff that many people in the family stole bites from and appreciated!), getting exasperated with doing technical stuff like filling in attendance and marksheets for SO MANY students for my mother, finishing my remote work and talking to clients, going to an exercise class, being irritated but spending time selecting pictures with care and sending my friend fashion inspo tips and reels, so on, so on.

And I sat down, sighing like a character does in movies, who finally gets rest after a whole day of chaos. I saw the time at 3 pm, realised only less than half the day had passed, and it is just the afternoon. I had an epiphany - you do get what you prayed for.

From days that went by too fast and were too short because I'd either wake up late due to depression and anxiety and sleep through my troubles, or days where I'd simply finish them by watching the same five shows under my blanket with no outside interaction. Days when men I dated or friends who were too busy caused me anxiety or heartbreak, or disgust. Days back, when I attached self-worth to the little downvotes on random Reddit comments. None of this matters tbh now.

Now, (again), I finally have people to fuss over, work to do, so many plans that I have the privilege to cancel, unread messages to return in an overflowing inbox of relationships I've cultivated with love and happy migraines to get. This is what heaven feels like and damn it took years to get. I have no plans of letting it go. Ever."

I tried to fix it but couldn't. Sitting there not knowing what to do, I realised that the battle was lost, so I discreetly called for my girlfriend.

She came in to the bathroom, I looked her dead in the eyes and said:

""What wasn't supposed to happen, happened"" while pointing my finger at the toilet.

She looked at it, started to laugh and said:

He used to stay with us when he was training with the police and  he would always give my son a pack of tim tams as payment for taking his room when he came over.

They're no longer manufactured and the bass counterparts were always rarer than the guitars, but my partner managed to find one and go get it for me!

289,0,"I wouldn't say I felt unhappy, but for a long time I felt a lack of motivation and a lack of meaning in life, like I was an incomplete person who did well enough but knew there was room for improvement. I decided recently to do something about it and just wanted to see if there was anyone who had similar feelings about life who could be with me on my journey, like a close accountability partner, I tend to do better when I have someone like that I can confide in. I made a simple post just talking about the kind of person I am like my faults, and what I desire in someone. I was expecting harsh criticism, sly remarks, and I did certainly get it from people, since the idea of anyone wanting a feeling of love in their life seems to tick people off and make them say the worst online, but to my absolute surprise someone came to me and offered. I mean it has not been that long at all but just the gesture made me feel special, and she has already been so much more comfortable for me to talk to than a lot of other people, I genuinely feel like I can relax around her and we can just enjoy talking and getting to know eachother, it is a truly amazing feeling. I want to be a better person just because she is in my life now, and just the thought of her throughout my day makes me make better choices, I just am really satisfied with life right now. Just meeting the right person flipped a switch in me to want to change. I am truly grateful to her and while I feel like I don't know the right things to say (most of the time) or I am awkward, I feel like she doesn't have a problem with that and understands. I fear I scare people away because of how attached I can feel, but I feel like it is mutual this time around. I don't know a lot about her yet but I think that feeling of walking into the unknown is exciting, putting my trust into someone and not doubting at all, and I want to get to know more about her day by day like uncovering a mystery. I think this may be the most i've ever been effected by a person in such a short amount of time, it's exhilarating for me. Words fail to express the happiness I feel right now, how content I am with the way things are. Anyways.. Just needed that off my chest, I obviously cannot send a 40 page document to her describing every facit of emotion I am feeling, but I figured others may benefit from this and it may be a motivation to them to brighten their day \^-\^"

- My beautiful wife and I were watching Chicago Fire as we started watching it as a joke and then we got hooked and invested. Anyway, two episodes in a row where someone dies and then the next someone gets trapped. I had a good friend and fellow firefighter die by a building collapse and it hit really hard. Watching this brought up memories, my wife, without hesitation asks is we should stop the show, skip it, just looking out for me. I love her so much. Little acts like that make me so happy and lucky.

So, cool thing happened after I got off of work today. I went through the drive thru of McDonald’s to get something to eat and I noticed that the car in front of me didn’t stop to order something at the intercom, he just skipped it and went to the paying window. I thought it was odd but decided to just forget about it. I ordered my food through the intercom and when I got to the paying window it turns out the person in the car in front of me paid for my food. I really didn’t expect that to happen, I told the employee that I would still like to pay for my food because it just felt wrong not to. The employee talked to the manager to see what they would do and said that If I wanted to I could pay for the person behind me in line. I agreed to it. As I got to the window to receive my food I noticed in my side mirror the people behind me thanking me, I waved back at them. It was a nice experience but I only wish that I got to say thank you to the individual who paid for my order. ☺️"

A lot of positive stuff has happened lately. I’m settling into my new job that has a more fixed schedule, I’m learning to avoid the compulsions of changing my name, gender and pronouns all the time and just focusing on what feels authentic to me. I’m settling on the best options possible for me, not the perfect one. I’m settling on a fursona for the first time in 8 years and not compulsively making another one because the one I made isn’t “perfect”. I’m settling with this account and not compulsively making another one because it isn’t “perfect”. Im learning to accept that I’m mostly attracted to men and not forcing myself to like women. I’m learning to avoid the urge to compulsively purge my discord servers and join them again one week after I leave. I’m following a healthy diet and getting in exercise. I’m finding hobbies that bring fulfillment and slowly getting over asking for assurance from AI and the internet. Most importantly I feel motivated to better myself. And I’m going up in my Luvox dose. "

* Now the blow out day!! We went to the Royal Easter Show with the family. man it was so much fun, we did so much, I really liked the Poultry, the chickens, ducks and geese were so cool. I patted a few giant geese on their heads and necks. I also scratched a few chickens.
* One of the geese honked at my daughter really loud and she screamed, we all laughed. So much fun.
* We saw sheep with massive bollocks! MASSIVE!! The whole crowd was commenting on them and it made me giggle.
* My son played the duck shooting game and got 4 out of 4 twice. What a crack shot! He was really happy with that, so was I. It was very impressive. 
* My daughter and her boyfriend went on some crazy rides and screamed the whole time, so funny!

305,0,"I don’t think I’ve ever said this out loud before, but I can finally say it and mean it: I’m happy. Not just momentarily, not just pretending — I’m truly content with where I’m at in life. I’ve wished for this for so long, and now that I’m here, it feels surreal.

It hasn’t been an easy journey. I’ve battled depression, mental health struggles, and navigated the storm of a toxic relationship with my mother. I’ve moved multiple times just to find peace, stability, and a sense of home. There were days I questioned if things would ever get better, if all this effort would be worth it. But I kept going. I chose healing. I chose myself.

Now, I’m in a stable living situation with a steady job, and I’m studying nursing — something I’m passionate about because I want to help others the way I once needed help myself. It’s a demanding path, but I’m sticking with it, and I’m proud of my progress.

I’ve also started focusing on my physical health — working out, eating better, taking it slow but steady. I finally have a gym I like and a workout plan that feels good. For once, I feel like I’m moving in the right direction in all areas of life.

Family-wise, I’ve set boundaries, and that’s given me peace. Personally, I’m connecting with someone who makes me feel safe, respected, and appreciated — things I used to only hope for. It’s still early, but I like the direction it’s going.

Most importantly, I’m proud of who I am. I’ve worked so hard to heal and grow. I’ve turned pain into purpose. For the first time in a long time, I don’t feel like I’m just surviving — I’m living. And it feels amazing.

If you’re still in the middle of your storm, please don’t give up. You might not see it yet, but your peace is coming. It is possible. I’m living proof.

Thank you for reading — I just wanted to share my joy with someone."
306,0,"My son very rarely sits still.  All day he will run around, knock things down, throw temper tantrums, etc.  

But at night, when I'm able, and we listen to music, he'll cuddle up with me and listen/watch music/videos.  Vermillion PT. 2  by Slipknot is one of his favorites. Other songs/music videos include ""More Than Words"" by Extreme, ""Creep"" by Radiohead, ""Hate Me"" by Blue October, ""I Can Feel A Hot One"" by Manchester Orchestra, and ""Topsy's Revenge"" by Grand Archives. 

There are plenty more acoustic/sad songs, but these songs he loves the most.  

I often feel like I've failed as a father and husband.  I work hard but I am underpaid; we live paycheck to paycheck.  I suffer from major depression and bipolar disorder.  

But I swear, when my son cuddles up next to me and just lays with me while any one of the above songs plays.... Everything melts away.  I cry because I am happy and not sad.

312,0,"I’m just very happy and wanted to talk about it to internet strangers (: I’m about to to tell a very summarized version of my life so sorry lol

I met my now fiancée, Sammy(29F) when we were in high school. We were very close friends and hung out all time until she moved away to another state. It was very sudden and it sucked for a while. I graduated college and moved on with my life until I met her again at the age of 26. We both caught up and I found out about her daughter, K, who at the time was only about 3 months old (won’t be sharing her real name). her bio father wasn’t involved. We stayed in touch and over time started dating. I eventually met her daughter who was a very happy 10 month old. I proposed to Sammy near the end of last year, and we had already moved in together at that point. I happily stepped up for the role of father for K, and she is now a chaotic and loud 3 year old.

Last night, K thought it would be a great idea to throw all of the clothes in her dresser on the floor. She giggled as she proudly presented her work to us. Her mother wasn’t as happy, and was already tired and stressed. I wanted to avoid a pissed fiancée, so I helped k put all her clothes back, which consisted of me doing most of the work. After we finished our cleanup, she looked me dead in the eye and said “thank you daddy!” Then ran off to the living room.

I was slightly stunned. I’ve always known I was her father figure, and I don’t know why it took me this long to realize that I actually had a baby girl now. This was the first time she ever called me daddy. I haven’t told anyone about it yet, And wanted to express my excitement right now. I love my soon-to-be wife and daughter so much. I just can’t wait to be a dad and raise this little girl."

314,0,"I live in an apartment at one point had a neighbor who put their keyboard in their bedroom closet (which shares a wall with my closet). I loved listening to them play at night but after a few years it seemed they had moved the keyboard, invested in headphones, or moved away. I really missed how it added a sort of parasocial, strangely moving atmosphere to warm summer nights with the window open where I could hear them from my bed. For an hour or so a few times a week I just got to love and admire a stranger just as a person I share the world with.

A few weeks ago, I heard a guitar. My keyboard neighbor is now, or was replaced by, a guitar guy. He sounded okay? Not confident or particularly seasoned but I could tell he was trying to hit the high note in Take On Me by A-ha. Bold choice.

The next couple weeks, same song and he's running through that chorus over and over again. I don't have it in me to be annoyed, I'm invested. This man is my favorite sport, I am his number one fan and I'm holding my breath every time he gears up to try for that note AND HE HITS IT! The crowd (me) goes wild (jumps up and punches the air)! We're both surprised and HE DOES IT AGAIN. *HE'S GOT IT FOLKS!*

I'll never tell him I'm listening, I don't want to ruin the magic happening here or add any additional pressure to perform. However, I'm excited for him. I'm happy to be his neighbor. I'm honored I get to attend his semi-regular concerts. "

317,0,"I've been overweight my entire life.
Every single time I go to buy clothes has been the worst day of my life. I can't find my size even in plus size stores, everything fits weird, everything looks like it's made for the elderly.
So I usually avoid shopping at all costs. 
I finally lost the weight over the course of the last year and decided to venture out to the store for the first time since, today. 
Every item I picked up and tried fit... 
I still cannot believe it. Every single item!!!! 
I know it's silly but it made me sooo happy within that I didn't leave the stores feeling terrible about myself and my body and was genuinely in a good mood.
I don't have anyone to share these kinds of thoughts with so here I am. "
318,0,"so, i just started a new school, after being homeschooled for 7 years. i'm a sophomore. when i first started i was literally so scared. welllll, today we had spring fling day, and the theme was anything but a backpack, and i won that. then, during water games we had a water balloon fight, and the softball coach came up to me and acted like i had the arm of a god and told me that next year i don't even really have to try out, i already have a spot. THEN, i went and played volleyball with some girls and the volleyball coach came up to me and told me i need to try out this May. THEN, during the relays i was told i was the fastest person there and the track coach said she was literally in awe of me. i've always been athletic, but bc ive never really been around other people i didn't know just how athletic i was. okay here comes the good part.

i have a 4.2 GPA and i just took my history final yesterday, and i was the only person in the class to get a perfect score. because of that i got tested for honors classes, and i passed!!! i don't start them until next year, but still im so happy about it. ik that most of you are thinking like ""what how is this the best day of your life?"", but you have to remember i was literally never around people, never had any chance to do this kind of stuff. i struggled with depression the entire time i was homeschooled, was on meds and everything. ever since ive been in school (1 and 1/2 months) i haven't had a single suicidal thought. another thing thats probably stupid, but i have like so many guys after me. like so many it's insane. idk all of this stuff just makes me feel really good. i'm going for student counsel next week. i really hope i get it. anyways yeah i just kinda wanted to talk all about my day and i didn't want to do it with anybody i know bc i don't want to seem too egotistical, so that's why im doing it anonymously 😅. i hate hate hate bragging about myself, this is like the only time i ever have. i just feel really happy about all of this.

I’ve been struggling with finding work but I went across the street to a ford dealership and asked if they’re hiring. Manager told me to apply online and I did. I really need a job so I pushed myself with the help from someone close to me and I went in person for an update. Manager pulled up my application, asked me a few questions and he’s going to forward my application to the higher up. Even if I may or may not get hired, I was pretty happy I pushed myself because I have AWFUL social anxiety.

I reconnected with a friend from high school, I’ve been having a lot dreams about my high school friends and I miss them a lot so I pushed myself to talk to one of them and now we added each other on discord.

I finally got check by a doctor last week too and I’m going the following week to get some lab work done. I want to find out the reason why I have brain fog. Also to check if theirs anything wrong with me.

I woke up at 6AM and was about to be late for work and ended up rushing out of the house without our normal morning goodbye and just didn't realize it. As I got into work I got these texts and it lit my day back up. She's awesome and I don't know what I'd do without her. 

Today could end up going terrible and I think I'd still come home happy. I'm glad I get to spend my life with this woman. We grew up 7,000 miles apart but now I don't even want to leave the house without her. The human experience is weird like that I guess.

I went with a buddy and we both had separate chances to talk with him one on one. I was the last person in line to get a pic/sign stuff and was very lucky to chop it up with him for a few minutes. I was absolutely star struck but kept myself together enough to have a decent conversation with the man lol. My buddy ran into him in the bathroom as the place was closing up and told me that he stopped at the door after drying his hands to keep talking with him. Amazing guy.

No matter how far you’ve gone in one direction, you’re allowed to turn around. Life doesn’t come with a deadline for change. You can begin again at 25, 40, or 65. Whether it’s walking away from what no longer serves you, healing from the past, or chasing something you thought you missed your chance at, starting over is a sign of strength, not failure.

You’re not behind. You’re just beginning a new chapter, and that’s a powerful place to be."

* Had breakfast with a good friend. Caught up on the happenings over the past few days and just general chit chat. Some people are good people and are easy to talk to and actually listen. It was great to hear him talk about his meeting and how he got to hang with the Superintendent. Making a great impression.

334,0,"My stepdad's mom was the best lady. Cute little Canadian woman who was the polar opposite of the elder Mississippian women I was used to. We got on like a house on fire and she got me into drinking hot tea while I lived in Canada. She had a collection of individual antique teacups and this one was my favorite, so she gave it to me. It got lost to hurricane damage the year after it was given to me and I've scoured the internet and various antique stores for another. I even found a smaller cup and saucer (demitasse) with the same couple and bought that.

Then, last week I entered one of the same search strings I've been using for years into Etsy, where I have been entering it for years, and there was the cup for eleven bucks. It even came from a Canadian seller. I bawled like a baby when I opened it."

And the guy was just really nice in general. We spoke about things for a few minutes, but it was a great interaction.

341,0,"I’ve felt this way for a long time, kinda hovering or trapped in my own head and thoughts and my own toxic behavior. A lot has happened to me in those years that made me feel unsafe to share those thoughts or let me feel like I could fully express my everything. Until recently. I’ve cleared out negative people in my life, set more clear boundaries, reexamined my feelings towards the people who I thought were against me for a long time and now have a better relationship than ever with them, I’m single for the first time in a long time and for once I’m actually starting to like myself. I’m starting to want to draw more and get back to the things I used to love, reimagining things and making them better, making more music. I was in such a weird place that I didn’t even have that many dreams but lately it’s been one after the other, all of them vibrant and giving me more hope for the future. I don’t think I’m really ready to date again quite yet but I’m so happy that im taking this time to really explore me as a person. I know this is a very self indulgent rant but I feel like I have to take more ownership of what I’m feeling and tell more people and make it feel more real that this is where I am. Thank you for listening!! I don’t know what the future holds but right now. I’m happy :)"
342,0,"It's been 7 years of me going to this restaurant, and they always give me freebies whenever they saw me coming. This day, the delivery guy from this restaurant suddenly knocks on my door and gave me my favorite food that I always order. At first, I thought they've got the wrong address and I clarified that I didn't order anything. Turns out, it is free from the local restaurant because they notice that I always order one specific food and most of the time this dish is always out of stock. 

Now, I am thinking if I should celebrate my college graduation here too since I already celebrate my high school graduation in there lol

Anyway, this is the first time I feel wholesome because someone did something like this for me. Thank you my humble local restaurant!"

348,0,"A few months ago, I was kinda a TikTok refugee and somehow ended up on RedNote. It was honestly pretty wild—at the time, the app didn’t even have a translation feature. But I still managed to connect with people there using super basic English. There were barely any ads, and it felt like this weird little peaceful corner of the internet. Then I came across this story that honestly gave me chills (in a good way). There’s this guy from Mississippi named Brecken—he posted for the first time on RedNote with a picture of him and his 14-month-old daughter, just saying “hi.” And out of nowhere, thousands of Chinese users replied with photos of their own families. It totally blew up. One of the top replies came from a Chinese family called “A Tiu,” and they actually became friends. Brecken and his family were so touched by the connection, they decided to fly to China to meet them......

During the pandemic and especially the last couple of years, they’ve helped me cope with a lot of changes that have happened in my life.  I truly appreciate how they’re music helped me turn my pain into something more productive and worth doing.  Meeting some of the members was truly a blessing and how nice they each were to me.  It was recently my birthday on the 3rd and I thank them for helping me get to that point each year.  The stories they tell through their music have made an impact on me and the person I try to be others.

Outskirts of a big city so pretty popular with a lot of local college students etc. This group of 4 young men (maybe 18-22?) were hanging out talking about the MLB (for non-Americans, that’s our pro baseball league) games from earlier that day. One of the guys was pretty clearly autistic/Asperger’s and seemed to be close to one of them. He didn’t seem to really understand and didn’t add anything to the baseball convo but all the guys kept explaining the baseball news in terms of trains - which seemed to be the other guy’s special interest. They mentioned an upset and one of them said “Josh, that’s like a steam engine beating one of those fast Japanese trains in a race” and he got pretty excited. It was just super cool to see they were including him and taking the time to explain everything they were talking about in familiar terms.

 I recently moved back in with my dad and they have severe allergies, so Scooter and my other cat stay in my room. 

I left my house and let my brother go pet him in my room, as long as he kept the door closed. My brother accidentally left the door cracked, and the family dog got in, scaring  scooter, who found his way into the walls. I tried everything, wet food, water, litter by the hole in the wall. Eventually, there was a smell in the house and I accepted and mourned him, and it absolutely killed me.

Earlier today, I walked into the bathroom, where the hole was, and he was standing by the tub, scared out of his mind, skin and bones, before he ran back into the wall, but stayed right next to the hole.

Wet food worked this time, and he let me just carry him on back to my room, scared as he was, and immediately got to work on the water bowl lol. 

Im so incredibly happy, my boy is back and cuddly as ever, still adjusting but alive.

Tl,dr: cat got scared into the wall, ""died"", and then found his way out three weeks later, skinny but just as sweet, and I'm the happiest cat dad in the world right now."

363,0,"Hello everyone! Recently i made a post here about how excited i am for my 18th birthday party with friends. Long story short, i decided to invite two of my friends (let's name them T and S) over to my house on monday, a day after my birthday. My family was going to go somewhere so we can party on our own. 
Here's how it went:
We met up near my house to go buy wine. They gave me a bouquet of tulips and a present which i checked out later. We arrived at the convenience store and picked a bottle of wine as well as one energy drink (energy drinks are also only legal from 18yo in my country). We went to the cash register and obviously i was asked to show my ID. I showed it immediately and what the cashier said kind of shocked me. ""It's obviously a forged ID"" she said. I gave it to her so she can check it out properly but she said ""there should be a flag in the corner"". I told her that maybe it's not there because the ID was made in 2018. She was not convinced, but another lady from the store came and said there doesn't have to be a flag. I also showed my legitimation and she finally sighed and sold me the stuff. We laughed at it on our way to my house. I had earlier inflated two huge colorful ballons that said '1' and '8' and hanged it next to each other. I also hanged some more ballons and i set the whole table with food and party things like sparklers, glow sticks, party hats, party trumpets and so on. I also washed the wine glasses and put them on the table. So it looked real party-like. I was so excited when we arrived. My friends bought me a special party hat that i put on immediately. They put on their party hats and sat down on the couch. I put the wine on the table and went to the kitchen. I pulled the birthday cake out the fridge, lighted my candle in the shape of '18' and carried it to the room. They started clapping and singing happy birthday. They recorded me blowing out the candles too. After that, i cut the cake and gave everyone a piece. We were dining and then we remembered the wine. We opened it and i poured everyone a glass. I put only a little bit in mine, just to taste it. I didn't like it as expected, but my friends did and that made me happy. I then decided to get another wine that my parents bought the other day (they allowed me to share it). It had a cork and none of us had any idea how to open it, even with the cork opener. Finally we figured it out and we were super happy. I didn't like the taste of this one as well and according to my friends it wasn't that great either, but they did drink some. We then had a long photo session. We took LOTS of photos, some while holding two wine bottles. It was SO FUN!!! We used the glow sticks, glow rings and sparkles. I also blew some bubbles for the photos. We turned the music on, turned the lights off and turned on a small disco ball that I prepared. We danced and sang. One of my friends started drinking the wine i bought straight from the bottle and got a bit drunk, but it wore off after an hour or so. Later i checked out the present i got from T and S. I got a my favorite sweets, a 100$ GIFTCARD to a mall and A SILVER BRACELET WITH MY INITIAL AND A LUCKY CLOVER!!! I was genuinely so happy and i hugged them. A couple hours i texted my mom that she, dad and my brother can come back home since we partied enough and it was late already. We cleaned up a bit and soon my family came back as we were getting ready to leave. We then went to T's house and i on the way i bought them both energy drinks. The cashier didn't have any problem with my ID. We arrived at T's house and told their parents everything about how the party went. Soon S's parents picked her up and since it was late, i too left after a while. I went home all happy and even today, a day after the party, i am very happy. Truly, it might be the most fun I've ever had. I'm so glad my 18th birthday was so special. :D

PS: the party with my aunt and uncle went super awesome too. I got awesome gifts and they were super kind and funny. My dad was in another city at the time, and i was kinda sad he wasn't going to be there on my 18th birthday. My mom texted him that I'm sad, but he already decided he's not going to come because his work will get delayed and i didn't try to convince him earlier, so now he had no way to come. But guess what - he caught the train last minute, paid 20$ more for the ticket, stood in the train for 2 and a half hours (there were no seats left) and surprised everyone as he entered the house with a bouquet of 9 roses. I WAS SO HAPPY he literally did all that just for me even though he knew he'd have to go back the next day. We used to have a not-so-good relationship but recently he really became a dad, not just a father. And the fact that he did that for me just shows he really cares and I'm overjoyed!!! :DD"
364,0,"* The lounge we purchased got delivered nice and early so I had all day to put it together.
* The delivery guys put the new lounge in our lounge room, they didn't have to as they only had to put in on the driveway, but they put it in our house which was really nice of them.
* No client work today so I got to chill and focus on my lounge (as you can see, todays post is mostly nah, all about the lounge!)
* I needed some help with the final stages of my lounge construction, I called my mate up and within 5 minutes he was reversing up my driveway and helping me out. we bounced ideas, got to work. figured it out and made the whole project solid. A few jokes about screwing tight and laughs and next minute, lounge is done and we're watching the Telly.

365,0,"A few months ago I nailed a job interview at a language school and today I had my first class. 

I spent an hour with 1st and 2nd graders trying to convince them that learning English can be really fun.

I was so nervous I almost threw up. Then I had some parents who wanted to watch the class and it made me even more scared. Also the kids were so smart I had to improvise harder tasks for them lol 

but my god, it was so worth it!!!!

I always said I wouldn't be good at teaching and stayed away from giving private lessons, and honestly getting this job made me realize this was a dream I didn't even know I had 

I have 3 more days of similar classes and I can't wait!!!

(I'd also like to give myself bonus points for finding myself around the kids' school and being brave enough to ask someone for help) "

369,0,"I don’t wanna dive deep into my childhood and make this any longer than I want it to be but I was always a people’s person. 


I lacked in recognising what I actually do, so I never understood or got why people thought I helped when I didn’t think I even did much? All I did was listen, I’d advise people about their situation and sometimes see it through with them till its end, till they’re okay and all good. 9 Years of listening and being the therapist caused me to have mountains of buildup in me. I noticed my behaviour was starting to become shifty, I was struggling, I’d find myself so upset and frustrated all the time but I just had no idea why. I’d have extreme ups and downs, I was unpredictable, unstable and angry. The confusion was driving me insane, I lost sight of who I was as a person, I was no longer able to determine whether I was someone fun or did I like subtle or what? Most the time I’d go for quiet and subtle cuz that was the only time I might get a minute for myself. But I’m more fun and interesting than I thought I was and having to find out about it now kinda makes me feel bad for missing out on me, but never too late!! 😋


I have a close relationship with my family, so I sat them down and for once I wanted to be heard, for once I wanted to speak out rather than the never ending blabbering I listened to all the time. I laid it all out there, I explained my feelings of confusion, anger and worry my soul is being broken down. I talked about literally everything. 



 After maybe a whole day or two worth of conversations, I decided I was gonna get my life back and own it relentlessly. I started with letting go, as in completely abandoning anything and everything that doesn’t serve me right. I don’t have to explain why I don’t wanna do something or why I’m a certain way or why I do the things that I do. I did it. I left and blocked people no matter what the fuck their mental state was cuz that’s their own responsibility, grow up and get the hell out of my way. For the people I might’ve felt bad for, I sent a clarification of no longer being interested in the connection and I was GONE. I left places that weren’t doing me any right, I cleaned up my social life and my whole life too to literally just end this, to just create my own space. I’m no longer a therapist or the friend some people desperately want in this life, man the hell up and do something about yourself cuz quite frankly I no longer give a shit. This is more relieving than you could ever imagine, I feel like there’s actual space in my head, I can think for myself, I can breathe. I can waste my whole day playing a game that upsets me cuz I keep on losing but I’m enjoying it million times more than being overwhelmed with paragraphs after paragraphs about things that don’t matter to me. I don’t care about people’s presence anymore, you got fucked up? What can I do about it 🤷🏻‍♀️


I’m taking a break right now, enjoying things I love, doing whatever I think about doing, having fun with my loved ones and I couldn’t be happier. I’m so relieved, so grateful and so excited for the new chapter to come. I’m not receiving anything right now, I just want my brain to settle and breathe for itself. When I’m done with my break I’ll only direct my energy, attention and efforts to God, myself and my loved ones, I must learn how to navigate friendships healthily now but for the time being I won’t allow anything to interfere with my energy. I deserve a fulfilling life, I deserve my own self and I deserve to be heard. If your life is not that good please get a therapist or talk to chatgpt, don’t depend and become over reliant on that listener friend cuz sooner than later they’ll get so lost in that fog and you don’t wanna be around them when they get the fuck out of it too. Anyways peace!! 😌✌🏻💜"

Yesterday, I was hired for my dream job. And I’m not talking about a job that I like.

I cant really talk about it with people in my life because I dont want to come off as bragging but he is just so incredible. Sweet, gentle, kind, understanding, tuned in, caring, funny, strong, handsome, reliable... the list goes on and on. He has supported me through some truly unthinkable things and his love has transformed me as a person. My birthday was this past weekend and he made the whole weekend about us celebrating. He never keeps score or reminds me of when he made a sacrifice for her. He never belittles or puts me down. We dont even fight (just have really intense and challenging conversations which force us to see other perspectives and de-personalize the other persons actions). He is my best friend.

He is so much more than I could ever imagine a husband to be. I am so so so grateful to be his wife.

I have no idea how to show him/make him know just how much he means to me. I tell him and try to show him every single day. Hes snoring next to me right now and he just squeezed my leg in his sleep and it makes me smile so much. "

My mom said I'll still get a cake and that my aunt and uncle will come to visit. That made me happy, but i wanted to celebrate it with my friends too. I didn't know if i wanted to spend it with just my best friend or invite some other friends as well. If i invited more people it would probably cost more money... so I was thinking a lot and became troubled by what should i do. Finally i got a perfect idea. I decided that the next day (a day after my birthday) i will invite 3 of my friends over to my house (unfortunately it became 2 as one of them is going on a trip on that day). I offered to buy whatever alcohol they want (i probably won't drink anyway because i don't like the taste of alcohol). They chose wine. Tbh I'm super excited to buy it, not because i want to drink it, but because you have to be 18 to buy it nad I've NEVER bought anything that i couldn't buy legally. So it's gonna be my first ""you have to be 18"" purchase and i can't wait to pull out my ID when the cashier asks for it (especially since I don't really look 18). I'm so excited!!!!

At one point even waiting 2.5 years to hear from a team until i was told by them i was lost in their system because the person who did my assessment left the position before submitting my paperwork.

i moved out of my parents place into supported living in 2021 and spent about 3 years ""living free"" thinking i didnt need my meds anymore and that therapy was a waste of time because of how much i got fucked around but about 4 months ago i realised how much i was still struggling and searched for help because my behaviour was really damaging relationships i cared about and my own mental health

but after only a few weeks, i have new medication and my first therapy session in 3 weeks, im going to the gym regularly (which i mever thought id do), i have my own place and i have a new found family.

397,0,"Hello!

As the title says, I used to game a lot which in turn made me spend a lot more money on those video games. My excuse was that those video games where my ""hobbies"", that I did not smoke or drink thereby it was normal and that I had every right to basically spend that money on those stupid games. But the reality is that I was spending too much, and as someone who didn't have a job and just savings I had a grim wake up call eventually.

The issue starting when I got into MMORPGS, I was spending a lot of money, 400-500 euros a month on just those games, leaving me with only 50-100 euros to get food pretty much every month. My addiction spiralled out of control a few months ago which prompted me to use most of my life savings on a game called lost ark.

Lost ark is a korean mmorpg, and essentially the reason why I'd spend so much money is because of RMT. I'd basically spend money and since I was never caught breaking TOS and neither was any of my friends, I justified it in my brain that it was more and more worth to spend money since I got way bigger value than I did purchasing goods from the in-game store.

I basically created a lie that I was supporting individuals that needed to make a living from the game, which wasn't true, i was just feeding my self lies to feel better for myself, which was honestly a toxic trait of mine, and would definitely feed into future issues as I grew older.

Either way, My family realized my issues when they realized my bank account was draining abnormally quick. It got to the point where i'd siphon my money through crypto and lie to familly that I was just investing, and that I lost my money in investments.

Either way, My ex-gf, which god bless her convinced me to get into rehab regarding this matter with a fairly well known clinical psychologist in my area, which was expensive, but helped me massively with my issues. It took months of therapy but I am now cured of these accursed shackles of over-spending on shit that will not make my life better, but make someone elses life better.

I just had to realize that lost ark wasn't everything, sadly I lost the love of my life, but I am happy to see my self becoming a better person. Me and her are still friends, she is just scared in case I drop into my habbits again, so we decided to give distance until we can be sure I won't relapse, but I made sure to take the necessary steps to cut out mmorpgs from my life, and any gatcha related games, and stick to only single pllayer games without micro transactions.

Special thanks to Elden ring and black myth wukong, they helped during my therapy. It made me realize that games with micro transactions are not the only fun games. I grew up playing games with micro transactions since I was 8. Starting with old dragons nest on ipad, moving to AQW \[Adventure quest worlds, a browser game\] and then moving to other mmos such as, black desert, revolation online, AION, TERA ETC. 

Micro transactions are quite the poison if exposed from yough.

I hope that if any of you suffering from what I have suffered are able to get through this, and managed to get over your addictions. It can be quite tough if you do not have a supporting figure, but I really do hope that you see that it's slowly taking away the one thing you have left, and that is yourself.

Stay strong lads, I am glad I am free, and more than happy I managed to fix my self. 

Thank you for taking your time to read my post.

Take care. "
398,0,"Hello everybody!

To start, I used to just be your average standard white male, I was quite lost however from a young age because I did not really know what I wanted to do with my life.

High school was never really a fun time for me, I hated studying and in general had okay grades but in my IGCSES, and A levels, not really in school exams, those had been a disaster. I just kinda refused to follow the system because my professors didn't really treat me as a person it felt like, more like a pest?

Either way, I decided to apply to a local uni and managed to get into their psychology bachelor degree. I have to say that I never really wanted to study psychology, I always loved economics but was never really good at it, but nonetheless I tried my best and ended up receiving a 3.1/4 GPA which is quite good i'd say!

I started uni during 2020, and ending now in 2025, in my country its normally 4 years, but I had quite a few issues with my health during 2023-2024, which caused me to take fewer classes thereby extending my degree time. 

Either way, I am now doing my thesis, and finishing up this semester. I am quite happy with what I have achieved, mostly because I did not really think I'd amount to anything. I am of course a bit scared for the future, especially about my masters or if I want to work, or what to do really. 

But I really do wanna keep moving forward. Right now I am suffering with a weight issue, have been for my whole life, but in general I believe getting work for a year and focusing my main goal to losing the extra weight I have might be a priority than going for my masters.

Either way, feels kinda good that I managed to get my life into a certain path or to mean something really. A lot of males I am sure are also feeling lost as well as women, never give up brothers and sisters, hope we can all unite during these troubling times, and I hope you all find something that also makes you happy in life!"
399,0,Saturday was my really good friend’s birthday brunch. She loves the beach. These past few weeks I have been having a really tough time personally with my father being sick.

Lots of fun times, me with a beard, me and my good mates getting on stage with HUGH BLOODY JACKMAN!! that was back in 2019 but I found a video. So good to go down memory lane and see everyone younger, my kids, my wife, and my poor pup, Amy. I'm not going to post any other update today as I want to end it on how awesome Amy was. She was a jack Russell, crossed with a Staffy. They called her a Jaffy, I called her a wombat. She would chase soccer balls around and control them better than I could. She had the best nature, loved sitting with us and loved being walked and let loose in a park. Everyone needs an Amy. She was so great. "

Then 6-7 hours college, engineering studies, entrance exam studies (for masters), mini projects, practical files etc etc. Listening to them helps. 

And these two are probably only people who make me feel loved. I would have given up if not for them. "

Since I've had to restart my life literally from ground zero again, I'm slowly achieving my goals one by one and it feels so good!! 

Edit: I bought this by completing offers on offer apps like True Finance and Copper. My first paycheck at my new job is next Friday. This week will be my second week at work. No, this isn't an ad for them, lol. Just wanted to share how I achieved my goals.

Edit 2: Wow, just 2 hours after sharing how happy I am after achieving my goals, the guy that's letting me stay in their home has a knock on the door. It's his landlord. Telling him that he's ""Sorry, but he's evicting him because at the end of next month he's selling the house to his daughter. Giving him until the 2nd week of April to find a new place to live. 

There once would have been a day that if I had heard that news, I would have just completely shut down, depressed, anxiety, feeling sorry for myself. But today, today those words gave me motivation. Motivation to keep moving forward, one foot in front of the other. I'm going to come up with some kind of plan, and ask the guy that's letting me stay here if we can work together and find another place together. That way, it's not as bad financially for the both of us. Life just threw us a nasty curveball but I have faith we're going to hit a home run! "

Don't get me wrong my mother was a good mom, always cared for us as best she could, but perpetuated the mistakes and poverty she grew up in. This was something I could not allow for myself or the life I wanted. I didn't excel in high school, but I wasn't dumb. I received a college scholarship for a 4-year engineering school based on my academics, that I grew up in poverty, and let's be honest, probably because I was a minority as well. My first semester at college was not a great one as I almost failed out because  I got caught up in the newness of it all (e.g, drinking, partying, being free, etc.). Unlike many of my peers, I didn't have family money to fall back on. So it was a wake up call. The following 3.5 years I killed it, recieving my B.S in Electrical Engineering.

When I graduated and started working, I was still lost a bit, but had the drive to utilize the Company i joined to my benefit. I got them to pay for my Masters in Eng. and subsequently my MBA. Around the time of my MBA I met my lovely wife, wh, like m,  grew up very poor; unlike me did not find the opportunities I had. However, this woman was the love of my life instantly because we connected on a level and vision in life you could not believe. She just never had the opportunities I had. So obviously we married, and 5 years later had a first born and subsequently 3 years later, our second. 

At this point, I have risen to a significant position of leadership in the Company i had stated with after college (12 years ago now). It is clear I now garner expertise internally and externally through my academics and industry acumen that means I will have gainful employment until I retire (even if move to another company).

 My salary awards me the opportunity to do something I could have never dreamed of when I was a kid. I have not only the flexibility with work to take vacations as I see fit but the funds to, on very short notice, take my family of 4 to Disney, Disney cruises, spontaneous trips, etc. I'm not rich, but we don't have to worry about losing our home, where our next meal is coming from, of we are saving enough for retirement, etc.

I dont say this to boast, but simply that as of right now 11:52 pm on the East cost of the United States I am crying tears of joy that the conversation i had with my self almost 20 year ago about what I wanted to accomplish and provide myself and my future family with has come to fruition. I cannot be any happier than I am right now.

I hope others find these opportunities as well!"

419,0,"my situation with my exes and friends since December 2024 really messed me up. I started seeing life in black & white. I had no hope, I hated people, and I just wanted to stay away. I carried the pain people inflicted on me everywhere I went.

I also hated being “by myself.” I couldn’t stand the fact that people wouldn’t show up for me—I didn’t understand why I was the only one showing up for myself. So I took people with me everywhere, from the gym to Reddit to friends, just trying to fill that space.

But now? I feel lighter. There’s a lightness within me. I’ve finally healed, and I’m finally okay.

I see life in colour again. I walk in faith, in belief. I show up for myself. I’ve stopped making everything about me and realised that life isn’t happening to me—it’s happening for me.

I really pray everyone reaches this stage—this stage of possibility, this stage of peace. And above all else, hope & joy."

The bride would like us to choose a dress style that we like from a local South African bridesmaid shop in the colour that she has picked out (a gorgeous champaign colour).

I felt despondent after the call because business is currently so slow that I'm needing to cut anything non-essential... I didn't know how to even think about adding the cost of a really pricey bridesmaid dress to the mix. I resolved to hope and trust that things would work out. I wouldn't let this be the bride's concern. 

The bride and I had our catch up call today and inevitably chatted about the wedding. She  offered to cover the cost of my bridesmaid dress as she was aware of how things have been going with work for me. We'll work out a way for me to pay her back when business picks up again later this year. 

I'm so ridiculously overjoyed by the kindness, consideration, and simple awesomeness. I will get to be a part of her day and celebrate this sweet, strong woman that I have the privilege to call my friend. "

428,0,"One Year 

Each year on this day I usually make a sláinte and happy birthday Pops post on the socials. Not today. Well, still happy birthday and I love you Pops, but times have changed old man. I did something that you never figured out how to do. 

Today marks a year that I decided I was done drinking. I don't want or deserve any kudos for it, so please don't give them to me. It has not been difficult at all and I don't miss it in the slightest. It's honestly been arguably the easiest big decision I've ever made in my life, and this past year my decision has been reinforced countless times as I have watched many others, too damn many, people that I love so fucking much, destroy their lives with substance abuse. None more than alcohol. It has been horrible to watch happen and to be so powerless to stop it.   

What I do want to talk about is how crazy it is the way people behave when they find out you don't drink. With no other substance do people behave in the same manner as alcohol. When you say, ""I don't drink"", everyone asks you ""Why?!"", or ""Are you an addict?"", ""In recovery?"", or any number of other similar questions, and they then almost universally encourage you to join them and imbibe. 

Why is that? 

Nobody ever even asks if you do heroin, crack, or whatever. If they did for some reason ask, and you replied in the negative, nobody would ask why you don't, like you're somehow weird for not doing so. Alcohol is one of the worst drugs we have (the worst?) and the most common life destroyer among us, yet we are treated as though you're a social outcast if you choose not to use it and we celebrate its use in media, entertainment, and society at large. It's so fuckin weird. 

Yes, I have been guilty of that behavior too. In fact, I am personally responsible for one of the people that I love most on this planet starting down that path of alcohol abuse. Something that I will never forgive myself for. She got out, fortunately, but not before it almost ruined her life, and then my continued use was a huge factor in me losing her. One of the most wonderful people I've ever known and the best and most loyal person that I have ever had in my life. 

I'm so sorry. 
 
But I digress. 

I have had close friends, and even relatives, spend significant time trying to convince me to drink with them at gatherings, holidays, to go out to drinking with them, whatever. When I decline they ask me ""What's wrong?"", and ""Don't you want to have fun?"", or, or, or. I've thought about it a lot, both my past behavior in this regard, and watching others since I quit, and it seems to me that we are looking for affirmation that we are doing the right thing by drinking. That when someone isn't drinking with us, that it shows us in a negative light, holds up a mirror we don't want to look in, and maybe puts doubts as to the correctness of our behavior. I don't know, maybe I am way off, but whatever it is that causes it, it's a real thing. It's fuckin wild to watch happen. 

Anyways, I am not ""sober"", and I am not here saying that I will never drink a drop again, but I cannot imagine a reason that I would do so and I certainly will never again make drinking or being a fuckin drunk part of my identity. 

Decades late, but I have finally decided to let go of my trauma and just live this life I have. I have never felt freer, during the worst and hardest year of my life, THE FUCKING WORST, I have been happier than I have ever been. I know that would not be true had I been drunk. 

I'm not here to judge you, or to ""tell"" you to quit, but if you've considered that you might want or need to do so, I would encourage you to give it a shot. 

""Not drinking has given me everything alcohol promised.""

It’s been two months since I landed my first job and six months since I graduated. Back in college, I devoted 100% of my life to studying. I remember crying on the bus to university because, at the time, my life felt so bitter. I had no self-love or self-respect. Whenever a girl showed interest in me, I pushed her away, thinking she deserved someone better, someone who wasn’t just buried in books. But life is getting better. I met a really sweet girl, and we’ve been dating for a month now. Yesterday, I told her I’d be late because I had to take my mom somewhere, and she replied, ""Okay\~, I’m waiting for you in our bed."" That message made me so happy! Not just because of the intimacy, but also for the simple yet incredible feeling of knowing that someone is waiting for you after a long day.

Life has been good lately :')"

I recommended Terraria, and it turns out he’s a huge fan of the game, thank god. 
I had such a fun experience teaching him how to mod it, selecting some stuff he might like. And then some general useful stuff. He seemed so enthusiastic, having never modded the game before. He was excited like a child. Granted, so was I.

Unfortunately I had to go to work really soon after. We only had one hour or so.
But he texted me after that telling me he wanted to do it again ASAP. Tonight even. 

My mind has been sapped to that idea now for a good handful of hours now. It’s childish, getting so happy over a game of all things. But he makes it seem 10X more fun to play, just being around for it. I don’t know how he does it."

My maximum old distance I could normally go in the car before this week was roughly .4 miles, or 3 minutes in the car. This week I've gone the following distances and places.

Grocery store multiple times I havent been at in over 6 years, 1.2miles 5 mins one way  
Outback Steakhouse for a 2-3 hour sit down dinner also 6+ years, 1.9 miles 6 mins one way  
Gas Station I've never been to .8 miles, 2 mins one way  
Chinese food sitdown dinner, 1.2miles, 4 mins one way  
Bass Pro Shop 4.1miles, 13 mins one way  
Drug store 1.5miles, 4 mins one way  
Burger joint, 1.5miles, 5 mins one way  
Card shop, 3.9 miles 9 mins one way  
Social security **6.8 miles, 18 mins one way**

In the dark, he sleeps like a log, but his wagging tail gives it away (he thinks he's sly). It's a game we've been playing for months. The morning strolls last for 20-30 mins, ending only when he decides to poop. It's a small victory for me. Today, Goku had different plans. He took 50-55 mins, but didn't do the ""doody duty"". When all hopes were lost, we decided to take a selfie. He's proud of it.

443,0,"How do you even respond to such a statement?
It’s something my best friend had told me recently. He and I were kind of in our feels playing a game, chatting about life and our previous experience with people.

He told me I changed his view on how he wants to be treated, and I feel all the same as him. But when he told me that, I felt really self-conscious. I’m not very confident in myself at all. 
Hearing that made that feel even worse. Like steering a plane off-course when it was perfectly fine the way it was going. He and I are pretty open with each other, so I told him as much.

I told him hearing that scared me a little. That I didn’t feel I could provide much to him, for him to say something like that. And that’s when he told me, well, that. That we don’t necessarily need to give each other anything for our friendship to matter. 

I could have cried at the time. Thinking of it even now makes me feel some kind of way. 
My only hope is to fully tell him the extent of what he’s meant to me, over our years-long friendship. Over these three months of fully-committed, dependent love. Thinking of him when I sleep, fireworks when I text him, helping each other through each long, hard day’s work.
I want him to know that I long to meet him in person, tackle him to the ground, show affection I’ve never been able to show.

Fuck. I know what he said, but I want to give him so much more than I do. He can tell me all he wants that he needs nothing from me, yet I can only feel in that I’ve never given enough, or anything for that matter.
I pray to whatever god there might be my feelings can reach him someday. I know this is something I’ll never be able to tell him. I’d probably sound crazy. Obsessed. But I don’t care.

He has reshaped my serotonin filter, putting himself at the front of it all. He tells me the feeling is mutual. 

I really, really hope that’s true."

My brother shared his with his GF who is from California and lived in a small farming community that was majority Mexican, they said it was absolutely amazing and that it tasted like ""real authentic Mexican food"" and ""reminded her of home"" which made me so damn happy because that is the top notch compliment one can receive about food.

The other day at work(I work at a large retail store) I was ringing up a woman who was buying a large suitcase. I asked her if she was going on a trip soon, and she said yes, but instead of a happy excited expression on her face, she looked stressed. 

“I’m going to be gone for two weeks, and I don’t know how to do that. I don’t know how to be gone and away from home for that long.” She told me.

“Can I give you a piece of advice?” I said to her. She said please. I told her “It sounds simple, but just enjoy yourself. Whatever happens at home will be there when you get back, whether you’re stressing about it or not. So just enjoy yourself, wherever you are, whoever you’re with, whatever you’re looking at in that moment. Just enjoy it.” 

She paused and stared at me, like she was processing what I just said to her. “You know… I never thought of it like that.” I then watched as the stress and fear drained from her face and was slowly replaced with a sense of calm. “I think I’m going to do just that. I’m going to enjoy myself.”

It was clear that throughout whatever this random woman buying a suitcase was going through, not one person around her has ever told her to slow down and enjoy the ride. I can only hope that she does have the best two weeks away from home, and that her happiness can be found and spread, and that ripple effect continues. 

You never know what people are going through, and how just a simple reminder to enjoy every moment can truly transform the world around you. That small seed of positivity planted in someone’s heart can grow and bloom into a garden of happiness."

I wanted him to sleep since he had work in a few hours and I didn’t want him going in tired. So when he went a quiet, I think he ran out of things to say, I started to sing You Are My Sunshine. He initially protested it, telling me he was no damn baby and whatnot.

But I kept going. Eventually he went completely silent, and after 10 minutes of him not saying anything, it was clear he had fallen asleep. I muted myself and stayed on call with him all night long. It’s so cute, guys. It is actually hard to put into words the fluttery feeling I got from that, and how embarrassed he was when he woke up."
453,0,"* I took time out of my day to spend time with my daughter as she wanted to go shopping for her friend's birthday present. We went for a drive, had lunch, went to a few shops and talked the whole time, I really like spending one on one time with my kids and because she's my eldest and over 18, she's out a lot so finding this time can be difficult.
* I had a lead turn into a sale, it is going to be a good one as it is for the local rotary club, I am going to do it at cost as it is to raise money to bring awareness against violence against women in our local community. I want to help out as much as I can. Really happy that they chose me out of all the web designers in our area.
* I had such a fun time in chat with some old and new friends, lots of big belly laughs and just fun dumb stuff, I really enjoyed chatting with everyone today. Lot's of good fun, dumb times.
* Even though my wife and I both had a very busy day, we finally found 10 minutes at the end of the day to sit and talk and cuddle on the couch, we watched dumb reality TV and enjoyed each other's company. Great way to end the day."

It's been a really tough time but I'm happy to say I finally don't wake up with a bloated face and belly anymore. My stretch marks are even going away.

My two year old cat was acting really sick, stopped eating or drinking.

We took him to the vet and he got meds, fluids, abx, appetite stimulant. A week later, he's back to normal. Has been purring and cuddling all night.

I just love humanity and being human so much"
464,0,"I've always been a dreamer. My entire life, I've felt completely disconnected from my reality--like there was a layer of plexiglass between me and the world. My adolescence was hard. I lacked a lot. This past summer, I made the decision to completely start anew. I moved to the city, 4 hours from where I lived my entire life. I didn't know a single soul. I've dreamt of this moment since forever. I dreamt of living in a place I loved; I dreamt of successfully pursuing my ideal career; I dreamt of having friends, lots of them, that loved me for me; I dreamt of meeting the love of my life.

But although I am a dreamer, I am a realist. It's for that reason that shortly before my move, I had to have a serious conversation with myself. Yes dreams are fun, and hope is the basis for living, but realistically speaking, I said, this city may not be right for me, and the career I've always wanted is almost impossible to achieve, and having the friend group you've always wanted is unlikely, and the ""true love"" people talk about really only happens in the movies, and certainly not to a person like you.

Oh how wrong I was.

This city was made for me. It's only been 7 months, but I feel so deeply entrenched in the community and culture of this place. Not a moment goes by where there is nothing to do. It's so rich in diversity and character--nothing like the cookie-cutter town I grew up in. I want to live here forever. Finally, I feel at home.

Being an artist is hard, especially when the film industry is not in its prime. And yet, I've managed to find work on tons of movie sets. So much so, that I seldom apply for gigs. Instead, I am sought after, because finally, people notice my talent and work ethic, and want me to work with them. I've discovered my strengths and my niches that set me apart from others, but most importantly, I have a network of connections that will allow me to continue on my path to success. Even so, it never feels like work. It's the most fun I've ever had.

All I've ever wanted was a friend group. A lasting one; one where I felt loved and welcome; one where the others weren't embarrassed to call me their friend. And suddenly, I have that. I never spend a day alone. I am with people all the time, and they seek out my company. I've laughed so much these past months. Sometimes my cheeks hurt from smiling. I feel loved. I feel wanted. To be with people that explicitly tell you they love and appreciate you is jarring. I didn't know that was an option. And I didn't realize how easy it would be to say it back.

And then there's him. The literal day I moved, I met him, and I knew he was the one. I cant describe it. I'm a nihilist. I don't believe in fate, or soulmates (in the spiritual sense), but those who say ""when you know you know"" were right. And I know. We've been together for only 5 months now, but it feels like a lifetime. Like there was a part of me missing before I met him. He's made me a better person. He's made me realize how easy it is to love and be loved in return. Not a part of me doubts he is my person. Even the realist devil on my shoulder can't deny our connection. Since the day I met him 7 months ago, we have not gone a single day without talking. I have not gone a single hour without thinking of him. And the craziest part, is I know he feels the same. I believe him when he says he loves me. I've been wrong about many things in life--and hell, maybe I'm wrong about this too--but right here, right now, there is not a doubt in my mind that I will marry this man.

Years ago, I used to be into manifesting. I thought maybe then I could have control over my reality, and achieve the things I so desperately wanted. I gave up after I lost my spirituality. But now, I feel like I am living the life my teenage self was trying so desperately to actualize.

This is the life I've always wanted."
465,0,"Just somethings to note first (skip if wanted):  
\- I’m defining pain as psychological or physical harm that is unavoidable (e.g. the physical harm and psychological trauma from being stabbed), but suffering as psychological or physical harm that is avoidable (e.g. the oppressive thoughts about a social situation you fumbled).  
\- Also I’m focusing on the source of suffering from attachment as intrusive thoughts as this is what’s been the main source of suffering for myself (I don’t have OCD or other psychopathologies so this to me is changeable without therapy).

Suffering is from the minds attachment (e.g. once they enter our minds giving them our attention and ‘mental energy’) to problems not the problems themself, as attachment is what causes the harm through the emotional and cognitive burden it causes when thinking about a problem. Problems are permanently a part of our experience, they have a high a statistical probability of occurring and an even higher one of entering into your mind (due to seeing them as a threat), therefore to reduce suffering it is the attachment to the problems that needs to stop since the problems will never stop entering our minds (so trying to engage and change your perspective on the intrusive thought itself is pointless as the frequency of problems means there will always be another one to ‘solve’ - meaning the only solution is reducing attachemnt to the problem).

In order to apply this into real life each time I’ve had an intrusive thought (which upon reflecting I’ve found is quite often) about a perceived problem I’ve reminded myself that when I have intrusive thoughts about an issue it’s just another expression of that statistical probability, showing myself the futility in caring about the thoughts and the lack of significance it actually has since is just a predictable, normal part of life. Also I try to recognise that the greatest source of suffering is the attachment to the thought itself rather than the practical implications of the situation that causes the problem - all situations are inherently meaningless, it's our attachment to them which imposes meanings (such as cognitive distortions such as personalisation of perceived problems since attachment motivates more extreme emotional and cognitive responses) which lead to suffering. 

This isn’t about avoiding intrusive thoughts about problems (as this is counter intuitive since this can increase their ‘power’) but recognising them for what they actually are - as said, just an expression of that statistical probability that is also a primary source of suffering. Also reflecting on what’s the source of having the intrusive thoughts (e.g. an insecure-resistant attachment style) may be helpful as a first step in solving the cause instead of just focusing on reducing the symptoms.

480,0,Hi everyone. It’s been one hell of a week with so much drama going on between me and my former roommate. For starters alot of stuff that happened between us was because of her and her actions. She decided to cut me off without talking about anything and today is when she finally moved into a different room. I was still sad tho because she couldn’t even look me in the eyes and apologize even when I heard our mutual friend getting mad at her for causing all of this to happen to begin with. But I’m just so happy to finally have that toxic person out of my room. I’ve noticed I’ve been taking care of myself more with her gone and been in top of work/ hobbies I haven’t done in a while. I love to read and haven’t done so in a while till now. Even tho I am getting therapy because of all that’s happened I still am happy to be moving forward and doing what’s best for me. Thanks for reading if you did I hope u have a wonderful day :)
481,0,"A month or so ago, I saw a job posting on LinkedIn for a senior engineering role at a well-known San Francisco based company.  The combination of role and company peaked my interest. As I began to read the description, it dawned on me that I am definitely qualified for such a role. Two seconds later, I realized that there were well over 1k applicants just through LinkedIn alone. I thought, well shit, there's no chance - this is just a moonshot. Fuck it, though, I will apply.

This opportunity helped me find motivation and courage to finish and publish some technical articles and open-source code that I had in the works but never had the motivation to finish prior. I then updated my resume and sent off my application, not really expecting to hear anything. 

To my (legitimate) surprise, I heard back directly from a recruiter within THREE DAYS of submitting my application. Usually it takes weeks or longer to hear back, if you even hear back at all. We scheduled some time to chat, and it went well. Now, fast forward several weeks, and I just made it past my initial coding screening, and am moving into the final round which consists of four virtual interviews all back-to-back in the same day. 

At this point, even if I do not get an offer, this has served as such a huge motivation booster for me. I didn't even think I would hear back, but yet, out of over 1k applicants, here I am going into the final round. Plus, it helped me get over my fear of sharing my knowledge publicly, as I actually finished and published some articles/repositories. A win no matter what, and it makes me happy!"
482,0,"(21F) Once my tax return hits my account and I get my next paycheque, I’ll have finally reach over $10k in my emergency fund account and also have extra to put towards my long term savings and family trip this year!! 

I know it’s not really a lot of money, but I only make minimum wage, and  the last couple years I made the mistake of putting myself in nearly 40k bad debt and it was really weighing on me.  I’ve had nearly 20k saved in my account at times because I’m an aggressive saver, but last year I was so tired of the debt and the interest that I decided to use almost my entire savings to pay off as much debt as I could, which was an scary decision for me but it was worth it to get out of that situation.  For the last year I have been working extra, and being really frugal and strict with my spending so that I can finally build back my savings from 0 and not have that anxiety looming over me. $10k with no debt feels so much better than that $20k with debt ever did.


I’m just really happy to have accomplished recovering from those bad decisions and no longer have that weight on my shoulders. I can finally use my money for my long term savings and financial goals instead of stupid debts. I can relax, I don’t need to work so hard and I no longer have to stress whenever I spend money on fun things. It’s a huge relief. I can move on to better things "
483,0,"Four months ago i quit smoking and started working out 3x a week - minimum. 

I had been addicted to weed for a little more than two years. I lost 40lbs in the span of a year, mostly because I prioritised smoking over eating or doing hobbies. I was high all the time except for work and when I met up with family. I wasn’t living, I was just staying alive. 

Now I work out 3-5 times a week, and I LOVE IT! I’ve started taking it more seriously, eating more protein, eating more in general, drinking water and getting enough rest. Also taking supplements like creatine and multi vitamins, and prioritising journaling and limiting social media. 

Im happy to say I feel better than I have in years. I’ve got more energy, more time for friends and family, and my head is clearer. Friends and family tell me I look better, and those that knew me well are pleasantly surprised with all the changes I’ve made for the better. 
I love my life, and seeing the gains is just more motivation to keep going. I can’t wait to see where I’m at in 3 months, 6 months, and a year!

Don’t know where I was going with this, but I’m very happy!

I was so jolted as I checked their open dates against the calendar - heart beating, mouth dry and everything lol. It's a new cafe that's about to open up soon and the owner seems like a cool person with appealing ideals for her business, AND the kind of social vibe that helps me feel at ease - the pay is good for the kind of job it is, too. She seems to be putting much more thought into the running of it than many businesses around here do, IMO. It's shaping up to be the kind of place that would get me as a customer even if they didn't hire me as an employee. But I'm hoping they hire me. We'll see!

494,0,Cruised to the west Indies last winter and it was one of the happiest times of my life.   Sometimes when I'm sad I look back at some pictures and just reminisce and it brings back some of the joy.   
495,0,"When I was in 1st standard/grade, I studied in a private school in Kerala, India for just a month. I was a shy kid, and had a lot of social anxiety. In my class, there was this girl who used to smile at me every day, but we never really talked. Funny thing is, I never even asked her name, and to this day, I don’t know it. She was one of the few girls who didn’t bully others. I still remember—she had these tiny little hairs above her lips, which made her look even cuter.  

One day, after PT(physical training) period, I lost my pencil while playing on the ground. The next class after PT was maths, when I got back to class, I asked the classmates sitting beside me if they had an extra pencil, but they all had only one. Our maths teacher was very strict, not friendly at all. Class started ,she started writing on the board, noticed that I wasn’t writing, and asked me why. When I told her I lost my pencil, she got angry and started scolding me loudly in front of the whole class. Then she told everyone not to give me a pencil, if anyone dares to do the opposite she will beat them. I was on the verge of crying.  

Just then, another teacher came and called her outside and she left . 
As I sat there, feeling helpless, I suddenly felt a tap on my back. I turned around and saw that same girl holding out a pencil for me. She told me to take it. I was shocked, of all the people in the class, she was the only one who defied the teacher’s order. In that moment, her kindness meant everything. To our luck that the math teacher didn't come back,she and I were saved from scolding😅. I used the pencil, and before school ended, I returned it to her. I wish I had said more that day, but I was just a shy kid who didn’t know how to express gratitude properly.  

A few days later, I was transferred to another school, and that was the last time I ever saw her. But even after all these years, I still remember that moment. Life has taught me how rare it is to find such genuine kindness in the world.  That moment, her gesture—small as it may have seemed—stayed with me. Because now, as an adult, I realize how hard it is to find people like her in this world.

If by any chance you’re reading this, it’s highly unlikely, but still, I truly hope you’re doing well in life and you were one of the few people who showed kindness to me. And who knows? Maybe one day, we’ll meet again. "

A friend realized that we both loved eachother. So uhh he asked about what friend said this is the messages. We are not labeled but he likes the idea of dating. Holy shit.  My second crush. And my first lover?"
