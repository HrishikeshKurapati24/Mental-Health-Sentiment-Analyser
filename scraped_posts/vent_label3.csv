1,1,"I have tried to be supportive to her and stay enthusiastic about it until today.  Because I know she really wanted it to happen.  It's her life, her body, her choice completely.

But when she returned from her appointment I felt devastated inside.  She now has that fish lipped look you see on so many of the TikTok/Instagrammers out there.

I can not bear to look at her.  I feel completely broken hearted that the face I loved so much is so different.  She looks disfigured.  Artificial.  Unnatural.  She just doesn't look like my wife any more.  I feel terrible inside and I just don't know what to say to her.  The face I loved has gone and I feel heartbroken."
2,1,"This is kinda a throw away thought but. When you are big or fat people will treat you however they want. Your friends your family instantly assume you are less worthy than themselves. Even other fat people will hate on you. It‚Äôs like a wolf smelling blood. I use eating as a way to make myself feel better. And honestly the fact that everyone‚Äôs worst WORST nightmare is to be what I am/ was is genuinely such a mind fuck. I have never in my life had one person make me feel comfortable or okay with who I was in the present. Being fat  isn‚Äôt healthy nor is it good to glamorious. But blaming me for eating to many hot Cheetos at 8 years old because daddy beats me is crazy work üò≠. 

The second I broke up with my ex what does he do? ‚ÄúShe was so fat anyways‚Äù all over social media like he wasn‚Äôt the one coming at me. Being fat shows you the worst sides of people. I won‚Äôt go back and im working towards being better for myself. But that lesson will cut me deep for the rest of my life. And honestly its made me loose trust in so many people "
3,2,"I was hanging out with my friend and texts from some dude kept popping up on her car airplay. And I was like oooh who is that? And then she tells me it‚Äôs her coworker who is literally fully MARRIED and that the two of them hooked up after a party and have been texting ever since. When I tell you I shut down in that moment. She‚Äôs been a friend of mine for over a decade. I would have never expected this kind of behavior from her.

And the more she kept telling me about it the more disgusted I felt. How he told her his relationship has been rocky for 2 years like that makes it okay. If his relationship has been so rocky for so long then why tf hasn‚Äôt he asked for a divorce??? Because he‚Äôs a coward. Also how he says that his wife doesn‚Äôt hang out with him anymore‚Ä¶like okay?? His wife works full time as a nurse and he works part time‚Ä¶he should not expect her energy level to match his and she is literally the breadwinner of the family. He‚Äôs an immature loser. 

Also what is BANANAS to me is how she had another married coworker trying to get with her before and how she like immediately set boundaries with him and did not hook up with him ‚Äúout of respect for his wife.‚Äù But now I‚Äôm realizing the only reason she didn‚Äôt do anything with that guy is because she just didn‚Äôt find him attractive. 

And she‚Äôs whining to me about how she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to get hurt.‚Äù With tears in her eyes. Like. Girl. YOU ENCOURAGED HIS ATTENTION AND CONSENTED TO IT. YOU ARE NOT THE VICTIM IN THIS SITUATION. HIS WIFE IS THE VICTIM. 

I know I can be a judgmental person. I am trying to be a better listener vs reactor when it comes to my friends venting. But I did not hold back because this is where I draw the line. I truly let her know everything I was thinking. Because girl if you are looking for me to just nod and stay quiet you are dead wrong about me. I didn‚Äôt yell at her though even though I wanted to. I really truly wanted her to hear me. 

And I could have forgiven her if she told me that it was a one time drunken mistake and she was crying out of guilt or that she couldn‚Äôt believe she did it or something showing me regret and that it was just a one time mistake. But nope. I can tell she is fully entertaining the idea of becoming his side piece and having an affair. She said ‚Äúit just feels right.‚Äù If he‚Äôs down she‚Äôs down. And if she goes down that path then I cannot be her friend anymore. I despise cheaters and people who willingly choose to be a side piece. "
4,2,"I have seen ads for these everywhere! The idea that someone could walk into your house or hell anywhere wearing what looks like normal glasses and record whatever creepy stuff they want too is insane. 

Cameras on your phone is fine. It is noticeable. 

I am not even the type of person to hide things but some privacy would be nice in this dystopian nightmare world we live in.

That is all."
5,3,"I'm not saying this out of cruelty or a desire to see anyone hurt, but out of sheer frustration. Because If someone can't understand how horrible and violating rape is, even after being told a thousand times from a thousand different people in a thousand different ways then, I don't want this to happen to you, but I'm starting to think it might take something happening to you for you to get it. And that's messed up. But I honestly don't know what would make it click for them except experiencing the consequences firsthand. And no, I don't want that to happen to anyone. But the fact that some people will argue about ""grey areas"" of consent or defend scenarios that are clearly abusive is so disgusting and incredibly enraging, I can't help but think maybe the only way they'll understand is by living through the fear and helplessness themselves.

Again this is not me wishing trauma on anyone. This is me trying to say some people are so far removed from human decency that they require trauma to learn compassion. And that's fucking tragic. it isn't even just a lack of empathy issue. It's just the person either being too driven by their own ego and and ignorance that they refuse to see reasoning. I lack empathy and maybe it's because I‚Äôve experienced s/a multiple times but even if I didn‚Äôt I‚Äôm also not a piece of shit and I am so tired of people needing to ""experience"" trauma to believe it's real"
6,2,"Over the past few months, I have noticed an increase in the stigma against single mothers, and it is honestly concerning. This kind of negativity can seriously affect the mental health of these women. I often see single mothers sharing their experiences online, only to be met with harsh comments blaming them for how the father of their child turned out.

Yes, some women might have ignored red flags, but many were lied to or manipulated. Despite this, the focus always seems to be on blaming the mother. When single mothers talk about relationships, the comments are often filled with men calling them names like ""used goods,"" ""salvage title,"" or comparing them to cars with ""too many miles.""

I understand that everyone has preferences, whether men or women, and that is fine. But men often take it further than just stating a preference. If you do not want to date or marry a single mother, that is your choice. But are these women forcing themselves on anyone? No. Forcing someone into marriage or a relationship is illegal, so there is no need to worry about that. Then why the derogatory comments?

Do people think women are immune to being deceived? Do they believe women have some kind of built-in system that can scan a person‚Äôs true character? That is simply not how it works. Instead of tearing these women down, the focus should be on holding fathers accountable for abandoning their children or failing as partners.

Preferences are fine, but they do not justify insulting those who do not meet them. Single mothers are already carrying enough weight on their shoulders. They deserve understanding, not cruel words."
7,3,"There used to be the old stereotype of nerds hanging around expo centers, endlessly debating pointless little details about their favorite shows‚Äîlike Star Trek or whatever. And sure, it was a negative stereotype but honestly? I‚Äôd take that over what fan spaces have become today.

Fan spaces have been overrun by this cancerous celebrity influencer bullshit where the race to become 'the next big thing' is deemed more important than engaging with the series with any sincere passion.

I recently introduced myself to a fan-community of a series I've loved since childhood ‚Äî no ulterior motives, no ego, not looking for clout, I just naively wanted to meet some new friends to geek out with.

-But instead, all my interactions in the space were with people disinterested in real discourse. They're all too busy reposting meme templates for *‚úü The Almighty Algorithm ‚úü* and making curated reels designed to go viral that all recycle the same clips and basic 'did you know' trivia. When they're not doing that, they're pushing coupon codes and pushing themselves all over their pages, as if THEY'RE what you showed up to see, and not the franchise itself.

There‚Äôs just no room for gainless fan discourse anymore, and that blows."
8,1,"As the title says I lost everything. I lost my husband. I have been fully isolated from everyone and everything since I‚Äôve been with my husband. He isolated me for 3 years. He left me Sunday. I‚Äôve been so warped by his narcissism I have zero friends, have cut off family and have just been staring at the ceiling since Sunday. I have no job (he wouldn‚Äôt let me work). I have no idea where to even start to building my life. We‚Äôve been together since highschool. I have nothing and no one without him. Hes stationed over seas at the moment but will come home in November to move out. I guess this is a drunk ramble. I have no one to talk to other than my dogs I just needed to vent. Thank you for reading."
9,2,"Today, i was outside with my dog and a young boy came, i told him to not pet the dog, he didn't listen but i was able to get the dog away and out of reach for him. After some time, his father came and he was more looking at the smartphone than after the kid. He just said ""he's special with autism, it's okay"".

This wasn't the dangerous part: Right after the encounter with me, i saw them going on and the dad is on the phone again, while the young boy just got on the street - right in the middle of crossroads, the traffic was going on and the bus almost hit the young boy. The driver had to make an emergeny stop to avoid the boy.

The father? The same again, he doesn't really care. Just like ""well, that's how he is"", without any thoughts about dangerous stuff. He even laughed for a moment when the bus had to stop.

This is no offense against the kid - i'm venting here because of the father. Zero control, zero interest in keeping the kid safe.

The dad was just on the phone and there could be so many things, that could harm the boy. 

We all make mistakes, but some things are 100% no-go's - like with the trains we have in my country, with the public transport, if that kid ever climbs on a train waggon and gets electroducted by the power lines, i don't think the father will stop him before it happens.

And what about the other people? I did nothing wrong, but if my dog had defended himself, i'd be the bad guy and the news headline would be ""dog attacks kid"", i'd get blamed. If the bus driver had not been able to stop in time, the news media would be like ""bad bus driver just kills a kid in an accident""

Some people are really not aware of what it means, to deal with kids that have autism. No interest in keeping them safe."
10,3,"Daughter's kindergarten ""graduation"" ceremony this morning, bunch of people crammed into fairly small space for the number of people there.  Kids performs some songs and each kid has thier name read and gets a certificate.  Nothing crazy but the kids worked hard this year and we're excited.
Anyway, spouse and I are sitting in the crowd trying to listen and we're surrounded by other parents that just wouldn't shut the fuck up.  Just chit chatting the whole goddamn time!  Kids performing? Ohh! Let me tell you about how much I like golf!  Kids getting recognized but they're not yours? OOOOH, here's the latest home improvement project we're working on!  Jesus fucking christ, have a little awareness and respect for the people around you!

Learn to be a fucking adult and allow others around you to enjoy moment without your endless yapping. 

That is all. "
11,1,"I grew up on a ranch and my job was to take care of the horses. I had one my whole life named Jack. We did everything together. We‚Äôd go on rides and he‚Äôd steal people‚Äôs hats and run off laughing. When he was ready to go he‚Äôd always press his head against my chest. 

One night after school I went to the horse barn to feed the horses. Everyone came out except Jack. He was laying on the ground in his stall with a broken leg. I put food and water beside him and told my grandfather. He said we‚Äôd fix it tomorrow. 

The next day I was pulled out of class and my grandfather and great grandfather (his dad) were there to pick me up. When I slid into the back seat there was a pistol in the seat. They drove me to the horses and explained to me that when a horse breaks their leg you have to shoot them. Otherwise they starve themselves to death. ‚ÄúShoot him!!?? I can‚Äôt shoot him. Jack is my best friend!!‚Äù I was 13 years old. 

My great grandfather turned around and said, ‚ÄúJack is your horse. Good and bad. It‚Äôs your responsibility.‚Äù 

When we got there they parked and stayed in the car. Told me, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt take too long, when you‚Äôre done pull yourself together and bring the pistol to us.‚Äù

I was barely able to walk I was so upset. I went in and told Jack how sorry I was. He pushed his head into my chest and then I shot him. And scream cried for I don‚Äôt know how long. And then I put myself together and went back to the car. They both shook my hand and began calling me ‚Äúsir‚Äù for the first time. My grandfather gave me a gold coin that said ‚ÄúBravery before safety‚Äù and he said, ‚ÄúWe half expected to hear a second shot. Well done Sir.‚Äù

They coached me on the way home about how I was to behave around my grandmother. The overriding principle was always that you don‚Äôt upset the women. So I didn‚Äôt cry. I told her matter-of-factly what happened. She tried to comfort me but I basically pushed back because that‚Äôs what the old men wanted. 

I felt so cold and lonely and misunderstood. But I had to hold it in. I felt like a monster for killing my friend Jack.

If you‚Äôve never been around horses, let me tell you, they form a bond with you. I believe you can get closer to a horse than you can a dog. They‚Äôre so intelligent and have unique personalities. Anyway, I think this event fucked me up. I was raised by old people (great grandmother 105 years old) so I had to behave like a Victorian to gain their approval. And I still act like a Victorian in many ways. I automatically stand up when a woman enters the room, because that‚Äôs what they taught me. 

Thanks for reading. "
12,3,"Ever since our son's 5th birthday, we have made it a tradition that he put away every penny (dollar, coin, etc.) he collects into his piggy bank to remain untouched until his actual birthday. Every birthday, he wakes up, counts everything in his bank, and is then free to spend all of his savings throughout the year on whatever he wants.

This year, after purchasing his big ticket items, he had $80 cash remaining. He asked if we could purchase a Steam gift card, so, we took him to Walmart \[1st mistake\]. Steam cards don't necessarily work like a reloadable Visa card. Although in retrospect, I wish we had just gone that route \[2nd mistake\]. We picked up two $30 Steam cards and one $20 card and headed to self checkout \[3rd mistake\].

We scanned the first $30 card, then the $20 card, and placed them in the grocery bag. Then we scanned the second $30 card. As that 3rd and final card was being tossed into the bag, the machine paused and prompted for employee assistance. We pulled out all three cards to compare the barcode numbers to the numbers that successfully displayed on the self check out monitor. This very young adult in a blue vest began heading our way. Once he approached our machine, we placed all three cards down (just to the right of the scanner, unbagged) and stepped back a little to let the employee sort out the issue.

The employee entered his code to clear the prompt, and then attempted to scan the third card again himself. Another prompt popped up. He entered his code and cleared the message again. He attempted to scan the third card one final time, then he placed all three card back in the same spot (just to the right of the scanner, unbagged), and walked away to ask someone why it wasn't working. When he came back, he said that there is an automatic feature in place to prevent a customer from being able to purchase too many Steam cards in one transaction. We said that was totally fine, and that we would just pay for the two cards that successfully scanned, and come back another time for that other $30 card. We thanked the employee for his help, he took the card that \*didn't\* scan back to the rack it came from, and we went home.

My husband loaded our son's first card onto his Steam account, but when he attempted to load the second card, Steam prompted that the card number was invalid. He tried again and was met with the same prompt.  Then he compared the Steam card number to the numbers from our Walmart receipt, and as expected, the numbers didn't match. In fact, the card \*totals\* didn't match. The receipt showed that we had purchased one $30 card and one $20 card for a total of $50 purchased with cash. However, we were actually holding \*two $30 cards.\* One that worked, and one that did not work because it had not been activated.

The employee accidentally restocked the now activated $20 Steam card, and bagged the $30 inactivated card. No big deal. Honestly, that's a reasonably easy swap to make after all the confusion with the uncooperative self check out machine. My husband took both cards and the receipt back to Walmart to explain the situation and hopefully exchange the inactive $30 card for the active $20 we intended to buy.

My husband walked back into the house visibly frustrated. He said that the store manager listened to his story, and told him she was going to her office so she could review the footage from our self check out machine during the time of our transaction. After reviewing the footage, she reapproached my husband and told him that there was nothing she could do to help him since she watched him take all three cards home. He asked if he could see the footage, and she told him that showing customers surveillance footage was against Walmart's policy. He explained the situation again and how it was a very simple swap up, but she reminded him that she witnessed him take all three cards home, and she confiscated the two cards he brought in (one inactive $30 and one now empty $30 card). With no way to prove that he, in fact, did \*not\* have all three cards, he took his receipt and left.

After hearing my husband's recap, I became pretty frustrated myself. Typically, I will jump through all hoops if it means I can avoid conflict \*by any means.\* Had this been my own problem, I would have just let them walk all over me about it, but since it involved \*my kid\* and now \*my husband.\* I was ready to give Walmart customer service a go myself. I asked my husband for the receipt and I drove back to Walmart.

I walked up to the customer service counter, showed the lady my receipt, and explained to her the whole situation (with no mention of my husband) as though this was the first time it had ever been mentioned. The lady said that I would need to talk to store manager. I said that was fine, and waited for the manager to speak with me.

When the manager walked through the door, I once again explained the situation as though it was the first time being discussed. She said ""I already spoke with a man about this."" I let her know that was my husband. She told me that she saw him take all three cards home. I asked if I could see the footage. She said ""Like I told \*him,\* it is against our policy to share footage with our customers, but I replayed the footage for 40 minutes--"" and I did interrupt her to say ""That's just not possible. We live less than 10 minutes away, and my husband was \*just\* here talking to you originally for 15 minutes in total \*at most.\*"" She backpaddled and said ""I mean, I watched the footage at least 40 times."" Then told me that she could check the footage again and \*take a picture\* of what she saw. She started to walk away, then she turned around and asked me to hand her the receipt. I said ""Of, course. Let me take of picture of it before I hand it over just in case it were to disappear."" She said, ""You know what? I don't \*have\* to help you.""

(I don't usually play this card often, but) I said, ""Look, my husband and I are both veterans, we're too afraid of losing our VA disability for us to risk ever losing our benefits due to petty theft."" She said, ""I didn't accuse him of stealing."" I told her ""You absolutely have or I wouldn't be here right now. I don't understand why I can't see the footage that you claim proves we went home with all three cards.""

She then told me, ""I can't show you the footage without getting the police involved."" I said, ""Please do not make me get the police involved over something so petty. Do you understand how gift cards even work? Do you understand that until a card is \*activated\*, it is literally \*just\* a piece of cardboard? You are accusing us of stealing \*cardboard\* while \*you\* are simultaneously robbing my 10-year-old out of his birthday money.""

""I am \*not\* 'robbing' your child."" she said. ""I've tried to be kind with you, but I am not obligated to help you anymore."" As she started to walk away from me, I said ""So you're just going to rob my child?""

She stopped walking for a moment, and I projected SO MUCH LOUDER (in fact, \*embarrassingly\* so much louder) because I was fucking \*livid.\* at this point. \*""So you're just going to rob my child?""\*

She stormed off to her office, and I stood by the Walmart welcome guy. He obviously heard me raise my voice (because everybody in the front half of the building had to have heard). I apologized and said ""This is such disappointing situation."" I waited next to him for the manager to return from her office after reviewing the footage \*again.\* When she came back, she said ""I'll let you have a customer satisfaction card \*because we're nice.\* You can go back to the customer service counter where they will help get you a new card.

I stood in line at customer service. Once an employee was available, she told me that I could go grab a new $20 Steam card and she would replace it for me. I stepped out of line to grab the card, and wouldn't you fucking know...they were fresh sold out of $20 Steam cards. So, I grabbed a $30 card and returned to the back of the customer service line because the lady who told me to grab a new card was assisting another customer by the time I got back. I wound up paying the $10 difference out of pocket which is...whatever at this point. Like, my god, Walmart. Was all of that necessary? Way to employee a power-hungry \[unkind word\] and make them the \*face\* of that location. AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. Why."

14,2,"Trigger warning, mention of rape/incest implications

I‚Äôm 16 and live in a pretty safe area just outside the city, on Mondays I attend a running club after school to try exercise more and I love it so far, yesterday I wore my usual athletic gear with shorts and a sport jacket. After I finished my club I had 2 buses to catch home and after the first I was waiting out the bus stop; 5  individuals just a bit older than me came to stand at the bus stop. There was one boy and 4 girls, and as I am standing there (headphones in) one girl starts yelling at this other girl near us saying the following : ‚ÄúThe fuck are you looking at me for? Don‚Äôt think your tuff I‚Äôll fucking bash you, you little white cunt‚Äù Headphones off at this point (which they didn‚Äôt see me take out) I figured it best to just be aware of my surroundings, I didn‚Äôt want to walk away of fear of making the situation worse

My heart dropped when I heard them talking about ME At first I thought they were passive aggressive compliments they thought I couldn‚Äôt hear ‚ÄúLook at those fucking shorts, wish I could wear shorts like that, so fucking short‚Äù Which I was fine with, people are expressive but then the comments got worse ‚ÄúShe deserves to be raped for those fucking shorts‚Äù The guy was agreeing ‚ÄúHer dad probably fucks her in those shorts ay‚Äù ‚ÄúHaha he should rape her or he probably already does‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what to do, I got on the bus and went home and that‚Äôs the end of it, it‚Äôs affecting me though and as a person with that threat having once happened, I‚Äôm a little on ease"
15,1,"I want a boyfriend, not a one night stand, not a fuckbuddy or some on-the-downlow bullshit.At the same time I don‚Äôt think I can deal with someone going all hot and cold and giving me the silent treatment for weeks on end again a d I know that comes with the territory. I don‚Äôt want to date some guy for two years and then he randomly starts pretending not to know me around his friends and starts vanishing off somewhere in the middle of the night while I‚Äôm sleeping  when I‚Äôm staying over at his place without leaving a note or anything and then doesn‚Äôt show up until 5 am and calls me a controlling bitch if I ask where he was.

 I don‚Äôt want another situation where the guy acts all says he wants to spend the rest of his life with me but when I say I‚Äôm ready for that he gets cold feet. It‚Äôs also exhausting trying to love someone who instead of talking to you about it when there‚Äôs something going on gives you the silent treatment for weeks and if you ask he just snaps at you and tells you to figure it out, like he expects me to read his mind or something. 

I feel like most guys want someone who can read their mind and I‚Äôm not smart or neurotypical enough for that. I can‚Äôt deal with the head games again. If I could find someone who doesn‚Äôt do that then sure, I‚Äôd give love another try, but that‚Äôs not how it works in real life. I want to be with someone I feel safe around instead of somebody who I constantly feel like I‚Äôm trapped in a game of mental chess with someone. "
16,0,"‚ÄúA is tiny, D is big‚Äù. This is mildly true, but generally false.

Cup size increasing as the letters go up is really only measurable when the band size stays the same. 32A<32B<32C<32D and so forth.

However a 28D is very small and gets mistaken for our idea of an A cup. Bc technically, it does have the same volume of an A cup with sister sizes. 26DD-28D-30C-32B-34A-36AA all have the same cup volume.

Down a band size, up a cup size. 32A cannot be a default small size because now everyone‚Äôs ribcage is 32 inches. See how that can‚Äôt make any sense? 

The cup size is the difference between bust and underbust (ribcage under boob). That gives a starting point, but sister sizes really give the correct fit. I‚Äôm 30C and no one would believe me if I told them I‚Äôm a C cup. 

Most women are wearing the wrong size and I wish everyone was educated on the female body and not ignorant. 

@Theirishbralady on Instagram is a savior of showing examples. I wish people knew. Would have saved me years of turmoil of thinking I would never find a bra that fits

EDIT: Also small chest appreciation!!! World needs more natural body celebration. Real natural bodies. I‚Äôm not getting my boobs done to fit what society deems most attractive. Small boobs deserve more sucking. Period. If you honestly prefer big chests, leave us small chested girlies alone. We want men who want us. "

19,1,"No I am not projecting my own failures onto others nor I‚Äôm I judging. I‚Äôm happy for people who have good parents but I can‚Äôt help but feel jealous at times.

20,2,"Recently I've gotten some tickets to a concert that I want to go to but I really really hate how I look and it makes me feel disgusting for having the audacity to show my face.

I feel like I have all the 'wrong' features. I have big crooked teeth, noticeable eye bags that never go away,  weird damaged hair that can never decide how it wants to look, and a face that goes red at even the slightest bit of heat.

My biggest insecurity would probably have to be that my face goes red so easily. It makes me feel like people are just going to look at me weird when I try to talk to them because I'm all red and bright.

I just really don't like the way I look and with how insecure I feel. I'm considering wearing makeup but this would be my first time and I definitely don't want it to end up looking cakey or big and makeup has always made me feel a little uncomfortable.

I'm almost tempted to resell the tickets just so no one else has to see my face. I know, I know, I'm being irrational but it's been on my mind"
21,0,"I‚Äôve been in a tough position for a few years. Medical issues, no insurance, barely getting hours at a crappy 9 to 5. Debt piling up with no end in sight. There were days I didn‚Äôt eat or sleep from the stress. I genuinely thought I‚Äôd never get out.

But today, I made my final payment. I‚Äôm officially debt-free!

I‚Äôve been watching a lot of Caleb Hammer, learning how to budget and move smarter. And yeah, I know a lot of y‚Äôall hate ChatGPT on here, but honestly, it helped me sort out my finances. I used it a lot when I was down and spiraling. Just having something to talk to helped me hang in there.

Now, for the first time in forever, I have breathing room. I can save. I can invest. My credit is up. I‚Äôm still broke, technically, but I‚Äôm not scared of the fridge being empty anymore. I‚Äôm still technically in survival mode, but at least now I can keep some of my money in my pocket."
22,0,"I have a friend who hates being a mom but had 7 kids. 1st 4 because she was in love and apparently never heard of birth control. Last 3 because she met a rich man and that child support was gonna be good. 
Her kids are so dang bad! My daughter knows better than to interrupt an adult conversation or not stop talking when i give her the look. All this friend does is yell ‚Äúshut up!! We‚Äôre talking!‚Äù And the kids just HAVE to finish whatever the hell they‚Äôre saying, which frankly no one gives a crap about. I‚Äôm here to see your mom, not you. Go play!! I almost feel bad because maybe I‚Äôm the only adult they can talk to, ever. But i couldn‚Äôt care less about whatever new movie is on disney+ right now. I nod sarcastically enthusiastically and continue ignoring and listening to the mom but its so hard when she wont just tell her kid ‚Äúwhen adults are talking, you need to be quiet‚Äù "
23,1,I don‚Äôt know what to do with this. He literally called me his little regret. I can‚Äôt stand that nobody. Not my mom. Not my dad. Not even my siblings actually love me. I don‚Äôt have any friends that love me. I can die tomorrow and nobody would care. I was just a little lamentation.
24,3,"They fucking told me that a date will be available on my birthday so they put it off and now here I am scheduled to take the test over half month away from my birthday. Ik it probably doesn't seem like a big deal to any of you, but getting my license is a huge deal to me. 1 it means I can become a lifeguard and start applying for that position 2 it means I can get out of this fuck ass boring house we moved in 3 after watching all of my friends and whole grade being able to drive on their own I can finally do it.

Anyways my parents decided to brush it off like I haven't been busting my ass the whole semester to learn how to drive, get all As taking only honors classes, study for an ACT, apply to early college, and tryout for travel soccer.

Its literally the only fucking thing I wanted for my birthday... freedom. And now they have taken away a quarter of my summer to which I will be stuck with my ass at home."
25,1,"I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I just don‚Äôt want to talk to people about my struggles anymore. It‚Äôs not even that I don‚Äôt want connection‚ÄîI do. It‚Äôs that most people, whether in real life or online, are dismissive or completely miss the point. I try to open up, and I get either:

	‚Ä¢	Oversimplified ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù that ignore the emotional side
	‚Ä¢	Passive-aggressive guilt-tripping like ‚Äúother people have it worse‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Or just straight-up silence, as if what I said didn‚Äôt matter at all

And then people wonder why I talk to chatbots instead of a ‚Äúreal‚Äù person. Because at least when I do that, I feel like someone is actually trying to understand me. No tone policing. No minimizing. No ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just being negative.‚Äù Just actual attention to what I‚Äôm saying.

It sucks feeling like every time I try to express something important or painful, I‚Äôm treated like a burden or like I‚Äôm making a fuss over nothing. I‚Äôm not trying to dump on people. I‚Äôm not even asking for fixes. I just want to feel heard for once. Is that really so much?"
26,1,"When my ex broke up with me almost a year ago in August he told me these words. It‚Äôs still stung and rung in my head. How can a being be too much, I am who I was molded to be with the world folding around me. I am sorry that my life has caused me to be this woman that I be today. I cannot simply exist in others worlds without being just too much for them to bear. In the friendships I‚Äôve had in my life I especially do not understand what is so immensely difficult for people. Maybe it‚Äôs the wrong groups, people, things. Why do I have to be this woman? I wish I had a list of why people refrain. I have always been me, and as a child I was ever so lonely. I had my dad, at times ,and I wish I still did. I am me, in all that is me, with all that this world has given me. It‚Äôs not my fault my parents died, and it‚Äôs not my fault I have CPTSD. This life created me for a reason. I try to hang on to that idea. "
27,3,"So I'm in year 12 and in my last year of highschool. Like I graduate from school in 100 days which is so crazy and kinda scary.

But anyways, I have like 4 assessment tasks due so soon. It doesn't sound like a lot, but I don't go to the best school, and literally no one understands our classes. Plus, next term for week 5 and 6, I have my trial HSC exams which are really hard and I'm probably going to fail them. On top of that, I have an extra assessment to do for PDHPE because for someone reason someone thought it was a good idea to add an extra one that doesn't count for anything. Then, after all that, I have to study, revise, take practice tests, and do heaps of stuff to prepare and actually take my HSC exams. It's all so much.

I literally just spent 2 whole weeks doing nothing at all when I should've been working on assessment tasks for Ancient History and English  Advanced. And now they are due in the next two days. I wish I didn't even choose these classes. Honestly, kinda wish I dropped out instead. I just can't wrap my head around any of the year 12 content and I can't drop down levels in any of my classes. I tried to for English, because Advanced is too hard for me (literally have failed all my assignments) and the school told me I wasn't allowed.

On top of that, I don't know what to do once I leave school. So far, I'm thinking about a gap year to get a job and earn some money. But like, in this economy? I'd be lucky to afford food. And my Mum doesn't want me around for every. She's in the army so she's not as home as much as she used to be, and I don't think I'll actually be able to take proper care of myself.

Also, I want to get a job, but what job? I don't wanna work fast food, but also I have no experience so I can't get hired. Mum wants me to work in the army in if it's just reserves, but I don't think it's for me and she's trying to force it.

Like what do I even do once I finish school.

I'm just so lazy and can't even manage to bring myself to change it and it's so annoying.

Sorry it's kinda long"
28,2,"Telling me to aim for perfection, is the clearest example of how to make me want to quit.

29,1,"I dont really know if this is triggering content but i talk about weed and vaping and depression and based off the flairs it seemed like i should try to maybe warn of those things. I'm so fucking angry every day, all the time, over nothing. I'm not angry at anyone or anything in particular i just wake up and feel frustrated. All the time i am so fucking angry and i havent found a single good thing that actually helps, only smoking weed, overeating, and lashing out at the people closest to me. At this point im even considering joining some kind of boxing or fighting club/gym whatever or something to just let off the steam. My gf is already under a lot of pressure bc honestly she's pretty mentally unstable and theres a bunch of shit from her family too and i dont want to burden her with these feelings on top of her own shit, i love her too much to do something insensitive like that. I stuggle with understanding the way i feel when im not angry or irritated or annoyed or some other version of anger and ive been depressed for years and my gf knows this but she doesnt understand the full extent of it thankfully or she'd be worried about me. I don't know what to do. I hate feeling like this. I stuggle to find the motivation to do just basic things and fulfill the promises I've made to people. It's so hard to even get out of bed in the morning. It's not even that i have nothing to get up for, its just that compared to the feeling of my bed in that moment nothing else matters nearly as much. And i know thats selfish but it feels so good to be selfish. But I hate disappointing people. I hate the way i end up treating the people i love most in this world because of stupid shit like my own laziness or the complete opposite of that - trying to please too many people at once. I am so angry all the time and it feels like the universe is trying to tell me the only way i can fix it is by constantly putting drugs or food into my body because nothing else ive tried helps. Personally I don't really care anymore if i have to be drugged to function i just want to be able to not disappoint the people that look to me for help or trust. I used to vape and that helped a good bit but i stopped bc my grandfather on my dads side died at 54 from smoking cigarettes and my grandfather on my moms side is addicted and has tried to quit several times but hasnt succeeded. At this point, im considering just giving in and smoking weed and vaping everyday so i can just have the basic motivation and level-headedness to get out of bed and go to work and see my family and gf and clean my house and take care of my body. I'd rather live happy with the drugs and my gf, my paycheck, and my family's trust and die in my 50s than live angry, sober, alone, and poor and maybe live 20 years longer than I would otherwise. I graduated highschool last year and i feel like I've been slowly fading emotionally bc ive been trying to ween off of the substances. I wonder if other people go through something similar at some point and just surrender to their desires and participate in their vices or if they find some kind of balance or have a religious awakening or something. Idk. Life is just difficult i guess. I'll probably die of cancer or heart disease from the things i eat or breath as it is already so why shouldnt i just donit on my terms? There are only 2 things that hold me back from completely caving and ruining my body for the sake of my mind: 1. my parents hate tobacco and nicotine products bc like i said both of their dads have been hurt by them. they've drilled it into mine and my brothers heads since i was in preschool about how bad it is and to never do it but i think differently about it and understand how it has such a major place in society.for example it helps me actually feel happy when im at my younger brothers baseball game and he gets a point. it makes me want to cheer him on and just be satisfied in that moment without screaming at the other teams coaches or parents. 2. I want to live a long life with my girlfriend. If i can help it i would rather not die young so i can live for a long time with her but if the cost of enjoying the life i have with her is that 20/30 years it shaves off of my life then so be it. I think that eventually i could get to a point where i can stop vaping and maybe use patches or gum or pouches or something better and i can do edibles too so theres way way way less risk. I love life. I love my life. I dont love the way my body feels every single fucking day of my life though. I just want to be okay. i dont need to be great just okay enough to do the basic shit.
 anyways. i just needed to get this out of my head even if no one reads this, i can go back and see how i felt and how i want to make things change for the better and that'll maybe make me feel better then. üê¢"

33,0,"I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts about body odor over time, and it makes me sad to see how many people lack empathy around this topic.

Quick background: I‚Äôm a critical care nurse who took care of solid organ transplants - heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, stomach, pancreas, intestines, you name it. 

The variety of odors that can come from a human body is endless. Think pus coming out of an infected chest wall, GI bleed mixed with diarrhea, any necrotic wound, fluid seeping from the skin, and that‚Äôs just a small sample. 

Some people live with a ventricular assist device connected directly to their heart from outside their body. They can‚Äôt take a normal shower. They‚Äôre not supposed to be submerged in water. You might not even know who‚Äôs wearing one because it‚Äôs hidden under their clothes.

I‚Äôm not going to go into every scenario of why someone might smell bad , there are too many reasons, whether they‚Äôre aware of it or not.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there are actual nasty individuals out there who simply don‚Äôt care, and this post isn‚Äôt meant to excuse those.

My point is: be kind. If someone smells and you have the means to remove yourself from the situation, just do that. If it‚Äôs someone you care about, maybe you can address it together, or approach it however you feel is best. But remember: you are not special. At some point in your life, you‚Äôll most likely smell worse. We are, after all, nothing more than flesh that can spoil in many different ways.

34,0,"Tonight I can't sleep. I think I must be falling in love or something. It's nice and slow. Very slow. But I like it. I guess I feel frustrated with myself for struggling to understand and read social cues-- but I'm also having the time of my life, regardless of how things work out. 

Here's where things sit: I met this person a few years ago at their place of work. We crossed paths several times and would have an occasional conversation, but just small talk. I found them engaging, but I was a little nervous to try and get to know them.

Then maybe 7 months ago, we started chatting more and I realized: this person isn't just intriguing, I think we might be compatible. 

I gave it a couple of months and we hung out a few times as friends. Then I asked them on a date. 

They said they just got out of a really long relationship and were taking time to figure out what they wanted and where they were at. I said that was fine as long as we could be friends and I meant that. I try to be a letter goer. Plus, they're too cool. They said of course, and we've been friends since.

It's been a few months since that and I only want them more. I see them all the time. As much as I can. I love every minute. I've never had so much fun. I've never been so myself. They've never canceled on me. They're as thoughtful as I am. They make me laugh so much. Creatively driven, but still level-headed. They really match my freak The more time passes, the more I see their character, and I really like what I see. 

I feel excited when I see them and they're excited when they see me. We talk and/or see each other most days, which is really unusual for me as I'm a pretty solitary dude. I mean, I've got friends, I just generally prefer to see them maybe once or twice a week at most. I've never met someone that made me feel like I could just see them everyday or do anything with them. 

I haven't tried making a move or asking them out again because I want to respect what they said when I asked them the first time. But it's hard because they seem to be enjoying all of this as much as I am. I can't tell though if it's mutual attraction or if maybe they're just naturally flirtatious and like me as a friend. I guess that sounds a little silly when I write it out. But you never know, right?

Something i like is that they're really playful. I got this stuffed animal recently. A small monkey. It's just a fun thing I'll bring around sometimes as a bit. I kind of started doing it because I knew they would find it funny. And now they have their own stuffed animal that they'll bring. They have made custom pants for my monkey. And a vest for their stuffed animal. The stuffed animals are now in love. They are the one to have really pushed this forward. I mean I'm playing into it, but they brought it up.

It's confusing to me and feels like thinly veiled attraction. Like maybe they just aren't ready to open their heart up again. Which would be understandable.

But I'm on the spectrum and and really don't know how to read social or romantic cues, so I never know if I'm just misinterpreting. Just a few weeks ago they said they were really happy to not be dating and it was good to just enjoy their free time for once. But then they're making our stuffed animals kiss and slow dance and the last time we did karaoke we did three romantic duets. And now they're like: we should start a podcast together. 

To me, all of that is saying: hey I like you a lot and I want to spend so much time with you! 

Which is really great. I feel the same way! 

So I feel like: dude, just let me take you to dinner. Open your heart, dawg. Just kiss me. It's really not even a big deal.

But then I decide not to say that because I don't want to put them in a position to have to reject me again. 

Maybe if I weren't like a never-been-kissed virgin in my late twenties, it would be so much easier to not feel like a dog foaming at the mouth. 

Like I said, I've always been a pretty solitary guy, so I'm eating all of this up, regardless. I guess, If the attraction goes beyond friendly, it'll play out in the long run. 

They're out of town right now and all I can do is think about them. No stress, just missing. Just excited to see them again. But now I'm thinking about all of this. "

36,3,"I had a back injury when I was 15. Unfortunately, after a couple surgeries between 17 and 22 to fix the issues, it developed into degenerative disc disease by the time I was 25. Super uncommon in someone my age.

It was mostly okay for a while, but around my 32nd birthday it started rapidly progressing. Now, at 34, I can't even stand long enough to make myself a bagel. My doctor says my situation is lifelong, will continue to advance, and all they can do is pain management.

I am just so overwhelmed at the thought of this being the rest of my life. My son is only 10, and there's so much I want to do with him, but it's so painful to even stand up let alone start walking.

I can't take opioids, because when my back issues started at 15 years old, my doctor put me on Percocet for 2 years because he thought it was less harmful than surgery (this was back when opioids were still freely prescribed). I'm sure you guessed, I got addicted. I'm afraid if I start taking them again, the same thing will happen, but I also don't want to live in so much pain all the time.

I guess I just needed to put this out there to feel heard. If you got this far, thanks for reading."

I work in tech support. I've been doing this A LONG TIME and I know what I'm doing... Just had a conversation with a co-worker that was fucking infuriating. 

Me: (sitting in my office at my computer) 
CO worker: can you fix my computer? It says the printer is offline...
Me: I'll need to look it...
CO worker: if I have to restart I'm gonna be really mad... 

Me:  (after about twenty seconds of troubleshooting, I can already see that we need to restart before trying anything else) I can't get basic programs to close/reload, and you haven't restarted in 11 days. We need to restart before we try anything else. This is something I tell people to do at least once a day. 

CO worker: I don't have time for that. 

Me: ok. (Then I leave because there's nothing else to do or talk about)

WHY EVEN FUCKING ASK FOR MY HELP THEN? DON'T TELL ME HOW DO MY FUCKING JOB AND DON'T ARGUE WITH ME WHEN I TELL YOU THE FIX. IF YOU COULD FIX IT YOURSELF YOU WOULDN'T BE ASKING ME FOR HELP! 

She already knows it's the first thing I'm gonna check, and she acts like I don't need to do that, like there must be some magic work around if she just complains enough. Fuck you. I'm not gonna waste my time trying to fix something the wrong way just so you don't have to spend 30 seconds restarting your laptop. "

It just really, really makes me upset to think of all this, and it just makes everything I do feel pointless. 

How do you guys cope? Because I can't. I'm honestly scared. So so so scared of the near future. I don't know who to talk to. My friends don't care, my family doesn't care either. I have no one to talk to, and it drives me crazy that this is how it is. I can't even sleep at night. The last few weeks have been completely restless for me and I can feel it's starting to impact my health and productivity at work. I just want peace and for everyone to get along. Why is it so damn hard?"
47,2,"  I know that it's going to be a long possibly retraumitizing process. I know it I've heard it plenty and I mean they already said the first time I tried it wouldn't even go to the DA. Though they never called me back. They didn't ask me to come down there and tell them anything again. Not to call him. Nothing. They investigated they said and then the DA didn't take it the Investigator said ""I hate cases like this cuz they're so hard to prove"". I thought it'd be a good case, despite our relationship because of the level of coercion..... and abuse. And me admitting I wasn't going to have sex or anything and he coerced me at most. Yet he said ""because you guys were in a relationship it comes down to a he said she said situation like he says this happened she says this happened "". Anyway.... then I asked well can you guys reopen it? And i basically said like cuz you guys didn't update me. And he said no they couldn't.

  However, I'll have a lawyer soon who says in my case there is a way to reopen my SA case criminally because they didn't handle it properly, the police by not calling me. Not informing me. Not only that but because of the fact that at the time it happened, I did not remember what happened until years later. So it wasn't discovered yet what happened. She says for those cases there is no statute. 

  I don't know why I'm worrying. On one hand I'm like yay this is what I really wanted to do but I was afraid I'd be blamed or judged or flat out my story just not believed just because of the circumstances. On the other hand, I mean there's no physical evidence. Maybe if I had known SA could be over clothes, but I didn't because I didn't even know about sexual activity and that it could be over clothes................ and I just felt like it was my fault and he basically made me feel like i deserved it or he didn't know, but he did. He literally got on my legs so I couldn't move..... 

  Anyway anyone know if I even have a case? He literally did something so much more severe legally than it looks. It wasn't lightly. It was straight up aggravated sexual battery, violent, and with restraint( the getting on my legs first n during it). However, because of the lack of physical evidence I'm not sure they'll even be able to put him away for a month, let alone how much time he should get. 

  It's possible nothing will even happen at all because of the lack of physical evidence, it being years ago, and the other circumstances like our ""relationship"", which wasn't even healthy. Either way now I know I did all I wanted to do about it and I tried. Wish me luck...."
48,0,"I'm so tired of hearing about it. I don't care who did what, I really don't. If it doesn't involve me, or doesn't affect me in any way, shape, or form, I don't wanna hear about it. I'm so tired to listening to friends say ""oh you like this? Well creator or team member did this!"" I really don't care. Stop trying to get me to hate someone I honestly don't give a flying fuck about. And stop telling me the media I consume makes me a bad person just because the creator did something shitty. I'm not the creator, their actions do not reflect mine. I'm just a dude who has no connections to them other than I watch/listen to what they made. It really doesn't help that most of my friends are hypocrites and still listen and watch things that were made by problematic creators but they give me shit when I am not in the mental place to give up the things I enjoy."
49,1,"I have broad shoulders and smaller hips. Its killing me to see myself like this. I want to be elegant , feminine, but everytime i wear a tanktop i feel like a fk football player. I dont even do sports and still have broad shoulders why... i Just want fk hips to fit the standards i want to feel beautiful.  I wish i could break my shoulders to make them smaller."
50,3,"I broke up with my boyfriend recently for basically calling me ugly, rating my face 5/10, laughing at me, and just making me feel like shit over a month. The breakup was peaceful, and we agreed to stay friends. We are in the same friendgroup and thus in the same chat. Because of this, I noticed that he blocked me but he's texting all fine in the group. For some reason this makes me angry. I guess I had wished for some kind of word before getting cut off (I know this feels backwards since I broke up with him). Since his birthday is coming up, a new chat was created with everyone but him. I considered telling that chat that we broke up. However, we. had said we should inform them in person. But now that I can't contact him, and I likely won't see him again, I feel like I just need to tell them right now. And I can't take it any longer. I'll probably have to leave this friendgroup because Ill look like an asshole. and also quit the club that we met in. I'm starting to feel hatred towards him. "
51,2,"Developing romantic feelings for someone is genuinely painful.

I don‚Äôt like feeling butterflies in my stomach whenever their name is mentioned. I don‚Äôt like the excitement I get when our fingers touch or our faces are close to one another.

I hate feeling my heart skip a beat when their text appears in my notifications, or feeling jealous when I see another girl I know likes him speak to him.

I‚Äôm get tired of handling and processing my emotions towards him. I wish I didn‚Äôt find him so interesting and entertaining . I with I didn‚Äôt think anything of him.

Being so infatuated is embarrassing and tiring. What is wrong with me that I can‚Äôt stop feeling so deeply despite hating it 

Having feelings for someone is physically painful and I don‚Äôt know how to stop it."
52,1,"I should start this off by saying I am incredibly biased. The only reason why I got into the Marvel universe in the first place was for Iron Man, aka, Tony Stark. 


I loved all the movies leading up to endgame, but them killing Tony genuinely ruined the entire thing. I will have full-on mini crying bouts when I see the scene of Tony being killed. I literally refuse to watch the movie he dies in. (I've only seen the clip because of edits) I watched ""Captain America: Brave New World,"" and I couldn't get over knowing Tony was dead.  



I could probably get over them killing Tony, but then they proceeded to kill literally all of my favorite characters. Natasha, Loki, and they ruined Steve's character. I am scared to get into the new characters because I dont want to experience them dying. Im still only here for Spiderman, and that's it. 


I feel so much genuine sadness and ache feeling knowing Tony Stark is canonically dead. And I want to get into Lokis' character more, but he's also dead. So I dont want to watch all the Thor movies and the loki TV show just so I could get more attached to the character.


I miss it when the movie gets super dark or tense, but ultimately have a good ending. Like be so fr. I hate it when they feel like they need to add character death to add impact. 


Im so sad they killed Tony Stark. I heard that more key characters will die in Doomsday, and I am honestly considering to call it quits. I miss the main cast. With Bruce Banner, Clint Barton, Tony Stark, Steve Rodgers, Natasha Romanoff, Thor, and the other side characters. I understand that times need to change, and I could accept that. But most of those characters, or at least all of my favorite ones, die or have their character ruined.


Literally what was so hard making Tony just have his arm explode off of his body, he survives. But due to his inhury he then retires and spends the rest of his life raising his daughter????? Being a better father than his dad could have been. I really wanted that ending for him. It fucking kills me knowing hes dead.



I know its really not this big of a deal. But I have this habit where I become disgustingly attached to characters. Like I will obsess over a character, and let my affection for said character over take me. And it is obbsesisve, I will admit. (its platonic, this is not meant having a crush on said characters) And it has ruined entire weeks of my life when I learn the characters dont get happy endings. "
53,1,Bro I don‚Äôt care for grammar rn I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm not gonna care my girlfriend and I almost broke up simply because I don‚Äôt think she likes me anymore? The hell does that even mean like I love her and I know she loves me with every bit of soul in my body but I somehow said that maybe it‚Äôs suicide thing I‚Äôve been feeling really suicidal and I don‚Äôt want her to feel bad about me killing myself or maybe I‚Äôm just trying to find justification in something horrible because I treat her like absolute garbage and i don‚Äôt want to I love her more than I love anything in the world I don‚Äôt know what the fuck is wrong with me (if your gonna take this down just send a warning I‚Äôll edit it and make the curses out)

I don‚Äôt even want to bother talking to him about it because it‚Äôs not going to help, so I‚Äôm just here to vent really. There‚Äôs days when I just drive around and think if I actually made the right decisions in life. I‚Äôve done therapy and taken meds for years but nothing has really helped. Sometimes I wonder if it‚Äôs actually depression or if it‚Äôs more situational? But I keep pushing on because I have kids. It‚Äôs just so hard to put on a smile some days ugh "
55,2,"it‚Äôs so scary because if i try to remember something i almost remember, i forget it even harder and then forget what i was trying to rhink about in the first place. most od my childhood is gone too. even like two summers ago, i don‚Äôt remember absolutely anything."
56,3,"I am a lost 25F. I left my serving job I got after college for an office job that I thought would benefit me in the long run and I‚Äôm starting to realize I am very wrong. I took a massive pay cut from serving for this role due to ‚Äústability‚Äù and ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù. After being removed from hourly and to salary, I can no longer afford my bills. I‚Äôm not doing that great at the job either (heavy metrics) so I thought, hey! why not just ask for my restaurant job back, they also rent me a home so you would think it would be a easy role to get back. They won‚Äôt take me back. Now i‚Äôm stuck with an underpaying role that I will most likely get let go from.. and my old job won‚Äôt take me back. I‚Äôm really scared. I‚Äôm really upset. I fear I may have to move back into my mom‚Äôs house 4 hours away and be jobless if nothing changes within 8 weeks (my timeline for hitting metrics).

57,3,"No one told me the lack of sleep will get to me this bad. I have never in my life felt worse. I just want to sleep. He is 5 weeks old and i am drained. I know it will get better but time is going by so slowly. And everyone says ill miss the days when he was so little but i sure as hell will remember the sleep i missed aswell. I want this phase to end omg. Please parents, tell  me when it got better for you because not only is my mental health suffering, so is my relationship with my boyfriend. 
I admire single parents and the married single parents aswell i dont know how you all do it. "
58,3,"I already know this is my own fault for allowing it. But I am so extremely sick of it. I‚Äôve been dating my boyfriend 2 years. The first year and a half together, he would do things for me and acted like housework and cooking should be split between partners. That all changed when I moved in. 

I do literally everything around the house. Everything. And for context, we both work full time jobs. Im 30, he‚Äôs 35. I‚Äôm also in school (online), he is not. I get home a few hours before he does because we work different shifts. I do all the grocery shopping, all the food prepping, I make his lunches for work, make sure his fridge is always stocked with the drinks he likes, feed our cats, get their food, clean their litter box, wash and fold all of our laundry, get the mail, do all the house cleaning, take out and bring up the garbage, LITERALLY EVERYTHING. 

Now I actually genuinely enjoy taking care of the people I love. His job is admittedly more stressful than mine. I also do not contribute as much financially to the household as he does. So in my mind, it seems fair that I should have more of the household responsibilities. I feel good knowing he can come home from work and just relax and not have to worry about anything around the house. But the issue that really bothers me the most is that he doesn‚Äôt appreciate it. At all. 

He just came home early from work today because he wasn‚Äôt feeling good. He‚Äôs never home before me. So I come home and have to do all my daily tasks, and then start prepping dinner for me to make in a couple hours like I normally do. He comes down from his nap and opens the cabinets and the fridge and I say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be making dinner in a little while‚Äù and he has a whole little fit that there‚Äôs no food and says ‚Äúwhat the fuck am I supposed to eat‚Äù. Then he storms off and says ‚ÄúI guess I have to go to the store then‚Äù and gets dressed and slams the door and leaves to go buy snacks. After I just said I will be making dinner. 

Now last week I came home with a bunch of snacks from the grocery store. He got upset with me and told me to STOP BUYING SNACKS BECAUSE ITS SUMMER and he needs to stop snacking. And I TOLD HIM THIS WOULD HAPPEN. I said ‚Äúwhen I don‚Äôt have snacks in the house, you get mad‚Äù and he said he wouldn‚Äôt and reassured me he didn‚Äôt want me to buy snacks anymore. And exactly like I predicted, now I‚Äôm the bad guy because there‚Äôs no snacks in the house. 

He also made a comment to me last weekend when he asked what was for dinner and I said I could make him chicken tenders or pizza because I wasn‚Äôt hungry and didn‚Äôt feel like cooking that day. And he said ‚Äúwhat kind of woman are you‚Äù. I brushed this off at first but it bothered me all week and I eventually said something to him about how it hurt my feelings and all he said was ‚Äúomg I was joking‚Äù. But I know when we are being playful with each other and this was not one of those time. No sorry, no nothing. 

I went through this same exact thing with my ex. I swore to myself I wouldn‚Äôt ever do this again. And here I am, doing it again. It is so extremely frustrating to feel like I do literally everything for someone, and they don‚Äôt appreciate it at all. I do the things I do out of love, but when I get treated like shit for tiny little things not being done, I just feel worthless and like I‚Äôm just a maid. I go out of my way multiple times a day, every day, to make sure his life is easier, while he does basically nothing for me in return, and then can treat me like I‚Äôm actual shit.

I know this is my fault but I just really needed to get this off my chest. "
59,1,"I just lost a best friend of 5 years tonight, not death, he sent one last message explaining why he was blocking me, and then he blocked me.

At first, it was really rough, I cried harder then I ever have, and I've cried really hard before.

It's been a few hours since, and I'm trying to go to sleep but my thoughts and body are refusing.

I keep thinking, what did I do wrong? Why didn't he say anything before? Just today I was texting him about how my first therapy appointment went, and now he's blocking me... I just.... Don't..... Get.... It....


I don't exactly have a lot of friends, so this is just really tough on me, this is a guy who I literally talked with ever. Single. Day. For 5 years, only days I missed were when I was in a mental hospital....

Where do I go from here?"
60,1,"I'm *very* behind people my age for many reasons, some of them my fault some of them just unlucky circumstances. I mean VERY behind, to the point that I don't really have anything to talk about with people my age because I have nothing in common with them. When the topic of ""what do you do with your life?"" comes up everyone starts talking about career, grad school, relationships etc and I haven't even finished my bachelors' degree, have never even had a job because I was too sick to work, and I've never had anything close to a relationship either. I also don't understand how conversations are supposed to go and my new therapist isn't ruling out yet that I might be on the spectrum but I honestly don't think I am because I never had sensory issues and I CAN understand social cues if I try hard enough, it's just that it takes a lot of energy and there are a lot of factors to consider. All this has just led me to feeling really isolated even among my friends, who are all growing up and maturing while I'm not. When they ask me how school is going I just want the ground to open up and swallow me because I don't want to lie, but telling the truth that I was yet again too sick to go to an exam disgusts me, I can see from the look in their eyes that it disgusts them too. Everybody I know is so far ahead in life and I've lost 30 kg/66 lbs just these past 2.5 years because I'm so depressed I can't even eat. I'm on medication and it helps A LOT but there's just so much damage done at this point and with all the shame and embarrassment I can't see how I could get out of this. I want somebody to understand so badly but nobody can understand what it's like to be so fucked up for so long that you don't even care whether you live or die anymore, let alone hit all the milestones a normal 24 year old should hit. "
61,1,Everything I say to me sounds like manipulation I feel unnatural in basic conversation I don't enjoy interacting I absolutely fucking dread speaking or having to speak to other people I don't feel like I'm human I'm some other species of lesser being I'm not one of you I'm some kind of animal 
62,2,"I think I‚Äôve slowly turned into someone people only remember when they need something. In school I was always the outsider who was barely noticed and barely included. That‚Äôs when I learned that if I became good at something, if I made myself useful, maybe people would finally value me. So I worked hard, got better at studies, and it worked. People started talking to me, smiling at me, asking for help and I helped every time because I have a soft heart and a quiet hope that maybe this is how I get to matter. Just recently a college friend texted me after months, spoke sweetly for a while and then asked for help and now I‚Äôve been helping them for the past three days. and this isn‚Äôt new, most of the friends I thought I had only come to me when they need to vent or want something from me. I see it, I feel it, and every time it hurts a little more but I still keep showing up because somewhere deep down I‚Äôve accepted that maybe this is the only way I get to keep people around"
63,0,"I hate my brother. He's a pastor. For a long time, he was my pastor. 

One time he told me God hates sin AND the sinner. 

He has explicitly suggested on multiple occasions that my mental health problems were being made up for attention. If only he could see the scars and therapy bills. 

He published a huge lie about a conversation we had in a book and said that it was a conversation he had with God. 

He also published lies about my father in the book. 

He fired a staff member who had been a friend for almost 15 years over a zoom call when he heard she would be moving 9 months down the line. 

He fired another one who was his literal next door neighbor for a similar reason.

He bumped himself up to a six-figure salary after letting go of staff members. He said he needed Lasik so he could see better when he's skiiing.

He preaches about community and forgiveness, about loving your family. But I truly believe the best thing my family could do for him would be to die in a fiery plane wreck so he could have fodder for a sermon series. 

Everybody who is a current congregant  loves him. He's a pillar in his community. He does so many charity events. He's just the most selfish person I know and a total Con artist as far as I'm concerned. Something they don't know is just how many bridges he's burned and how readily he'll do it. 

He doesn't want friends, he wants followers. If you're not involved in his business, he truly does not care. I've watched it my whole life now.

I've known his wife for 20 years and I don't know much about her. She exists to serve his business pursuit. 

I wish his wife would leave him, but I doubt it. That what's going to take him down for a while in his 40s. Will it be drugs or an affair? My guess is a misappropriation of church funds. I don't look forward to it, but I guess we'll see how it works out."
64,2,"Realising that after talking with a friend that my anger and pain and even hatred towards them was because of my guilt of not helping another friend in the same way they did and even actively and unknowingly making it worse

Which followed into wondering why I thought it was helping in the first place and I think it‚Äôs because everytime I talked to someone about my struggles instead of actually helping me or telling me I‚Äôm in the wrong they acted like I was a innocent baby and the other person was evil

And I think I‚Äôve had this happen my entire life which caused me to potentially conceal others the same way or have this feeling and constant terror of people seeing I in fact have flaws due to how anyone that had flaws in a way that actually affected them made them evil

66,1,"I am deeply unsatisfied with my current life. I'm 19 (just finished my first year of community college), live in a one bedroom apartment with my family, and my only friend is my younger sister. I tried making friends last semester, but none of them worked out, either because we didn't connect or because they just stopped responding to me as soon as the school year ended (this just recently happened with someone I thought I could actually connect with, which is why I feel really frustrated now). Everyday, I wake up and just use my phone ALL DAY, and I hate it but am also addicted to it. I get very light exercise but I dont eat enough because I dont have enough motivation to learn how to cook. I dont even have enough motivation to pursue my hobbies, which are art, writing, and music. Part of it is that I feel very uncomfortable just existing around my parents, and as a result, my sleep schedule is fucked because the only alone time I have is when everyone else is asleep. I just wish I could live by myself and teach myself how to take care of myself out of necessity and pursue my hobbies without feeling judged all the time and have a good group of friends. The only thing im looking forward to in life right now is that I'm going to Japan with my sister in a week, so I'll have some time to just explore and enjoy the world around me with someone I feel comfortable being myself around. But since I cant live by myself yet, I want to at least learn bare essential life skills and have a part time job of some kind, but I just spend all day watching youtube or whatever instead of doing actual work.

It's hard to bring it all together every single day, the ""A"" game 

I love him so very much, when I look at his eyes I see the disappointment, anxiety and it's so hard and for the sake of our child we try and keep things at home normal...but man! Some phases in life can be so hopeless. I worry what all this anxiety will do to the two of us.

I can 100% say that my parents are my sponsors. They are paying for everything regarding me. Im a sahm not by choice and i dont have my own money. My husband got himself braces but not for me so my parents payed for them. They are paying for the check ups too. Clothing, medicine, vitamins, hospital bills basically everything that i need.

76,1,"I feel kinda lame having to go on here to vent, but obviously I can't complain about this to my friends so here I am. Today is my 20th birthday, which is supposed to be a pretty big milestone for me, but it's all just felt like one big letdown. 

Now, I don't have that many close friends, but the friends I do have I care for deeply. I have my best friend, 2 friends from high school, and 5 friends from college that I would consider as my closest friends. 2/5 of my college friends actually remembered my birthday and texted me bday wishes which I am extremely grateful for, but everyone else forgot. I'm honestly not surprised my friends from high school didn't remember because they've forgotten previous years too, and my friends from college don't reach out over text much unless I initiate something. Mostly, I just feel heartbroken that my best friend hadn't said anything. She's ghosted me for almost 5 months now and I've been hoping that maybe she would say something, at least for my birthday, but there was absolutely nothing from her. But, that's kind of a whole other issue.

I guess I just feel kind of stupid for barely having any celebration. I always see so many of my acquaintances posting/reposting dozens of birthday posts and seeing their comments flooding with support, so it's difficult to not want to measure self-worth by comparing how much people are willing to show their love for you vs how people love others. And also just the effort I try putting in for remembering everyone's birthday so they can feel even just a little more special starts to feel like it's never going to be reciprocated. Like, is it so hard to just add a reminder in your calendar whenever you find out when someone's birthday is?? I've been doing that since I got my first phone but I guess most people just don't bother? It's just a combination of things that make me feel more and more pathetic no matter how much I try to stay positive for the people who have shown up for me. Honestly, I forgot where I was even going with this post I just really needed to vent even if no one see this.

TLDR; Most of my closest friends forgot my birthday even when I make an effort to remember theirs and now the only way I can sum up my entire birthday is just: ""pathetic""."

Ive had a pretty bad year with my mental health, and for the last 2 months of school I only went in 1 accounting class, I was trying to avoid the teacher. That meant I only studied company accounts and cash flows, missing out on product budgeting, cash budgeting and sole trader, and I haven't studied for accounting since I stopped going to class. When I was in class I found ordinary very easy, getting 80s and 90s on tests, but my exams tomorrow and I haven't studied. "

79,1,"I love him so much!! But argh he‚Äôs such a boy sometimes and his emotional process is different from mine. I‚Äôm the type to not say things if they are not helpful or positive, and he believes in honesty as a means of trust. Yesterday we were talking about how we started seeing each other, a common topic for us, when he mentioned that he honestly wasn‚Äôt really crushing on me when we first started dating. which ü•≤. so I asked him why he asked me out after several months of not wanting to. led to a rabbit hole conversation in which he divulged more of the things he was thinking about when we first started dating. things how he wasn‚Äôt sure about me, but realized dating wasn‚Äôt an ultimatum and he could feel things out. and how at first he had to make a conscious effort to do relationshippy things with me‚Äînot *force* himself, but really change his mindset. I know things are not like that now and we both really care about each other, but I feel dejected hearing those things. This is my first committed relationship after a long string of fuckboys, so I look at every step of this relationship with flowers and hearts and rose colored glasses. In my downtime, I loved thinking back on how we got here. But knowing his side of things now, it‚Äôs hard to feel the same fondness for those memories as I had before. And despite how wonderful things are, that thought does make me sad. I guess ignorance is indeed bliss, huh? "
80,3,"My husband conditioned me through trauma so that he could call me violent

I was never a violent person growing up, I was suckerpunched and titty twisted by boys at least 3 times that I remember in school, and my response was to leave the situation and get to safety.  My mom hit me and both parents verbally and emotionally abused me and I never responded, I always just sought to keep away to keep the peace.

Some years ago, my husband started forcefully grabbing my hands, hurting my wrists and arms and hands, and hitting himself with my hands.  He kept doing this on the regular although I fought it and asked him to stop.  He said that he wanted me to be rough with him, like rough sex, and he wasn't going to stop until I started doing it myself.

I started hitting him in anger to get it to stop, and then he began to scream at me that I'm violent and to slam me around in ""self defense.""  He kept asking for rough sex but then also being abusive to me about how inferior I was because I was ""violent.""  I talked to him about why, and he refused to admit that things happened this way, and he continued to scream at me until I hit him on many occasions, only to then kerbstomp me in response because I am ""inferior to him because I responded violently to words.""  This pattern has continued for years, and he obviously gets a thrill out of it and doesn't want to change the behavior.  He was increasingly abusive to me about my ""violence"" and that he's filmed it and is going to black mail me with it and so on.

I finally searched my memory again today when he was doing this and remembered the trauma of how this started, how he would hurt my hands with taking them and hitting them on his head, and wouldn't stop despite my pleas and resistance, and that he screamed in my face to provoke me to start doing this.  Along with saying his mom hit him all the time (which he now denies after years of having told me that), and that he can take it because he's a man, then he screams at me that I'm hitting him because he's a man, says all of these arguments that I now know come from TRP/incels, and gets abusive.  He also bosses me around to an irritating degree non-stop and denies that he does it or that he's being manipulative.

TL;DR he screamed at me that I'm ""violent"" although I'm a peaceful person by nature, and physically, hurtfully forced my actions, so that he could respond with violent ""self defense"" to me that goes way beyond just trying to defuse a situation, to vengefully doing serious harm to me.  This is a TRP manipulation tactic that he did for both sexual thrills and because he wanted to push a TRP narrative that women are violent to men.

I broke the spell today by putting all of this together that he's tried to suppress and deny that it happened this way.

I never saw another woman talk about this happening to her, so I just wanted to share.

I believed him and felt shame for years about my violence, nor understanding how I did it when this isn't the person who I am in any other situation.

TRP is a form of BDSM kink, or at least extremely downstream from it!"
81,1,"i wasnt even there to say goodbye. she fell off her cat tree and probably paralyzed herself, she died within 15 minutes. 

my dad, mom, and brother all rushed her to the vet ER but she died in the car.

82,3,"For a year now, ever since I have started preparing for a competitive college entrance examination, my life has been fucked. 

I'm so incompetent and stupid, I had a test 2 days ago and I got the worst score possible. 

My parents make everything worse. They are full of expectations and I don't think they care about me enough, most they've said is to not take the wrong step and after every failure I've shown, they've done nothing but overwhelm me by being overwhelmed themselves. This happened again. 

And this recent failure means that I'll have to live with my mother, which I absolutely don't want not just because I dislike her and she's inconsiderate but also because she asks me along with my father to give up every hobby of mine for a year and get to studying and only study and this is very hard. 

I don't know how and whether I can convince them to not live with me. 

I decided to skip my classes today entirely and I have never skipped any this year up until now but I'll get scolded because of this too. 

I don't want to get scolded, I don't want to get misunderstood. I might be stupid but be it. 

I know I'll get the suggestion of dropping the preparation entirely but my parents won't allow it, they've shown nothing but scepticism and doubt regarding other fields. Moreover, I'm not sure what else I can do other than follow the crowd as I've never been exposed to academia in the past and have never had the opportunity to fully explore my interests. I'll apparently have that opportunity once I get to college and that too, only if I pass the examination. 

I often contemplate and reflect on whether what I'm doing is right or not and I feel sad about it and I'm never able to reach a conclusion. 

I wonder if I'll be okay.

I'm sorry for my bad English and I hope this is the right place to post this. And I'm sorry if I said anything wrong.

This leads me to cause problems and make up problems in my life and treat my loved ones poorly.

85,1,"today has been a rough day. im on the first day of my period and for some reasons that came with crazy mood swings. i spent the entire day either crying or getting pissed off about everything, but bc i do struggle with anxiety and depression sometimes its hard to tell what im feeling exactly so ive just been confused.

today a lot of things got under my skin, but the main thing was that i woke up earlier than usual (since its summer and my sleep schedule is all over the place) and my phone was painfully dry. most of my friends have partners and respond to every single notification they receive from them, even during conversation, but for some reason my notifications are never a priority. i reach out to my friends and receive responses within an hour or longer sometimes. i dont have a lack of friends, but i just wanted someone to talk to and realized that in this moment, in these 24 hours, i had no one. 

then it started to pop up on my feed. a friend flew over to visit their partner for an anniversary. an old coworker had her anniversary too. people posting their partners, vacations, dates, posts, 1 year anniversary, 2 years, 3 years, engagements, marriages, pregnancy announcements- it makes me sick.

im in my early 20s. its typical to see people in different stages of their love lives and i realize that. but it seems like everyone around me has found their person, and after a particularly rough relationship i had 4 years ago, i havent dated since, despite my efforts.  

happy couples make me angry because they overshare those special moments on the internet instead of living them. not only that but they expel all of their fucking efforts into their couple-y lovey dove-y bullshit, and oops! now they dont feel like talking to their friends. 

im tired of being an afterthought. im tired of my friends treating me like im in the background. i try so hard to assure my friends they are important to me, giving them gifts, initiating hang outs, doing things they want to do bc it makes them happy, etc etc. but that same level of care and thoughtfulness never gets reciprocated.

im a physical touch person. none of my friends hug me. in fact most of them dont really like physical touch, which is fine, but theyre ok with it when it comes to partners. im not interested in sex or anything like that, but i need to date someone just to get a long hug????

it could be my autism but people are more confusing than ever. i make my needs clear and they are not met. i take care of people but have no one to fall to. im in a room full of people, and i feel so alone because theyre busy making out with each other and rubbing it in my face.

and the worst part of all of this is that i cant even say this to anyone out loud because theyll accuse me of being miserable and pathetic and lonely. i fucking hate my life."
86,0,"The struggle is something I‚Äôm not afraid of anymore. You have to crawl to walk. It‚Äôs painful but it won‚Äôt last forever. I won‚Äôt let it. Learning to stop complaining is hard.

You will too!"
87,1,"I have tuberous breast deformity which has completely destroyed my ability to feel like a full, desirable woman. It‚Äôs not just body image. It‚Äôs not just insecurity. It‚Äôs the experience of having something sacred and identity shaping taken away from me before I even got to feel whole. And since it‚Äôs so specific, and because everyone only seems to have aesthetic concerns about their bodies that are within the range of normal. I feel like I can‚Äôt relate to anyone. And nobody understands.

When people try to empathise, it‚Äôs usually about body image issues like ‚Äúmy boobs are small‚Äù or ‚Äúi look weird in a bikini‚Äù. This isn‚Äôt that. It‚Äôs a deformity, it‚Äôs not small, it is malformed. And it significantly impacts how I move in the world, how I experience relationships, how I process existing in a sexualised society.

It feels like porn culture and the way men comply with it has made this 100000x worse. I‚Äôll never be the fantasy. I‚Äôll never be seen the way I need to be. I have an amazing boyfriend yet I am still completely crushed by retroactive jealousy. I know his past partners/the women he had access to before me had better bodies, and I can‚Äôt stop the images in my head or imagining what he sees when he looks at them.

I‚Äôm looking into surgery and it may be covered by my insurance but I‚Äôm scared of not liking the results. I‚Äôll have scarring, and guys prefer ‚Äúnatural‚Äù boobs. I also may lose sensation. I‚Äôm scared that even after doing the thing that I thought could fix me still won‚Äôt feel okay, and I‚Äôll have exhausted my options.

To me, it doesn‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs something worth fighting for. I‚Äôll never have this part of myself I need or to be perceived in the way I need. This porn lens taints everyone in society, and I can‚Äôt escape from it."
88,1,"Not accepting boyfriends is one thing, not accepting any proposals that we get for marriage is another.

lol. 

I don‚Äôt even know what to say or where to begin sometimes. Just truly baffled at the whole process of adulting with the interference of my parents. 

They wouldn‚Äôt let me be independent and now they won‚Äôt let me be dependent on the person I want to be dependent for also. What era am I stuck in? 

I‚Äôm 27. I feel so depressed and lonely already.

I don‚Äôt understand on what basis do they say no to people. Like have they seen themselves and what they bring to table? And they have expectations that‚Äôs beyond the roof. I get that have my best interests in their hearts but god just let me leave the fucking nest so I can live life and make my own decisions. 

For once, let me make my own decision if they won‚Äôt make one for me. It‚Äôs not rocket science, it‚Äôs so simple.

89,2,"Last Friday I was with some friends at a bar, and we drank quite heavily. We went there by bike, but since other friends joined us there, some of us back to walk back at the house. Friends told me I was to drunk to ride a bike, but I tried to take one anyway, and I felt after less than 10 meters. I went to the hospital and got 3 stitches on my chin, and now I am already obsessed with the scar I am gonna have üò¢"
90,3,"It‚Äôs now 8:07am on Wednesday as I text this. I cleared my diary, ensured I‚Äôm in a safe space and have my earbuds in waiting for my Mental Health First Aid Supervision to begin. I am a Mental Health First Aider who shows up and does the work to the best of my ability and with all my training. It‚Äôs been rewarding so far. 

Recently, however, I sat with someone who had a problem that hit really close to home and I didn‚Äôt realise just how much I struggled with the issue. I was able to be of use and present to this person in that moment but I walked away like some kind of veteran of a psychic war. Flashbacks and feelings that I thought I dealt with suddenly splattered across my mind.

I scheduled a call with the organisation for 8am this morning after they failed to ring me on Monday. I had a ‚Äúooops, Monday was messy‚Äù email stating they usually use Teams but I pointed out I ticked the phone call option and knowing I did because I confirmed my phone number. I sent them a reply with the time to ring me AND typed in my phone number for today‚Äôs call and now it‚Äôs 8:23am. 

I think what really gets me about this is I am the kind of person who follows through with plans. I get that things come up but this is meant to be a professional company that is there to support Mental Health First Aiders and they have reportedly helped others but they‚Äôve left me hanging and I‚Äôm spinning out because I really need to talk this out. 

So now I am reliving two things I struggle with. The original issue that came after helping someone else through their struggle, and the feeling of being unvalued. Like my time means nothing to others. 

Right. It‚Äôs 8:31 now so I guess I had better go journal, meditate and try to counsel myself. Come on Higher Self, don‚Äôt let me down!

91,1,"I am always taking photos of my friends, just fun little candid ones most of the time. Sometimes when they look good I tell them pose up and like put them in certain places I know will look so great for a photo. I love documenting my friends and getting photos when they look their best, like when they‚Äôre genuinely smiling and look like they‚Äôre glowing. None of my friends do that. I hate that I don‚Äôt have photos they took of me that aren‚Äôt like, silly or when I look weird or bad. I wish they would take photos of me like I do of them. When I take their picture I want to be able to show it to them and love seeing them get excited because it‚Äôs a good photo and they look great because they weren‚Äôt trying. I feel awkward being like ‚Äúhey can you take my photo‚Äù and then I have to awkwardly try and pose. Maybe it‚Äôs just me because I love getting photos of them when they don‚Äôt even realize they look amazing, I wish they would do the same for me. I hate being missing in group photos, I‚Äôm not in the one group photo we got at prom, everyone is posing together and I took it and they didn‚Äôt think to be like ‚Äúokay now one with you‚Äù they just broke off to get other photos with their dates and stuff. Like it‚Äôs not that deep but also it feels that deep, especially since they posted that photo everywhere but there‚Äôs almost no photos of me in the group. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre leaving me out intentionally and I know that I take more photos than they do just because I‚Äôm more of a ‚Äúcapture the moment‚Äù person. Not like I‚Äôm not present and focusing on my phone, I am always making sure to stay in the moment while also getting photos for memories. One of my other friends is like me and takes a lot of photos but we don‚Äôt get to hang out a lot because she lives kinda far and we only hang out every few weeks. It‚Äôs such like a‚Ä¶uhhhhhh, feeling. Not having photos of me just being myself because I‚Äôm awkward when I actually have a camera on me knowingly.

93,1,"I would like to know what a happy, loving, and supportive family felt like. Unfortunately, i‚Äôd never know because i was given the spawn of satan as a mother. Yes, i understand that life is hard. She may have went through terrible things, but even some drug addicts on intervention still show some type of attachment or love for their kid. Even when they are high out of their minds!

I think i could accept the truth if she told me she never wanted me then I can stop hoping that she‚Äôd love me one day. Maybe I should accept that truth now. She‚Äôll never come around. She will never be the supportive, sensitive mother i need. 

She fostered this competitive, eerie household where my sisters are always in competition with me and each other. Actually, i‚Äôll just say they want to be in competition with me because i don‚Äôt even care to be around them let alone compete for my mothers‚Äô love and acceptance. My sister gave my mother my diary i guess thinking that‚Äôll strengthen her bond with my mom. Nope! Just recently, she kicked her out and she was homeless for two weeks. 

My middle sister is always making comments about how i was ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù and the ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù. Spoiled? Idk how being kicked out, homeless, broke and hungry in college (while all my friends‚Äô moms called them, gave them money, helped them out) is spoiled. My grandmother gave me $100, A $100 and my mother made the comment ‚ÄúWhy you giving her money?‚Äù Anyone who has been to college understands how tough it can get. So for her to make that comment really pissed me off. But she‚Äôs taking pictures to post me on fb to show everyone i went to college though. ü§Æ

Everytime im given something my middle sister makes a comment. I was given sculptures of the french clown Pierrot from an aunt. I love art! I am an art collector so to me that meant a lot. They were dusty and had dirt on them. She makes a sly comment, ‚ÄúYou better hope i didn‚Äôt break them in the car.‚Äù Just evil.

94,3,"I just want somebody to hear me. If you work in healthcare just don‚Äôt even read this I don‚Äôt wanna fight with anyone what I‚Äôm saying can be triggering. 

Working in healthcare is actually soul crushing. I hate it so much and it has nothing to do with patients or the work it‚Äôs the fucking co-workers and managers. It hurts me so much seeing patients getting treated poorly. 

I do inpatient treatment now but when I did home care my clients would absolutely adore me just for doing the bare fucking minimum. Like being nice and showing up on time. Like that was fucking rare apparently? I had so many clients like this. 

Now I work in addiction inpatient treatment and there‚Äôs this guy at my job and he‚Äôs so fucking mean and rude and he‚Äôs always bragging about how caring he is. He‚Äôs sooo dismissive hardly anything is valid. Something hard will happen and he‚Äôll come to me to ‚Äúsupport me‚Äù but he interrupts me and talks about himself the whole time, and dismisses my feelings. Then he‚Äôs like I‚Äôm such a good supportive co-worker! He gossips about EVERYONE every chance he gets and he‚Äôs ruined patients reputations. All he does is complain and judge people. One time he told everyone that a patient was m***bating in the halls. And all the other patients hated him. Cameras proved it didn‚Äôt happen. 

And management allows this. They fucking trust him and make excuses for him. They let a fucking bully work in inpatient treatment. 

Mb it‚Äôs just me but the job itself is not that hard. 95% of patients are calm and polite and follow the rules. It‚Äôs the meanest co-workers that complain about patients getting mad at them the most. And it‚Äôs cause they start shit. When I work with a good empathetic team (which is fucking rare) patients feel better and are naturally more calm. When people know they‚Äôll be heard and supported no matter what they‚Äôre more honest. Like you know.

Most of the time when patients lash out it‚Äôs cause we literally did something wrong. We get de-escalation training, coworkers choose to escalate instead and then complain when it was a mess. Like WTF 

Also why on earth would anyone work in addictions if they hate drug seeking behavior. I can‚Äôt stand the nurses. They are sooo ignorant when it comes to mental health. And they think everyone is a lying drug seeker If you‚Äôre not screaming and crying in public you aren‚Äôt depressed and don‚Äôt need your prescribed meds. 
Its definitely not like it‚Äôs super common for people to hide their suffering or anything no.. (sarcasm) 

MAYBE.. people ask for meds when they need them for whatever reason. Even if it‚Äôs fucking drug seeking they are doing that cuz they‚Äôre fucking desperate for relief. No happy and calm person seeks drugs. Does it mean give them a narcotic? Obviously not but atleast see what you can do??? The moment they decide the patient is ‚Äúfine‚Äù they loose all empathy and the patient is nothing but an annoying drug seeker. Then I have to hear them mocking the patient and talking shit about them. Meanwhile that patient is genuinely suffering. 

Yesterday I got fucking meanly criticized by a nurse in front of a patient when I said I didn‚Äôt have the intake breathalyzer results.  I didn‚Äôt do the fucking intake I had nothing to do with it. I was gonna say we need to ask the staff member who did it and she cut me off and started lecturing me about not doing it. WTF. It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs just waiting for a chance to put someone else down. 

I could keep going on and on there‚Äôs way more but I won‚Äôt. I hate my job so much. "

At least when I had a hooked nose it covered most of my upper lip. Now this looks hideous and thin. It took me 12 months before I was comfortable to leave the house again. I found a job and am now working on paying off my credit cards and collecting a savings so I could have a revision and have some of my old features back. I just want to forget this mess ever occurred.

It‚Äôs just that, ever since I started this new job. People treat me worse than they did before. I show up every day, put in my eight hours, but man. People are insufferable. Out right bullies. People lack any empathy and tend to kick you while you‚Äôre down. Even when I try to stay quiet, do my shift and go home. People have to find a way to interject my looks into the conversation.

Meanwhile before my nose job. People thought I was handsome. Kids would blush even.

I pray constantly but feel like my prayers are falling on deaf ears. I‚Äôm heavily suicidal. Not planning, just wish I wasn‚Äôt born. I try to stay hopeful and put in my time hoping that the future will look different but man, day in day out this is very difficult."

The company that makes the uniforms we use only makes clothing based on the male physique, so as a woman i have to use 3-4 sizes bigger than normal since i have boobs and hips. Because I have to use such a big size, the rest of the clothing is huge. I have to roll up a third of the pants since they are so long, just to avoid tripping. And even by rolling the arms so they are supposed to hit the elbow, they go past my hands. 
I hate feeling like I am swimming in the uniform just because I am a woman, and the company refuses to make clothing based on the female physique"

98,1,"I am 26 years old and recently everyone has told me they thought I was barely 19 years old. People would be FLOORED and in shock when I would tell them my age. People would always treat me differently, like I noticed everyone would always be very very rude and disrespectful when talking to me/ how they treated me when I would never do anything to anyone, and I was always the only person they treated like this. I‚Äôve had coworkers at past jobs, (coworkers not managers or anything above me) start just telling me to go clean/ do things around the store, telling me what to do like they were a manager but I would be the only person they did it to. I would never see them doing it to any other of my coworkers. I never knew why they did this because I just thought doing that was bizarre and made no sense to me. Only recently I thought that they were probably doing this to me because ‚ÄúI look very young‚Äù so they probably thought I was much younger than them, which they think makes it okay to just start telling me to do things when they weren‚Äôt the manager. Also people would never take me seriously. Every time I try to be confident or assertive in social situations or at work, people/managers say I‚Äôm being extremely rude and I get in HUGE trouble and they all get VERY mad at me. I‚Äôve had a therapist tell me the reason people always attack me for no reason when I never do anything to them is ‚Äúbecause of how I look‚Äù. She told me these things have nothing to do with body language, how you carry yourself, or how you talk and it‚Äôs 100% how you look. I asked her what it was about how I looked that made me a target and she just shrugged and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs just how you look.‚Äù And refused to tell me what she meant. My whole life I‚Äôve always been bullied in almost all social situations no matter what, where, who. Guys were also never interested in me at all, ever. Guys just never were interested in me in any way. They just never wanted anything to do with me and would act appalled whenever I tried talking to them (because I had to since they weren‚Äôt) I‚Äôve never dated anyone and people are always never shocked when they find out. My whole life people like other girls never wanted to be my friend/ were never interested in me. They would always be very rude or unhinged to me with no hesitation and that‚Äôs always how people treated me. When I waited for people to come to me, every time it would never happen. I always just never had friends since high school until now. I was by myself all the time and it felt mentally damaging to have nobody, ever. It sounds crazy but I even think my own mother never stopped treating me like a child up until now age 26 is because I look very young. 
I never knew why this happened to me but I think now the reason is because ‚ÄúI look very young‚Äù and so when you look young people automatically see you as a target, have no respect for you and bully/ harass you because ‚Äúyour very young‚Äù and that‚Äôs just what people do, and that‚Äôs probably the reason for everyone‚Äôs behavior. "
99,3,"My best friend and her husband came out here for me and my husband‚Äôs wedding this weekend and stayed for a few days as well. The day of our wedding, he was so mean to her. As she was trying to get ready, he would purposely mess up how she looks because he thinks it‚Äôs funny. Apparently this has been a thing he does for a while now and he doesn‚Äôt care that it annoys his wife. 

As we were riding in the limo, she‚Äôs trying to hype me up by singing and moving her arms dancing. He yells ‚Äústop‚Äù at her and everyone else got quiet. We look at each other and I can tell she was hurt by it. No one wants to get involved in their relationship, they‚Äôve been married for two months and she makes it sound like hell. She gets annoyed when he‚Äôs home and wants alone time. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs normal to genuinely hate when your new husband is home. But that‚Äôs beside the point. During the beginning of the wedding when I was waiting in the bridal suite to make my entrance, my brother comes and tells me that he saw my best friend and her husband arguing in a corner and she was crying. 

A few minutes later my best friend comes in and tells me she‚Äôs trying so hard to pull it together for my wedding and how he‚Äôs trying to ruin it for her. She says he‚Äôs a narcissist who makes everything about him and can‚Äôt let her enjoy herself even on her best friend‚Äôs wedding day. I felt so bad for her. She pulled it together and we got through the wedding. She was glad I put them on separate tables, i had my bridesmaids and mothers on a special table. 


Yesterday we went to a cool mall here and he was mad at her for no reason and wasn‚Äôt talking the entire time even though my husband was trying with him. Eventually he got back to normal and we continued our day like normal. But it was so awkward during that tension, my husband gets so weirded out by it. He tries to settle things down by keeping a conversation going.

Today, we went out for these chicken bowls I absolutely love. My best friend got the same as me and she said she liked it a lot but then she tried a bit from my husband‚Äôs plate and she wanted the sauce he had on his. She wanted to go up and ask but her husband was telling her she can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs so weird to see her just listen to him and be very clearly upset by it. I‚Äôm like if it‚Äôll make her enjoy her meal more then why not? Eventually she got to get sauce at the end of the meal to go. But the tension just ruined the whole vibes of the dinner. It‚Äôs honestly really annoying. We just wanna go out and have a fun time, these little things every time get so annoying. You can always guarantee tension.

Yesterday me and her were talking in the kitchen alone and she says she feels like she‚Äôs already too deep and can‚Äôt walk away. After getting married to him and everything. I‚Äôm like you feel like that but you‚Äôre never in too deep. If you‚Äôre not happy, you have to make the tough decision for yourself. It‚Äôs been years and years of their relationship being toxic. It‚Äôs just exhausting. I‚Äôve always been there for her and try to help her, but she always goes back to him and all the talks and all the guidance was just wasted breath. I‚Äôm kind of glad they‚Äôre going home tomorrow, I can‚Äôt stand being around my best friend while her husband is there. "
100,3,"I'm beyond happy to help my friends and loved ones, I truly am. But I've been forgetting to take care of myself in turn, and the stress is burning me the fuck out.

Last month I was on my first individual vacation ever, it was my dream vacation, and one of my best friends had a major issue. I actually stepped aside for a few hours to help her get through it all in the moment. About 2 weeks ago, same friend and situation reached a head, and I spent many hours across multiple days talking this friend through it all, and I'm still doing so on occasion.

The day after this, my boyfriend got jumped and beaten up. I was doing all I could to help him as well.

Then a few days ago, my other friend had a situation akin to the first friend. Naturally I helped out how I could, but my boyfriend is also sick currently, so I bought him medicine and have been doing my best to care for him.

But it's been 3 days and I haven't remembered to refill my medicine, so now my psoriasis is flaring on my scalp. I don't remember when I last took a shower. My asthma which has been relentless and no medication helps, is flaring even more now due to exhaustion and stress. I have to schedule an appointment to replace the back brakes on my car and also a test with the hospital for my asthma, and I'm just fucking exhausted y'all...

The trouble is that I feel awful if I leave my friends in need through the absolute toughest moments in their lives. I spent many years in therapy learning that I am the caretaker because I didn't have someone like that for myself growing up. I have all the coping skills, but psych medications are useless. My body does not respond to any, and I tried countless in all possible doses across a decade. So like most everything, I just need to brute force it through this, but also recognize that I matter and I need to care for myself as much as I care for others.

But I'm just tired. It's almost 3am but I'll go take a quick shower, then sleep. I need it."
101,1,"So basically just as the title says. I am a first gen, from a low income background. I tried to go to college and I ended up failing my first year because of mental health issues and poor financial preparedness/ inability to qualify for student loans. After years i got super lucky and I started going to college again and i managed to get scholarships to cover like almost all of my attendance costs and i am working full time/ support myself completely. I even have a prestigious major and really solid career prospects post grad. Here‚Äôs my issue: I am stuck somewhere pretty rural and as someone who is lgbt I feel like my dating options have been pretty much exhausted at this point? I have had a few relationships here and there pretty consistently but i‚Äôve recently kinda hit a wall. I just have this itch to give it up and go to a big city to finally try and meet the one, but I know I have the opportunity of a lifetime here with school. I guess i feel privileged to have the opportunity but I just feel so alone and kind of trapped I guess. I just have two years left and i‚Äôm 22. I know there‚Äôs time later for romance but i‚Äôm struggling so hard with this heavy sadness. I just feel so alone despite having friends and family etc. "

Hi all, this may not be the best place to post this, but I‚Äôm just incredibly stressed out and anxious. I got bite by a lone star tick over the weekend. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it at the time, but I distinctly remember it having a little white patch on its back before I flushed it.  I started to research a bit the next morning and realized what it was all the potential ramifications. I‚Äôm so distraught thinking about alpha gal syndrome. Though it‚Äôs rare, it seems to be becoming rapidly more common, especially in my part of the country‚Äî Kansas City, Missouri.

I‚Äôve reached out to a dr. Via tele-heath. They‚Äôve nurse mentioned that it was serious and she had a family member run into a lot of complications with LS ticks They‚Äôve got me on doxycycline to hopefully remove the risk of some of the possible pathogens. That said I fully understand that AGS is wholly different and won‚Äôt be minimized by doxy.

I‚Äôve also already reached out to an allergist to explain the situation‚Äîand again, the receptionist said they had someone call in the same day with the same issue, however they were experiencing horrendous symptoms, which freaked me out. Even though I‚Äôm not presenting any symptoms I felt it best to be extremely proactive about this. I already have terrible seasonal allergies, which from what I understand makes me even more susceptible to AGS due to my heightened histamine response.

Again, not classic symptoms yet outside of extra body itching, which could just be anxiety.


I just can‚Äôt fathom a life long, or years long, battle with a mammal allergy. I just don‚Äôt know how to navigate that.

All comments and feedback are welcome.

103,1,"I‚Äôm tired of pretending I‚Äôm ok.
My parents are horrible people and like a moron I try hard to keep some sort of relationship with them as an adult, because I still love them and I don‚Äôt know why. 

All my life my parents have torn me down, hurt me, doubted me, insulted me, criticized my life.
I don‚Äôt even understand why they had me if they had no intention to love me..
It also kills me when people say ‚Äúthey are still your parents‚Äù ok? I‚Äôm not the abuser, I didn‚Äôt want them to do the shit they did to me. They chose that. It guts me to see people with awesome parents and a happy environment, really I can‚Äôt even be around it as it makes me depressed to see someone have something I should‚Äôve had too but I didn‚Äôt. 
I wish I could just stop caring about them for my own sanity. "
104,1,"I don't want them to ask me if I'm okay, absolutely nothing at all. I just want to throw myself in their arms and ball my eyes out for hours on end. I want to feel the comfort of someone else loving me. I have no one. I have phantom sense, but I don't have my VR on me and hug my friends. After I moved houses my irl friends stopped talking to me. Only notifications I get are from here and YouTube. I don't feel safe anywhere. I'm traumatized from not long ago. I need someone."
105,1,"When I started my job 18 months ago, I was a nervous wreck. This was my first job outside of retail and because I‚Äôm Autistic, all these changes and transitions were even harder. I met Nora on my first day, she‚Äôs in same position as me, and walked me through the basic of the job. Not too long after I started, I was given more tasks alongside Nora and we quickly hit it off. We were the perfect pair as our strengths and weaknesses balanced each other out.

Nora is also neurodivergent so she vibed and dealt with my tisms‚Äô really well. She knew that even though I was doing something else- playing on my phone or doodling- that I was paying attention and listening, so she just let me do my thing. She could tell when she was ‚Äúlosing me‚Äù and was really good at redirection. Nora often knew what I was going to do before I did- ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stick your hand in the (broken) shredder, dude.‚Äù She said one time when I had just began to lean into those pesky intrusive thoughts.

And I knew her. I knew when she was having troubling processing things or when she needed to talk something out. I sat with her through countless tricky emails, letting her read and explain some new policy or change to me over and over again because she needed to teach and explain it in order to understand it herself. I helped her write hundreds of emails because sometimes she struggles to translate thoughts into words. I could stop her spirals before they got out of hand.

We were the go-to dynamic duo.

Then one day, it changed.

I told Nora a lie. She asked if I had done something I was supposed to do- I was distracted, and talking to someone else. I said yes even though I hadn‚Äôt- don‚Äôt know why I lied. It was about something so small and stupid, but it affected Nora. Nora hates lies, some issue from her past that made it an instant stop. That was on Friday. Monday and Tuesday she didn‚Äôt talk to me; she talked to everyone else, but me. On Wednesday, I asked if she was mad at me. I knew something was off, but I didn‚Äôt know what. She said she wasn‚Äôt mad at me, but she was struggling with an interpersonal conflict. We talked later that afternoon where she told me how deeply and personally she was hurt, and that she was trying not to let our personal relationship affect our professional one. She needed some time and space, the wall of trust needed to be rebuilt, but one day- she assured me- we‚Äôd be okay again.

It‚Äôs been 3 months and I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever be the same. We‚Äôre casual coworkers now, never stepping outside the barrier of professionalism. It hurts not being to talk to her about things we used to talk about. It hurts not being the one she chooses to take a lunch or break with. It hurts seeing her laugh and joke with everyone but me. It hurts watching her spend all her time and becoming closer with that coworker we once despised. It hurts that she doesn‚Äôt talk through emails with me anymore even though she‚Äôs obviously struggling.

Some days are better than others. Some days we‚Äôre almost back to where we used to be. Every once in a while I think things are good, that just maybe, we‚Äôre closing that distance and things will go back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but it never lasts. She‚Äôll go a day or two without talking to me. More often than not, when she does eventually talk to me, it‚Äôs to point out some mistake I made.

I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs doing it on purpose, but that doesn‚Äôt make it hurt any less. And to top it all off, I sometimes feel as if I‚Äôm not allowed to feel this way. She doesn‚Äôt have to be my friend. She doesn‚Äôt have to talk to me. She doesn‚Äôt have to put up with me more than the job requires. She doesn‚Äôt have to be nice, only professional. I‚Äôm too sensitive. It‚Äôs all my fault.

I will say I have chronic depression and anxiety, that I could be misinterpreting or reading into things. But that doesn‚Äôt the stop the hurt. And my god, it hurts a lot."
106,1,"I really miss my therapist and I‚Äôm not sure who to tell since well I don‚Äôt have a therapist anymore. It‚Äôs been a few months since my last session and I‚Äôve hated it ever since. It‚Äôs been a really tough few months too and everything is just getting worse. 

She was always very polite and understanding and great at talking me through things. I always came out of sessions feeling like a new person and just refreshed. It was like leaving her office was a shower for my soul, yet for some reason I just can‚Äôt make myself go back. 

I had to stop due to losing my job but now that I have a job again I can‚Äôt bring myself to go back. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm scared it won‚Äôt be the same or if I just can‚Äôt face her again because I just cut all contact because I was ashamed of losing my job. Either way I miss you Mrs Angie.

108,1,"17 but my whole life has been shit. i never felt happy, and even as a young kid/toddler i'd constantly tell my mom that i wanted to die. nobody ever took me seriously, and id get in trouble with my parents for telling my friends or teachers that I wasn't doing well. even now, my mom still keeps poking fun at me being ""an attention seeker"", even though it never was an attention thing growing up‚ÄîI just genuinely wanted someone to get me the help i needed. 

now I dont want help anymore. I dont think I'll ever be okay, and no amount of therapy can fix me. everyone always talks about how great therapy can be, but I dont think it'll work for people who are doing BAD bad. I mean, how is a 50 min session once a week supposed to do shit for people? all you so is sit there and talk about your feelings and thats it. i think that would've helped me a few years ago‚Äîbut now its too late. I can not picture a single thing someone could do or say that would make me feel like my life is worth living, and im so fucking pissed off that nobody helped me earlier"
109,2,"I went to the closest store to buy something soft to eat because I've had 8 teeth removed, and there's nothing to eat at home. As I walked to the store, I faint on the way, but luckily, I could feel it coming, so I sat on a bus stop and leaned my head back. 

I haven't eaten anything only sometimes jam and mashed potatoes, so I guess that's why I fainted. The thing is though the bus stop is close to my school so when I woke up I saw some of my school mates and they probably saw me sleeping and drooling near a bus stop. This is the worst summer. I feel so embarrassed I didn't even go to the store. I just went back home. 

Edit: Hello, thank you for all the replies. I've read them all, and all them have been super kind and helpful. I feel much better now. My blood clot is still very unstable, so I dont really want to eat anything. I made some broth with those cube thingies (no idea what they're called, sorry) for when im hungry. Again, thank you to everyone who took the time to reply:)"

I thought I was being punked man she asked the most insane things and told me she was a stripper and could peg me if I wanted üíÄ

117,3,"She didn't warn me. I left the house with my room one way, and came back to my room reorganized. Things in different places and all that stuff.

I slept on the couch the first night and now I'm sleeping in my sister's room. She's done this many times before. 

She eventually figured out I was upset and told me, ""Don't be angry, I just wanted your room to be nice and fresh for the summer."" I am not confrontational with my mom because she has a history of victimizing herself whenever we try to talk to her about not doing stuff like this. 

Lots more to say, she reorganized my bookshelf too. But that's the jist of it. I'm frustrated and I'm tired. It adds to the list of stresses that I've been facing without end since I got out of hospitalization from surgery. I'm just done. "
118,1,"Hi, just really need to get this out. My ex and I have been together on & off for 5 years.

She wasn‚Äôt bad or evil, so I‚Äôm not sure how to word this. She‚Äôs been great since I‚Äôve become an adult and she was never abusive as a child. It‚Äôs just baffling to me how she could‚Äôve behaved and felt about me as a teenager now that I‚Äôve had my own.

I remember my mom arguing with me as a teenager. Snapping at me etc. As a teenager I didn‚Äôt consider the fact that she‚Äôs an adult and my mother, and once I became an adult I didn‚Äôt consider that again. Now that I‚Äôve been raising a moody, angry, snappy teenager. Why in gods name would I argue with her. She‚Äôs 15, I‚Äôm nearly 40 by now. That‚Äôs a kid, my kid. I‚Äôm a grown woman frankly I find it baffling my mom argued with me when I was that age. Because to me, my child is a child. I‚Äôm the adult and parent. It‚Äôs common sense not to take anything she says personally ??

There was a situation as a kid myself my cousin had passed, their family and ours were neighbours and she was like a best friend to me so it was very harrowing. I remember my mom yelled at me a lot in that time, and later said it wasn‚Äôt her fault since she was suffering grief too. And couldn‚Äôt love me at that time when she was sad her sisters polite kid had passed when her own was so troublesome. Had to learn to re-love and accept me etc.

My fathers passed recently and he too was close to my teenager, he loved his grandkids very dearly they loved him very dearly. Despite him being *my* dad, I am once again an adult. She is a teenager. She‚Äôs so young and she‚Äôs handling grief like this the first time in her life. How in gods name could I inflict my own grief and issues on her? How in gods name could I yell at her right now? What the fuck kind of a parent would I be? I‚Äôm supposed to be the one helping her through this, and healthily managing my grief away from her so she doesn‚Äôt need to suffer or deal with it.

And I cannot for the life of me consider losing love for my daughter because someone else‚Äôs had passed away. I just can‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the most baffling to me. And if I did for whatever reason, why in gods name would I **tell her** that ??

120,1,"I have not been given the beat living environment, i have been raised in an abusive and quite unstable household, as such my mental health has not been as good as you would see in a child my age at the time. I have been given multiple diagnosis ranging from Bipolar Depression to anxiety to PTSD, and let me say‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs probably the worst thing to ever happen to me, ever.

I have aspirations to join the military, been a dream of mine since I was a young lad, however with these stains on my record, they‚Äôre just going to disqualify me and deny my waivers. The years of hospitalizations and therapy means nothing, and it just feels like I‚Äôm being punished for my mental health more than anything.

Nobody trusts me with anything anymore, and therefore my existence has become very isolating. 

This has not been effecting my mental health in any positive sense at all, if anything it‚Äôs been stressing me out more and more, especially since my environment barely changed.

My future may be doomed and I might not be seen as a normal functioning human being ever since I was diagnosed with this.

I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt consider taking my life, everything feels so hopeless. "

I'm 24 now always been an introverted guy. I don't like being around so many people and I'm alone most of the time I prefer it ig cause people where I'm from are all the same when it comes to mentality I just don't feel normal around them at all. 
and when it comes to my dating life no woman ever showed intrest in me and I believe it could be my appearance idk I just never seen myself attractive at all just a mid looking guy ig and I just don't understand why everytime I try approaching a girl irl she doesn't show intrest in me at all. Sometimes on social media on Instagram for example I do have somehow good pics of me that are all taken by luck. im not trying to brag about it jts just sometimes I'm lucky enough to take that 1 in a million good pic of myself that I feel brave enough to share. for example and when I start a chat with a girl that probably checks my profile and sees how I look in those pics she thinks I look like that irl. She talks like she's intrested in me and all but if I ever got the chance to meet her and she sees me irl I sense that sudden switch in her personality and the way she talks which basically means she's not intrested in me after seeing me irl. It happened to me so many times that I reached a level where I simply gave up on trying to approach or talk to girls anymore I just gave up completely I've been single all this time now I know people might say that's a normal thing and all but its just Its been like this for too long and im sick and tired of it its like im just existing at this point.

How about you try something like: ‚Äúalright I get where you‚Äôre coming from and I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôll make a change‚Äù or ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see it from that perspective at first but now that you explained it I understand and would like to work on it together‚Äù the whole point of an apology is to acknowledge that you hurt someone or caused harm and wish to make amends, and even if you genuinely don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre in the wrong it‚Äôs better to hold your ground in a respectable manner.

The worst part is that the people who leach sympathy like that know that they‚Äôre wrong, it‚Äôs cowardly and downright pathetic watching them throw a pity party to try to swerve around the consequences of their actions and the worst part about it is how often it works, so many people get sucked into it time after time because they‚Äôre so scared of hurting the wrong doer‚Äôs that they tuck their nuts between their legs and roll over for it every time. Like just hold your ground don‚Äôt let them slip out of it or it‚Äôll never stop and if they leave replace them with someone who will communicate like a grown up.

Anyway before this turns into a whole other rant the point is self hatred isn‚Äôt an apology, if you‚Äôre gonna apologize to someone do it properly, if you‚Äôre gonna stand you‚Äôre ground do it in a respectful and respectable way, if you‚Äôre gonna talk bad about yourself to try and dodge the conversation go see a mental health professional."
124,0,"We live a bit distant from each others and since i live in a island we have to take a plane, i did it already but it is her first time to visit me in my city so i'm so freaking excited, i feel so many emotions right now that makes me want to explode because you know, we are a bit distant but to me it was always like we shared this life together since the first moment we met. The mundane daily life, we have that special bond that makes me feel like i'm always there, it is so special and hard to describe.

This was a rough year for me, i was and still am really lost, things were a bit rough and stressfull for different reasons and i also felt alone during these months so having a surpirse like this made me want to love life again.

I still can't believe how beautiful love is, i'm not alone in this life and i will never be thanks to what i have here,"
125,3,"When I was on Twitter years ago, I met lots of great folks and made several wonderful friends. During those years, there was this creepy guy (later 30s) who'd constantly brag about being a Christian husband who loved his family ‚Äî had a wife and two college-aged daughters. He constantly butt into my conversations with other girls and say weird and inappropriate stuff, which we'd all ignore. Well, it escalated to the point where he'd DM my good friends and be really perverted towards them. He did it to me too. Also his ""Likes"" section had explicit pictures of minors, all girls who looked to be around 14-16 years old. 

He gave my girlfriends a hard time, I know because they'd send me screenshots and tell me what he'd say to them, which angered me to no end. Therefore, I created a catfish account to expose him to his wife and to his business. I did my research and gained his trust over several weeks before I gathered all the incriminating information I had on him. I had it all. The flirty conversations, pictures, everything. It was easy to find his wife on Facebook. I had my message to her all ready to go, as I explained to her who I really was. I was a young girl who was preyed on along with my other friends by her gross husband for 5 entire years. I was ONE click away from sending it to her when I suddenly changed my mind. I couldn't live with the fact that I was about to potentially ruin his wife's and daughters' lives. The guilt was too much. I was a coward. 

This was several years ago when I was a 16 year old girl...and now, as a 29F, I regret that I didn't send the message. There are so many child predators out there, they NEED to be exposed. I wish I hadn't let the guilt get to me. I should've sent it. Yeah, I might've been a monster for ruining his wife's and kids' lives, but at least they would've known that their ""Christian"" husband and dad was a perverted predator who liked sexually harassing teenage girls online and gathering pictures of little children wearing little clothing. 

And for those who are about to ask why we didn't all block him: We did. Multiple times. We kept making new accounts, but he always find us anyway. He also found and followed us on other social media platforms, too. How he knew? No idea. It unnerves me to think about that. We never shared that we were moving on to other platforms. Also he had a tendency to start a gossip campaign against people, and since he was a popular account in our large friends' group, we were afraid he'd badmouth us. We were teens, so at that time, we were scared of what others thought about us. As an adult, I realize that I never should've worried about being ""liked"" by my group of other friends. Instead, I should've followed through with my plan and exposed him for being the creep that he was. I'm just angry at myself for not acting when I had the chance..."
126,3,"Literally the most time consuming annoying stupid boring experience ever only to get 1 credit hour. I am exhausted of going to labs. Also none of the labs I‚Äôm taking are homogenized at all (same dep). One class will have all assignments due at 11:59 the day before lab other will have they due right before the class. I genuinely miss the days where I had to show up and turn in a paper. Like a real sheet of paper. 

Don‚Äôt read this tbh it‚Äôs me ranting nonsense "
127,1,"I‚Äôm just stuck in a fucking rut. I mean my life‚Äôs not terrible it used to be way worse in a couple ways I‚Äôm happy I have a lil home but I have not had a CAR in 2 and a half years and 3 years ago I had to move out of my hometown to somewhere with cheaper rent so I could maintain, I feel bad cause I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt complain about not having a car as long as I have a roof over my head, but I get so depressed I feel like I never go anywhere and the only time I do go somewhere once in a blue moon it‚Äôs not even fun or satisfying because I‚Äôm on there time like it‚Äôs there car so I have to go where they want to go leave when they want to leave. And even if it‚Äôs a good time it‚Äôs usally only a couple hours or the day then they drop me back home. I miss going to the beach and staying out for a couple days. It‚Äôs been so long I feel trapped in a cell. And I‚Äôm trying to save for a car but it‚Äôs SO HARD because ther so expensive even shitty cars are like 5k now and even if I did have 4k I don‚Äôt want to buy a shitty car cause there‚Äôs a good chance it won‚Äôt last or be dependent so I feel like I have to have like 8k just to get an actual  decent car unless I finance but I can‚Äôt because of course when I was young and dumb I messed up my credit and no body wants to finance me. But I have turned my life around, I do what I‚Äôm supposed to and I‚Äôm a good person but now I get no help from family and have like no friends cause they all are fake and do drugs and I‚Äôm just not in that life style no more. I just feel depressed and I don‚Äôt know what to do I‚Äôm bored all the time. And what makes me even more upset is my ex best friend who litterally I had to stop being friends with cause he does drugs and has been making terrible life choices he gets lucky and his boss buys him a car and just lets him pay 200 a week he did not have to put any money down LIKE WHAT!? Why can‚Äôt I get that I don‚Äôt even do drugs and I go thru so much more than he does but yet he gets babied and pampered. Idk maybe I need to just appreciate what I have but it‚Äôs so hard I love nature and the beach and I‚Äôm like completely restricted from it I feel like emotionally drained. Sorry for any spell errors i cant imagine much people will actually read all this but if u do thanks üôè "
128,3,"Today my ex fiance strangled me in a drunken stupor. I truly believe, for some, alcohol is the devil's spirit. I'm not angry at him, I'm just disappointed that he did this. He felt so guilty, he turned himself in and reported himself. Now he is arrested with aggravated assault. I told the cop I didn't want to press charges. Truthfully, I found out some stuff in the relationship that just disgusted me and I wanted the relationship to end. I know me ending it, hurt him. He was rightfully angry, but to that extent? 

I don't know. I just don't want to deal with this. I don't want to press charges. I just want him to get his shit out of my house and leave me alone. He doesn't deserve a felony for a rash, drunken decision. When he is sober, he isn't like that. 

At the end of the day, I just want to spend time with my family. My dad's health has been declining and I recently lost my best buddy and my dog. 

I'm done wasting my life trying to help and support someone who said they want to kill me. I don't know if I will fight for him in the court system or if I will just let the courts handle it. I don't feel as tho he deserves this. I would have never done that to someone else tho. 

It's been a fucking day. I need to prioritize my life better so I stop getting in these shitty relationships and I'm focused more on the relationships that matter in my life. I'm tired of causing my family to worry about me. "
129,3,"So a little background on my life and family 
I ( 28 f) met my fianc√© ( 29 m) 2 years ago and we are expecting a baby. Along with this baby I have a daughter ( 8 f) that we will call Jade, and he has a daughter ( 10 f) we will call Carly. 

Carly has had a rough past, she has a mother her allowed her to be abused by her stepdad at a young age , lived with my future mother in law for a few years before my fianc√© got full custody of her. She has some behavioral issues, goes to therapy, takes medication. The works. We have spent a lot of time and money trying to help her ( not looking for praise just giving context). 
Jade is autistic but very independent. I don‚Äôt need to get on her about hygiene, bedtimes are easy with her, meals are easy, and she‚Äôs over all very laid back with the occasional temper tantrums when she gets overwhelmed. 

I knew before getting into my relationship with fianc√© about Carly‚Äôs past and trauma, we talked very much in depth about it and I believed being a gentle parent with Jade and the things I used to help her and my willingness to learn new parenting styles that I could handle Carley especially being someone who also dealt with abuse myself. 

Well 2 years into the relationship I‚Äôm ready to leave and it scares me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I LOVE my family, I adore my fianc√©, I love our baby we are going to have together and my daughter loves not only fianc√© but Carly as well. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the pregnancy hormones talking or if this is how I genuinely feel but lately things have gone majorly down hill with Carly and I can‚Äôt take it anymore. Any type of punishment I try to give her wether it‚Äôs sitting down and talking and explaining to her why what she did was wrong, or having her write lines saying what she did was wrong, or standing her in the corner she will sit and scream no at me, she had threatened harm to Jade, and just over all made being home a nightmare. 

I‚Äôm a part time stay at home mom. I work weekends so during the week it‚Äôs just me and the kids, while my fianc√© sleeps bc he works 3rd shift. In her tantrums she has woke him up multiple times and he‚Äôs having a hard time getting consistent good sleep for work. 

These issues only started recently as of about 4 months ago, at first I chalked it up to she wasn‚Äôt happy about their being a new baby, but I‚Äôm due in less than a month and it‚Äôs still as bad as it was on day one of all these issues happening if not worse. 
I‚Äôm to the point where I‚Äôm absolutely exhausted and don‚Äôt even wanna be around her anymore. I confessed to my fianc√© that I‚Äôve contemplated leaving because of how bad it‚Äôs gotten lately, she basically runs out apartment bc she will sit and scream bloody murder to the point cops have shown up to do a wellness check bc people think we are killing her. CPS has gotten involved to make sure we arnt abusing her. My future mother in law who used to make up every excuse in the book for her is at a loss on what to do bc she‚Äôs witnessed the behavior and has agreed it would be a lot to handle daily. Her therapist doesn‚Äôt understand why she‚Äôs acting this way either bc when they talk in their sessions she clams nothings wrong. 

I‚Äôm so tired and I‚Äôm emotionally exhausted from handling this everyday. I love my family but I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can do this. Do I leave? I don‚Äôt want to but at this point idk what else to do. If anyone has any suggestions I would greatly appreciate it."
130,2,"My father recently passed away, and I‚Äôm now attending his funeral, seeing his side of the family. Most of them believe we had a great relationship and that he was a good father but I feel differently. After my parents divorce, he  stayed local until I was six, then moved 16 hours away and didn‚Äôt see me again for a decade until I saved up the money to visit him myself.

My mom never forced him to be involved. In adulthood, she told me she allowed him to show up as the kind of father he chose to be. For him, that meant paying child support inconsistently, making occasional phone calls, and watching my life unfold on social media from a distance. He often made promises he didn‚Äôt keep whether it was about visits, gifts, or simply calling back. Sometimes, he even asked me for money.

As I grew older, went to therapy, and became a parent myself, I realized I no longer had the emotional energy to keep a relationship going with someone who hadn‚Äôt been present in my life. Just as I was preparing to express these feelings, he was diagnosed with cancer. I tried to push through and be there, but for once, it felt unnatural to lie just to make someone else feel better. I asked for space to work through my emotions in therapy but before my next session, he passed away.

I feel relief that he‚Äôs no longer suffering, and if I‚Äôm being honest, that I no longer have to pretend there was a relationship that never really existed. I do feel a sadness that he never got his life together, never formed a real bond with me, and never achieved the dreams he once talked about.

What I‚Äôm most anxious about now is the funeral, having to perform a version of grief that doesn‚Äôt feel true. It seems easier to play the part than to explain to his family what he was actually like as a father, or why I‚Äôm not deeply affected by his death. His family keeps calling to check in, asking how I‚Äôm doing, but the truth is: I‚Äôm fine. He wasn‚Äôt a real presence in my life, and his passing hasn‚Äôt changed much.

I‚Äôve spent most of my life pretending to keep others comfortable. But over the last year, I‚Äôve stopped doing that and it‚Äôs been liberating. Still, pretending at his funeral feels like going against everything I‚Äôve worked so hard to reclaim. And yet, maybe this final act of pretending is the last kindness I can offer my father.
"
131,1,Imma tell u this straight up but I‚Äôm tired of chasing people bro. I‚Äôm tired of being the person people text at 12 pm when theyre bored I‚Äôm tired of being dry texted. I‚Äôm just tired of late responses every 2 mins. Atp I prefer people who text 8 hrs later than 2 mins interval. Inconsistency is such a turn off. If you don‚Äôt wanna talk to me you‚Äôre not obligated to just stop checking in and out like it‚Äôs some airport. 
132,0,"I never thought I'd actually hit this point in life and I really just want to share. I'm proud of myself and it feels so weird to say. 

I left my abuser and found a lovely man who supports my goals and uplifts me while finding his own motivation through my success. I'm doing well in college, in fact so good I'm making honors while double majoring and raising two kids. After hearing all of my life that I would never amount to anything, it feels so enriching my life is amounting to something. "
133,3,"Art, writing, voice acting, all stuff I badly want to do and get good at. But everytime I try I get this stupid pressure and it makes me want to rip my hair out. Its so unbearable. 
It makes it so I give up on things I want to do so quickly. Even though I really want to do it. Which causes me to just cry from the discomfort and the disappointment in myself. 
I want to push myself. But now can I push myself when it just causes me to cry "
134,1,"Okay, so couple years ago, my father was in the hospital due to liver failure. And We weren't sure if he was going to make it. but one day these random ass people show up and I find out they're My dad's daughter and son(dif wife) and they are acting like they own the place and start just talking about who's gonna take the car and who's all gonna take what when he passes and being disrespectful as shit. They send me down to the cafeteria And I come back up and everything looks normal. But after my dad passes I look online and see that they have taken pictures by My father unconscious and it just pissed me off Because I wasn't able to be by him. I was 14 at the time and his so called children took advantage of the situation. And they took advantage of me thinking I wasn't listening while I was on my computer and they started saying ""I want his car"" and this and that.

Also before all of this when me and my mom tried to go to the hospital for the first visit. They said we couldn't get in because the so-called daughter and son restricted it. I was the one who stayed with My dad in the hospital for a whole week while they came in for like 2 days.

"
135,0,"When you said they would no longer be invited, I was intrigued. After all, you always let them pull those things. But then I heard it's because of the tantrum they threw because I was coming. Though honestly, you should have seen that coming, as coexistence and they are an oxymoron.I'm glad you're prioritizing yours, as in the past, you would have just backed down. This is the first step of many you need to take to start loving yourself. I used to hold some contempt because you were throwing yourself into the same self-destructing cycle they did, but honestly,I i think of you more positively because of this and i hope to help you conclude not only loving yourself but also see the sort of end of your arc."
136,0,"It's one thing to be a biological uncle or aunt, and I don't want to minimize that.  But being *chosen* for that assignment, and having someone's kids willingly call you that, because their parents want you to have a place in their lives... it's a real good feeling."
137,1,The job I‚Äôve worked for the past two years shut down and I‚Äôm still kind of in shock and have yet to tell my mom. I‚Äôm only 22 and its the longest job I‚Äôve had. What is even more hurtful is realizing that no one really checked on me after I posted about my job closing on social media. I now kinda understand what people mean when they say there is a false sense of closeness that social media provides. People just kinda spectate your life happening but they don‚Äôt really care. I plan to hit the ground running tomorrow to look for another job but it still sucks. I loved my coworkers and we had such a healthy work environment.
138,1,"It's my own fault. I didn't take care of my mental health, lost my job, got behind on bills, and got served an eviction notice today. 

I feel so embarrassed and humiliated that I'm in this situation. I can't believe I'm about to be 30 years old and going to live with my mom. I'm mad and sad for myself that I let this happen, but I'm trying to be thankful that I have parents who will take me in. I hope I can use this time to do a full reset on myself. Get a new job, go to therapy, rebuild my savings, reconnect with myself. 

I'm just so upset right now and struggling to see the positives. Feeling like the biggest POS alive right now. Hopefully tomorrow is better "
139,1,"Obviously I‚Äôve not had the easiest life but then again neither has most people but recently I was getting better, for the past few years I‚Äôve just been feeling complete shit, gave up on myself & life itself I didn‚Äôt care about anything about myself it got to a point where I didn‚Äôt care about most things really I just let myself rot away, I‚Äôm not going to go into full detail of that but i was recently getting better didn‚Äôt really have the days and nights where life would feel meaningless & pointless. I realised it tonight that it has been atleast a week since I‚Äôve felt like that but tonight it just come again out of no where and it like i cant find no distractions as it‚Äôs 4:22 in the morning and I can‚Äôt get to sleep feel trapped in the mindset"
140,2,"So 10 years ago my girlfriend and I had split.  We got back together after two months, and two months after that we found out she was pregnant.  A couple months go by and I check her phone, and see messages where this guy was questioning if the baby was his.  We argued so much over this and once the baby was born there was no denying she was mine.  Two years ago this guy started sending me requests on facebook and since I don‚Äôt really know him I never accepted.  I noticed she had added him back on facebook and IG but I didn‚Äôt cause a fuss because it was around the time of a death in the family and just eventually let it go .  My girlfriend posted a pic on IG today and he had commented a blowing kisses emoji and she didn‚Äôt respond to it but  hasn‚Äôt said a word about it.  I have noticed she‚Äôs been more active on the app lately, but I‚Äôm curious how I should approach this.  "
141,1,"Im 18, dont party, dont do drugs, surround myself with solid company, am top of my class, got into a top 50 college, full scholarship, am always on the grind, but am all alone.

My parents beat me as a kid, and I used to have long hair and wore a turban which lead to me being ostracized by my peers. I recently cut my hair last year and have been very conflicted and distraught about it.

I was orignally going to college for english to then go to law school because that's what my parents wanted, and focus on my writing on the side as im passionate in literature and filmmaking, but then realized after talking to many lawyers that if you want to actually make money you end up working 80-100 weeks, so it isn't a ""day job"", you're always on call.

I recently graduated a week and a half ago and have been feeling nothing but empty. Despite me working all my life for a good future, im going to be going to an elite school for a useless degree, that serves nothing besides meeting my interests.

Im diagnosed and medicated and in therapy for anxiety, mild depression, ocd, insomnia, and bipolar type 2. I had a failed suicide attempt a few days after my birthday. I have friends but none of them are ever there for me in my times of need.

I've never had a girlfriend, I haven't even ever held hands with a girl. I'm not an incel, and Im respectful and not a creep, I workout and keep my mind sharp but I've never had luck with girls, I have extreme sexual frustration.

Im sorry for this being long and rambly, I think I might be admitted myself to the psyche ward again because im thinking about hurting myself. 

I did everything I was supposed to do to live a respectful and successful life, but feel like nothing but a looser and a failure."
142,1,"I‚Äôve been trying to better myself lately. I‚Äôve been scared of everything my whole life and bullied a lot throughout my childhood, including by my own father. That led me to being quite insecure about‚Ä¶ pretty much every aspect of myself. 

In relationships, familial, friendship or romantic, there‚Äôs times where my decisions are decided by my insecurities and it rarely goes well. I‚Äôve tried so many things to stop this, I‚Äôve had two different psychiatrists, it was nice talking to them about stuff on my mind but it hasn‚Äôt really done anything long term. 

Recently, I‚Äôve been trying a fake it till you make it approach, but when it‚Äôs late in the day, it all comes crumbling down on me and no matter what I tell myself, I hate everything about me. I hate how I look, I hate the person I am, I hate my interests, I hate the way I talk, how I treat people‚Ä¶ everything.

I tell myself it‚Äôll pass, I tell myself I just have to look for positives, that they‚Äôre only in my head, all of it. This self hatred is so overpowering. I‚Äôm constantly passively wishing to die but moments like these almost make me want to do it myself, even though I‚Äôm stable enough to guarantee I won‚Äôt. 

I feel like I should just quit trying to better myself, nothing I try works and sometimes, like now, just makes me more miserable. I don‚Äôt want this anymore"
143,2,"Hey so I've been struggling with this for a while and I've been trying to overcome it but really don't know what to do, I lost my best friend recently (about a month now) and eversince I haven't been able to do the things I used to enjoy, one of those things was gaming, not all games, but a few select titles, and two of those titles I got pretty good at and he was just as good, but ever since I lost him I haven't been able to play those titles at all, I always feel a sense of dread when even hovering on them, I know this really doesn't matter, but I just wanna be able to enjoy these games again, I still am good but I wanna be able to play these games again solo, I play with other friends but I wanna have my confidence to play solo again, my friends reassure me, but I just can't seem to muster up the confidence.

That part of me that has ideas, that dreams, that sees life in a magical, hopeful way ‚Äî she‚Äôs slowly decaying inside me.

I have so many ideas. So many dreams. I see things in a way that feels so alive inside.
But none of it can come out.
I don‚Äôt have the talent. I don‚Äôt have the skills.
I don‚Äôt even know how to begin.
And it fucking hurts. It hurts in my body. It hurts in my soul.
It hurts to look at the world and see women who are so talented, so full of soul, so unapologetically expressive.
Women who have a unique, powerful style that is theirs.
And I can‚Äôt do that.
I‚Äôm blocked. I feel rotten.
And that hurts too.
That I can‚Äôt express myself like that.
That I can‚Äôt show who I really am.
I feel like I‚Äôm not being myself.
I don‚Äôt feel capable of being authentic, of having a voice, a style, a presence that says: this is me.
And the worst part is‚Ä¶
I wish I could love something ‚Äî anything ‚Äî as much as that.
To love drawing, or editing, or anything enough to do it every single day without feeling drained.
But I don‚Äôt love anything enough yet.
And I don‚Äôt know what to do with all of this. I just know it hurts."
145,1,"Recently been having a great few months but as of late, I've just been in this weird state. My brother just recently got married, my sister has been married, they've both moved out. I'm the youngest at 21 years old. I was in a relationship for 5 years a while ago, over that. Then another small relationship, over that too. I've been loving my life for quite a while, just me myself and I. But now it's just... lonely. My parents are still here and we have a good relationship but that first breakup of 5 years kind of took all of my friends away. It was a mutual ending, no bad blood. But now it just feels like I have nobody. Not just feels like it, I really don't have anyone. I have maybe 4 friends that I talk to occasionally. Not very often because they're distant and busy with their lives, which I completely understand, so am I. My parents keep talking about how it's my turn to find someone to get married to and obviously I know they don't mean right now, but realizing that the people that I used to talk to and let out my feelings and thoughts to aren't around anymore is just... painful? I don't know. I'm filled with rage. Why don't I have anyone? Why does everyone else get to have someone and I'm just left alone? I have so much love to give, I've been told that I'm one of the nicest guys people have ever met (idk how true that is, I can be a dick), but I can't have anyone. Is it that someone who was made me for just not exist? Am I meant to not have anyone? I just wanna be in love man, it was the most exhilarating feeling. I just wanna feel like I belong to someone. I wanna make a life with someone. I wanna have a future with someone too. Is it that I'm short? Am I ugly? Am I just not what people would wanna be with? Am I just not enticing enough to even approach or stick to? What have I done to deserve this loneliness? I've tried my damn hardest, to be a good person, to be a safe person. To be someone who people could be proud to say that they're mine and I'm theirs. "
146,3,"And the dam multiple verification methods.  I know it's designed to protect us, but for F sake, I lost my phone today (left it on my car roof) , had to get a new one. It's been 3 hours of me trying to connect Google /samsung/outlook/... etc accounts. They keep trying to send codes to my lost probably smashed phone,  then tried emails, even tried taking a selfie video for verification... I'm about to lose it. Can we just do a ID.me or Gov version of it for all Apps and get rid of these redundant verification methods? It's just painful.  There has to be an easier way. "
147,1,Nobody sees me as a human being. All I‚Äôve ever been to people is a sex toy or comfort object. Nobody has ever truly tried to make me happy. Nobody has ever asked me what affirmations I needed. Nobody ever checks up on me to make sure I‚Äôm okay. No matter how much I do for other people I‚Äôm just around to provide emotional or sexual service. I had a conversation with someone recently where I realized I haven‚Äôt had a single relationship in my life that was genuinely emotionally healthy. I know I‚Äôm weird. I know the things that happened to me make it hard for people to relate to me and make me hypersexual so sex is more important to me then most people. I like being nice to people and helping them feel better. Why doesn‚Äôt anyone ever feel like that about me? Why do I have to feel everything so much? I‚Äôm so tired of crying alone nothings ever going to change.
148,2,"Ever since I(16F) was younger, my parents were hard on me. My stepmother(45F) got mad anytime I‚Äôd try to correct the things she did wrong or do something a certain way she disagreed with like putting the dishes in ‚Äúthe wrong way‚Äù. My father(46M) would tell me to stick up to people but then get angry when I stuck to him, saying he was the adult and I was the child. He‚Äôd tell me not to do something and then do it himself. There would even be times when messing up, even the slightest bit, would set him into a complete rage, putting fear into me and my siblings. I used to think that I loved my parents but I‚Äôm not sure anymore. I recently got a job at a largely known corporation, Walmart. Last night, I had a few more minutes until the end of my shift so my boss asked me if I could just sweep the floors and I happily obliged. Afterwards, I was setting the broom and dustpan back when I dropped it on accident. I rushed to put it back and exclaimed ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry..!‚Äù An older coworker nearby and my boss looked at me confused saying ‚Äúsorry? For what?‚Äù And I was baffled, I just stood there, stuttering for a moment. ‚ÄúWe-well, I-I-I-I dropped the b-broom‚Äù and my boss just said in a calm tone ‚Äúthat‚Äôs okay, just pick it up and try again, no worries.‚Äù

There have also been times when my parents would get angry when I didn‚Äôt do things in a ‚Äútimely fashion‚Äù so when I‚Äôm bagging groceries while being trained by a coworker, I got nervous, thinking I‚Äôd get in trouble or reprimanded if I didn‚Äôt do things fast enough, so I began frantically putting things into bags and almost sweating out of pure anxiety. The female coworker training me just looked at me and said ‚Äúhun, slow down, see how they aren‚Äôt asking you to hurry up or anything? You can calm down. You‚Äôre doing great, everyone‚Äôs gonna love you, it‚Äôs okay‚Äù 

I‚Äôm now very attached to the family ive been welcome into at my workspace. I feel like I can take a breather from harsh expectations and just settle down for a moment. I don‚Äôt feel like my life depends on every waking moment when I‚Äôm there. But then I dread going home.

Is this..normal? Am I just a spoiled kid with way too high expectations and wants?"
149,3,"I have been so stressed out lately. I graduated exactly a year ago with a STEM degree from a top US university. 

I applied to graduate school locally‚ÄîI cannot afford to move due to student debt from my bachelors‚Äîand I felt like a shoe-in for the program I applied to. After three months of coordinating with my advisor and waiting to hear back, I got a notice that my advisor had not received the funding he expected due to budget cuts and can no longer take any new students. 

I was devastated and still feel the disappointment looming over me. 

I then applied for a government-funded residency program and got it! I quit my waitressing job and thought I would be moving across the country in one month to begin the program, which I am now hearing has also been defunded. 

Sure, my waitressing job will take me back, but I just don‚Äôt think I can mentally take it any longer. The customers are disrespectful and treat me like I am nothing. The other day I had a man assume that I was uneducated and told me to ‚Äúgo get my education and leave this job‚Äù, not knowing that I have this job as a last-resort to pay off my student loans. 

I am also a first-generation graduate and every woman in my family has been a career waitress‚Äînone of them were happy with it. I just feel like I am being forced into a life that I don‚Äôt want.  I feel like I lack the resources and connections to go beyond this. Everyone I know from my university have gotten high paying jobs with companies that their parents work for‚ÄîI am so envious of that luxury. 

I live in a town with very low job availability and have gotten ghosted by countless jobs.  I don‚Äôt know what I am doing wrong."
150,3,"i‚Äôm a 26f and my boyfriend is a 30m. my partner wants to be famous, and have a lot of followers on tiktok and twitch and i don‚Äôt understand. my ex also wanted to be famous, he wanted to be a stand up comedian. i‚Äôm not being a hater cause i supported my ex and i support my boyfriend. its just, financially we are struggling where we both need to be working. i work full time but my job only schedules me 2 days a week, im currently looking for a 2nd job. my boyfriend just got a job at FedEx but hasn‚Äôt started yet and he‚Äôs so concerned about being famous online and im concerned about the fact that we‚Äôre at rock bottom. my license expired today, my birthday. my insurance cancelled cause i didn‚Äôt have the money for it. my cars up for repo, our phones got shut off, we‚Äôre late for rent. i apply to so many jobs a day and get rejected. i usually have a plan, something to fall back onto but this time i dont. i dont have anything to sell. i cant doordash/ubereats because phones are off. i just dont understand the thrill that comes with being famous. ugh. "
151,1,"I feel a little uncomfortable posting here but I don't know where else to get this off my chest. For the last few years my life has been stagnant, and it's only getting worse the longer I'm stuck at the job I have. I make enough to pay the bills, but not enough to make any real difference in my life. I've tried over and over and over and over to find a new job or move up into a new position at my current place of work, but nothing ever pans out. The job market I more or less get. It sucks, and my current job isn't the most transferrable thing in the world. But to not be able to go anywhere at my current role is defeating, especially when I have everyone behind me and supporting me that matters when it comes to influencing hiring decisions. 

The first 2 times it didn't pan out, I took a step back to determine what I might've been lacking. But I'm one of the top performers on my team and in my area. I've gotten accolades and nothing but support from teammates and management to the point where the department VP told me in our annual meeting that everybody had nothing but great things to say and even they wanted to see me succeed. I guess that makes the rejection sting all the more, and the rejection is really starting to wear me down. That and the recent feedback has begun to infuriate me. First I was told to build up my skills. When that didn't work, I was told to not give up. When that didn't work I was told I'm applying to too many jobs and it looks like I just want to leave my job for the sake of it. Meanwhile I've watched coworker after coworker and a few managers move to different areas of the company they had no direct experience in after applying to more than a few different roles all because they wanted to jump ship. 

And I was told recently about another role that  just opened up. One that everyone a half year ago or so told me I should go for when it eventually became available. And now? I don't even know if it's worth the effort. To spend hours redrafting my resume, preparing for the interview, getting grilled by the person hiring for the role, and trying to justify my skills or supposed lack thereof. All while trying to stay positive and push forward, when I'm so afraid and almost certain it'll just end with another rejection - especially knowing the expectations of this particular hiring manager. I'm so, so tired and don't want to expend the energy, and yet I feel like I owe it to everyone that's had my back and pushed me toward this to at least apply. But for what? The slim chance I might get lucky this time?

I'm exhausted - physically, mentally and emotionally. I'm tired of being expected to have endless grit and a positive attitude. I've yet to see a therapist but I'm pretty sure I'm bordering on depression if I'm not there already. I used to be able to separate my work and life, but that's becoming harder when I'm constantly reminded of just how trapped I am. I mean, what do you do when all the effort and all the support amount to nothing? You'd think that at some point, surely something has to give, and yet it never does. 

I'm sure common knowledge would dictate I focus on the things within my control, like health or hobbies etc., and being grateful. And that's fine, and it can help to a point. But it doesn't solve my problem, and I just don't know what do anymore. Anyways, thanks for reading I guess."
152,3,"So, a month or two ago, Dad started a lawn care business with me so I could have some money, since I can‚Äôt get a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù job. Well, Dad came over to the house when he got home from work and told me that, since he‚Äôs going back OTR, he‚Äôll have to cut a lot of the yards we mow.

So there goes the money I‚Äôm supposed to be making. I can‚Äôt even get a normal job. I want money but can‚Äôt fucking make it because I can‚Äôt get a damn job, and now Dad is taking the only thing away that made me a little bit of money."
153,1,"I stopped smoking weed because my parents wanted me to. I stopped abusing dxm because i didnt want to make my mom sad. I stopped self hxrming because my parents caught me.

I recovered, sure, but its not for myself. Id still probably do it if it was my choice. Glad i have ppl who care for me, but my recovery is never my choice. 

Im afraid on day, people will notice how little i eat. Then, my power to control that will be gone too. 

In all honesty, i dont want to recover. It just never did me much good. Life didnt get better, i just had to find another way to cope. Healthy coping mechanisms i tried and it was ineffective. I dont care about recovery. I just want to enjoy the time i do have."
154,1,"I just laid in bed and cried to my boyfriend telling him how I‚Äôm not happy in our relationship. How I‚Äôve been sad for a while now and it worries me. I miss when I felt happy and hopeful about us, but now I know we‚Äôre doomed and it‚Äôs so hard to accept. I know he doesn‚Äôt love me, that he doesn‚Äôt feel the same way about me as I do him, and it hurts. He just rolled over and went to sleep, said we‚Äôd talk about it tomorrow. It‚Äôs very late here of course, almost 4 am, but the lack of closure is killing me. 

A large reason why it‚Äôs so hard to let go is because I‚Äôm ugly. If I ever leave him I‚Äôll never experience love again, never experience sex or intimate connection again. He‚Äôs the only person who could ever be in a relationship with me in this way. It hurts thinking about how beautiful people can date around and try their options, find that person who ticks off all their boxes. I don‚Äôt have such a luxury, and it leads me to wanting to accept and overlook things I know I shouldn‚Äôt. I explained all this to him by the way. 

Despite this, I love him. I‚Äôm attracted to him. He‚Äôs such a one of a kind, precious person and I wish things could work out between us. But I know they won‚Äôt, and it hurts. "
155,1,"Every time I thought I formed a friendship, because the person said I was cool and sometimes they invite me to stuff, I just feels so hollow as those are filled by many attempts of trying to talk to people just to, 90% of the time, be left on read or just a laugh reaction. On the love side is abominable, everytime I think I hit it of and have a chance is either: they are already in a relationship or I didn't hit it off and they are just chill. This feeling of just being downlooked makes me feel so empty inside that the touch of even myself feels so alien, my name feels like a curse and the idea of pain seems like a promise out of this numbness but I'm to afraid of pain, for now, to do anything. I just want to understand what I'm doing wrong, if people say I'm cool, they share very private secrets sometimes, give compliments that the feel safe around me, then why the fuck am I so shafted and ignored by everyone?"
156,1,"For pretty much my entire life I've been surrounded by talented people. My family all have some kind of achievement, I know people who have performed live for competitions, etc. Meanwhile I'm just off in the corner, some kind of mediocre being but I feel so inferior compared to everyone else that I really just feel like a complete failure. Maybe part of it is that my parents have made a huge deal about prioritizing only things that are productive/can be used for monetary gain in some way, but these things come so naturally to everyone I'm around that I'm left behind again and again. It's frustrating to look over your shoulder and realize that the things you've put hours into practicing, to reach the level of ""decent"", has been immediately surpassed by someone who has done none of that effort and is so much better at it than I'll ever be. I've tried so many things but none of them really feel like something I'm talented at. And yes, of course it's stupid and unrealistic to think that I could be the ""best ever"" at something: there's always someone better, etc etc. It's more just that I wish there was something that felt like it came naturally to me, that nobody I'm around could do quite as well as I could. But that'll never happen so I guess I'll just. Be the inferior human? I don't know"
157,0,"It's hot as balls outside, no AC at work, all I've been thinking about all day was buying myself a cheap little kiddie pool, and an inflatable to sit inside of it with. A grown as adult with her butt in the water, an inflatable backrest, and a margarita in her hand. That's all I wanted. Clock out, go to the store, get home, rushing around to do chores so I can relax, smash my fingers and cry a couple times, but I powered through it, got everything done. 

Finally I've got my music playing outside, kiddie pool filled up & in my garden, inflatable pool chair blown up with a good view of my chickens. I sit down in the water, toes stretched out into the dirt, a cold canned cocktail in my left hand and a burning joint in my right. I lean back, close my eyes, feel the sunshine cover my body and the cool water underneath me, great vibe, just what I had been dreaming of all day at work. For about 5 minutes I'm laying there having my, ""I almost forgot, this is what it's all about,"" moment, and I open my eyes...

Just in time to watch myself get shit on by a bird. Just a big, fat shit, falling from the sky, landed right on the side of my drink and onto my thigh, with a loud, disgusting 'plop.' I was only halfway through my joint. 

I just started at it in disbelief for a second, and feeling the warmth of the bird shit on me, sighed, got up, hosed off, and gave up lol.

Fuck the pool.  Fuck nature. Fuck birds. Fuck this shit. üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ what are the chances, like seriously? Ive been alive 25 years without being shit on by a bird, and today it happens? üò§üò≠ü§£ü§£üò≠"
158,3,"I am 21F and this is going to be about my brother 25.
For some context we were raised by a single mother and we also have different fathers. Since childhood i remember my brother being my mom's favorite, obviously so. Though the weird part is that he verbally and mentally abuses both my mom and I. As kids it was over his games... I would stand near his PlayStation and all of a sudden he would be irate... not just mad but IRATE. Screaming and throwing things at a little girl. In high school it turned into him becoming irate over nothing... I once stood next to the fridge unaware he was trying to open it so he slammed the door into my body and called me a
""fcking cnt"". This doesn't even scratch the surface to be honest. We once went on a family vacation to Disney world and my mom said something that pissed him off so bad that for the next 2 hours in the middle of the park he screamed in her face and became borderline violent... I stood there trying to cover his mouth with my hand and begging him to stop. People surrounded us like we were entertainment. It was humiliating. He was in college at the time. Things like this happened almost every single day. Oddly though, he was always my mom's favorite. She paid his college tuition... not mine. She pays his rent STILL... not mine. She funds his entire life and I ask for help once and the answer is no. I remember a time in high school where I was severely struggling with my mental health silently. I finally decided to open up to my mom about it. I sat down next to her and told her I needed to get into therapy... she didn't even look up from her phone or acknowledge me. I felt completely alone. Though my brother would have a fit of rage and minutes lat' she would be coddling him while I stand to the s. wondering how I can try so hard to be perfect and still go unnoticed by her. In adulthood this dynamic has not gotten any better. We don't live together anymore but he will now harass me over text message. I try not to engage and speak rationally to him but instead he just continues the abuse. I had a s*icide attempt when I was 12 years old after an instance where my brother was having one of his moments and my mom took his side instead of mine.
She walked in during my attempt. We never spoke of it again. Though when it comes to my brothers mental health she constantly obsesses over it. I have felt completely alone my entire life. Trying to cope with this has been a life long struggle. I thought maybe when we were both grown up things would change but they've just gotten worse. He's a grown man who behaves and has tantrums like a toddler and I just have to stand there and take it. I can't complain about him or confide about it with my mom. I try to vent to her about him berating me over text and she just says ""not my problem"" or ""you know how he is"" or ""you are both adults now handle it yourself"". My close friends get the details of basically every single one of these altercations and they all say it sounds like my brother is toxicly possessive over me. A few months ago we started playing Fortnite together and any night where I was too tired to play with him he would send me full paragraphs calling me every name under the sun, saying how horrible I am and how I don't care about him. It's just so hypocritical considering he once went 3 months without responding to a single text of mine and he never once addressed it. I don't know what to do anymore. Just a few days ago we went from having a nice conversation to him threatenina to throw himself off of our balcony because he ! a comment that he's a ""protective big brother"" a. got upset because he's in NO way protective. He may pretend to be in public but behind closed doors this is my reality. It's all just performative and I'm sick of him saying that. He says all the time how he's
""written by a woman"" and ""respects women"" but that is so far from the truth. I can't listen to it anymore. THIS IS NOT NORMAL. I've found zero solutions to get him to get off my back. As well as zero solutions to getting even an ounce of support from my mom. Fml."

160,1,"I've been suicidal since i was 12. No, not the kind of suicidal you're thinking of. If you count the time since my first thought of suicide, it was years before that. So far back i dont remember my first. The earliest memory i have is the thought of wanting to be a corpse, and knowing it wasn't the first time ive thought that.

No when i say ive been suicidal since i was 12, i mean every moment of every day. Even in the rare dreams i do have that arent suppressed by the sheer amount of thc i pump into my body in the hopes that i hurry up and get lung cancer.

Every single moment. Wanting to die so innately that its become a part of my personality. Maybe it was the abuse. Maybe shitty brain chemistry. but even the happiest days of my life have been spent with the looming shadow of ""my life would be better if it was cut short.

I fake having thoughts about the future, because the only future i can picture is one without me in it. I joke, and laugh with friends, knowing im completely hollow on the inside. I fill the holes with things i can do for others hoping it helps. If im just more selfless maybe I'll stop being punished by whatever divine or universal force is out there.

it never works.

therapy doesn't work. ive tried a few dozen times. But i have to skirt a knifes edge between being thrown in a psych ward and getting adequate help. There is no escape to my torment besides a shell of buckshot through the roof of my mouth.

162,3,"I hate when ppl take advantage of my kindness and add shit to my workload. I keep getting asked to do different things that literally aren't my job.  I finally put my foot down today and said I'm literally slammed and can't help. I feel like an asshole but It felt good to finally say no. 

Another thing that's bothering me is my co worker. She's so fuckin lazy. She's been at the job for 5 years and I've only been at it for a year, and I have to TEACH HER how to do the job. I sometimes have to do her work because she doesn't do shit. If I don't then it makes both of us look bad. Here are some wild things she has done:

- Left work because she's sad that a student is in the hospital 
- left work because said student got out of the hospital and was happy 
- she got her blood test back and found out she was deficient in B12 so she went home to eat a salad 
- at least 15 min late to work everyday 
- asked if she could have my Vicodin bc it helps her stay ""energized""
- randomly let a homeless person in the building WITH KIDS??!

163,2,"I (15f) have been recently diagnosed with GAD/OCD [got diagnosed with GAD from my GP and have a psychiatric appointment in July for the official OCD diagnosis)

I wash my hands a lot and my mom always gets mad at me. NOT because my compulsions are bad but because of the waterbill. She always yells at me whenever I wash my hands (keep in mind I wash my hands until they crack, bleed, scar, dry) and she knows this. She knows I'm struggling. She won't even let me take medication. I HAD TO GO BEHIND HER BACK AND GET THIS DIAGNOSED. 

She knows how badly I'm struggling and she still chooses to treat me like shit. She started making me go outside and throwing shoes at me when I wash my hands. JUST NOW she came and hit me multiple times on my head. She was aiming for my face but I had my hands up. She is so neglectful and abusive. I just cried questioning why I even have all these DUMBASS compulsions. LIKE THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING?? I'm not normal at all. I have other themes like harm OCD and moral OCD but physical compulsion wise, contamination has been the most difficult and then my mom just told me I have to wash my hands outside with the water hose. 


I'm going to stay with my dad some time in July but like, this still hurts me. Why isn't she here for me? Why does she hate me so much? Why can't I be normal? Why won't my thoughts stop tormenting me? Why has life been so hard on ME??? I've been going through hell my entire life and now it's like.. It's so much worse now. I thought depression was my going to be my biggest problem. OCD is far worse AND IT'S LIKE VENTING ABOUT CONTAMINATION OCD IS NO BETTER BECAUSE LIKE ME SAYING ""I feel like I'm going to die and that I'm a unforgivable monster and I'll never make it in life if I don't wash my hands. "" LIKE WHAT???? IT'S SO DUMB AND EMBARRASSING AND I HATE IT AND I HATE ME AND I HATE OCD AND I HATE LIFE. "
164,1,"t's a trap. Once you're homeless it's incredibly hard to get out of. Even then, I will always be at risk of being homeless again. Most homeless people I talk to have a track record of getting accommodation but end up back on the streets. I've been doing this now for a long time and I'm exhausted. I don't drink or do drug but I can see how people can slip into it.

I'm tired of begging for food. I'm tired of looking for jobs just to be turned away because I don't have a address. I'm tired of being cold and hungry. It's all too much and I don't think I can carry on. Yes, I'm a grown adult but I clearly can tackle life like everyone else. I have no family and the church/shelters don't do as much as you'd think. Being homeless has made me humans a lot differently. Most people don't understand and just tell me to move in with my family or just get a job. I try everyday but I've been rejected at 6 job interviews now because I'm homeless. I can't stand it anyone and I'm here to vent but I think my time is limited"

168,1,"I've been out of education since I was eight simply because homeschooling was a trend then, the only signs I showed of being unhappy in school was when I would get upset that lunch break wasnt longer. My mother never taught me curriculum or tried to get me academic help other than some idiots who ""taught"" me with ai, she's left me with countless useless workbooks (I can't do the sums if I've never learned the subject!) and I've tried so so many times to try teach myself but it's so hard to do so without money or motivation. All my friends are doing their GCSEs and even getting jobs and I can't even do simple algebra or even division,I've let myself down massively and I know I can't get my dream job now I don't know what to do. I do nothing all day, I have no friends and I'm stupid"
169,2,"Haaay. Wen't for a run during lunch break as I usually do. Went back to almost the almost the entire team at my work (small agricultural school, around 20-30 people) disbanding after taking a team photo. They told me I was 2 minutes too late and that they had written an email right before lunch time (I went to check, 11h57 to be precise) and ""it was such a beautiful day not to take a picture"". It was the an average day really, many more to come. I've been there for 6 months and it's a kind of ""clicky"" team but I'm not sure they're aware of it. I don't think there were ill intentions (not sure though, I get along fine (not great though) with them professionally and I'm not interested in socializing during break times, so they might have taken that a bad way). They are not bad people, I usually get along great with anyone, but I just don't share much in common with them and clicks kinda repulse me from the get go. It sucks and hurts a bit sure, but I've been in situations of social exclusions quite a few times before so it doesn't affect me that much anymore. What pisses me more is that this type of social, tribal behavior exists. It goes beyond me how nobody thought this was a pretty shitty move professionally, excluding members of the team photo like that, without minimal effort to reach them. I really hope the couple of other people who were missing were not hurt if they were in the ""didn't read the email"" situation too. I mean, this type of things should be planned in quite some advance right? This was just a bad decision on many levels and it's giving me really bad vibes or maybe I'm overreacting but it does feel good to vent a bit. Thanks"
170,3,"My dad's fiancee is a fucking handful to say the least. She constantly has my dad do things and acts as if she can't do them herself, so she and him get into arguments a lot. 

Today she came home all in a whirlwind and acts all pissed off about something about work and then sits in the car for 30 minutes texting instead of going to get food like she said she was going to. So my dad had to watch the baby and cook dinner. 

I sort of kept an eye on her but I'm not really in the headspace to monitor a super active toddler. So, they got into an argument and then she was crying and shit because she was all overwhelmed or whatever and kept acting as if my dad wasn't. 

I've been depressed for months. It's gotten worse lately and I'm tired like 24/7. The main reason is because I can't get a job. I haven't worked since January and I've been spending months applying and  getting rejected over and over again. On top of that, it's like every conversation I have with anyone, especially my dad and grandma, is about getting a job. 

I just feel like I'm not good enough for anyone anymore and that I'm a fucking failure and when they constantly tell me to just keep doing what I've been doing and act as if I'm not doing anything, it makes it worse. 

So me and my dad sort of got into an argument because my aunt texted me about a place I could apply to and I told her I'd talk to my dad about it. 

But I've just spent so much time focusing and worrying about a job that I'm burnt out on it. I'm tired of talking about it, and thinking about it. And I'm tired of applying and getting rejected and then applying again and never hearing back. 

So, we argued because he didn't understand why I'd get upset because of the text and I tried to explain but I guess either he didn't understand it or I didn't explain it well enough. I'm just sick and tired of everything. Everything is stressing me out and I just want to sleep but I can't fucking sleep becaause I have to keep applying for a fucking job and then figure stuff out for school and I am sick of my dad's fiancee's bullshit.

171,1,"just here to vent 

we became friends when i was in 4th grade & she was in 5th, from then on we had been best friends for a little over 6 years. i cut her off in the beginning of 11th grade because she was barely doing anything to maintain the friendship & it felt one sided for months. i finally gave up & cut her off. it‚Äôs been 3 years since we haven‚Äôt been friends anymore. she did try to sort things out when she realised i‚Äôm cutting her off, but i was rude and dismissed every effort of hers to mend the friendship. i was acting like a bitch & now when i look back i wonder if things could‚Äôve been any different if i was more receptive towards her efforts. 

today, i was going through old pictures & videos & came across ours as well. we had so much fun together & genuinely liked eachothers company. i wonder how she‚Äôs doing. when i looked at those pictures i couldn‚Äôt help but think did i make a mistake cutting her off & dismissing her efforts? i just wish i could relive those moments with her, she was truly an amazing friend & we share good memories together. unfortunately, i know we both have changed a lot & hold no common ground anymore to bond. it sucks. "

Never done Something Like this before and honestly dont See how this ist supposed to Help or anything but i guess its Like screaming your thoughts into a abyss or Something Like that

Ive recently finished  my appranticeship and its like the First time in my life that a Phase of my life is truely Just over with nothing planed after that. My workplace didnt let me stay so im courently Just looking for other Jobs and looking to self improve.

It is really chill to do nothing for a while (Like work  or school) but its also gnawing (idk If thats the right word) on me that i have nothing to do in my Life rn.

Thats gonna get better when i get a Job but honestly it probably all comes down to Just wanting to have someone 

Ever since my gf broke Up with me 2 years ago ive been single and the loneliness is starting to get to me. 
Maybe its gotten worse because ive been on weird porn sub reddits in the Last couple of weeks where sluts Post just fucked Up Shit, and i guess thats Like a extremly small percentage of Girls Overall that do that Shit but its making me really sad somehow bacause its reflecting my own inabillity to speak normally to ppl espacially girls.
Probably Just gonna Stop masturbating and call it a day befor i lose completly the touch of what regular Girls/women act like.

Back in the day i always Had Just a few Friends but that all changed when i started drinking. Suddenly i Had a bunch of ppl i was good with and could do stuff together with and i somehow got my First gf. 

Then i went to spain for vacation and there the friendgroup just kinda broke Up and a week after that my gf broke Up with me (it was also the First week of my appranticeship) 

After that i really started Smoking Weed exessivly and Like every day i would meet Up with friends to smoke Weed. It got so Bad that i eventually lost my drivers liscence Last year ( i got caught Last year and Had to surrender it to the authorities in Feburary this year).

Well i stopped smoking Weed Like a month ago and i feel Like incredibly Well. I mean i stopped smoking Weed before for Like 4weeks or so to get Back some braincells but ive never felt so good sober. I also used to get insanely Bad hungovers every time i was drinking but that also stopped recently which is great ( now i Just need to Look Out that i dont become an alcoholic xd)

Anyways i basicly know every step i need to do to get my Life Like i want it and Back on track but getting a gf or at least getting my dick wet once (which is probably not that great anyways when there is No real Connection [hooking Up regulary {Like once its probably a worthy experience} with different women is Like Just the Same as Masturbation but idk] and maybe its just ending in me chasing a girl that doesnt want me Like that) is Like the one Thing i cant figure Out.

I added a girl in snap that i know for a fact used to have a crush on me in school bevor i started the appranticeship. Ive send here two roundsnaps and havent gotten a respond in anyway Jet but im thinking about writing her.
Also tomorrow is a Party where im gonna Go maybe i can Chat Up a girl there.

My Problem is Just that i have Like Trouble having conversations with people but when im drunk that Problem quickly fades away. Unfortunatly i also Love do be a dickhead when im drunk especially toward Girls (idk it Just fills me with such joy) but ive worked in that recently and have gotten alot better with that. 
I relised that i cant Just be a dickhead all the time and i am ashamed of myself and Always doubt myself If i did Something fucked Up or how people think of me. Most Times its worse in my head than in Reallife but still.

Ive become a Lot better about Just Meeting Up with people and doing Something that doesnt involve drinking exessivly or Smoking Weed (i do Sometimes Drink Like 1-2 Beer with a Person while doing Something but that fine)

Anyway im gonna get some sleep now 

Every day i grow to hate the Internet and especially social Media more and more 

If you read until Here wtf are you doing

PS: sorry that this whole vent/rant has been all over the place i Hope you have a wonderful day/life/time #staytoxic"
173,3,"My wife and I are in our early to mid 30's and have been married for \~8 years. In that time, she's job hopped a bit, taking pay cuts just to get out of jobs she hated going to. She got laid off right before this last Christmas due to the company closing (it's a whole big story). She took about a month off before finding another job. She hated it too. She didn't apply herself very much, and got let go because of it.

  
It's now been 2 months that she hasn't worked. Her claim is that she doesn't want to go back into accounting. When asked about what she wants to do, she doesn't have an answer. I've suggested career councilors, and she seems disinterested. She says she doesn't want to go back to school, either. When she looks for jobs, she sits at the computer and cries and becomes unconsolably depressed. I told her that she can get a part time job. I do pretty alright, but not well enough to keep living the way we do on my income alone. She ins't even interested in that. She's still living like we have 2 incomes. Going out, Amazon is always at our door, biding on things on auction sites. She's complaining that we are losing our savings at the same time though. Like she doesn't understand we can't have it both ways.

  
The most annoying part is how she spends her days (from what I see when I WFH). She sleeps in, lays around the house, takes naps, and does only the required job searching weekly for unemployment. I'm still stuck doing all of the chores I normally would, plus everything that she stopped doing.

  
I'm at my wits end. I don't know what to do. All the help I've suggested and given isn't working. I think she's pretty sold on never working, or doing much of anything, again. I work to enjoy life, not scrape by. As selfish as it may seem, that was mutual going into things. Enjoy life without having to worry (relatively) about money."
174,1,"no matter what, i am ALWAYS the issue.

i didn't do something right. i didn't say the right thing. i can't do anything right for the hell of me. it's like God has decided to toy with me for my entire life. my parents have hated me for years. my brother treats me like i do not exist. 

my friends always demanded respect but never respected me. make fun of me all they want, but if i do it it's high treason. and then they left. everyone leaves eventually, i knew this, but that's the issue. i am so sick of being alone. it gets to the point where i lie. i don't just lie about being okay. i lie about my life. things i do. i lie to seem more interesting. i lie so that my life isnt so mundane. well there's the reason everyone leaves you right there, you idiot. you dumbass. you think people wouldve stayed? and if it's always everyone leaving me, then i have to come to terms with the fact that it may be me. i am the issue. 

my life has been filled with pain. please tell me i am worthy of being alive, because i don't know how much longer i have in me. i can't take it anymore. please tell me i have some hope. that there isn't a reason to not go on and pass away. im sure that it'll just be seen as attention seeking anyways.

it just feels like i have one day. one day every few months where i feel invincible. like i can do anything i want. like im god. but then for that sin of enjoying my life, God throws millions of bad days at me. like it's a crime for me to be happy. like i've sinned trying to be a better person. i try to be a better person. to be nice. to be kind. but who the hell wants that? who wants you to be yourself? nobody loves you. nobody ever has.

im paying a price to be happy. except im not even happy. im always trying to make other people laugh with jokes. or make them happy with gifts. but you never asked if you were happy. im not. aren't you? im not.

but do you know what i am?

im the retarded, fat, chopped, ugly, crazy kid. its okay to make fun of me because im me. everything i like is bad. every opinion i have is wrong. i can't do anything right. i dont have common sense. i dont have anything redeeming. i am a disease. a disgusting presence. it is no wonder i am alone.

if i had to endure myself, i would go crazy too.

i may truly be the worst person to grace this earth. because i try to be a better person than i was yesterday. but no matter what, it only gets worse and worse, tumbling down and down until nothing remains.  i only bring pain. and suffering. to other peoples lives. i am a curse. an anomaly. and nobody would miss me. because nobody would know. because nobody acknowledges my existence. and for all intents and purposes, i am fundamentally invisible."

I‚Äôm not used to being the youngest anymore. My sister and my brother in law have jobs that require them to be away from home for some time, and my nephew just turned 2 this year. 

I‚Äôve been left home alone since I was around 9 when my parents had to go somewhere. I don‚Äôt know if I have attachment issues or what, but my mom had to babysit my nephew after she dropped my dad off at work. 
And I feel so stupid for being upset over it, but I can‚Äôt stand being home alone anymore. I just want my mom.

180,1,"This is my first time here. I just wanna get out of ny chest how detached I feel from the world and how isolated I feel.

At this moment I'm pathetically crying and getting my nose clogged again as I do after 2 weeks of having a cold. Great.

I've tried so much, so so much. I've made so many friends, more than the normal person would. I still can't find someone I can connect perfectly to. The one that got the closest to it isn't even curious as for why I identify so much with Gojo or why I'm leaving messages incomplete. The person I feel the most comfortable with since my mom is someone I've met about 4 weeks ago, how pathetic is that? 

Nobody was ever that curious about me while at the same time, making me so curious about them. I don't wanna overwhelm them with my feelings, they already helped me so much...
We've talked every night since I got their personal contact (about 3 weeks ago).
All of our conversations are either fun reflective stuff about how humans work or really deep emotional conversation about how we don't feel entirety human. Reduced to objects of desire to everyone.

Every friend, and I mean EVERY. FRIEND. I've made since I was a little kid, fell for me. It ruined everything every god damned time. It's like I'm just something beyond human to them. They don't even know my real feelings or my mind, my fears. When they get to know, they notice I'm not the strong one they admired so much.

I'm so tired of trying, I'm so tired of being isolated. I'm crying right now like I haven't cried since my ex-boyfriend made a 1 day long joke on my birthday about cheating on me with a guy named Gabriel.

I didn't put out everything that's in my chest, but I'll stop here because I really wanna catch some sleep tonight, and I wouldn't do that with a clogged nose.

I just turned 18 a few days ago, but I feel like I'm gonna end up buying a few bottles of whatever can numb me to these feelings.

182,3,"Venting here so I don't go full Karen at my landlord. They have every right to do this, I'm just annoyed as hell. 

I live in an apartment complex and have a small patio outside. This year I really made it nice - built a small garden bed and planted some lovely plants (like vegetables, and some annuals). I built it myself with a wooden frame. I bought a hammock, set up a nice bird feeder and bird bath, etc. 

Yesterday, I received an e-mail that they will be doing construction on the exterior of the building for the next 4-6 weeks and everything will need to be removed. I didn't check my e-mail for 24 hours and when I came home, the garden bed was completely disassembled (with dirt and plants thrown out) and my hammock/bird feeder were in my living room.

Look, it's not illegal, but where's the notice? What am I going to do with this giant-ass hammock in my 100 sq ft living room? I live in Boston, this is the only nice 4-6 week period in the whole-ass year!"
183,0,"I‚Äôm just going to rant about awkward women in order to hope I learn something about not being an autist in the process. 

I was at my wife‚Äôs mom‚Äôs birthday party with her extended family (20 people total?). I haven‚Äôt met a good amount of her cousins before. 

When my wife first introduced me to one, her first reaction was ‚ÄúEw!‚Äù. My first immediate thought was ‚Äúif I say literally any mean spirited joke in response, my wife might not like it‚Äù, so I kind of just end up laughing and moving on. 

However, we end up sitting at the same table for cake because we‚Äôre ‚Äúthe college aged people‚Äù of the party. It was weird to watch her reactions towards me being polite, because she clearly gets ignored a lot. Like, she‚Äôd start to say something, and my wife‚Äôs sister would interrupt her with whatever. After that I sort of focus my attention on her, and people listen to what she‚Äôs saying. I guess, with my absence, this is what I would get treated like in a crowd full of people who don‚Äôt like me. Anything I say gets drowned out, and people sit in the corner with their own conversations that I can‚Äôt contribute to. 

Another woman was even more awkward. We were making small talk about different natural disasters in the USA, and she said ‚Äúyou know, when people think the apocalypse is coming, porn usage skyrockets because people start jacking off‚Äù. 

Now, I know social etiquette is hard, but Jesus Christ, this is not something you say to someone the first time you meet them. I made a joke about ‚Äúdeleting my search history before the apocalypse‚Äù, because her comment was so far out there that I couldn‚Äôt even come up with anything. I switched the topic to the weather anyway, but it‚Äôs really annoying to force me as a socially autistic guy to be the one to drive a conversation. 

The guys at the party were way more normal when I did talk to them, but also more introverted. The talkative ones were more likely to stick to themselves in a quiet conversation in the corner, where it'd be hard for me to join them. My wife also seemed to talk to them less, so maybe they just had fewer chances to give me a weird impression. However, at least for introductions, every one of them definitely acted polite and open to conversation."

Or even worse, you watch a whole film about a guy playing poker, and constantly in the film, different actors in different situations are there mentioning that you CANT hate the fucking olives. WHAT POKER HAS TO DO WITH THAT?

185,1,"For almost all of my life, I've had a diaper fetish. It started in preschool when my teacher forced me into one because I'd had an accident and she made me sit beside her with it on as I watched all the other kids play outside. It's burned into my memory and I'll never forget the humiliation I felt sitting there. Ever since then I'd been sick with that fetish. I never really got into the ABDL side of any of it, but the diapers were bad enough. When I was in my teens I began to research more about it and learned it's definitely not the most well regarded fetish. In fact it's often associated with pedophilia. I'm disgusted in knowing the fact that if people found out about me, they may believe me to be a pedophile. Everytime I get off to it, the wave of shame washes over me thinking that I may very well be a pedo. I don't have an attraction to children, nor an attraction to taking away innocence. I just happen to be into something that unfortunately is very closely tied to children. I don't get off to kids in them nor do I get off to the idea of a kid being in them, but still, it's hard to avoid the fact that it's correlated with children and is something very negatively regarded. I've honestly thought about ending my life because of it. I don't want to be seen as a pedo. I've tried every way to get rid of it but it just won't go away. It's just there, hanging over my head as a reminder that I'm a disgusting person. "

Nothing is more frustrating than going through Winter, waiting for warm weather, just to remember how AWFUL Summer can be! And don't get me started on evening, when the warm weather finally goes away and then you are left with tons of mosquito bites instead!

188,3,"I was out with friends Saturday morning and we came back to my apartment about 1.5 hours before my shift

I have been struggling with a leg injury and was complaining about it during this downtime. My two friends and my bf started nagging at me to call out. They said i overwork myself, my bf bribed me with sex, it wasnt my problem who was called in, and it wasnt my problem who had to carry the weight of my absence. The thing was, I wanted to go to work to have the distraction from some mental issues.

My friend asked me why i wanted to go, and who would i mainly show up for. I namedropped a coworker and my bf started saying ‚Äúo but if you wanna see x so bad then just go since you probably wanna be with him anyway‚Äù, he later clarified that he was joking and doesnt actually feel that way about my coworker.

They kept nagging me and screaming in agreement with my bf and eventually i just caved in and called out 30 minutes before my shift. My manager was understandably upset with me, and all my friends (who were at the door listening to me otp with her) were asking why she was such a bitch and why she had such an attitude. I told them she had a right to, and they all basically said ‚Äústill shes a bitch‚Äù. Then they all were like ‚Äúyay we can hangout all day‚Äù i didnt even want to hang out, and told my bf at the end of the day that i just felt peer pressured to call out. He said thats the length they need to go to get me to take care of myself.

Thing is, ive already been calling out a lot. Ive been calling out almost once a month since my injury 6 months ago. Im pretty sure im gonna get written up for my stunt, and im gonna be honest thats bothering me. I just came down with covid so i worked 1 day then immediately went back to absence until Friday. My manager wasnt in on Sunday so she didnt have the chance to talk to me, but im more than sure shes gonna talk to me friday. Im just bedridden and only have fever dreams of getting written up or fired over this. At my job theres a trend of people getting written up then fired soon after and ill be pissed if this  extended hangout is why i fall into that pattern. 

Im just annoyed at this situation, i shouldve just told my friends im going in. I shouldve just told my manager ill be late or something fml"
189,2,"1 of my 3 new neighbors is a young west African foreign woman with the ghetto attributes. Early 20s. As of this moment I can hear her toddler three doors down from me. The only thing I can think right now is why isn't that baby sleep? It is 10:58 at night. The child is adorable by the way but she should be sleep. As for her, in and out of the apt, door slamming, (I used to live in her apt so she has a slight pass on that, just no slamming), her friends popping up around this hour making noise. Come the fuck on now. This is what I hate about young parents. This woman is clearly not ready for a child (like the majority of people her age), obvious signs of this. Yes, I don't know her life but I know people, I've been around people like this lady long enough. I would say something but one thing leads to another and some shit happens. "

192,1,"This is literally just a vent, I know I can get a new job. Currently I'm paid a lot of money to do tasks that are tedious and boring and that add no real value to anybody's work. I literally just feel like a pencil pusher and it's draining me.

For example, for the past couple of months, I've been getting paid to pretty much just sit at home and update Excel sheets that no one even looks at. I could do it easily, but all I seem to do lately is just sit there dreading to open a single document, knowing full well that as soon as I'm done with this batch there will be more, knowing full well that nobody will even notice or give a shit (except my boss who checks up on me once in a while to make sure I'm doing something, anything). I went to uni for nearly a decade just to basically get paid to sit in a chair and tippy tap on a keyboard. It's insulting.

The worst part is that everyone tells me I'm lucky because my job pays well and has a lot of perks. One thing I get a lot is ‚ÄúI wish I had a job with nothing to do‚Äú but I don't think people understand the soul crushing aspect of not having any of your skills used, not contributing to anything, doing tasks that are so boring and useless that you almost feel offended when you're asked to do them.

My job just makes me feel depressed, undervalued and pessimistic about the future. If I could live the rest of my life without hearing about scrum meetings and metadata ever again, I would die a happy man."
193,1,"Rugby is my main sport, I have loved every second of it.
I missed 2/60 practices,trained 3 times a week every week. And I wasn‚Äôt the fastest, the tallest, the strongest, I always showed up. I was a fucking ray of sunshine even when my depression was at a 10, even when I was sick I showed up and I smiled and took every bit of constructive criticism. I trained hard and I listened harder and I did every thing I had to to improve 

At our season finale I got the whole contact sport trio, a broken nose, a concussion and severe whiplash. I went through 3 weeks of vomiting, constant blood, and not being able to speak clearly.

We had an award ceremony and I got dressed to the nines, and I went in alone. My mom didn‚Äôt want to go and my dad was at boxing. I was driven late so while my teammates sat together I had to stand 20 feet away at the venue when my team went up on stage and  they called out titles like most improved, MVP, coach‚Äôs choice, my hands were left empty.

I feel like I didn‚Äôt do enough, it wasn‚Äôt enough that I felt physically in pain, I didn‚Äôt have any friends on the team or any physical proof I worked hard. I know the whole ‚Äúdoing sports needs humility‚Äù thing but it‚Äôs just, I worked my ass off, put myself at risk and I feel I didn‚Äôt even get a friend in there. Let alone a trophy."
194,1,"When we‚Äôre born we get forced into a social and economic game with rules we‚Äôre expected to simply intuit with nobody to teach us. The punishments for failure are either invisible or excruciating. And sometimes a person is born as someone who seems completely unable to play this game. 

I‚Äôm one of these people. My emotions are far more intense than they should be, I can‚Äôt focus on anything to save my life, especially not building habits. I almost and sometimes actually cry and mentally spiral over the smallest of things as if I were a child. And telling myself these feelings are childish and trying to hold them back certainly doesn‚Äôt change their existence and overwhelming hold on my life.

All I ever wanted was to be more than someone‚Äôs second or third or last choice. I‚Äôve been that way since I was born really, and I can never tell if it‚Äôs even my fault. I know these days I‚Äôm usually exhausting to be with, because if someone does actually take their time to be with me I‚Äôm overbearing because of how badly I need attention and love and care.

So I think I‚Äôm done. Because the modern world accommodates for it, I think I‚Äôm done going outside. I‚Äôm done even trying. I‚Äôm done hoping I‚Äôll be anything more than nobody and nothing. Because I‚Äôm lucky enough to have the financial support of my family despite everything, I‚Äôll just live off of that until they die and by then maybe I‚Äôll have worked up the courage to go jump off a bridge. My attempts at connecting to people are ultimately meaningless. Progress in this world is ultimately meaningless. Everything can be lost in a split second, and times like that aren‚Äôt even rare coincidences.

So since I‚Äôm lucky enough why not just shut myself in? I won‚Äôt have to fear everyone outside anymore. I wont have to stress over the fact that things are going nowhere if I decide that my life simply isn‚Äôt meant to be heard and seen. If I can just abandon that guilt and shame then why not? 

Yes I know I‚Äôm spiraling. I‚Äôm already in therapy. I‚Äôm not asking for you to tell me how to fix myself."

I wish I could take my mums burden away as all the bills are stacking up as we pay rent , electricity, water etc 
We don‚Äôt really have much as per food but it‚Äôs still manageable as we have been used to that c: plus once a month and a half the church gives us something. 
I do realize there are bigger problems in the world right now and I‚Äôm sorry for complaining.

I‚Äôm ashamed I cant even help my family I‚Äôm useless. I don‚Äôt know what I need right now maybe that ‚Äúevery it‚Äôs going to be okay‚Äù I‚Äôm so lost "
196,2,"The state of the world terrifies me, im so scared of global war and mostly nuclear war (as we all are i guess). I know everythings has been going to shit for a while, climate change, wars, civil wars, crises all around the world and it only seems to get worse. And im scared. Maybe we all are idk, im falling into despair i feel like im drowning in fear and apprehension of could happen at any moment. I dont enjoy anything anymore because it seems superficial like ""whats the point if we all fucking die ?"" , everything i do and exeperince seems superficial and useless, also selfish. I feel like such an hypocrite because i live a comfortable life and by being so scared im selfish in a way. I feel selfish when im happy or enjoy something, i feel like i dont deserve/am not allowed to feel this way. Im scared, and honestly not even for me but for my family, i never cared about myself, i care about them and i dont want them to suffer in this awful world. 

I hate complaining and this was probably pathetic to read. Im sorry "
197,3,"I hate my sister so much I hope she fucking dies

I have another post about growing up with her on my page but i can‚Äôt handle her anymore she‚Äôs diagnosed with PTSD, ASPD, ADHD, and a learning disability where she has the mentality of an 8 yr old and she‚Äôs so fucking insufferable to be around when she‚Äôs home you need to walk on eggshells because one wrong look and she‚Äôs screaming in your face threatening you and is just a complete bitch. 

She doesn‚Äôt listen or care about anyone but herself, she comes home at 5 am everyday drunk banging on my window to let her in, if you say no to her she won‚Äôt shut her bitch ass until you comply. She nearly broke my door down because i said no to her, there‚Äôs now holes in it. I usually have a lot of empathy towards people who struggle mentally but with her I cant, I hate how everyone just excuses her behaviour due to her mental health issues.

She‚Äôs also a wanna be hood-rat, an alcoholic, and a drug addict, and a fucking whore she had an abortion when she was 14 and has had multiple STDS because she has sex with anything that walks, even this ugly fat one eyed dude, or she‚Äôll have sex with someone for alcohol or weed. And she doesn‚Äôt take responsibility for anything, if you‚Äôre a foot behind her and she falls it‚Äôs your fault, if you do anything and she reacts it‚Äôs your fault. I hope she gets her ass beat and dies, or her std‚Äôs kill her, I fucking hate this dumb stupid bitch

198,1,"My gf broke up with me in april. The reason was that she wanted me to fund her in everything, she didnt want to work or do anything besides drinking often with her girlfriends. 
I am an attractive 25m she is an attractive 24f everybody said we looked perfect together, we were compatible in sex in our free time routines.
She was the first to say and often repeat the word ""I love you"". 
I gave her everything: my time, my affection, damn she was the first girl that I liked that much, I even showed her to my parents (althought she never did and avoided it).

Man I tried to be her friend, her boyfriend, her lover, her cheerleader (without doing it too much).

I still think that she just wanted money from me this whole time. She broke up with me, I took it as a man, I did not beg for something, just walked out cold with a ""If that is what you want, I wish you well"".

I know I did the correct thing, but it still hurts like hell. Fuck. I try to occupy my mind with my purpose, my work, I train, I take walks, even tried dating again, but here I am more that two months later still drinking out of pain in the night, still thinking how I could have been this stupid to fall for a girl, and I hate feeling sorry for myself. 

Sorry if it was hard reading all this, I'm a bit drunk and completely heartbroken. I wish I never met her, but at the same time I know I loved every minute we spent together. 

Genuine guys please, take care of your heart, a girl that shows you all signs of love, could just be doing it for her own purposes. "
199,3,"Family isn‚Äôt just some avengers you can assemble when you‚Äôre feeling lonely and want to  argue to. How am I supposed to trust you when all you‚Äôve given me is malice and heartbreak. I‚Äôve tried to talk it through with you but you interrupt me and act like you suddenly know ‚Äúthe real reason‚Äù. This has nothing to do with white people, this has nothing to do with Asians or Jews, this shit is all on you .  You only blame other races for your mistakes because you can‚Äôt admit you‚Äôve made some that you know none of us in the family will ever heal from. 


You know I used to look up to you, I was born into a world with any father figure and you were my first. I trusted you with my life, my secrets, my deepest feelings and what did you do? You laughed at me, dismissed my fears (which would go on to be true) and downplayed my achievements- moved the fucking goalposts. I‚Äôm done. If being in this family means being a top dawg pretentious prick then fuck no, fuck that noise.  The moment you said ‚ÄúI wasted my time with you, get the fuck out of my car‚Äù that hurt. But your old black ass could give two damns and a tiddlywink of piss about it.

You say you don‚Äôt want to continue the cycle but you created an even worse cycle. Now all of your grandchildren are afraid of you and don‚Äôt want nothing to do with you. Because of all years of you shittalking me, you scared them away. The moment they found out about you choking me is the moment they cut ties with you and with Grandma . You wonder why they don‚Äôt come around anymore? That‚Äôs why. 


Now I was being stupid, I wanted to stay because surely my grandparents were in there. These evil , vile , harrowing creatures couldn‚Äôt be my grandparents, not the ones I knew. But dear fuck the rose colored glasses you made me wear was strong as fuck because when I looked back, I never had a voice in your household. Only a job. Be quiet, be good, look pretty. 

Fuck you, fuck this family. I‚Äôm done.

200,3,"So couple months ago i found out my parents stole money from me. And not a little amount. It was money i had saved up to pay off my student debt (its kinda hard to explain how that debt works but i can explain more another time). I dont talk to my parents anymore. I have t talked to my mom since then and to my dad i already didnt talk to him since a year ago. Why i dont talk to my dad is bcs he wanted me to quit my job at a warehouse (where i work with awesome ppl and make good money) to go for work his new company, a company that didnt even last a week and made huge losses. Bcs i refused to work for him he told me to move out the house lol. Like yea my dad is like ‚Äúmove out my house but let me keep your debt money and spent it on my business‚Äù

On one hand im kinda thankfull for it bcs it made me realize i never have to think about my parents ever again. I dont ever have to think about making them proud or doing them a favor. On the other hand ive been betrayed by my own parents. And the funny thing is when i got the debt money they told me to send it over to their bank account bcs ‚Äúi couldnt be trusted with it‚Äù.

Since this all happened it did make me realise all the mental and sometimes even physicall abuse they caused me. My dad was always pushing me to get good grades a do a good level on school (in my country highschool and college are divided in different levels). When i went to highschool i got to go to a high level of highschool. My dad always pushed me and was strict if it was about school. He would check my grades every month, go to every school meeting and never would be halpy with my grades. ‚ÄúWhy do you have a 6 and not a 8?‚Äù

And the funny thing is im the only one in our household who got to go to a high level. My older sister, younger sisters and parents all went to a lower level than me. Why did my dad push me so much more than my sisters? He never checked the grades of my sisters as much as he did for me. hell he doesnt even go to my younger sister‚Äôs parentsmeeting.

I know why he does that tho. Because in his family im the only one who got to go to a higher level. All my cousins on my dads side got a lower level and some didnt even go to college. For my dad i was the project he could flex in his family. i remembered when i got the higher level he told everyone. Not bcs he was proud of me but bcs he could brag bcs hes a narcissist.

Theres so much i could go into like my younger sisters and how much i hate them too. but this post is going on for too long"
201,1,"thought i‚Äôd put the trigger warning there because there will be mentions of rape and suicidal ideation.

i‚Äôm 19f, and i‚Äôve never really been able to make connections with people. i‚Äôm autistic, so i‚Äôve always felt like an alien who came down to earth against her will and had to watch humans closely to mimic their actions and expressions to fit in. to try and look human. when i was a little kid i had a lot of friends because i was super hyper (i also have adhd), but once i hit secondary school, and hit puberty, everything just took a turn for the worst. i DID make a group of friends, but they all turned on me. here‚Äôs a quick summary: 

i was a stupid kid, about 14. didn‚Äôt know how to process and express that i needed support. i posted on my instagram story one night that i feel so alone and like i have nobody. the next day all my friends were giving me the cold shoulder, and when i asked what i did one of them said that they were offended over my story. that apparently i was taking them for granted, and that i‚Äôm acting like i have no friends, when i have them. anyway, i apologized for hurting them and they continued to ignore me for the rest of the time we were in school (we leave at 16 in the uk so the next 2 years). they‚Äôd physically get up and move tables when i‚Äôd sit down, spread rumors that i was a bully to them, etc. it got so bad that i would eat lunch with the teachers and thought about killing myself every day. i self harmed frequently. my grades were awful because of it.

i haven‚Äôt had proper friends since then, and i‚Äôm now almost 20. whenever i DO try to make friends, they turn out to be either be disgusting people, or just mean bullies. i keep getting hurt. 
today was my last straw. about a week ago, i was walking to class in college and a guy stopped me, telling me he loved my clothes, hair, makeup etc. we ended up speaking for a while about music, video games, fashion. we had so much in common and i felt genuinely happy that maybe this time i‚Äôd found someone who understands me, someone i can be true friends with. he invited me to open mic night (there‚Äôs open mic night in my town every wednesday) and i said yes.
tomorrow is wednesday, so today i and if he‚Äôs definitely coming because i don‚Äôt really like last minute plans, i want to know at least a day before. he told me he can‚Äôt come, because he‚Äôll ‚Äòget jumped‚Äô. i asked why, and he drops this on me. he has rape accusations, and his ex and her friends will be there. 

now, i know they‚Äôre just accusations. but i‚Äôd rather believe the victim. if he is actually a rapist‚Ä¶i dodged one nasty bullet. especially because we would‚Äôve been hanging out one on one before we got to the open mic night. good god. 
i feel so upset, why can‚Äôt i ever make friends with nice, normal people? it seems like only bad people gravitate towards me. i‚Äôm so done. i feel so fucking depressed and suicidal. i‚Äôm going to be alone forever. im cursed. im genuinely just in my room every single day doing nothing. my life is good for nothing."
202,3,"What the title says. I know this goes both ways, I‚Äôm not by any means saying I have bad parents, quite the opposite actually. We are pretty financially secure, they also have a lot of time on their hands so it‚Äôs not like they neglect me, but even after all the ingredients needed to have a perfect family we are far from it. We hate talking to each other. We live in the same house but don‚Äôt see each other‚Äôs faces till nighttime, that too only to say good night. I don‚Äôt want to be like this, I‚Äôm going to move out soon for college (to a different continent) and I wanted these last few months to be good with them, but it never will be. 

I can‚Äôt remember the last time my dad and I had a conversation that wasn‚Äôt about school. It‚Äôs always about that. It‚Äôs always about how I should study, how I am not doing enough. Who tf would want to talk to the other person if this is all you associate with them. My school ended a month ago, and still, the only thing we are talking about now is admissions, and how im still not doing enough. 

I‚Äôm so tired. I see my friends and they actually like spending time with their parents, but I can‚Äôt even fathom that. The thing is that now I have so much resentment towards them (I‚Äôm sure they resent me too) that even when they scold me about valid things I get angry. All our conversation are *just* that it is quite literally nothing else. They get mad at me because they say I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell them anything‚Äù which is true, I don‚Äôt, but why would I? The one time I did they somehow still made it about school and how I should focus on it instead of wasting my time. Whenever we talk for more than 10 minutes we end up fighting. So then we just avoid each other. 

He doesn‚Äôt understand me and I don‚Äôt understand him, and yes, it is common for parent and children to not understand each other but it surely can‚Äôt be this bad. Is this normal? Is what I‚Äôm feeling just the consequence of being a teenager or is there something actually wrong with how we feel about each other?  "
203,2,"‚Ä¶ And can‚Äôt lean on traditional methods to do it because of a history of eating disorders. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and 179lbs. Calorie tracking and weight tracking are major triggers, but I also hate the weight I‚Äôve gained. I used to be 150 and comfortable. I‚Äôm trying to do it the way you‚Äôre ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to when you have a history of disordered eating, but no matter what I feel like I‚Äôm packing on the pounds. I don‚Äôt drink soda. We don‚Äôt go out to eat. We make all of our food at home, but due to my wife‚Äôs IBS it‚Äôs a lot of calorie dense foods, meat and potatoes. 

I used to eat like‚Ä¶ well, like a poor person with an ED, but I wasn‚Äôt particularly unhealthy. A lot of cheap fruits and vegetables and protein powder. Then I moved in with my wife. I started a desk job, so I‚Äôm not on my feet eight hours a day. I try to stay away from or offset my calories from office snacks. I would exercise outside of work hours, but I‚Äôm constantly taking care of household chores. There‚Äôs hardly any time for me to do hobbies I LIKE, let alone go for a run. 

I feel like if I wanted to lose weight I‚Äôd need to do something drastic, but I don‚Äôt WANT to. I just want to be a healthy weight.

204,1,"I just hate it so much, I dont care if it‚Äôs a good thing, I‚Äôd rather be like everyone else then to stand out. Everyone who says this doesn‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like.

I just want to be treated the same and not be treated like I am sone sort of different species. Why can‚Äôt people just understand that this isn‚Äôt a pet peeve and it‚Äôs something that ruins your life until you feel trapped. 

Can someone relate to this? Because I‚Äôve had people think that I am weird because of this. Idc if being different is a good thing. It‚Äôs fucking annoying how I am always considered different, I am just like any guy my age smh. "
205,3,"I have autism and it seems as if everybody is better than me. On Saturday me and my family went to 75th birthday anniversary of some relatives( their birthday is couple days apart and they are a couple). At that party there were my cousins.(I literally saw them for the first time) They are 10-11th graders. And as I'm writing I can't stop crying... It seems as if they are better than me in every aspect. I have issues with directions in my city lets not even talk about the capital or other country. Turns out that I(12th grader) am just r word. I am bad with direction, I can't even get driver's license and I am just useless. One of my cousins' is good at biology and will be a doctor, other is good at programming. And here am I. Everything I'm good at is English but again my vocabulary isn't that broad or unique. I can't even put into words how frustated I am with myself. Their mom asked me where I want to study but apart from learning subjects from school, I've done nothing else. My cousin knows how to play an instrument and I can't even figure out what I like to do? I have no interesting hobbies and my cousins are brilliant. On Sunday I woke up at 2pm!!! This really messed me up. They are probably doing sport activies but all Sunday I was doomscrolling and did absolutely nothing. That day I began my crying cycle. On Monday, I was cleaning my room. Quite productive, right?? Wrong! On Sunday I was supposed to write my to do list for the week which would have massively helped me start my week but I only managed to clean my room. That day I almost cried next to my mom. I don't want anyone to see me this way, only my psychologist( who i dont go to anymore because school is over for 12th graders and next year im no longer a student in that school) I feel so lost and confused. And on top of that which is the main reason I'm so over the edge, my school friends are ignoring me. I messaged my closest friend on Saturday at that party, he replied. But now... No reply. Didn't even bother to read my message. My other friend takes days to reply. I want close contact with them but it looks as if they do not value me or my emotions. Tuesday(today) was the same. I had hard time waking up, doomscrolled in between hair washing and bathing. Took like 1 hour breaks between those tasks. Later had hard time brushing my teeth and procrastinated doing it and when I actually did it, it was like 3pm. I'm furious with myself and my friends. Why do they never text me back! Everything is changing and I hate it! School is over, idk what to do, my cousins are amazing. To be fair, its not my cousins fault for this reaction those are my bottled emotions because everyone my age has drivers license and I cant even navigate in my city. But I feel so heartbroken with my friends' actions.... It feels as if I'm nothing to them. Please provide me guidance. I know that I'm extremely overstimulated and overwhelmed but my doomscrolling makes me feel even worst and I cant clearly thing to figure something out. I was legit crying writing this. Also, I want to begin hanging out with my friends after school but my friend isn't messaging me so idk. I need to get him his last day of school bell. I have a plan to go to my school tomorrow maybe special ed teacher could help and arrange one final meeting for me with my psychologist. My friendships mean a lot to me but it feels like my friends do not value me. My other friend told me maybe my closest friend is busy and cant reply but i doubt it because he mainly just plays video games so obviously he could've found some time for me.

206,2,"All I‚Äôve ever wanted was for someone to truly hear me. To truly understand me. To believe me when I say something is a big deal to me, or when I say I‚Äôm breaking inside.

No one does. No one tries to.

It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm not loved by family, partner. They do, in the only way they can.

But it‚Äôs not what I need.

Therapy says I can only be myself, accept them for who they are, so I try to do this.

My place is to hear them. To try to understand them. To believe them.

I give up a little piece of myself every day.

208,3,"I know I probably shouldn‚Äôt comment on what my sister eats but I‚Äôm a little concerned. Whenever I make chicken Alfredo or something I tell my sister she should try it. But no my mom makes her a whole other dish of macaroni and spaghetti sauce and a piece of chicken. Everday for school lunch she has a small pizza or pizza bagels when she‚Äôs in middle school going into high school here soon. When I ask what she wants for dinner she says either ‚Äòpasta‚Äô or ‚Äòpizza‚Äô. Now I‚Äôm not a huge fan of pizza myself since my ex-step-dad ruined it for me and recently it‚Äôs made me sick ever so whenever we have pizza I make myself a salad that‚Äôs all. Other than that I eat whatever is made and put in front of me. My sister? You put something that isn‚Äôt pasta or pizza infront of her and suddenly she‚Äôs not hungry and doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with it. Pasta or pizza? Well she eats it right up. I‚Äôm getting a bit tired of having to make two separate meals especially when I make chicken Alfredo cause then I have chicken to worry about and the pasta and a separate piece of chicken in the oven and there‚Äôs been times where I‚Äôve had to run to the bathroom (stomach aches) and I ask my mom ‚Äòhey can you watch the food I might be a minute‚Äô and when I get upstairs‚Ä¶ everything is burnt and she blames it on me.

209,2,"I don't know what to do, I'm probably just spiralling, but I don't have anyone I can tell without causing them to worry, which might be unfounded.

I found a lump in my neck behind my ear and had it checked by the doctor who told me to come back in 3 weeks if it's still there. It could just be a swollen lymph node from infection, but I've not been sick.

It's been 3 weeks, and it's still there, I've since found another lump in my jaw/cheek area and just today one inside me. I felt the one inside me a while ago but convinced myself it was just my anatomy. It's not my cervix it's on the side of it. I checked today, and it feels worse.

I'm going back to the docs next week, but they have a history of fobbing me off despite something actually being wrong, so I don't trust them at all. They don't know about the lump inside, and I'm scared to tell them in case they think I'm time wasting and it's normal.

I think I just need someone to tell me everything's going to be ok or if they've had a similar experience and it turned out ok."
210,2,"My husband lives in Canada and I'm in the states, opposite coasts. I do enjoy Canada a lot and dreamed of living in Vancouver for a while. It was our plan, for him to move to Vancouver so that I'm closer to my family in the states. Except well, things have changed. His industry was really affected by the policies going on in the US and he hasn't been getting great traction in the Vancouver job search. The alternative was to move to the states when I'm at, but I think for the time being we're more comfortable with being in Canada.

And so now we're looking at moving to Toronto but the idea is making me grieve. I grieve holidays and dates with my family, coffee and celebrations with friends, and living in a space that I love and consider home. I've moved around a few times when I was younger and every time I felt forced to move and be away from friends. And while financially this move to Toronto makes sense (he has a house he's almost done paying off, plus his job is there), I feel like I'm being forced again. And it feels unfair to me too. My husband doesn't really see his friends or extended family while I see mine every weekend. He isn't as attached to his city like I am to mine. 

He's super understanding and supportive and we've spoke about this a bunch but I just feel the same regardless. I'm not excited to move, in fact, my therapy sessions have been just about the move and how to not get FOMO and not assume that all my friends will just leave me. 

I have about a year before the move, but my anxiety-ridden mind is already creating 100 scenarios for all the bad things. "
211,1,His snap score constaly goes up. Went over 60 up the past 2 days. We are in a LDR n I fcking wait hours and hours for a text n he'll never ever snap me. No streaks. No random pictures. Maybe if im lucky hell send one if i ask. So why is his score going up so much? Over 200 in 2 weeks.Phone calls? Ha. There's always a good reason it never happens. :)) I'm starting to think I'm just a passtime to him or I'm a side or something. Idk. Fckin hurts bc he chased me for months. Ya know what's crazy too? I didn't even mean tp look at his snap score. Just noticed everytime waiting for his response I'd look at the very few pictures he sent his score would go up.

Edit: I know ur all thinking ""if he's not sick just rehome him!"" Because I would be lol.

I mean would U wanna take on a dog who attacks every man or child he sees? Who attacks your neighbors and strangers to the point he will get U evicted or even sued? Who needs a muzzle, prong collar and a harness with an extra grip incase he sees someone triggering to him to just go outside for a walk or to sit IN YOUR OWN backyard? Who can jump 8 ft fences or open doors? A dog who if you move wrong will attack you? I love him but he's a fucking handful. He's got a bite count of 11 in a month in a half. Nobody wants him and my boy, as sad as it is, is more of a liability than anything atp I love him dearly and I hate to see him go but there is no fixing this as far as I've been told, it scares me that he has bitten my neighbor quite deep as well as multiple strangers and myself. I don't know what else to do and I'm sorry if our views differ but this is what's best for him according to our vet and multiple professional trainers."
213,1,"I'm 20M, and after dropping out of school, i took multiple jobs, left lots of them. And the one I'm doing rn is in a Surgical Face Mask producing Factory for ~85 dollars a month (Tadaa). And the owner of that factory (literally a company) makes millions every years. How? 

Well, as i heard, he was never interested in studies, never saw the face of a school, his father had some land which he became the owner of after his death, and that land's price obviously skyrocketed with time. He sold some of it and built an apartment on the land he had left. He sold and rented out flats and started opening illegal businesses. The turnover in his life came when a guy in his apartment started making face masks and sold them to pharmacies, he was making some good amount of money. And our bad guy had an idea, he asked the guy to share with him his contacts and vendors, which he didn't, then my boss kicked him out of the apartment. Somehow he found some vendors and started the Face mask business, then appointed some educated and skilled guys to handle the business paperworks and his ownership managements (guys who were 100 times more intelligent and worthy than him) 
And luckily, COVID-19 striked and he sold masks for up to 50√ó more than what it cost him to make them. Then he became a millionaire (in BDT, maybe in Dollar too) 

Luck? Idk

Hard work? Barely

Evil? Yeah, for kicking out that guy

Coincidence? Maybe


Unfair? Hell yeah!!"
214,1,"I (20F) have come to the realisation that I‚Äôm no one‚Äôs best friend (hopefully that doesn‚Äôt sound too cringe). It‚Äôs just a shit feeling to be honest as someone who would love to experience a true genuine friendship and sisterhood. I feel like everyone in my life has already found their people but I‚Äôm just stuck like floating between people. This realisation has come after I noticed that the friendship with a person I considered my closest friend is just not the same anymore, she‚Äôs found her own group and there‚Äôs a difference in how she acts with them and with me. I feel nothing malicious towards her honestly, like she‚Äôs an amazing person and is still one of my really good friends it‚Äôs just a personal issue I have with myself.

I feel like I really wasted those formative social years of high school and university, now I‚Äôm graduating and this is the state of my social life. I have friends here and there but no one which I could really say is my best friend and who would consider me their best friend too. I‚Äôm no one‚Äôs main friend if that makes sense.

I‚Äôm far from being a pushover or people pleaser, and I genuinely feel bad for not being able to complete the tasks they set me up for, but for some reason when I say no it‚Äôs an issue. Like I‚Äôm not an on call babysitter or house cleaner, I picked up these skills by taking care of my 5 younger siblings and picking up the slack for my mom when she was stressed out.

I just wanna live my life without people always asking me to do stuff for them simply because they don‚Äôt wanna do it. It really urks me to my core, now I see why people are so selfish with their time because the second your not you get called for EVERYTHING. 

‚ÄúCan you do this‚Äù ‚Äúcan you do that‚Äù like come on! I have my own life I want to live dude, I don‚Äôt want to constantly be doing people favors when I don‚Äôt get anything in return. "
217,3,"I have very wide feet. Whatever you‚Äôre imagining, they‚Äôre wider. They flare out on the sides. I have a very hard time finding heels and when I do, they look ridiculous because of the overhang. 

My aunt (who I live with so it‚Äôs not like I can just ignore her) continuously tells me my wide feet are the direct result of wearing flip flops and shoes that didn‚Äôt ‚Äúbind‚Äù my feet growing up. I‚Äôm almost certain that‚Äôs not how that works but I feel like i‚Äôm going crazy. 

My dad has super wide feet so i‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs genetic! I think a small part of it may be because i‚Äôm classified as overweight but even as a tiny preteen, my feet flared out! They were bony, but still flared. 

It‚Äôs just annoying to hear that it‚Äôs my fault because I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt wear the right shoes‚Äù growing up. I‚Äôm 19 and from middle school up until now, I only wore closed shoes that were tight enough to ‚Äúbind‚Äù my feet (if that‚Äôs a thing) and guess what? Feet are still wide. Every shoe I wear gives me foot pain as it is and i‚Äôm sick of being blamed for something i‚Äôm 90% sure I can‚Äôt control. "
218,3,"I hate that this is a continuous thing thay I post about, I think I have two or three posts here about it but it's because I'm just constantly passed off üò≠

This time though it's not really about misophonia related issues. I'm scheduled to go into work at 9, so I leave my house at 8:30 to get there, and wake up around 8:00 to get ready. This is while I'm not in class too, so before this summer I did the same sort of schedule but still an hour earlier. And I thought it would be nice to get to sleep in a little instead of rushing to class. But for the past three days I've been woken up at six in the morning by my step-mom doing various things. First it was moving furniture, then it was her and my stepbrother talking. And he usually works at night so IM expected to walk around on eggshells during NORMAL waking hours so he can sleep on our couch. But he's taken off work for like two days (the days I've been woken early) and it's pissing me off. I literally went into work two hours early today because of this today. I went in an hour early the day they moved furniture. May as well be pissed off at work and making money than listening to their words grating on my ears for free.

My stepbrother also stays up late, which is fine because I do too but sometimes he decides to cook in the middle of the night and doesn't even try to be quiet about it. And he also has a pet parrot that was staying at his dad's house but has recently come to ours because his dad is at the hospital with his sister so it had to come here and it just REALLY sucks because now I'm being woken up by bird noises too. Like parrots are cool and all but I'm about to strangle something. Not the poor bird because he's a victim in this too lol

I wish I could move out honestly but I can't afford anywhere, much less a pet friendly place and I have two cats. Also who the heck brings a pet bird to a house where there are MULTIPLE cats that could try to attack it?

And before people get mad, my stepbrother is 30. He has his own house he built (off grid type stuff). He is a grown man so I guess that's why it pisses me off so much. I'm held to standards he just isn't and I'm so tired. And he and I get along very well, so that sucks too but I just wish he would shut up at 6 in the morning üò≠ but I guess he gets that from his mom because she's half the problem rn"

220,1,"21, unemployed. I quit working at panda express cuz I hated my life and working an unfulfilling job without a purpose or clear goal isn‚Äôt sustainable. 

‚Ä¢ College isn‚Äôt affordable

‚Ä¢ A car isn‚Äôt affordable 
‚Ä¢ Military requires me to sacrifice my soul

‚Ä¢ I want to be paid a livable salary.

‚Ä¢ I want to be treated with decency by my coworkers and colleagues.

It can‚Äôt just pay the bills

It‚Äôs way more important than bills, it‚Äôs a majority of my life, a finite resource of time and energy and I intend to spend it wisely.

Hopefully I can figure out the next best thing soon so I can move out of this apartment and claim some peace of mind away from my family. "
221,3,"Like any ad in any form on any platform. TV ads, I despise them. Radio ads can fuck right off. Billboards, you suck. Social media full page ""fake meme"" video ads... blow me.

Seriously, I intentionally avoid companies who's ads have pissed me off, which is basically all of them.

222,2,"Short story:

I came back to Missouri for the weekend to get the rest of my stuff to move to NYC, I took an Uber Pet to get breakfast with a former  coworker, the first Uber that picked us denied us me and my medical alert dog in full vest because she was ""too big and the driver didn't feel safe"" I put in the notes that she's a German Shepard// Golden Retriever mix and what she is trained to do. If you don't like big dogs please let someone who does take the ride. 
It seems to me that since covid there have been more people driving ride share which is great the downside to that is that this is becoming more and more commonplace when I travel compared to before when I traveled for work. I bring a towel out of respect because it is summer here in the US and she is shedding her winter coat. 
To be clear i only ride share when I am out of town because when I'm at home we can use the train and subway without issue. It makes life a million times easier "
223,1,"So as the title said, my gf broke up with me. We‚Äôve been together for about a year and four months. 

She had been really distant for about two weeks now, not calling or texting me as much. She works a LOT and i chalked it up to her being overworked and tired. I had planned to go over her house to talk about how shes been acting and how shes been feeling regarding our relationship, but she beat me to the punch. (Sad haha) 

She texted me first saying that she wanted to talk to me about some feelings shes been having and that its important, offering to text or call. Me being the girl i am i asked her to call me. I had figured it was bad news with the way she worded her text.

When she called me it wasnt on FT so i assumed it was serious and asked her whats up. She was very quiet and said that she feels as if she has lost feelings for me. My heart dropped to my asshole. She then said that she didnt want to hurt me and that she needed to be honest with me. She said shes been having these feelings for about the last month (around the time she became distant) and she hopes to still be friends because she still wants me in her life.

I wont lie that i cried and am crying. I really really liked this girl and i thought our relationship would last longer. She makes me so happy, my heart aches with knowing that i have to lose her. 

She assured me that it was nothing i have done and that she needs to work on herself more. 

I feel so fucking hurt and i know thats normal, i know that i‚Äôll find another woman out there that will make me happy. I just wanted her to be that woman for me. 

Thank you to those that read this long ass rant. My support systems are limited and its nice to vent online.

224,3,"I dont even know what to do or where to begin. 

I am barely getting by in a career I absolutely love, working with kids with autism. I live with my parents to help them and in return it also helps me. Recently I saw a ‚Äúfunds for financial crisis‚Äù form my mom was filling out. 

Theyre in their 80s. They dont have much in savings. I want to scream. Cry. Just fucking explode and I cant. Im their only kid, they adopted me. Theres no other family. 

I am scared. I am tired. I am terrified. "
225,1,"My last few weeks I have been slowly coming to terms with the fact that I have an eating disorder. Like 1000 calorie deficit type stuff. I think I have the tendency to believe that I overate when in reality all I had was a sandwich but I had multiple people tell me recently that they were concerned. I had been meaning to ask my parents if it could see a nutritionist for a while and they finally agreed with some hesitancy. They are people who do not believe that fat can ever be good and that believe moderation is stupid. We never had snacks or sweets in the house growing up and often I would get in trouble for eating too much apple sauce because that was the only sugary thing they kept in the house. I knew in my heart that they weren‚Äôt going to finance another trip to a nutritionist so I was completely honest about everything I‚Äôve been going through when I met with one and I mentioned as well that there was a chance this was the only time I‚Äôd be allowed to see her. Low and behold when my parents asked me how it went and i begrudgingly opened up to them about how little I was eating my mom accused me of lying to the nutritionist and both accused me of over eating. My dad even said that if I wasn‚Äôt willing to cut certain things from my diet that he didn‚Äôt see the point. 

What else could I possibly be cutting? I‚Äôm at 300-500 calories a day from my one meal that I eat which is two eggs and some bread. My body isn‚Äôt becoming skinny fast enough and neither of them believe me when I tell them I‚Äôve been restricting. 

I don‚Äôt want to be like this. I want to enjoy the food I eat. I want to stop sobbing in front of my fridge everytime I open it. I‚Äôm just like too afraid to grab anything. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll make the wrong choice. 

I‚Äôm going to try and stick with the preliminary plan the nutritionist and I made to get me back to eating three meals a day but I feel my body starting to hurt in ways it didn‚Äôt before and I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm gonna pass out and end up in the hospital if I can‚Äôt get my appetite up.

They haven‚Äôt believed me about certain mental health stuff in the past and it‚Äôs ended up with me being in out patient but this is different. If I can‚Äôt push through the pain that eating makes me feel I could like actually end up unable to physically recover. (Not that that‚Äôs not a risk when I was depressed but I don‚Äôt want to die anymore and I feel like it‚Äôs a battle to get my body the energy it needs)

So i guess I lied I so feel something: I feel scared and my head hurts so bad "
226,2,"
So yeah. Today absolutely sucked.

Found out someone I considered a friend, someone I let into my space, into conversations, into trust, used to date a 17-year-old. He‚Äôs in his early 40s. And on top of that? He has a kid in their early teens. I‚Äôm trying not to scream just writing this.

At first I didn‚Äôt want to jump to conclusions, I wanted to believe it was just a weird situation. But no. The more I looked at the way he talks, the threads he engages with, the way he gushes over people in their early twenties, it‚Äôs not a one-time thing. It‚Äôs a fucking pattern. And I‚Äôve been that younger girl before. I was 16 with a 25-year-old. I know exactly how that kind of ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù messes you up. It‚Äôs not romantic. It‚Äôs not edgy. It‚Äôs exploitation, plain and simple.

I removed him from my Discord. Quietly, but clearly. I said I‚Äôm not okay with age gaps like that, especially considering my own past. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs ‚Äúlegal.‚Äù There‚Äôs a massive power imbalance, and it hurts people. I‚Äôm not gonna sit back and let someone like that lurk around my community, let alone my friends. Turns out I wasn‚Äôt the only one uncomfortable‚Ä¶.others had noticed weird behavior too, especially toward another woman, but she didn‚Äôt want to say anything.

And now I‚Äôm here, exhausted, feeling like I‚Äôve been punched in the soul. This is the second time I‚Äôve had to cut off someone like this. Makes me feel like I need to vet people harder, like I can‚Äôt fully trust anyone until they prove they‚Äôre not secretly a predator. And that sucks. Because all I wanted was a chill, safe space, and now I‚Äôm cleaning up the emotional wreckage again.

I just want to retreat into my books. At least the men there aren‚Äôt trash."
227,0,"Can i call it a vent or just the truth? 

A person who had done plastic surgery ‚Äî I‚Äôm talking about cosmetic surgery ‚Äî truly does not love themselves. If you love yourself so much why do you want to change your appearance? Come at me or don‚Äôt. I hate nose jobs, yes sure your nose is pretty (most of the time it isn‚Äôt) but does it fit you? No. I can see one from a mile away. I hate lip fillers other than the fact that it is a literal trend. I knew people who got bullied for having big lips and now it is the standard? PATHETIC. I‚Äôm not getting into detail about how it‚Äôs brainwash and the patriarchy or whatever I‚Äôm just stating one fact. You don‚Äôt love yourself and it‚Äôs bad for your health, welcome to the long term effects of plastic surgery might read about you in a few years on Pubmedüòò

Loving yourself isn‚Äôt a basic thing you wasn‚Äôt born with it, it takes time and not a lot of people mastered it but seeing so many people with plastic surgery talk about it self love BAMBOOZELS me.

228,3,"My (28F) partner (30M) and I have been together for 7 years. We have 2 kids together and one on the way (28 weeks) 

He works so hard, which is a great thing. 

He works his official job in the evenings and is usually at his parents every day helping them with their horses. He does gardening for locals to help them too. I had been asking for months for him to take some time off otherwise he'd get burnt out. 
He refused. 

When it comes to our house, garden or anything, he has no motivation. 

We're due to move out of our rented property into a house his mum has inherited next month. 
I've been doing what I can, packing, decluttering etc. Pushing myself to do more than I'm supposed to. 

Due to having severe pregnancy complications, I'm on bed rest and have been signed off work by my doctor. 
The times we do get out, I have to use a wheelchair to get around due to pain. Otherwise I'd do more of these things myself... 

I've needed his help to paint, gardening and clear out the new place. 
It took me weeks to get him to take time off to do these things. Otherwise we wouldn't be getting our deposit back. 

He took a day off last week to start on our house and went to do some gardening for someone instead. 

He finally took a day off today and has been so reluctant to do anything, saying he's going to take a nap instead for a bit. 
But I know had he been at his parents today, he'd have all the motivation and energy to get that done. 

We're slowly running out of time to get things sorted and don't really have any extra help. 

I have tried to be supportive, while also trying not to nag at him for these things to be done. It's beyond stressful for the both of us...

230,2,"My auntie (father's sister) was assigned to look after me 19F and my younger brother 10M while my parents were away for 2 weeks. During her stay with us, she never asked us about food or anything, only caring for herself. I didn't think too much about it. After a week we all decided to go to my uncle's house (dad's brother). There, his wife neglected us and didn't even ask about food. I bore it for 2 days, but then came Eid. I was close to my period and her not caring for us was starting to get to me so i called my mom and told her the whole truth. 

My mom got on call with my auntie and uncle and yelled at them. She mentioned how she'd taken care of all their kids, given them gifts, let them borrow money etc, yet they could not care for her kids for even a week. After this fiasco, everyone became really cold towards me and my brother. We felt like outcasts until our parents came back early to pick us up.

My auntie made a whole mess by mentioning how her son had hired my mom's niece. She spoke about it with so much arrogance, even tho my mom's niece was more than qualified for the position. My mother's niece was forced to hand in her resignation.

I feel an immense amount of guilt. I feel as though this is all happening because i spoke up. If i had just been quiet and ignored it, none of this would've happened. Worst part is, my mother's niece was using this job to pay off her medical bills. I'm scared she won't find employment anywhere and it's all my fault"
231,1,"I often feel so alone. The thing is I want to be social, I love being around people I know but its so hard for me to make any friends. I want to be able to talk to someone at anytime but It is so hard for me to talk to someone. I am very socially awkward and it seems like I am going against my nature trying to talk with someone. "
232,2,"Okay, so, I‚Äôm an autistic woman, btw, with an anxiety disorder. I stay inside a lot. I‚Äôve no friends in real life. Only on the internet.

I had a friend on an app for almost three years. He missed me when I was gone for a while. He told me I was his favourite person on there & he was mine. He was actually (& still is) one of me favourite people in the world.

His account got suspended & I‚Äôd make loads of posts asking people if they knew what happened before I learnt it was suspended. I hated the fact he was gone & was waiting ages for him to come back. & just felt like yk he wouldn‚Äôt like abandon me.

& he did come back & told me he was looking for me for ages & was so happy when he found one of me posts. Told me he missed seeing me rants & I was delighted bcz I missed him too. & only really enjoyed the app bcz of him. I wanted to leave it loads but didn‚Äôt want to abandon him especially seeing how he didn‚Äôt like when I wasn‚Äôt around.

Ehh so recently he told me he was okay & that life was good like when texting me. Then a day or two later he made a post saying he‚Äôs not slept for three days bcz he‚Äôs monitoring the situation & that he just needs a hug & several years of warmth & darkness. So I texted him apologising for me recent text saying ‚Äúhope you‚Äôve a lovely, lovely day‚Äù & said that seems insensitive of me to say & asked if there‚Äôs anything I could do & how I‚Äôd fight the people bothering him for him. He told me it‚Äôs grand & that I couldnt have known.

He explains some man tried to intimidate him & he got him to go away & threatened him. Kept telling me he was grand. & I told him I‚Äôm glad he did that & how I felt useless (we live in different countries) being all the way where I am unable to help & referenced his post, the one where he said he needs a hug & several years of warmth & darkness. He just kept saying not to worry about him & that he‚Äôs a strong soldier n all.

He told me he‚Äôs always in survival mode & has been since his friend died in his arms when he was teen. I told him I was really sorry to hear that & that he‚Äôs been through so much & that it‚Äôs completely understandable.

I asked if he‚Äôll be getting any rest tonight & what he‚Äôll be up to. He said he‚Äôs going for drinks with his friends. I said i hope his friends take good care of him & that I was gunna go to sleep. He told me he‚Äôs thankful for all me kind messages & that he really appreciates me & that I‚Äôm a good friend. He said he hopes I‚Äôve a good sleep & said you too. & that was that

Then I wake up the next morning & I‚Äôm blocked. & initially I tell meself it‚Äôs okay. He was probably embarrassed? About what he told me? Or regrets it? Like I would deactivate me account loads when I made vulnerable posts on there, so I thought it could be that. & for some reason, I just assumed the block would be temporary. I also wondered well he said he was going out for some for drinks. So he might‚Äôve blocked me accidentally? & meant to block someone else?

It was literally a nightmare come true & an unimaginable thing for me, something I never thought would ever happen never in a million years. & I don understand it.

& of course I‚Äôm hurt bcz the friends I had in school bullied me, then the other ones also bullied me but then stopped for a bit & now don‚Äôt want anything to do with me.

Friendships for me don‚Äôt usually last. & I do feel like people don‚Äôt like me which I hear is common for autistics to feel. Like I don‚Äôt have this strong desire for friends. I feel like I‚Äôd live longer without them bcz then I‚Äôd be hurt less. Just I would prefer not to lose amazing people like that. I really really really really really liked him a lot! I also told him this in our last convo when explaining why I felt awful not being able to help. I‚Äôm aromantic btw so no it‚Äôs not romantic.

Have been in tears for three days & literally going to sleep in tears waking up & remembering & ij tears. & I‚Äôm just confused like I don‚Äôt think he lied about appreciating me. I just don‚Äôt see why he wouldn‚Äôt like at least let me know he doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with me anymore. I wouldn‚Äôt have argued. I mean I understand I‚Äôm not entitled to that. & he doesn‚Äôt have to explain anything to me. I just would like to know what I did wrong? I spoke to someone about this & they said it mightn‚Äôt have ahyhinf to do with me at all.

It‚Äôs really shite lol his bio says he‚Äôs looking for his old friends. & I was one & he found me & now I‚Äôm blocked & I‚Äôm just so upset like. Just never feel good enough to be anyone‚Äôs friend & I do feel disposable. Like I‚Äôm the friend everyone blocks & nobody wants. Did I make him uncomfortable? Probably suffocated him? If he told me to feck off I would have understood. The way he kept telling me not to worry was probably a kinder way of telling me to feck off, I think.

Im so tired of being fat, im not obese but i also dont have an hourglass body, people say that being thin isn't all that but it is, you're treated differently man. Guys dont talk to me they talk to my friend who's so skinny and pretty, me? I have stomach fat, no ass and a chubby face. Guys treat me like shit. I will never find a boyfriend unless I'm skinny. I try to workout regularly just so i can lose this fucking weight and be skinny. I can't anymore I'm so tired of being called fat man, i really am trying to lose weight but it's taking so long I don't know how much longer I'll be able to do this. People say that being skinny isn't everything and that a man who truly Loves you won't care but I don't think that'll happen. No matter how many times people say looks dont matter, they do. Fuck. I wish i was naturally skinny

Edit- thank you to those who understand me meanwhile please stop telling me to be more confident, I know how helpful confidence is and I'm working on it, I just wanted to be heard."
234,2,"So, my ""dad"" cheated on my mom once, hit her so that I can stay home with him and so that she can leave.Then we decided to leave and go to our relatives house. He came there and asked for forgiveness (my relative forced me to send a voice message to call him there). My mom forgave him. 

And then HE CHEATED ON HER AGAIN. He said that they were backup messages from WhatsApp, but the dates told otherwise. 

I don't even think he talks to my mom very well anway. He has arguments about irrelevant things. Relationships are about commitment and love, he has none of those. He just simply sits there, watching porn or probably talking to someone else.

Today: My mental health is slowly declining, I am getting sad at school even though I have friends and I laugh with them, I am having frequent arguments with my mother. When I'm home, half of the time in there, I have thoughts about harming him."

236,3,"I, (F55) have had my current phone # for almost 18 years. The person who has
D the phone before me STILL gives it out as a bogus # for estimates and other junk she apparently doesn't want to receive. I know her full name bc I 1) still get calls from her friends looking for her and 2) when I go into a store and give my phone # (such as Ulta or Best Buy) her name comes up and they think I'm her. I know where she lives(because of all the estimates she requests for her house) and I have tracked down her current phone #. I texted her to please stop giving out her old #, MY #, as a burner # bc I'm tired of getting text messages for her - generally twice a month on average but lately it is a couple times a week. I know it doesn't sound like much to be irritated about, but my husband has health issues and everytime my phone dings, it's important for something to brace myself for in getting news. Not looking for a solution or to change my # due to the amount of work that would be. Just irritated AF and wish she would STOP. "
237,2,"My (18F) boyfriend (19M) of two years has been treating me like shit recently. he constantly is ignoring me for his friends and videogames. He has especially been not talking to me for hours on end and the only thing he has to say for it is 'Sorry' no explanation, every time we're together he falls asleep and gets grumpy If I ask him to be present with me, he can't go for 10 minutes without scrolling on Instagram reels and when I ask him to just sit and enjoy time with me, he says he can't because he has ADHD. He cant handle how emotional I get. (which, might I add, is me texting him multiple times asking if he's okay bc he hasn't messaged in 12 hours. (and I cry when I'm really lonely bc I have really bad separation anxiety thanks to PANS.) he says I'm too much to handle sometimes so he needs space, but he never knows what to say when I'm upset or I bring up an issue so I end up panicking. and every time I try to approach an issue with respect and understanding, he always treats it like my goal is to tear down his whole lifestyle. he has put in a little effort, into things that we almost broke up over, but i don't understand why he acts out like this. our main argument is that I'll occasionally point out that a friend of mine as a very affectionate boyfriend, and that he hugs her and is in contact with her in public, which I love and would love if my boyfriend did more, but he always shuts it down as if I asked him to sacrifice his firstborn. i really love this man. he makes my life better than I've ever known, but he's really fucking stubborn and so every time I have an issue with him he gets pissed off. 

just looking for some support. idk what I can to to make him realize how he's treating me makes me feel so useless and unwanted, because I can see the effort he IS putting in, even though its not enough. (I may have to mention that I don't have friends I can chat to while he's busy or ignoring me, so Im completely isolated, and he knows I'm alone and get lonely.)

TL;DR My boyfriend does the things that make me feel the most alone and isolated, but even though I see some effort to change that from him, its not enough, and not the right things.

238,3,hiii so i was looking for ways to relieve my anger and i think that cutting myself is the best bet! the problem is that whenever i search up guides on how to cut myself without bleeding out and dying the only thing search engines give is the stupid fucking suicide hotline. i dont NEED the hotline i DONT want to die. i just want to cope and instant relief like is that so hard ugh. give me recs on what tool/method is best to cut yourself with and if i should cut horizontally or vertically for less blood (for cleanup. and not dying). ok thanks :p
239,1,"I always thought myself as a good person, I try my best to always be there when someone needs me, buy lately I have been thinking I am not a good person and I truly deserve all the bad luck and vibes that keep coming my way. 
When it comes to friends, I am that person whom is always there, if you need to vent, need a hand, a shoulder to cry on, a shopping buddy, etc. I have been going through some hard times, been taking hit after hit, when I sat and looked around to my friends, none came, none answered, and I realized quickly I have no friends. My family is the same. My siblings don't talk to me unless they need something, and my in laws, they straight up ignore me, one of them told me it was amazing that I had cancer.. 
I am just so heart broken and clearly shit since no one wants to be around me. I feel like I have wasted most of my life trying to be friends with people that never wanted to be mine. I would give my last dollar to someone if they needed me and I can't even get a reply. 

Part of my wants to just give up, but we all know, no one would find my body all the windows were blacked out by flies, yeah.. right.. even then..

240,1,"My gf (21) and I (19) had been dating for 8 months before she sent me a breakup text a few hours ago. We'd been having a range of issues, including the fact that we'd turn into an LDR since I'm planning on moving -11h away pretty soon.

But I feel like a lot of issues wouldn't have happened if I simply treated her text-self the way I treated her IRL-self, we got to meet only a few times but whenever we did, I felt so connected and so much in love with her.

But looking back, I think there was some form of disconnection on my behalf from her when we texted, like I think no matter what, I was rarely able to show strong emotions and wasn't able to react with as much as empathy as I should've when she raised any issues. It felt like there existed an invisible barrier between our online selves and I really don't understand why. 

I know I love her and all because seeing/meeting her gave me some unparallled sense of joy. Was it the fact that I couldn't see her face? Smell her? Feel her? Experience her existence within my vicinity? I don't know.  
  
Perhaps it's a compelling justification in favour of having the rl ended before it moved into an LDR, or maybe this would've worked out if I had somehow learnt to cross that bridge that made me distant from her text-self?"
241,1,"Soo basically I just wanted to check up on an influencer I used to follow on YT , named @fromlumi just for fun and all . 


She helped me through a hard time as I used to weight about 76 kg while being only 160 centimeters short ! 

I have eventually lost the fat and held it consistent for  about a year and a half , embracing my short and not so skinny but healthy looking body (: .


My comfort influencer @fromlumi though didn't. 

The reason I connected to her was mostly because of my tighs , with mine being even at healthy about 55 cm which is nowhere near model but lumi just was / is so pretty that I said fuck them tighs , healthy all the way ! 

Now I was obviously shocked because the last time I have seen her , she was advocating for muscle build and a healthy life style and now she is doing shorts about losing eight kilograms , mind you she was mostly muscle mass so I don't even understand what she is trying to achieve . 

I think I finally understood when I scrolled further , found out she had broken up with someobody and did korean ""unrecognisable"" make up .


All lumi wants now is to fit in it seems , which is sad because from my experience there are things you can't or rather shouldn't change . 


Also she is kinda in an on - off with her body , in some shorts praising her muscle and in the others suddenly wanting to lose almost 10 kg /: 


I know , I know . 


Influencers aren't your friends , why do you even care so much ? 


Because she was my role model , seeing her struggle like that makes it feel weird that she was part of the reason I found happiness with my life. 


It's just sad because she is the perfect example of how an environment can change you to arguably the worse . 


I just hope she finds happiness! "
242,1,"I would love to be with someone. To go out on dates, to watch movies, to have that connection. I am sick of being single, of feeling unwanted, because I won't put out.

I used to be really insecure, being the DUFF of my friendgroup and all. When I was 16 (I'm 18 now) | became friends with this guy who seemed interested in me, it was exciting but confusing. I didn't understand why he wanted me, but I just liked that he did, so I kind of ignored all the red flags. A couple months down the road we were hanging out and he brought me to a 'cool place' in the park. He kissed me, and I kissed him back (it was my first kiss), but after a minute I stopped. I told him I didn't want to do anything else, but he didnt care. He forced me to the ground and made me have sex with him.

I've been really uncomfortable with intimacy since, with any touch really. And l've never met anyone willing to try be with someone who won't sleep with them, or kiss them. I understand people have needs, but it's not like I'll never be okay with touch, I just need some time to get used to it again. But it doesn't seem like it's going to happen.

This is just a random vent since I can't talk to my friends about it. Thanks for reading if you did."
243,1,"Over the last year I broke up with my partner of 14 months (who had also been my friend of 5 years). I moved to sixth form then college then dropped out of college to join another in september 2025. I attempted. I moved house. I got a computer, so my primary interests changed. I spend every day of the week out, whether that be because I'm working or because I'm forcing myself to socialise because if i sit still for too long the thoughts get to loud (i finished this college in may). I've become far more independent, taken control of my own finances, healthcare and education

I lost my pet fish of 10 years today. When I was at my absolute worst in December/January/February, I would sit next to his tank and just talk to him. And he's gone now.

This time last year I had my fish, I was in my old house, my main interests were entirely different, my friend groups were entirely different, I didn't have a job. I was on summer break after gcses and spent most days sleeping at my ex's, with one day a week spent hanging around with friends.

I love my new house and I like having a computer, my ex showed her true colours - breaking up was the best thing she ever did for me - and I can't wait to start again in September. But at the same time I feel a major loss, because I'm just so... different. I don't recognise myself. And I miss my fish really bad. "
244,2,"For the most part I am very confident in myself. My job, my education and my personality. Except I grew up as a hairy brown girl, I have always been kind of pudgy and I am extremely insecure about my appearance, even though my body is probably as good as it‚Äôs gonna get as a young woman in her 20s. I got really bad cystic acne during quarantine which has since healed but has left me with lots of acne scars on both of my cheeks. I am really insecure about this. I feel like I‚Äôm putting stress on my relationship with my girlfriend because I am so insecure. We are in a happy and healthy relationship and have great communication..mostly. Every time I get triggered (ie. she interacts with or brings up a woman who I have deemed is prettier than me physically) I feel like I just shut down. I do my best to talk to her about it, and she is wonderful and reassuring and responsive. But it is just so difficult for me to do. I feel like I become distant and it takes me an hour or two to text her back because once my feelings are hurt, I don‚Äôt feel like talking to her anymore even though she did nothing wrong. I recently found out what her ex girlfriend looks like (she didn‚Äôt show me of course, I just went digging for something I knew would hurt me) and I am VERY upset at myself and just in general. I feel like I am too insecure in myself/my looks/my body to be a good partner. She hadn‚Äôt said anything, but I just feel so guilty when I tell her I just need a bit of space because I am sad about the way I look. And I feel even worse when she tries to tell me I‚Äôm beautiful and she loves me and it just doesn‚Äôt make me feel better. I want to be with her. I want to marry her. I just don‚Äôt know how to improve my self image. My parents always doted on my younger sister. She was really sick as a child so most of the attention went to her. I was mostly recognized for being studious, shy, and good in school. Never really for being pretty or cute or beautiful. My sister is also a lighter complexion than me. I got bullied in school and online for ‚Äúlooking like a monkey‚Äù for being hairy and having a unibrow. I was told as a child that I laughed too much and my father was emotionally and physically abusive towards me for the duration of middle-high school (ie. Puberty years). My family is not overly affectionate at all and I feel like all of these variables have led me to have extremely low self esteem despite me being pretty efficient in social situations and the like. I am still friendly and I like to meet new people but now that I have found someone I really love, my deepest insecurities are coming out. I am afraid of losing her to someone more beautiful. I am even more afraid of losing her by unintentionally pushing her away. I am devastated. I don‚Äôt know how to lift my own spirits. I wish I could be more confident in my looks but I don‚Äôt really know how.

EDIT: Thank you for the helpful and reassuring replies everyone. I spoke to my girlfriend about it and put everything out on the table. I explained all my irrational insecurities and told her about my fear of pushing her away or losing her. She was lovely to me about it all (as usual) and we are both looking into starting therapy separately to work through the traumas that are coming up in our relationship :) I just posted here to vent, but the responses have definitely confirmed my own suspicions about perhaps needing therapy/having anxiety. Not a diagnosis of course, but something to look into. Have a great day everyone :) "
245,3,"I just came here to vent clearly I work at a hybrid job and what originally lured me in was in the interview they were talking about how flexible the hours were. However, whenever I ask for the slightest adjustment in hours or schedule I feel immediately denied where as managers and superiors can change their schedule and other people can etc. I am actually terrified to use PTO on certain days because I don‚Äôt want to be guilted by management. I just hate jobs that expect you to be 100 flexible and on call but won‚Äôt budge when you ask for one thing. "

247,2,"As I said, I'll have my birthday tomorrow. But Instead of being happy or ecxited, I'm feeling as if I might get a panic attack. It's as if i don't even want my birthday to come. Maybe it's because always something bad happens between my parents every birthday. Maybe it's also because I've lost all my friends this year because they kicked me out of the group. I just feel like I'll see my reality this time. How no one will remember me, how no one will wish me. How it would be the utter opposite of last year. My bf is the only one who's excited for me and has prepared a lot but he also got in trouble today with his parents for his gifts he prepared because they didn't like how he was ""wasting"" his time preparing gifts instead of studying. I don't even know if he'll be able to make it tomorrow to celebrate my birthday with me because of this and obv I'll have to call off the celebration because he's the only one I can invite. I haven't had the nicest childhood but I earned a place through hard work (within myself and my education) to end up with a ""good"" set of friends who were also hard working, only to end up failing in multiple things I was set out to do within my area of education and being ditched by them (for no reason because they didn't even know that i didn't qualify the exam I was preparing for). I have cut off toxic ones and left behind the ones who exited themselves out of my life on their own. But now I'm left with no one. No one except my bf ofc but i also want true friendship. So I'm scared to except that in some sense I've lost all of what I had ever earned. I don't want my birthday to come but only 25 more minutes are left. "
248,0,"Hello! I've thought about this for some time and after stumbling upon my old classmates on Facebook, I thought of how long its been since we last spoke. For context: I knew them since year 3 and by year 5 me and my family moved countries. I kept in touch with around 4 of them. We hang out and texted back then all the time. We all kept in contact, I did especially with one of the girls, until 2020 or just before. We didn't have any arguments, just that I didn't have the money to come visit them ever since I left and naturally our conversation ended with us being so busy with school.

I understand that we were like 13 when we last spoke, meaning that they could be completely different people now. From their posts it looks like they still continue to hang out together. I wish I was there with them until now. But moving countries was not my choice at 10 years old.

I'd like to hear all your opinions."
249,2,"So after some investigation I found out my old pc's case fan is near death and probably need to be replaced, and I asked my dad for confirmation since he knows more about techs than me, and he agrees with me.

Everything seems fine until I said that I want to buy a new one(with my own money) and asked him for help.

Suddenly he goes a tantrum about how no one ever replaces fans in their pc, how his own pc fan is acting weird as well, worst of all he said that pc fans are wielded in and requires wielding tools to replace WHICH HE KNOWS IS A LIE(I can tell just from his face and common sense).

It's not even that he wants to me man up to do it myself(he did so in the past) or some shit, he offers to help transfer the data on my HDD to a new SSD(which is more expensive than a fan btw so it's not about the money).

Like I don't get it, he's a very good dad to me but sometimes he goes on this tantrum for no reasons!"
250,3,"Hello, everyone. This is my first time posting here. I'd like to open-up about my grievances regarding my townspeople. Please bear with me.

I live in an average middle-class town, the type of town where almost everyone knows everyone. My mother is the head nurse of our town and she's well-known because not only is she professionally smart, but she's also helped many many people in the past.

Now, here's the thing.

Just like many of my other fellow Gen Zs, I formed the habit of complaining online to release my negative feelings. But this is where the problems arise.

You see, due to my mom's status as somewhat of a local celebrity, I inevitably get some of the townspeople's attention. Whenever I post any frustrations, no matter how small, like ""OMG my grandparents are so annoying üòÆ‚Äçüí®"" or ""My professor was so mean today üò£"" or ""The weather is so fucking HOT! üò© üò´ üî• ‚òÄÔ∏è"", some of the people from my town would immediately message my mom on Facebook messenger. They'd immediately start asking shit like ""Ms. OP's mom, why is your son (I'm male, btw) posting this or that? ü§î"" ""Why is your son complaining about his life? ü§î"" etc. They'd start trying to violate my free speech & privacy, trying to pry into my past to inquire as to why I feel the way I do.

Meanwhile, some of the other people my age (my former classmates from Elementary School & High-school, my batch mates in collegez etc.) are literally posting thirst traps, pictures of them drinking & smoking with their middle fingers üñï out, and so on. Maybe the occasional online/cyber bullying every now and then. But these same townspeople never DM their parents about it.

""Oh, Mr./Mrs. De La Cruz why is your daughter posting her beach pictures with her ass sticking-out? Shouldn't she know that such a young lady should be modest?""

""Oh, Mr./Mrs. Sanchez, have you seen your son's latest gym pics? He's showing-off his muscles so much he's practically naked. He should have more decency!""

NO. Nothing like that at all.

Yet the moment I even do so much as complain about the weather, they start snitching on me to my mom about my ""negative behavior"".

The thing with my town is that it's relatively peaceful. Crime rates are low, poverty rates are low, etc. Peaceful, but boring. There's no tourist attractions or anything to keep people busy, stimulated & entertained so they try to create their own drama by violating & vexing the lives of others. I know this to be all but factual because one time, there were rumors of a terrorist/rebel group roaming the wooded areas of my town. It was all over my town's Facebook. During that time, no matter how much I lamented about my issues, no one messaged my mom. Yet when the news died down, they resumed harassing me from the shadows.

They're just so cowardly because none of them would dare to confront me about it. No one wants to speak to me directly about how they feel. They go behind my back and DM my mom about it instead of messaging me or confronting me in real life. They just wanna create drama at the expense of hurting other people's feelings.

I know they're judgemental & picky as well because they only acknowledge my posts when they're ""negative"" but when I post good things like, me eating-out with friends, posting new beginnings, sharing positive experiences I experienced at my university, etc., no one messages my mom about it.

""Oh Ms. OP's mom, I saw your son go-out with his friends! The food looked so GOOD tell him we're happy for him!""

""Oh OP's mom we heard your son now has a new baby sister (my dad, separated from my mom, had a new baby with my stepmother). We are so happy for him and we wish the baby all the blessings in the world!""

None of that. They only ever acknowledge me when they have something to nitpick but never when something good happens in my life.

They're also hypocritical because let me tell you something. Here in The Philippines (I'm Filipino, btw) people love to gossip about others' lives but when they're the ones on the receiving end of gossip, rumor-spreading and crap talks, they're quick to anger.

They love doing hurtful and damaging things unless it's happening to them.

I mean, take a look at bigger communities like manila city, quezon city, makati, etc. here in The Philippines. Those places are huge, with a huge population. When people in those towns vent on social media no one cares because everyone's busy in their respective lives. But in my small boring town, they can have all the time in the world to gossip and talk shit.

Another thing that vexes me is the fact that they're not really concerned. A truly concerned person would approach and say things like ""I'll always be here for you, I'm your friend. If you need or want anything, you can talk to me."" but NOOOOO. These people just wanna talk crap about me from the shadows.

I just feel so violated and oppressed because other people my age can post whatever the heck they want. Smoking, drinking, driving their motorcycles loudly, thirst traps, vulgarian posts, couple pics with their tongues shoved down each other's throats and so on yet the moment I even do so much as sigh on social media people rip me apart from the shadows.

I just wanna be able to do what others can, man."
251,2,"(i might have used the wrong tag lol sorry) im 21, and a few years ago i found out i was intersex. ive always known something was different about me, and ive always had gender dysphoria, so learning this was very‚Ä¶ satisfying? its like oh- i finally know what im the way the at i am. people always thought i was just a boy when i was younger. now i present more androgynous like, but deep down i really want to be a girly girl. im really nervous about how my friends and family and ppl that know me will react when my voice and mannerisms change suddenly. i also struggle knowing what parts i want to have down there. im thinking about making a gofundme so i can afford a surgery for it, but im shy and scared for everyone to know about my condition. i feel alone about this a lot so if anyone wants to talk that would be cool"
252,1,"am i in the wrong for owning ""toys"" that i paid for and hid in my room while living in my parents house. they would not had have known about that stuff if i was never pressured and told to get shelves for my room btw. just pisses me the fuck off that i get treated like im still a child even though ill be 21 in a couple months. I feel like there doing this to make a point that I still love in their house. I'm still under their rolls, and that, oh, if you want to be a failure in this house, this is how we're gonna treat you. I'm the only one that hasn't succeeded in college( my brother has never been to college, so I can't really count them into this discussion, but my younger sister, she's in college, and she's doing well and they always comparing me to her saying, oh, aren't you in college like her, why aren't you doing this or that?) and I'm the only 1 that doesn't drive( i don't have my license yet. That's really it.). That's a point number one. Am I overreacting for filling this way? Feeling like I shouldn't be treated like. I'm a literal child when I'm going to be old. Enough to drink in less than 2 months, and it's not like I'm going out being a w****, or anything. Getting stds and getting sick. All i'm doing is masturbating, maybe a couple times a week, but to be honest, they've always had an issue with me. Doom, anything so that god honestly might be the issue.Why they have an issue with me?Doing this. I don't know anymore. I kind of want to die or just move out.I just don't want to be in this situation dealing with this crap.
But also I feel like I've lost the plot to my life in the last a couple of years. So I'm not sure if that's contributing to this,yeah."
253,1,"Im  just so sad and idk I'm crying rn I'm sorry this is so corny but thank you to whoever reads and thank you so much to anybody who comments and just let's me know somebody else is listening bc I just want somebody and I don't have anybody

Both of my parents give me very high dose drugs, like edibles shrooms and benzos. These things are always either adult doses of medication or 700+ mgs as of current. I'm in 10th grade. 

I appreciate all that stuff kinda, but I really want parents who care about me and love me and stuff. I know I'm whining and complaining and being stupid so I'm sorry I just need to talk about how I feel.

Today was the last day of school and all the seniors graduated. I hate school usually, bc my school is like an alternative school for people with emotional problems. I go bc of psychosis which I manage now.

I hate this school sm and they're saying I can't even come back to public until 12th which wouldn't make sense bc one more year. I was literally in honors at the start of high school and I even worked my way back up to honors in 10th. I have As and am on honor roll and Ive worked so hard to become stable and they're js gonna keep me in a place of misery. I was a good kid all year. We're gonna try begging public school to just accept me but it prob won't happen. 

I had such a bright future and I messed it up by going to the mental hospital in 9th. This school is pretty nice compared to other alternative schools and I'm in honors classes but still. I feel like a cheater and I went insane this year bc no work and I can't even say anything I learned. Colleges will see my public school but that still doesn't make me any less of a cheater and still doesn't change the fact that I've limited my future and myself. 

And today being the last day, that means that I won't have anybody for 2 and a half months. I have 2 friends. Both have no car or license and don't wanna hang out frequently. I have a grandfather with dementia who I try to talk to. That's it.

I'm crying so hard bc it's just gonna be me and my little pile of drugs that my parents give me to substitute for love and affection. I'm just gonna drug myself to oblivion and study. That's literally all I can do bc I tried to get a job but nobody's hiring and I have no transportation. 

I feel like such a loser and I am. I'm literally a psychotic loser who will fail no matter how hard she tries bc nobody believes in me. I genuinely js wanna be a normal kid with a normal life but I never will be. 

Am I just hard to love? I've always gotten good grades and been nice to ppl and donated to charity and stuff. My parents loved me so much more before my mental issues. And as I typed that I realize that it's def my fault they stopped loving me. If I wasn't depressed or hallucinating or anxious I bet you they'd love me and they wouldn't have gotten divorced. My horrible lonely life that came from my horrible lonely childhood is just entirely my fault and idk how to even get myself out of it. When is life gonna be worth living again.

There's a lot of bigger issues in the world right now so I shouldn't be complaining and I feel guilty about it, but thank you for reading this anyway. It feels a little better talking to myself here than js sitting there and crying. I really appreciate you  listening to my crying ranting and dumb self pity about situations I got myself into lmao

256,1,"This is gonna sound so corny bc I'm a teen and I shouldn't care about this  but you know I'm gonna talk about it anyway.

I'm in 10th grade and my dad has been giving me a stream of drugs, like benzodiazepines, high dose edibles, carts and shrooms since last year in December of 9th grade. 

He doesn't really talk to me much other than about drugs and encouraging things like sneaking out and doing bad stuff at school, and other illegal or ugly activities. I don't listen to him, and I don't live with him anymore.

He mainly buys me edibles, because that's my standard thing of choice. These edibles are always at least 400 mgs, and for the past few months they've been 700+ or even 1000+.

I do it mainly because it helps with my chronic anxiety, depression, and it calms me down with psychosis. I couldn't function before it and I was letting my mental illness control me. I failed classes, never went to school, and was rude to authority.

I went to a new school after starting, and Im currently in a club and I want to join more next year including a sport which I've never been able to do including in childhood bc of mental illness but always wanted to do. I have As and 2 Bs, and I've been on the honor roll all year. I'm involved in my club, and my teachers all speak highly of me. And on top of that I have friends.

I lived with my dad for 2 months in 9th grade where I just stayed high 24/7 which I still do but less. It was a hoarder situation, I was currently being evaluated at a program for psychosis, and I only got 1 meal a day. And there was no food that wasn't expired. I could've done something like tried to clean my house up, but I didn't because I was too depressed and lazy, so that part is on me.  
I didn't really make any messes but still. I did try to clean one time, but I found it all messed up the next day.

I miss when he used to care about me, and ask about me as a kid. I miss how he used to know who I was and what I liked. I miss when he cared about my future. Like what have I done that's so bad that you just give up on me?? My dad 10 years ago would've never given me drugs or never bought food. 

I was a good kid, who was on a good path. I graduated elementary with awards and middle school with honors and went into high school in honors. I'm trying to get myself back onto a good path after destroying everything, but it's hard when I don't really have any reliable parents.

I feel like a loser for having these feelings. All of my friends tell me how lucky I am, but I don't feel lucky. I wish he would just give me a hug and tell me he loved me and that he was sorry for everything, but I get drugs instead. I should just not complain, which I don't, but yeah."
257,1,"Every friend I've made recently online thinks im a pedophile so they block me, i can't make friends in real life either because i dont go to school. Everyone assumes im a pedophile as soon as they hear how deep my voice is, i feel so lonely."
258,3,"On April 19 l was rear ended at about 45-50mph while stationary. This caused me to hit the vehicle in front of me. No airbags deployed and I had my seatbelt on. I initially felt ok but the pain worsened over a few hours.
Went to the ER- they didn't take me seriously at all even though I had terrible neck and head pain. Discharged me after 45 mins after they concluded i didn't have broken ribs??

Went back to the ER the next day because I didn't know my address I was so confused. I was diagnosed with whiplash/neck injury and concussion. (I face planted into my steering wheel)

Now, it has been about 8 weeks since my injury. I've done 13 sessions of PT (stretching, manual therapy, etc) I have also used my TENS unit, heat, and medications.
-tizanidine (didn't really work)
-cyclobenzaprine (didn't work)
-methocarbomol (didn't work)
-tramadol (somewhat works)
-lidocaine gel/ tiger rub
-trigger point injections in traps on 06/11
(didn't work at all)

I also had a cervical MRI that was normal and a neck x ray that was normal. Unfortunately, I still feel awful. Daily tension headaches that result in nausea, dizziness, light sensitivity, pain all around my jaw and head, and decreased appetite. I also have severe pain in my traps (they're hard as a rock), neck, and upper back. 

I'm seeing PT still and seeing pain management. I work as a medical assistant in a very busy primary care clinic, working 10 hours a day. Sitting at a desk is difficult.

I guess I'm just curious how long it takes to have this heal and if I'm missing any treatment options. I do have a lawyer, and this injury caused me to miss 3 weeks of work. I'm just still struggling with day to day life. If anyone can relate?

I was folding the dry laundry and hanging the wet. I had locked the door because my social battery was running really low and she was sick and wasn't allowed to smoke (we still live at our mom's for different reasons). She knocked at the door and I opened it. She immediately asked if I'm really locking the door and got defensive about her telling our mother she's ""too sick"" to walk the dog and then wanting to smoke. I hadn't had the energy to argue so I went to my room and slammed the door shut. (Was it good? No. Nothing broke or got damaged.) My sister then screamed that I'm stupid and shouldn't slam the door. I yelled ""Pech"" wich means something like tough luck. She then called me a ""b3hind3rt3 autistische F0tz3"" wich translates to disabled (degratory) autistic cu*t. I put on my headphones to blend her out. I'm not autistic, but I'm disabled. I've also always been the weird kid and she has made fun of me, my friends, and my hobbies before. She's now not talking to me and ignoring me completely. I've tried to talk to her multiple times and explain that I'm hurt by it and why and also hear her side. She doesn't acknowledge me and acts like I'm not here. I'm a very harmony-needy person and all my attempts at making peace were ignored. I'm getting worse with each day and she seems to either not notice or not care. My mother doesn't know how to discipline/punish her (she's not a fan of punishment and prefers natural consequences but that's not really working here). She has threatened to cut contact to my mom and move together with her boyfriend once she's 18 before for worrying about her boyfriend's influence on her. Now she threatens to do it again if my mother brings up our fight and asks/talks to her about it. 
I honestly don't know what to do or how to protect me and my mental health. It's a stressful time for me anyway and I feel like the silent treatment of her is making everything worse. 
I've had to say goodbye to one of my best friends (she's moving to another continent and she's always been a safe space for me), I've lost my friend group beginning this year and still haven't found a new one. I have my last and hardest exam tomorrow. It's also having a negative impact on my social life because I have less energy and my mental health is getting worse. My boyfriend is trying to support me but I feel like the situation is straining our relationship a bit.

260,2,"I see so many videos and posts about people dressing up for their city's pride parade, and I genuinely love to see the shirts, accessories, makeup, all of it beautiful outfits but then I have to remember my parents would never let me attend one, I'm aroace and I had come out to my parents already my mother laughed at me in the face when I explained it to her and my father well idk he just tolerates it (sort of...?) but both don't like when I get ""too invested"" in anything lgbt related.

My city's very small so that would be impossible to do, I can't be myself when I'm with them, never could, and now that I'm a young adult this is so embarrassing, ""but you have free will?"", brother in Christ my parents are overprotective as hell and judgemental whenever I fall off from their perfect perceived version of me, I don't have a voice and I will never have when I'm with them, at least I'm moving to a different state entirely that actually brings me happiness :')"

Do you know what I mean?

Like, discourse about ""double standards"" ""skewed ratios"" ""80/20 rule"" ""age gap"" ""pick mes"" ""ghosting"", whatever!

I notice that people still grasp onto the idea that dating and relationships have to be like... I don't know, painless? 

Have these people never heard of the saying ""all's fair in love and war""? Have we not lived long enough and experienced enough bullshit heartbreak to know that NOTHING about dating ever makes total sense or is fair???

Someone explain it to me, please.

262,2,"I WROTE THE BELOW ON MY NOTES APP EARLIER TODAY IN A TOTAL FRENZY. IM PASTING EXACTLY WHAT I SAID AS ITS WHAT I FELT WHEN I WAS IN THAT FRENZY:

‚ÄúBasically, the last 72 hours I‚Äôm going fucking mental. I can‚Äôt focus on work I can‚Äôt focus on fun things, I get nothing done. I‚Äôm going bat shit crazy about my appearance. I‚Äôm getting nervous about the future and it‚Äôs slightly feels like I‚Äôm about to have a nervous breakdown. I thought I made so much progress with therapy and I thought I had finally fixed my worries about my looks with my hair transplant but in fact it‚Äôs only getting worse and worse and worse and worse. I obsessively wash my hair I obsessively wash my hands I obsessively make sure all my hair are in the right place. I obsessively iron all my clothes and I just feel disgusting.

Sometimes my hair loss bothers me so much I just wanna chop my head off. 

I think it‚Äôs more than just hair loss. I just fucking despise my body. I feel fucking fucking gross. My surroundings makes me feel gross. Even though they are objectively nice. I miss how I used to look when I was in my late teens. I just fucking can‚Äôt take feeling this gross about myself any longer. 

I want my life to just be empty of this shit. And it fucking pollutes my brain like dogshit.‚Äù"
263,1,"I dated this one guy a year and a month ago. We were perfect and i did so much for him honestly. I was good for him. We broke it off because ‚Äúhe wasnt ready for a relationship.‚Äù We were friends with benefits for a while, but it felt like he would only text me when he wanted something, and also hed get mad if he saw evidence of me moving on. We stopped talking and 3 months later he reached out saying he was sorry and he loved me. I didnt say it back yet, but We talked as friends or maybe working up to something? for a while. He heard me talking to another guy and got mad even when I explained the other guy and me couldnt be together. I sent him a happy birthday after a month, 2 months after that he called me to ask if i ever got the house me and my mom looked at when me and him were dating a year agoüò≠ like no? Houses dont stay up for sale for 8 months. He said that was all he wanted and hung up. He reached out to me 3 months after that on fortnite, and we played for 10 minutes, in awkward silence and dry small talk until he said ‚Äúhe was gonna go call his girlfriend‚Äù and i said ‚Äúokay.‚Äù and got off. He invited me to a fortnite party 4 times 2 months later but i didnt answer. He texted me ‚Äúhey‚Äù , after a month, (2 weeks ago) and was really nice and flirty for about a day until the next morning asked me what i was doing and when i answered and asked him what he was doing as well, he completely ghosted me. Itd been 4 days, I was on fortnite the same time as him so he could invite me to a party and apologize just incase hed gotten his phone taken or something, but he didnt. I decided to move on and block him on everything. Im not sure if hes texted since, but when I got on fortnite a few days ago he invited me to a party again, and he didnt answer. "
264,2,"  ***About the trigger warning, I don't have any eating disorders, however I will be mentioning them.***


  So for some context, I used to be 140lbs. I then had 2 babies, jumping up to 275lbs, when I decided to take my health back. This was back in 2020. I cut out a lot of the junk, added extra protein and more veggies, and lost 150lbs. I was down to 125lbs. I felt great, but a bit self conscious about all the loose skin. 
  
  During this time my SIL and MIL were constantly checking up on me, asking ""did you eat today"" or saying ""you need to stop what you're doing you're going to fade away"", among other things. I've always just laughed it off, why start a fight you know? (They're the kinds of people who are ALWAYS correct, no matter what.) 

  In 2023 I decided to start weight training to try to put on some muscle, and hopefully deal with some of the loose skin I was still carrying. 

  The comments haven't stopped, I get asked ""are you anorexic or something?"" ""Oh come on why not have another cookie maybe it will help you look healthy again"" etc. 

  My SIL just had fat loss surgery, where they removed most of her stomach because she's 400lbs and can't lose weight. She refuses to follow doctors orders and isn't following the plan they set up for her. She isn't losing weight the way the surgery intended. For this reason, she's even more inclined to believe I ""cheated"" my weight loss by not eating. 

  I have a fitness app that tracks my calories, and I never go under 1800 calories in the day. 

  Recently I've gone back up to 150 lbs. Until yesterday I was proud of it! I've been putting on muscle and I was feeling amazing in my body. Until she mentioned how I was starting to look ""healthier"" again, and showed me 2 photos of myself, back when I was 125 lbs and one now. My tummy is sticking out a bit more again, and even though I know muscle is more dense and definitely one of the reasons for my wieght gain, my self confidence dropped like a bowling ball off a skyscraper. 

  Today I measured my body and all the measurements were half an inch - 2 inches larger than the last time I measured. I put on a pair of shorts from last year and my thighs felt tighter then the last time I wore them. I can't get her words out of my head. Somehow overnight my view of myself changed, and instead of the strong woman I saw myself as yesterday, today when I look in the mirror I see the woman who just had babies and weighed in at 275 lbs. 

  So, that's it. I just needed a place to say all this, and anonymously online is easiest I guess. 

"
265,2,"From the two posts, I posted before, there is an underlying issue going on with me.

The dangerous addiction, titled doomscrolling, has rooted into my system and coupled with my tendency of overthinking to the extreme has resulted in the ""no hope for the future and humanity"" mentality, that kept cycling around like vultures.

I made some steps, like deactivating Twitter, which was the main cause for my mental health spiraling down. But it keeps coming back. (Not twitter.)

Is there a way to combat it effectively?"
266,1,"Hey y‚Äôall,

My gf and I (both 22) recently adopted a cat. Her name was Lola. We adopted her only about 2 months ago. We bought her all kinds of fancy toys and gave her so much love and attention. We had just taken her to her first vet appointment. 

I‚Äôm posting here because a few days ago we came home to Lola hanging from the blinds. It was really traumatic. I had to clean up the mess she made while trying to escape. And I had to bury her. I didn‚Äôt even own a shovel since we live in an apartment so I had to go buy one. It was one of the worst things I‚Äôve ever had to do.

We had only left for the weekend and thought we had made sure everything was safe for her. I feel so guilty. That cat relied on us, and I feel like I failed her. She was so sweet. She deserved all of the love in the world and now I‚Äôll never get to give it to her. 

Anyways, I sorta took yesterday off or at least worked less from home anyways. Mostly just cause I couldn‚Äôt focus. My gf and I have both been really upset the past few days. We‚Äôve tried to be there for each other some and that‚Äôs helped, but only so much. I can‚Äôt do anything without thinking about how awful it was and how she‚Äôs gone. I‚Äôve been having nightmares as well. I feel like a horrible person."
267,3,"I was sent to the store out of the car after just waking up and waa told by mom to get Chef or Ceasar salad cause she doesn't eat pork. She said it once after I had barely woken up and sent me into the store quickly.

I walk in find the salads, I don't see any Ceasar but I see a bunch of chef, so instead of buying 2 of each,  I bought 4 chef.

When I get home she looks for the salads and starts yelling at me for not buying the right SALAD, LIKE ITS THE END OF THE FUCKING WORLD. Turns out she said southwest, but since ID JUST FUCKING WOKE UP I misheard her, and then she goes on a rant about how I, ""Only bought shit for myself"", when I deliberately bought 4 with the intention of not eating one.

She yelled at me and was crashing out over some fucking salads bro."
268,1,"I have one of the worst lives imaginable. I have bad genes, I'm ugly, I have no real friends, I'm poor, and have a bad and distant family. I struggle to relate to others, because nobody seems to have it as bad as I do. I just hate everything. My life is nothing but agonizing darkness and misery, and it seems like nobody really cares. I suffer in silence for the most part.

It feels like the world and the universe as a whole is intentionally making my life a living hell just to toy with me or something. I feel like I'm going to go insane one day from how shit my life is, or maybe I already have. Therapists and meds don't even do anything for me because my problems are pretty much all external, and any internal problems I may have are a result of my external issues.

270,3,"needless to say im livid.

was with my ex for 3 months when i noticed he had randomly added a new girl everywhere. he always went on and on about how loyal he was, offered me his locations and asked for permissions to post stuff and lovebombed me. he also said he had no female friends

i stalked the girls tiktok reposts and one repost was ""when u know ur the prettiest girl he's ever been with"".

i casually asked him (didn't accuse) and he said his best friend was fooling around with the girl and casually flirting, but couldn't add her on socials because then his gf would see, so he asked me ex to add her so he could msg her on his phone

I believe this (i know) but later on reveal that it made me uncomf and my ex removed her everywhere.

we have two arguments over the coming weeks, and one big fight because i got drunk with my friends and they dragged me to a gay club. i vomited and got home, but because i was so disoritented i didn't send snaps or drunk text, just updated him on where i was going. he was deeply upset and so upset he vomited, and believed i cheated.

we eventually reconciled but we were never the same. he added the girl back and broke up with me over text two weeks later and blocked me, he told me he was faithful the whole time, but he needed to start grinding

now yesterday i see he's on holiday with her, after he told me he broke up with me to ""grind"". he posted a photo of her on his story and i don't know how to feel

i cant help but wonder if he was telling the truth in January and because he thought i cheated and he's trying to get revenge, or he genuinely was cheating the entire time. we were together 8 months total and he said he could never post me anywhere bc his parents and family would see but now hes posting relentlessly and posted a literal photo of her

i have been terrorized by my parents throughout my entire childhood: getting sent to school with bruises on my face, getting strangled, punched in the stomach/face, called out my name, being dogged by family members etc., so i feel like it‚Äôs very rational for me to not want to speak to them. but they always make it seem as if i‚Äôm doing some unspeakable act, throwing the things they do for me in my face as if buying me food and clothes isn‚Äôt the bare minimum. mainly because my mom has a similar relationship with hers, but their on pretty good terms so she probably has expectations for me, but if i‚Äôm gone, i don‚Äôt plan to ever speak to her again out of respect for my future. 

it‚Äôs not that i hate my parents, i love them, mainly because they‚Äôre my parents, but they are pieces of shit. pieces of shit who cannot take accountability and solve everything by letting time pass. what they don‚Äôt know is i live by communication, and i can‚Äôt stand not talking for a week and then acting as if nothing happened. they can hate me all they want but i have to put myself first.

it‚Äôs not even like my results are extremely urgent either. my doctor ordered it to find out if i have a pituitary adenoma, which is a benign brain tumour on the pituitary gland. naturally, my results are going to take longer even if the scan is positive because my life isn‚Äôt in any danger. the tumour would be inconvenient at best and can be managed with an endocrinologist. i‚Äôm just horrible at waiting.

I've tried to be the person everyone else sees but I don't even have a personality, I just act how people in the past say I've acted, I don't know who I am in a personal way, not in the LGBT or pronoun way but who I am to people, how people see me and think ""oh they seem nice"" or how people could be attracted to me.

If the people I know saw me for how I see myself they'd just see a suicidal teenager with a porn and self-harm addiction that probably doesn't have a proper future besides MacDonalds or OnlyFans if I manage to survive that long.

275,3,"The title says it all. I‚Äôve been unemployed since February and it‚Äôs been truly a struggle. I was in a contracted WFH position from September of last year to February of this year. The employers kept hinting that I could potentially have my job converted from contract to full-time despite needing to leave due to a medical emergency. Still, they decided at the last second to cut my contract early. I was laid off because I had informed them months in advance that my mom was battling leukemia and she had made it to the remission stage of her medical journey and needed stem cells to help fight off the cancer. After 2 million donors weren‚Äôt a match to her, I being her biological daughter was her last 50/50 shot. So of course I stepped and told my job, followed protocol and gave them all of the medical paperwork to let my job know only for them to tell me a few days before I got on the plane that I was let go. 

Since then, the job market has been a dumpster fire. I‚Äôve been applying for jobs almost every day only to be told positions have been filled or that I‚Äôm over or under-qualified for the role I‚Äôve applied for. I‚Äôm someone with 10+ years of experience in customer service, the beauty industry, and even in real estate. I also have my associate's degree and am working towards my bachelor's degree and will graduate by spring 2026. I‚Äôve applied for remote, hybrid, and on-site positions and it‚Äôs been months of ‚Äúno, no, no.‚Äù A part of me is thinking maybe it‚Äôs a sign from the universe to work on the novel I‚Äôve had and promote that to get self-published. 

But as far as for job places I‚Äôve been applying on; I‚Äôve been mainly on LinkedIn, indeed, and any jobs I‚Äôve searched from the Google search engine. 

I‚Äôm over this and hate the job market, and the area I live in, and overall I‚Äôm tired of struggling. Any other recommended job search platforms would be appreciated to be shared in the comments, especially for US positions. But yeah‚Ä¶honestly fuck these jobs and their fake job listings. "

280,1,"I am feeling so miserable and actually just wanted to vent it out to someone.

Today I just received another reject call from a job application. I had so much hope in getting in since the interview didn't go half bad. But here we are. This made me think about my life right now.

I been unemployed for over a year and a half now.  I only work casual now, its really hard. 

My passion was in drawing, but recently I have difficult time actually enjoy drawing artwork. I feel stressed and every time I draw because it looks bad. It really doesn't help that I went to University for Design and animation and I can't even animate properly or design like pros. 

I though oh, my artwork is bad but I can sure use my degree and be a teacher in high school instead, so did my post grad.

Now I am sitting here, doing casual job for the past 1year and half. Unable to find full time work, having low self-esteem worsening everyday.

I feel like maybe I just choose my career wrong. But I never been smart and struggled with studies so much. I could never have became anything more than what I am now. This realization has made me so broken.

Everyday I talk to my siblings and they talk about all these thing they learned in school and I just realize I never known that! Or when my siblings talk about things they remember about the book they read.. I cant even remember what I ate yesterday or if I brushed my tooth yesterday.

its so tiring. I know i need to improve myself but I don't even know where to start. 

"
281,1,"(If you want a reference for my looks check my profile. Also, not claiming to be attractive or good looking- just that i started looking better)

For the vast majority of my life, I have been regarded as ugly. I used to be overweight, with a non existent sense of style and few friends.

For the most part, I was invisible. And that was when I was lucky. When I was not so lucky, that invisibility would translate to disgust, mockery and hatred directed at me for even having the audacity to exist around other people. Aside from the few friends I had, and the online communities i subsisted on, most people approached me with an incredibly palpable sort of disgust. They‚Äôd speak to me snappily, curtly, or straight up dismiss anything I had to say (As an example I remember once during a group project for a class, I made a small joke and everyone stared me down until a single girl said ‚Äúok‚Äù and continued conversing among themselves), while anything else anyone had to say was given the entire light of day.

For a very, very long time, I thought it was my personality. I figured hey, not everyone is this grand asshole I‚Äôm making them out to be who‚Äôs so fixated on nothing more than my outward appearance as to hate me over that. It has to be me. I had to have been the issue.

And turns out I was the issue, just not in the manner I was expecting.

I started getting better looking about a little over a year ago. Small steps. Eating right, working out, experimenting with my fashion sense. People started talking to me more. Got invited to karaoke with new people. I hadn‚Äôt spoken to anyone new other than co-workers and classmates for like two years at this point.

As I lost more weight and got to looking better more and more people started to take interest in me and what I had to say. No longer were people dismissive, no longer were they curt, strict or rude.

They laughed at my jokes. Would indulge me in my long winded babbles on niche interests. They‚Äôd listen to every word I had to say and hold onto it as though gospel.

I thought, alright, maybe my personality got better. Maybe I was a better person to be around, or that the years turnt me out a little nicer.

I could not have been further from the truth. A little down the line I went to a club with my new friends, and was hit on by several people. Good looking people. People who would have never, EVER, IN A MILLION YEARS, TURNT MY WAY IF THEY SAW ME A YEAR PRIOR. It felt good. Really, fucking, good to be seen and desired, something I had literally never felt in real life before.

But it also left me with an empty feeling. These people didn‚Äôt know me. They hadn‚Äôt spoken to me at all. Hadn‚Äôt taken the slightest sliver of time to even eek out a conversation with me: and yet they wanted me all the same.

So then, was it really my personality that stopped me from experiencing any of this back then?

I haven‚Äôt changed. Not in the ways that matter. I‚Äôm still an airhead. I‚Äôm still impulsive. I still go on long winded rants about niche topics like speculative evolution or how anthrocentric our established worldview is or about the latest shitty rpgmaker game I‚Äôve been dreaming up.

But hey, now I‚Äôm not an airhead. I‚Äôm dreamy. Now I‚Äôm not impulsive: I‚Äôm carefree. Now I‚Äôm not a stupid schizoid loon: I‚Äôm a passionate nerd.

What the fuck? I‚Äôm still me. I‚Äôm the me I‚Äôve always been, the me I‚Äôll always be. I didn‚Äôt change, not in the ways that mattered.

But suddenly everyone fucks with me because I put on eyeliner and dropped a couple pounds. It pisses me off so fucking much. Where was any of this love when I needed it most? How is it that the same person can be perceived so radically differently because they dripped out a little more?

I feel so fucking unseen and alone. Which is ironic, because in this point of time I am the most doted on I have ever been.

Rant over. Tldr; people treat me differently now i‚Äôm awooga hot goth girl and not fat pasty asian midgef"
282,1,"there‚Äôs no beating around the bush here she says she wants to have sex with other people while actively ignoring me who‚Äôs still a virgin because ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt feel ready‚Äù. she says she has her needs and that ‚Äúshe‚Äôs gonna be selfish for once‚Äù. god i feel so pathetic. i just miss when we were happy. i‚Äôve been doing my absolute best in this relationship what am i doing wrong? am i not enough??? i‚Äôve been here supporting her every need for over a year. knowing myself im just gonna stay with her because i‚Äôm too much of a pussy to leave but god it hurts, it hurts so much, i just can‚Äôt stop crying. i miss my sweet girlfriend who said i was the only one she could ever need. i‚Äôm pathetic, i‚Äôm so fucking pathetic"
283,3,"I am so so pissed....you know what anime community can be really toxic sometimes.

I hate that it doesn't welcome individual opinions like everyone has to think the same.


NOT ALL FANS ofcourse

But some people really really piss me off .


Like if you don't like one piece or Naruto or bleach whatever or don't say that it's the greatest anime you're suddenly stupid , an idiot or like the worst human on earth.


You watch certain anime because you like the looks of certain character you're labelled shallow person who doesn't get the story.


Like why does it matter to you huh?

I am gonna watch whatever I want yes I am gonna watch for looks so what ?


Yes I don't think one piece is my cup of tea no I don't consider it a masterpiece so what?

Yes I will put certain newly released anime on top ten so what?


Just because an anime is old doesn't mean it's a cult classic and maybe it is a cult classic but not everyone has to accept this.


And most people weren't born during the time those anime released so people should also stop shaming others for not having the so called cult classic animes as their first anime


So what if someone's first anime was JJK , Demon Slayer or whatever like seriously what is the problem


Let people have opinions, their own preferences Not everyone is gonna think like you


I am seriously so done with those type of people who police others choice in anime


Yes I am gonna call them so called anime police


Seriously üòí

284,2,"This actually happened a while ago but still to this day I still think about what could‚Äôve happened and what lead to those events and the outcome

To explain, I (17f) went to Spain on a (supposedly) school approved trip during my spring break in April. We had a group of 19 kids and 3 adults not including the tour guide, and only one of the kids was 18+ in our group.

This teacher was a teacher I had gotten along with since sophomore year, but unfortunately on this trip he showed his true colors and was DAY DRINKING??? I got sandwiches with him just the two of us because I wanted sandwiches and nobody else did and he got 2 beers, and then he needed wifi so out of all places he decided to sit in a bar and I wandered off on my own and he didn‚Äôt care?? He was also offering other kids under the age of 18 (the legal drinking age in Spain) alcohol as long as they didn‚Äôt tell the other chaperones as if that‚Äôs something a good chaperone does???

Regardless it all kinda built up when on one of the days we all congregated back together in the group and we got on a boat. Idk how much he drank at lunch but I saw him drinking at least 3 beers on the boat and other kids said they saw 4 or 5. Once we got off the boat he was stumbling and arguing with locals and it was just crazy. I was standing off to the side when I feel him stumble backwards onto me and we go for a few feet before I manage to get from under him and he falls to the ground.

When I think about the situation or the Spain trip as a whole all I can think about is how he fell on me. So much could‚Äôve happened.

We were close to the water and the edge had no fence. We could‚Äôve fallen in and when I think about that other possibilities pop into my head like I could‚Äôve watched a man drown. Drunk people tend to latch on in water I‚Äôve heard so I could‚Äôve drown too.

I could‚Äôve hit my head on the concrete and then fell in the water.

I had recently had a leg surgery so that could‚Äôve royally fucked up my recovery time, and I honestly kinda think it did as I‚Äôm currently having issues right now.

I could‚Äôve just hit my head as a whole or gotten hurt if I fell with him.

My parents don‚Äôt have passports so they would have to go through that process to be able to get to me if something were to happen, and I‚Äôm not sure if they would let my sister come and get me. That fact is distressing too.

I never actually got a proper apology personally from him face to face and sober and the apology he gave to the group as a whole was half assed at best and pathetic at worst.

He had the audacity to say he only had two drinks and blame it on medications when talking to us as if we didn‚Äôt see him with more.

I feel like a fool because right before all that happened I was praising him to the other students because everyone else was from the other high school in the county and I was the only one who knew him. And then come to find out after we reported it to the school board that they told the original teacher doing this stuff to stop these trips last year so on top of that I might‚Äôve gotten a woman fired.

Summer break has started and with that I‚Äôve also graduated but even so I lie awake thinking about what could‚Äôve happened. I could‚Äôve been dead right now. 

I mentioned on a TikTok post that asked about the ‚Äúcraziest thing that happened at your school‚Äù the craziest thing in my opinion couldn‚Äôt be legally talked about and now so many people wanna know but I‚Äôm still afraid he would see it and know it was me, even if I didn‚Äôt say names or county, and would sue me or my former classmates would attack me for lying or something, because he is a well loved teacher.

I promised in the past I would explain to those people who wanted to know but in afraid now I don‚Äôt know how to approach it especially since when I think about it I still get shivers down my spine

I wonder if I‚Äôm being irrational, and I wanna know from internet people if I am. I apologize for how long this is or if it doesn‚Äôt go here."
285,2,"I have C-PTSD. I was gaslit, psychological abused, and emotionally abused. I have five years of false memories, and I cannot parse out what is real and what is fake beyond a few significant moments.   
I don't make it super known, and I operate fairly normally. But whenever I do, some fucking asshole has to display how much they value their own ego over another person's comfort.  
Like, I hate the colloquial use of gaslighting. It's a very specific type of abuse that, yes, was popularized and named via a movie. But, like, fuck man. This method of altering a person's reality for the benefit of an abuser _obviously_ existed beforehand. But people will be pedantic assholes and argue with me when I say it makes me uncomfortable and I'd prefer it if they didn't use it around me. Bro. Empathy is free. It costs you nothing to pivot your language. But it's actually _making me upset_ and feeds into my fear of not being believed.  
Or, I have admittedly weird triggers. They're mostly avoidable, and I can manage them myself most of the time. But sometimes I do need to bring it up so I don't wind up having a panic attack or shut down. But, again, people will argue with me and tell me to stop being so sensitive.  
Dude. I lived through horrible fucking shit. I'm trying my best to operate like a normal person, but my brain is fundamentally altered by my trauma. I can't control the way I react sometimes. I'm requesting basic empathy and understanding. But some people just refuse to be kind and respectful and I'm so sick of it. "
286,2,"I need to vent about my experience with the mental health system. I am not going to talk about the things that actually happened, but I need to vent about how frustrating it is when people try to dismiss the reality of my experience.

I had an extremely negative experience that left me with lasting medical trauma. But I can't seem to understand why people get so offended or upset when I talk about my negative experience with the mental health system? Is it because they think that by sharing my experience I am trying to negate their positive experience, which is not true. 

One person's experience does not cancel out another person's. 

Or is it, for some people I have spoken to at least, that they get upset because my story upsets their reality. I mean most people don't want to think about or face the truth that the mental health system society worships could really be as bad as it actually is (speaking as someone who was in mental hospitals for 5 years basically straight). I understand both reasons, I am not trying to invalidate anyone's positive experience with the mental health system or tell people that psychiatry doesn't work, it does for a lot of people! But it also hurts a lot of people. 

I think it would be best if both sides of the story just agreed to take the other as they are. Just not overcomplicate things and just listen when someone is sharing their story or experience. One person's experience does not cancel out another person's different experience.

Just venting my thoughts, I'm getting tired of people telling me it is not that bad when I went through horrible things in those places. But at the same time I respect people and if psychiatry works for them I want them to get that help.

I guess I just want people to not feel threatened by my experience or offended or upset by it when I'm not trying to upset anyone. 

And I'm just tired of always being countered with some form of ‚Äúbut it is a necessary system‚Äù or ‚Äúit isn't that bad!‚Äù. I know it is necessary, that doesn‚Äôt change how much harm it did to me and still does to so many. 

Anyway, had to get that off my chest,not many places where I can talk about these things, thank you.

287,1,"He says he loves me, but so often it doesn‚Äôt seem like he *likes* me and Idk what to make of this. I am most likely thinking too deeply into things and being nit picky, nonetheless sometimes I guess I just hurt my own feelings. Tonight he was doing something on my labtop in the living room while I was in the bedroom. He came into the bedroom and gave me my labtop back. He didn‚Äôt leave immediately so I got on my knees to hug him from the bed. He just stood there and didn‚Äôt hug me back. I don‚Äôt know why but I felt so hurt. I feel like little things like this happen so often. How we‚Äôll be laying in bed and I‚Äôll be snuggling him and he won‚Äôt embrace me back, or how after a few hours of him working on his computer I‚Äôll go in the living room to give him kisses because I miss him, and all he will say is how he doesn‚Äôt like distractions. He won‚Äôt kiss back, just complain about how I‚Äôm bothering him. I‚Äôm the mornings I 99% of the time wake up before him, and this usually leads me to showering him with kisses and cuddles because for some reason I just get really affectionate and excited to spend the day with him lol. But once he finally does wake up, the first thing he will reach for is his phone. He won‚Äôt kiss me first or hug me first, and that hurts me feelings too. Idk why lol. I know I‚Äôm likely overreacting and being a baby about small things like this, but it doesn‚Äôt keep me from hurting. I frequently ponder whether or not he truly likes  or desires me. I don‚Äôt feel desired and I‚Äôm not sure why. "
288,1,"What if my mother never really touched me weirdly as a child, and those were just made up memories? What if those times she spanked me as punishment were my mind playing a trick on me?? I remember her spanking me for hitting my head and crying in church. What if that was just a bad dream? What if those times she said no one would ever want me weren't serious? What if those times she commented on my genitals while I was showering hadn't happened at all? What if those times I was crying as she yelled at me and slapped me I was just being dramatic?? What then?? 

I feel so numb. We had a therapy session and she denied ever doing stuff like that, or downplayed it saying she ""didn't mean it like that"". I fucking remember all the shit she did, I cried about it, I told my friends in the past. I wish I didn't throw away my diary when I was younger. I had it written all down. I even threatened to call services on her at the time and she just laughed. I used to wish she was dead. At 6 I was already writing how much I hated her. But somehow I can't help loving her. I'm just scared. What if I really am crazy? Stupid stupid brain. I already forgot most of my childhood. All these memories only came back this year. It makes me think I made it all up. I wish I could forget them all over again.

Everyday I just hug and kiss my mother like nothing happened. "
289,2,"They emailed me with an superficial explanation, in which they state that I am younger than 18 years old. As proof, they mention my identity card which I photographed and showed them for some kind of PayPal card stuff. The issue is that the card directly contradicts this, as it states my date of birth at the 11 January 2002. The Hotline for some reason straight up doesn't work, I tried to call them, but just nobody takes the phone despite it should be open according to their opening times.

291,1,"August approaches and while there is a momentous celebration to be had in one part of my life, for the love of my life, deep down it marks another year of continuous, from the minute I'm awake, cruel mistress that is pain. 

I look back through the beginning, the middle and can't wait to reach the end because I refuse to believe there isn't an end for it. 

Never had a romantic relationship reach three whole years but here I am, about to break that with the most intrusive, life altering sensation that suffocates me on the worst days and hinders my spirit on the best of days. Completely absorbed in mind, body, spirit, every single part of the person I once was, am and hope to be. 

Like anyone living a loop that fluctuates in intensity, I'm exhausted. 
I am drained. 

More meds, a higher dose, side effects to manage and try to acclimate to. 

I feel like the static of a radio, I will keep trying to drone on. 

August fast approaches.."
292,1,"I just wanted to say that I have been crying for an hour and no one seems to care, I have been dealing with some sort of depressive state for over a year now and no cares either, they just say I am overreacting to things and that it is not that big of a deal.

I broke up with my ex almost 2 years ago and I miss it so much, not him but having someone who actually listens to me and cares when I am upset about something and doesn't simply minimizes my feelings like my mom always does. I miss having someone to talk to, someone to hug and who would tell me that everything will be okay even it is not true. 

I just need a hug and to cry with someone by my side.

Sorry for any spelling mistakes I can't barely see with the tears."
293,1,"i fell into a depressive spell recently, but I was almost happy about it, because it is comfortable for me to be sad. Im trying everything, I work out consistently, shower every single day, i do hobbies, ive been writing, i try to do things i did as a kid, nothings making me feel alive. like its really really bad this time. i feel paralyzed like i cant move. i thought i finally fought it off. i want to take medication or something, its just the scary thing is i dont even want to get out of it. i almost like my sadness, i just cant get it to stop. its easy to stop being sad until your depressed. people without depression never understand, its more than just drinking a cup of coffee or getting some sunlight. i try that but its not working for me anymore. "
294,1,"i‚Äôm 23f and this is something i‚Äôve carried for as long as i can remember. i never had a real father figure. every man who was supposed to protect me, love me, or raise me either left, pretended to care, or just ended up being dead weight in our lives.

tl;dr
my real dad left. one man pretended to be my dad but never truly supported me. my stepdad did something inappropriate when i was 11 and still barely helps with anything. my mom works herself to the bone while he does the bare minimum. i‚Äôve kept all of this to myself for years.

1. my biological dad

i never knew him. he left before i could form a single memory. he never tried to reach out. never sent a letter. never even checked if i was okay. and now that i‚Äôm graduating, there‚Äôs a chance he might show up. i laugh and say i‚Äôll ‚Äúmake a scene,‚Äù but honestly, i‚Äôm scared. what do you even say to someone who walked away from you before you could speak?

2. the man i thought was my dad (but wasn‚Äôt)

i grew up believing one man was my father. people let me believe it. he kind of played the role. but when i was 13, living abroad with my adoptive family and already going through depression, culture shock, and loneliness i found out the truth. he wasn‚Äôt my dad. not even close.

that crushed me.
i used to blame myself for the things i hated about him the way he acted cold, selfish, the way he mistreated his own family. i thought i inherited that. then a relative told me, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not like him. he‚Äôs not your dad.‚Äù and instead of relief, i felt more lost. more confused.

the truth is, he never really showed up. he visited once a year, handed me ‚Ç±1000 like it was some weird ritual, and still jokes that we ‚Äúlook alike.‚Äù but he was never there emotionally or financially. if i hadn‚Äôt found out he wasn‚Äôt really my dad, i probably would‚Äôve spent years wondering why he didn‚Äôt care. now i know. and i owe him absolutely nothing.

3. my stepdad

my mom reconnected with a guy from her high school circle. he had a crush on her for years but never made a move. eventually they got together, had two more kids, and for a while i thought maybe we could finally be a real family.

but it didn‚Äôt turn out that way.
he‚Äôs quiet, seems kind on the outside, doesn‚Äôt cheat (as far as we know), but that‚Äôs basically where the good stuff ends.

he never had a stable job. worked abroad once, then came home and settled for a ‚Ç±10,000/month job like that was okay. meanwhile, my mom busted her ass, got a va job, earns ‚Ç±30k+, and handles everything,bills, groceries, school, even supports her elderly parents. and what does he do? ‚Äúmanage food.‚Äù and sometimes, even that‚Äôs too much for him.

and still, he spends. on shoes. mall crap. late night takeout runs. and guess who pays? my mom. always her. he even uses her debit card. she carries the bags. the trays. he doesn‚Äôt lift a damn finger. doesn‚Äôt clean. barely cooks. when he does, he‚Äôs so slow she ends up helping anyway.

and every single night, he expects a massage. and she gives it. every night. and i sit there, boiling inside.

when i was 11, he crossed a line.
he touched me.
and he watches adult content that involves incest. i found it once. i wish i hadn‚Äôt.

i never told my mom. i didn‚Äôt want to destroy what little peace she had. i didn‚Äôt want my siblings to grow up without a father, even if he‚Äôs a lousy one. i didn‚Äôt want to ruin her. sometimes she tells me to choose a man with a stable income, someone who‚Äôs better than what she picked. other times she says she‚Äôs lucky because her husband is ‚Äúkind.‚Äù

but she doesn‚Äôt know what he did.
and i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôll ever be ready to tell her.
i‚Äôm scared of what‚Äôll happen if i do.

----

despite all this, i somehow ended up with a boyfriend who‚Äôs nothing like the men i grew up around. he‚Äôs kind. consistent. affectionate. respectful. emotionally present. he makes me feel safe. whole. like i matter. i even tell my mom how he treats me. Maybe because i want her to realize what she could‚Äôve had too.

sometimes i wonder if my past, being left, being lied to, being touched and silenced is why i used to chase male validation. maybe that‚Äôs where it all came from. but at least now i‚Äôm aware. and i‚Äôm choosing better. i‚Äôm choosing someone who doesn‚Äôt destroy me just to prove they love me.

i don‚Äôt hate my mom. i love her. i see how much she‚Äôs done. how hard she‚Äôs fought. but i do hate how every man in her life and mine failed us. each and every one of them."
295,3,"I'll get to the title eventually, I feel the need to explain all of this including how much I feel betrayed by my family.

Was and still am in the worst place in my life I've ever been. Mom walked downstairs for ""5 mins"", came back up claiming she called my grandmother (she didn't) less than a minute later I'm given the so-called choice of a 72 hour hold in an abusive mental hospital (sibling's been there before, it is abhorrent.),or a seperate crisis facility that the officer claimed was much better, had games, good beds, and food. I didn't care about any of that, all I knew is that he made it sound like I'd have some sort of choice while I was there, but never gave details on what that choice was. 

Anyway I got there at 11 pm. Tossed, cried, and turned all night, slept 2.5 hrs max, got checked on 12 times that I REMEMBER. My only way of keeping track of time was counting the fire alarm blinks every 9-11 seconds, for some reason it was always a second early or late. I could have asked the time more than once, but I felt like a bother, same as food, I'm a vegetarian and I couldn't deal with having to go through that shitty process of explanation with some random person at 12 am, at a place I can't stand, that I hadn't eaten in well over a day and needed special food, you don't know what kind of place you're stuck in until it's far too late, I do want to say that every single worker was incredibly kind, except one. I felt like I was in CAS all night (alternative school I got sent to, defended myself from bully got 10 days, genuinely knock off prison with wannabe CO's who couldn't get the job, or got fired from a school, didn't deserve it so I switched school systems after my 4th day.) 

Whole room smelled like copper, passed out for an hour, woke up to clothes by my bed which made me so sad knowing my mom had already came once. I eventually woke up at 5:45, they came in at 6 saying it's time for breakfast, while my BP was being checked a girl saw an earwig, but I know what an earwig is so it didn't bother me (what did bother me was hearing about the multiple roaches, horribly traumatized by those, it's not a horrible place nor roach-nfested, but still..). Here is where I had to tell them I was a vegetarian who also doesn't eat eggs, I felt so ungrateful in a place that I had no clue I would be trapped in less than 12 hours before, but they atleast brought a seperate fork for the hashbrowns and the nightstaff/worker who gave it to me was kind. (notice this is the first time someone was told about my diet, semi-important info). Sat alone and delerious for about 10 mins before putting my tray back and lying back down in my room while crying, until someone gave me a toothbrush/paste to use (after eating... when I am in the habit of brushing I know it is ALWAYS done before eating). The sinks have the water pressure of a 78 year old man urinating... how can you clean a toothbrush, your hands, ANYTHING, when your light trickle of drops lasts 8 seconds?? Saw my shower was still dirty btw. Almost broke down because my decaying teeth/overall hygiene were part of the panic attack that got me thrown in there. 

I remembered the registration guy worker wtv told me that I would be able to do something about leaving in the morning, but obviously couldn't the same night that cops brought me in. So during the medication education class where they told me everything I already know about the medications that I've taken 7/10 of, I spoke to the therapist that you see daily about it, avoided some home kwestions (this suhb doesn't like certain words wtf), she said to make sure I tell the psychiatrist about my feeling of being tricked into coming. I did, he thought it might be a good idea to go back on lexapro, I was saying anything and everything to get my ass out as quick as possible like an inmate on good behavior. Later that day got taken to speak to my case manager blablabla asked me the same kwestions as quite literally 4 others did, until she asked what my main goal was, I straight up said to getout (another phrase not allowed on here..) today. I was told maybe 2 days would be a good idea to get a break.

 In between all these events after breakfast I started speaking to some people. Names will be K, M, V, and C. 

K was a bit antagonistic, immature, too unserious, and the youngest. Basically got another girl with  learning disabilities to become her mimicking goon, whatever they both don't really know better, playing uno and they somehow end up with all the special cards that typa stuff, it didn't bother me until C and I started really bonding and everytime I felt like we were in the middle of a good conversation K would intrude, interrupt, or otherwise distract us(those damn uno games, istg that girl has never read a rule EVER). Eventually it made me feel like the only enjoyable parts of my stay were stolen from me. I had a few conversations with V and she reminded me of myself when I was a tad younger, not nearly social, but neither was I. Just adapted to being forced to be. The only person I felt could become a true friend was C, she told me about how her mom wasn't answering the phone yet to be released, and then let me know that she doesn't even want to be released. Home life sucks to put it simply, but that really resonated with me as all I wanted was to get out of that place and the person who I related to most wanted to live in a longterm recreational facility (she doesn't eat pork, they didn't accomodate this and she still wanted to stay there). She was on her TENTH day.. this is a 14 day max facility, most get out in under 7 by their case managers. 

Lunch came and it was spaghetti and meatballs, I can't remember why or how, but during breakfast some other worker asked why I didn't eat and I told them I couldn't eat meat, hadn't since I was 7 (second time they were told), I didn't care that it was given to me as I hardly felt like eating as my hunger wave was long gone and I had eaten pb crackers. I was eating the garlic bread until one of the girls told me to just ask for more food and they'd do it, so I did. The single rude worker decided to tell me ""well ion see that on your chart... nope no dietary restrictions"" I'm a reserved and shy person, but idgaf at this point so I said ""that really doesn't matter I told 2 other workers"" she said ""well we don't do accomadations"" I was NOT putting up with this projecting anti-positive waste of a salary and just told her I will not eat and sat down. ""WelL i MEaN we CAn FrY yoU soMETHING"" is what I heard when she started asking about my diet to other workers, who immediately told her that I was indeed vegetarian. I coudl tell she wanted me to just cave and eat the meat, which is why I didn't waste my time asking for an accomodation. Eventually they brought me spaghetti no meatballs, with random pieces of meat in my corn. I ate like 5 noodles, toast, and put it back.

  
We went outside and I just walked around... avoiding bugs in the southern heat, while watching volleyball and basketball as 1. I don't really like sports, but 2. If I were to suck it up and do the only activites available I'd hurt the pitbull bite on my hand, I didnt even really play, yet still I ended up slamming my hand into a volleyball at one point like an idiot. This dog bite only hurt more and more after leaving, pain comes and goes with swelling it's so overwhelming I've had no joy in over a month because of this shit.

  
More free time, talked with C more, cracking jokes that unfortunately the others didn't understand, until the workers talked to us about dinner, then I realized I'd have to tell them for a 4th fucking time I won't eat their chicken nuggets, got told no accomadations again, but they'll make a grilled cheese (iykyk cheese is rarely vegetarian) I shut up and said sure, dinner comes around I eat the tater tots pass the chicken nuggets, grilled cheese, and ice cream until the workers stop me bc apparently we cant share food. Didn't care that much about that as I still gave C my grilled cheese and a lady told her after we were done ""I see that bread, I was a teenage girl before too"" only including this to show that these people aren't monsters, just barely scraping by with the resources my state provides with one bad apple worker.

Eventually after dinner people kept and kept asking me what's wrong, they KNOW I'm suicidal, so instead of getting into that I just told them I really wanted to leave and I wish I could have came at a more aware or better time if that even exists. (truth is now I know I wouldn't be able to take it, I actually wish places were more accomadating or honestly nobody ate meat and had extreme hygiene standards because wtf is up with my shower having old spice purple shit on the wall, I know both these things are impossible in my shithole hometown area to say the least)

  
Then C asked how old I was, and said that if you're older than 16 you can just... go, and I felt so much better yet nauseous. C didn't do this because she doesn't WANT to, but I did. I called my mom, couldn't handle telling the workers I need to be released so I just got my mom to do it. 45 mins later said goodbye to everyone as we were playing slapjack after the damn tornado warning went off, it was so quick, on the way out I told the worker I wish I could have came at a better time, I wish I had the strength to stay, or something like that. I could tell she was somewhat disapproving of me leaving, but said that I can always come back if I need to, and hoped that I won't need to.

Random note, they had Haven by Novo Amor playing at one point, I love this song so much from Life is Strange.

After leaving I've had nightmares every night since, I wake up >3 times a night, physical issues only gotten worse aside from me thorougly brushing (still got cavities and a shitty overbooked dentist so this doesn't matter). I think about C so often, and every time I do, I get so sad and guilty. I hardly said goodbye, didn't even think to ask about how I could contact her, don't know how she is doing now as it's been well past the 14 day maximum stay for her, and she has no instagram that I can find.

 No matter the maturity or moral differences in there everyone was so nice and accepting. I have never, ever, ever met people who just care so little about things that people at school wouldn't shut up about. I looked disgusting, physically couldn't wash my hair due to the dogbite that swole everytime I showered and mentally because the shower was dirty. But no one said a thing, V said she liked my glasses and I liked hers too, C noticed I dyed my hair a while ago and said she liked it, anyway it was just so strangely welcoming yet the whole time I felt out of place and just waiting for it to be over. M left the same day as me and I barely spoke to them, I wish I did more, same as V, but I'm sure it would have required more time. 

  
Idk why I felt like writing this on a greater scale, all I know is I made a new friend in person for the first time in actual years, and I miss her, knowing she or anybody was there, and having someone to actually listen to about serious things in real LIFEEE. Sure I talk to my childhood best friend, she talks to me, but her problems are so inconceivable... She had a fucked up childhood same as me, but now she lives in a 250k house in a subdivision, her dad owns a company, and let his wife turn him right wing??? All of these things affect her greatly, but I can't talk to someone like this and truly feel seen or listen to her when we see each other twice a year. I think I'm done, gotta sort youtube playlists cuz that's about all I'm good for right now."
296,0,"I‚Äôm a larger person as well, so I don‚Äôt have anything against her appearance or anything, but for the love of all things holy, I wish she would stop offering unsolicited healthy eating and dieting pro tips. It doesn‚Äôt seem to work for her, so why would I want her suggestions?"
297,1,"My former best friend is a narcissist who emotionally abused me for around the last ten years or so.

I thought of her as the older sister I never had. She was more than just a friend, she was family. Or at least I considered her so, but it didn't go both ways.

We would talk on the phone every day for many hours on end. We played a ton of videogames together. I was the best man at her wedding. She helped me write my first resume and hyped me up for my first job interview. She comforted me during the pandemic when I thought my dad was going to die from it. She encouraged me to better myself and start going to therapy. I considered her house a second home. I paid for flight trips out of my own pocket (and I had very little to my name) to visit her once she moved to another country. We had a library's worth of inside jokes and stories of shared life experiences to pull from. Every aspect of my life included her in some way or the other, and I was happy that it was so. I felt like she understood me, cared for me, and that she would stay at my side until we grew old and got to happily ponder on a lifetime of companionship.

But at the same time.

She set her own success as the universal standard of success and made me feel like I was a failure for not living up to it. She convinced me that my every decision had to be run through her and get her approval before I did it. She made me unsure of myself as a result and then constantly berated me for being ""immature."" She left a trail of discarded friendships throughout the years (and I foolishly believed I wouldn't be one of them one day). She once told me that she only considered friendships to be worth it if she got a tangible benefit or value out of it, and I didn't see it as a red flag. She once told me I was her ""project"" and I didn't see it as a red flag. Every time we fought I was the one who apologized to get her back. I was always in the wrong and she always in the right. She constantly shit-talked people and their choices and not once did I think she was doing the same thing to me behind my back. She tried isolating me from my own family and almost made me neglect my other friendships because she was taking up all of my attention.

And what ultimately broke the pedestal I had her on was that she instantly despised my boyfriend (the first romantic relationship I've ever had after years of being single and sad about it) once I arranged a hangout for them to know each other. Following that, she started whispering in my ear to make us break up. She made me doubt my love for him, she made me doubt what I knew in my heart was the truest passion I've ever had the joy of experiencing and caused me anguish I'm only now starting to heal from.

And when I told her I wouldn't terminate my relationship because she was asking me to do so, she told me ""my best friend (me) is dead"" and that I would ""be alone, because she was the only one who had ever been there for me.""

She then blocked me everywhere and cut off contact. This was all the way back on February.

I suffered for months following that. I got depressed. Started considering self-harm and suicide. I felt empty, hollow. In my mind, my best friend was the person who saw me for my real self, and if she thought I wasn't worth the shit beneath her shoe then that was true.

Months passed without us exchanging a single word. Then my grandfather found himself dying in the hospital. My best friend knew my grandfather. She knows all my family. Once he died, I told a mutual friend of ours to pass her a message from me telling her of the departure.

She unblocked me.

After months of not saying a word. From February to June.

After my grandfather died in the hospital, and the day after we buried him.

I get the following from her.

""We are done. Stop trying to reach out. You chose (my boyfriend) over me, good for you. I hope it works out for you. I honestly don't think it will and I don't want to see it happen either. So we are done.""

That was it.

No condolences for my grandpa. No ""hey, I'm sorry you went through such a painful thing."" Nothing to acknowledge that we had been ""best friends"" for more than a decade and she'd just thrown that into the trash like a used tissue.

I then told her to fuck herself and blocked her everywhere. This was on Saturday as of the time of writing this. 2 days ago.

It's surreal. Now I feel... free. Like I'm myself again. The storm has passed, and sunlight awaits me. I don't know what life has ahead of me, but all I see is hope. I cut the chain, and I'm no one's prisoner any longer.

I am no one's plaything. I am no one's extension.

I am myself. I am my own person. My choices are mine to make.

Goodbye, Ruth.

I do not need you. I will not miss you. You will make me cry no more."
298,2,"Last year, I realized I was trans male. I told nobody except my friends. When I started dating a girl, I didnt tell my mom because I knew she would see that as dating the same gender since she didn't know I was trans, but since i had a photo of two of us kissing, when my mom found it, she told me that she didn't support me but accepted me. She told me that when she was my age, she has crushes on girls but that didn't make her gay or whatever, and i would come to realize that I just REALLY liked her, but that me in that photo is the happiest she had seen me in a while and that made her happy, so she didn't force the relationship to end. But, when I came out as trans as my reason to attempt to end my life (I don't know why I truly attempted at that time and really wanted to just come out and also pinpoint a reason), she told me straight up that she would never agree, accept, or even see me the way I want to see myself, because I will never look male. Her reasoning was pretty similar to her reason for not thinking I was anywhere on the wide LGBTQ spectrum, telling me that she too felt like a man at some point but she was just a tomboy, and that my autism makes me trans. I just... why could she accept me liking more than one gender but not me simply going by a new name and short hair? She told me that as long as I was happy, she would always support and accept me... being seen as a guy makes me happy!!"
299,3," have you ever disliked someone so much‚Äînot out of jealousy, but because of how they treat you‚Äîthat you just want to be far away from them forever?

For me, it‚Äôs a classmate from 7th grade who happens to be the class topper. On the surface, he seems perfect‚Äîalways getting high marks, praised by teachers‚Äîbut behind the scenes, he constantly puts me down. He mocks me in front of others and seems to go out of his way to make me feel small.

I once tried to speak up about it to a teacher, but I was immediately dismissed. The teacher said something like, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs impossible‚Äîhe‚Äôs such a good student,‚Äù and made it sound like I was lying. It hurt a lot.

I don‚Äôt want to fight him or ruin my own image by getting into trouble. I‚Äôve always tried to be a good student, and I don‚Äôt want to change that. But trying to ‚Äúbeat‚Äù him academically is almost impossible. He‚Äôs just always ahead, and I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in his shadow with no way out.

Honestly, I feel trapped. Like nothing I do is enough.

i am not over exaggerating 


"
300,2,"I 29m just wanted to get that out. I can't stop thinking of it. Heard a rumor and found out the girl I was seeing was also seeing others. There's a scare and I just want to make sure.

Thanks if you read."
301,1,"i feel like i struggle alot with self image, and it hurts and feels embarrassing when i try to talk to people and it seems like they aren‚Äôt interested simply because of my appearance. 
i feel like after my last relationship, it left me wondering why i wasn‚Äôt enough? why didn‚Äôt my
ex fight for me? it felt
like he wasn‚Äôt comfortable or felt like he was ashamed or that he didn‚Äôt appreciate me, why?
i just wanted someone to appreciate and care for me, to just support and reassure me, is that really too much to ask..?
it just seems like im only good enough to fuck, but not good enough to love and that hurts

302,2,"Hey everyone. My Mom is getting married in around 2 weeks. This weekend is her bridal tea which I've helped her friend plan. For context, I am 19f and I currently live with my Mom. My neighbour asked me recently what gift she should bring for my Mom and I've come to the realisation that I don't really know of many specific things my Mom would like. I know that she loves dark chocolate and I know that she usually enjoys practical and useful gifts and I know that she does like to have something to relax with and I can think of the odd example of things she would like, like her coffees and stuff but I feel like I just can't think of more specific and meaningful gifts. I honestly feel like a terrible daughter. I'm very close to my Mom so I don't know how I can't think of these things. She honestly doesn't really talk about things she'd like to buy for herself much but I still feel like I should have some sort of clue for what she'd like specifically. So far my gift for my Mom is a framed photo of her and my future stepdad. Even that feels like a sad excuse for a gift. To make matters worse, I've told some friends that I'm struggling to find a gift for my Mom. I think they must think I'm a really inconsiderate daughter. I still need to get back to my neighbour and let her know of what gift she should bring. I'm just so scared that she'll also think I'm a bad daughter if I tell her that dark chocolate, gift cards and jewellery are good gifts for my Mom. I feel like those gifts are so normal and usual. I feel so so awful."
303,2,"My gf is a recovering alcoholic and I told her I don't want her to drink and she knows this, I've never ever liked her drinking, she's known this for years she got mad at me one day because I drank and I told her I wouldn't again which I haven't because I don't like her drinking and she said 'no it's fine we can both drink' I actively told her I'll stop the occasional drinking and she assumed I would be fine and she told me that I stress out too much and she won't relapse and there's absolutely nothing to worry about I'm just being basically crazy, I'm worried about her possibly relapsing, is this not a reasonable concern?

Small edit : She reacts similarly with my eating problems, she will react very similarly if not basically the exact same when she decides to ask about how my eating problems are going, so I maybe had hope she would understand "
304,2,"I am a girl, and as I was growing up I understood that there would be some men who are creepy, who I need to avoid. But I guess I didn't understand how it would feel. 

I am 17, compared to many I'm lucky for how little I am made 
 uncomfortable, it's almost funny. It tends to happen in clusters, for example, there was one week where I am on the bus and this older man calls me 'beautiful', and then tells me how he wishes he could walk around, exposed to the world. A couple days later there is another older man tried to flirt with me, as if he were 20. 

""Hey, how are you doing üòè""

Another time I was walking home with my dog, a Chihuahua mix, and some guy in a bike was checking me out, I didn't mind because he didn't seem like he was 60 years older than me. The bar is low. But this older man saw and was like ""he looks like he is gonna eat you up"", then proceeds to follow me, and ask me to fix his mental health and smoke with him. Saying he'd provide weed, wonder if it's laced.

Thankfully I have bigger dog now who barks at men who come up to us for no good reason, and don't leave us alone. 

But then today, it's my ti et day if this new internship and I didn't dress like a slob, so naturally, in a 10 minute walk I had 3 different older men gawking at me. Then on the bus as this old man is leaving, he passes by me, my chair is facing the inside of the bus, so as he passes i can help but look at him so he stops, looks at me, he face is about a foot from mine. He says what all the other old guys say to me

""Your are beautiful today""

I am uncomfortable, I have no space to move, he is staring at me.
""Oh, uh, thanks?"" I smile, as soon as he walks past I cannot hide my disgust.

I notice there is the young guy who saw the whole interaction, when the old man says what he said the young man seems happy, when I am disgusted, he seems confused.

Is it weird how I am annoyed he seemed confused? I mean like, why are some guys so naive it's irritating

305,1,"Everyone in my class is skinny except for a few people, schools out but they text me mean things

I just wish they could leave me alone even in the summer, like I play sports and stuff, it makes me mad.."
306,1,"I just need to vent for a moment. I stole extensions, yes hair extensions, from one of my closest friends in high school. It‚Äôs been 10 years but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever forgive myself. It ruined everything. My behavior was selfish and unacceptable. It‚Äôs one of my biggest regrets. This friend was good to me and I acted so poorly, I hate myself for it. I just needed to Get that out."
307,3,"Hi everyone, today was my audition for my college drumline. I was given the role as an ‚Äúalternate‚Äù for snare drum. I am currently feeling very disappointed as well as frustrated. I worked so hard to get a spot and I wanted it so badly. My reason for feeling frustrated is that I honestly think I am a better player than a couple of the members that made it onto the snare line. 

I was told that being an alternate will basically mean I will have to learn our halftime shows and the music, but I will only be able to march if someone is missing. 

I honestly don‚Äôt know if I am interested in being an alternative mainly because it seems like it will be a big waste of time. Especially because it‚Äôs not even guaranteed I will ever see the field. On the other side, it could be a good experience for me and you never know what might happen in the future. 

I think I might email the drumline instructor in a couple days and just kinda ask him what I can be doing over the summer to get better. Not really sure though. 

Thank you for reading."

309,1,"constantly fighting the constant anger at the state of the world. it feels like nobody cares about anything and will stand for nothing. yet it i still can't help but be selfish and think about how i'm going to die alone. people always say that you'll find someone, or that it gets better, but those words - while kind - are simply a repeated script that don't do much good except provide comfort for the person saying it. 

people talk about the importance of friends and how we forget that, or they say ""but you're forgetting about friends, what about friends? you're not valuing the importance of friends."" but i'm talking about someone touching me like i mean something more to them. you say this after having had your first date. your first kiss. you say it's no big deal. you know what that's like. i don't, and i'll be the judge of how enjoyable these experiences are. at this point i don't even need to be intimately touched, i think one kiss is fine. and then i can face the world knowing what it's like to be wanted. even if i was wanted only for a short amount of time, the fact that my life intersected with another's meant that we were there for when we needed each other, for however long that was.

you might say that's naive. but there are people i've let go of because i've burned that bridge down in a righteous anger. i know what it's like to be used. discarded, cast aside. seen as only a blip in this existence. i meant nothing to them. i was replaceable. i say those ""naive"" words not out of some sort of naivete, or lack of knowledge, but rather, out of a wish to no longer be so angry.

it's crazy how amidst families being torn apart both overseas and in nearby neighborhoods, there's still homework to be done. jobs to work. bills to pay and expectations to fill and everything feels so suffocating i haven't been able to do anything at all. yes, i know that's life. suck it up, so be it. but what a terrible, raw and ugly life. to be expected to live when others cannot. to have the whole world in our very hands, when others have nothing.

don't come to me and tell me that's life. i am very much aware that This is Life. i have spent too long fantasizing about ending it, and only by nearing the brink have i come to understand it a little more - that life is an amorphous thing that we experience until we become nothing. maybe everything we Do is all for nothing. i talk about ""in the next life,"" or ""maybe in another life."" but even if that were true, that other ""life"" would not be us. so perhaps my alternate self would know what it's like to be wanted. to know love, to know self-peace. but that's not what we have here. there's no use whining or mourning or griping at it all. i think these things only cause inaction. 

but still. it does feel good to flail like a fish drowning on land. to scream at the circumstances of this life. to wonder what we've done to deserve it all. 

to that i say - that's life. 

welcome to the complete unknown. maybe if you want something so badly, you should fight for it. "
310,1,"Lately, I've been noticing a pattern in dating that's really starting to wear me down. I‚Äôm Indian, and I‚Äôve come across a lot of people (especially on dating apps) who are really into Asian pop culture K-pop, anime, K-dramas, etc. Nothing wrong with that in itself (even I sometimes like to watch them), but I‚Äôve realized that many of them subconsciously (or sometimes very obviously) have a strong preference for East Asian men.

It sucks to feel like you‚Äôre being filtered out not because of your personality, values, or what you bring to a relationship, but because you don‚Äôt ‚Äúlook the part‚Äù of someone‚Äôs fantasy. I can't change my race, and I shouldn't have to. But being constantly overlooked or dismissed just because I don‚Äôt fit into someone‚Äôs aesthetic bubble is exhausting.

At this point, I'd rather focus on my career and goals than keep trying to fit into spaces where I feel invisible. I'm not bitter, just done wasting time where I‚Äôm not genuinely seen or appreciated.

Edit: This post's intention is to just vent out and make my fellow Indians aware that it's not worth the chase, you all are just wasting your time TBH. Our worth is only measured after getting an extraordinary job."
311,2,"It's my right ear that burns when my anxiety is peaked. My heart is constantly racing just hearing about the war news, whether I willingly want to or not. The thought about the U.S. getting bombed terrifies me. But what terrifies me the most is losing my family.

My son is just one year old and still exploring the world. While he's in his own oblivious world, I'm counting the days until I hear about a peace treaty or not knowing when I'll hug my son for the final time.

I know the U.S. isn't ""directly"" at war, but they're heavily involved. So, any threat to the U.S. terrifies me. The last dreaded image that pops up when I hear the remote word ""bomb"" is me holding my wife and our son as they're both crying while our dogs bark out of panic.

Maybe it's just a stupid fear, or I'm being heavily paranoid. But it's hard not to hear from it when it comes to me daily."
312,2,"Hi guys, this may be a long paragraph read if you'd like it's just so I can write my thoughts down. Bless you all have a wonderful day!

I am a younger sister in my family (teen) and I have an older sister (teen) we have a very close relationship, and I adore her very much, am super grateful for a sister like her.

But it's not easy living as the younger sister in my family, my ages i've been the shadow behide my sisters life. To put this in perspective my sister can

\-cook -dance (prof ballet etc.) -Art (all kinds) -good at acidemics -a social person -anything she does it's just perfect.

I on the other can't do any of those things compared to her schedele I'm at home the whole week, I don't have talents, I can't cook, do art, I CAN""T EVEN TALK TO PEOPLE.

the worst of this all is she's so much prettier and I've known from a young age, all the complements were at her ""omg \_\_\_ is that your sister she's so pretty"" ""Who is that"" ""whats your sister makeup"" and I'm just some side kick to make her popular just an addition to her life. 

Recently we have moved schools I've been at that school longer than her around 5 or so years, she's recently joined and already has the whole year level after her, I'm not even joking when I say she made 13 friends on the first day.

I HAVE 6 FRIENDS IT'S MY 5TH YEAR.

I've always thought about how she's always better ""\_\_\_\_ be like your sister"" ""Why can't you dress like your sister""

At this point I just want to ewhfodhfk,dkzbs, we look nothing alike she's so perfect and I have no many problems in my life I can't process why am I the one with anxiety why am I the one with shyness why am I the one who has to always be that one person people compare to make themselves look better.  When I look on the internet people my age look so pretty, and I just feel like I'm just a mistake at this point.

My sister made friends with her whole previous school but after we moved places and she moved school she already has the whole school on her side.

It's not fair, why am I made to just be a side peice as ""oh that's the nice friend"" ""thats the smart one"" I can't do this anymore I'm so angry with myself I can't do anything about it, I can't I dont have time I 'wpESFHDovdfzjxckn m.

They‚Äôre one of the sweetest people I‚Äôve ever known and I wish so badly that they didn‚Äôt have to go through this. I mailed them a package with a plushie and a note from SendAFriend. I know this shit gets isolating and a stuffed animal won‚Äôt fix that, but fuck, dude."
314,1,"I guess this all started a few months ago when I turned 30. My girlfriend has been talking about it for a couple years, throwing a big party for me and celebrating the end of my 20‚Äôs. As we got closer I realized I don‚Äôt really have friends that I would invite to a party anymore or anyone that would probably end up coming if they didn‚Äôt know other people that were coming.

Everyone works full time and has kinda gone their separate ways, and my closest friend I haven‚Äôt seen in a couple years up until a few months ago when he needed help with a car. (Not from lack of trying on my end to hang out or go on double dates or anything just to see him again) It seems like plans I‚Äôve made to see or even just play a game online with my old friends just falls flat. When I suggest events or getting together with the circle I‚Äôve been in for a little bit it is pretty much ignored.

I feel like every time anyone has reached out to make plans with me personally and not as a group, it‚Äôs if they need something, whether it‚Äôs work done on their car, welding something back together, or a ride. I don‚Äôt mind helping and being reliable but it makes me feel like people just want me around for my skill sets and not for who I am as a person.

I have people that know me and I enjoy talking to if I‚Äôm out and about (my girlfriend calls me a local celebrity because everyone seems to know me in some form or another) but I feel like we are more acquaintances than anything, and making specific plans with them would be awkward and probably not pan out since we don‚Äôt have that level of a connection yet.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just being pessimistic lately or what but I feel like the groups I were part of have dispersed or I‚Äôve fallen out of, and I don‚Äôt know how to make new friends, or even if I have the drive to. I dread talking to strangers it stresses me out to be honest, even non face to face conversations like on a multiplayer game. I feel depressed and in a rut though."
315,2,"Let me start off by giving some background, which began when I was in middle school six years ago. I had a really nice PC I was given as a Christmas gift, and it was a gift I held very dear. After a while I started playing games online for a while, and for some unknown reason this random I matched up with in a game decided to target me. While we were speaking on discord, he unfortunately started sending me unsolicited and vile pornography. This also happened right as I was being physically and sexually assaulted in middle school. The lewd material also contained malware and somehow installed a rootkit onto my PC, and for those unaware that pretty much gave him total access to my home computer. Recently, my mother hooked up an older television we had bought around the time I had that PC, and since the wifi network I had at the time was also possibly compromised; I‚Äôm worried that the aforementioned smart TV was also infected. Currently, I fear that this TV that may or may not have been connected to that wifi has compromised our current wifi router and this awful person will continue to spy on me and harass me. My mother said that the TV wasn‚Äôt connected to the Wifi at the time, but I feel like I can‚Äôt take her word for it. I have diagnosed CPTSD and borderline from all of these horrible things that happened and I can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs a rational fear and what‚Äôs paranoia. I‚Äôm so tired, and I just want to feel safe. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve been abused at home, at school, and now the country ( the US ) is becoming increasingly hostile towards my existence. Why can‚Äôt people fucking leave me alone. I can‚Äôt go on like this anymore. I‚Äôm 20 and I can‚Äôt even leave my home because my fight or flight response kicks in full gear the second I step outside. I worry that I‚Äôll die miserable and alone, and I feel like I deserve it as well. "
316,1,"I remember being in theatre at school, I played a character that someone else was happy to see, and seeing her eyes light up and cheerily greet me as I opened the door broke my heart in pieces. It was over a year ago yet I remember this half second so vividly, she was just doing her act, it wasn't real joy. 

I don't remember what she looks like, her name or anything else. Just a captured moment and heartache, still residing in my mind. No one will ever love me, no one will ever be happy to see me and no one will ever miss me. "
317,1,"What is it with friendships over 30 nowadays really,  every time I make an attempt of getting close to someone in a potential friendship scenario, I end up with people just taking and taking and giving nothing back.

For example I've got a friend who's calling me frequently to tell me about issues she's got with men in her life but whenever I've got a problem unrelated to her favourite subject in the world, she replies flatly with cliche answers like aaaw that sucks, and the conversation ends really shortly. One time we went past the aw that sucks and ended up having a mini fight where I felt like a child being scolded by his parent.  Even with talking about something else rather than issues, convo ends after a few minutes with minimum of interest toward something like that. The last 'best friend' I had ended up in a similar situation, but worse, there wouldn't be enough characters available in this post for me to describe the whole drama I went through.

I approach people on Bumble but they reply like once in a fortnight and even that doesn't move past the cliche 'so what are you doing this weekend', unless it just ends up in a one sided therapy setting.

I honestly do not remember when the last time was when I felt that someone would be genuinely curious about finding stuff about me.

 What is it with people nowadays, is no one genuinely looking to build proper connections past a screen and actually have a meaningful conversation, or is it me, the way I approach people, am I choosing the wrong people to be around or is it just the norm these days.

Honestly, I'm just gonna get a fish in a bowl and live happily ever after.

318,3,"Never thought I would be. I was always pretty accepting of the thought but now I guess because it's literally happening now I'm terrified. Some things about me: I've been learning how to drive, I'm going to be a senior in highschool, and I'm the drum major of a marching band. I also am eligible for a job and I'm also queer in a place where that's just not acceptable. Possibly TMI but it's a vent area so I'm probably fine. Anyway, my main concern or realization is just how much is going to change. I have friends irl, but I also have this friend group online. I won't say they've been my crutch, but we've all known each other for five years, going on six. We're all close, we game every now and then- some younger some older but nothing drastic and it's a happy bunch of  friends made through the internet. There has been times the server is silent and then times it's anything BUT silent, there's been periods of silence and people saying they'll be busy and they hardly talk anymore, and that's fine. But I'm so afraid. I'm gonna miss them, I'm not ready to let go yet. And I guess they won't all leave tomorrow or this month or even in the next year but I'm so scared. There's also a big thing going on with my mom and my younger brothers, who I miss way too much and is the reason I'm driving so I can go see them. But there's a big age gap, so I don't even know if they'll care their older brothers have been gone for three months versus when we saw them everyday. My mom also stresses me the hell out, and there's this whole situation I probably won't talk about and honestly I don't even know what to make of it. I'm so stressed out, and there's so many new changes. I'm not ready and I don't know what to do. I'm not qualified to do anything anyone says I can do, I'm not enough right now and maybe in the future I will be, but I'm not sure right now in the present time. I've got to now go tough it up and be this pillar of enthusiasm for more than thirty people as their drum major, which is cool and I don't mind but I'm dealing with so much and realistically of course no one cares, and I get that because you've got to focus on yourself but I'm just so sad. I'm so bothered. I'm at a loss. An ""ATL"" if you will. Little more niche which also might get me hate if there's any homophobes or transphobes here, but realizing I'm queer makes things worse. I love being myself first of all, but the fact everyone I know will hate and be disgusted by me because I'm queer. There's so much to deal with, I think I'm overwhelmed."
319,1,I know he‚Äôs joking but it‚Äôs so annoying he really ruins the whole moment by making me feel shitty like I‚Äôm not even flat chested I have boobs but they just aren‚Äôt big ! I want implants already. 
320,2,"Okay this is a burner account because I do not want him harassing me on my main account. I also have no idea who to tell and I just need to know if I am overthinking or overreacting. I wrote a whole essay but decided to delete it all because it had too much personal information. He lives in my town and I had to get a restraining order on him because he was really abusive and harassing me after we broke up and was stalking me so I am scared that if he finds this and figure out it‚Äôs me he‚Äôs going to hurt me.. anyway, me and him started dating when I was 16 and he was 20. He ended up sexually assaulting me after i refused to have sex with him and I ended up getting pregnant and he left me as soon as he found out. It was a thing before we knew each other that he would sleep with women and try to get them pregnant but I didn‚Äôt know about that till after we broke up. Anyways long story short and as minimal details as I can put, I found his secret Facebook account through a marketplace post that I knew was from him and found out that he‚Äôs friends with and taking to a bunch of underaged girls, like around the age of 13 (some of their ages were in their bios) and I feel disgusted. I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôs going to do what he did to me to them‚Ä¶ some of the are posting suggestive pictures of themselves too and he‚Äôs liking them. He‚Äôs also following a bunch of OF models and pornstars which is only feeding his lust (and I‚Äôm not assuming, this is what he did while we were dating too. He would follow all these girls and lust over them and then try to initiate something on me because I was the only girl around I guess) and also while we were dating I found him looking and porn art of underaged anime characters and he said that it‚Äôs just a character and it‚Äôs not real. I just feel like Im going to throw up and I genuinely think he‚Äôs like a pedophile or something but I can‚Äôt accept that I dated a pedophile. After therapy I found out and came to terms that I was groomed by him but i didn‚Äôt know that he was doing that same thing to younger girls. I‚Äôm sorry if none of this makes sense, I‚Äôm kind of just rambling and it‚Äôs late at night and I can‚Äôt sleep‚Ä¶ am I overthinking this or is he actually a pedophile and what do I do????"
321,3,"I go to a job that pays well but my boss sucks. I come home to a wife that doesn't take care of the things I've asked her a million times to take care of. I pay bills but there are always more. There is always another task to do around the house when I'm not working. 

I'm literally just done. I want to quit my job, divorce my wife, move into an apartment, and just play golf in my free time. I think I'd be so much happier just living by myself instead of being let down by all the people around me. It's so exhausting. "

323,1,"I know what I did was wrong but you never put any effort in. It was always me that talked to you. You never reached out once. Yet your posting stuff about how your hurt and how much pain your in. When you're just playing victim. I know me not talking to you probably made you feel different about me but you never showed any interest towards me. I only heard compliments through your friend. Not actually from you. It's been months since we talked. I have so many ???? with no answers to them. Did you like me? Did you play me? Did I mean nothing to you? Why end it how you did? Saying you deserve better but then act like your hurt? Your the one who left. I wrote a letter with 6000 plus words that explained everything and that means nothing? If actions speak louder then words why didn't you show me interest? You never talked to me, made me feel like you didn't want to. You ruined me dear. I can't look in the mirror without being disappointed. Feels like I'm unlovable. Struggling eating. Doing horrible habits because of how you see me. It feels like my only friend won't even talk to me either. What did you tell him? I don't know what I did to deserve this. I'm convinced that it was actually my fault. I never meant to hurt you. That's not who I am. I told you why I'm the way I am, the reason why I'm so insecure. But you never tried to help, or talk to me about it. I'm sorry my love. You ruined me. Destroyed me. You've won."
324,2,"A couple months ago my mom asked me to pack the dishes so I was going to. She said I couldn't listen to music so I got a bit upset but went to pack the dishes anyway. She elbowed me really hard in the back and I got confused. She started yelling at me and told me to stop packing the dishes. I said it was fine and I was going to continue. She got mad but I held my ground. Then she pinned me to the wall and started choking me. I was so scared I started screaming. She let me go eventually and then she opened the door and tried to kick me out. I said no and we started yelling at each other. 

I was screaming at her and she was just ignoring me. I went to my room and told my friends. They started comforting me and I cried. She called me and then she fell to her knees and started begging. I told her that she's being so unfair to me and I started yelling again. She tried to make herself the victim but I kept on yelling until she got my point. I went to my room and locked my door. She's been crying loudly while saying ""please forgive me"". She asked me to forgive her so she can sleep at night knowing she has my forgiveness but I told her she doesn't deserve that from me. A day or two had passed of me being more distant with her until she got upset with me. 

Her explanation as to why she did that was to show me that she was stronger than me and could kill me if she wanted to. Idk if that was supposed to make me feel better or something. Anyway it's been a couple of months since then and she hasn't hit me since. I have a boyfriend now and she gets irrationally angry with me and calls me a slut or tells me to focus on my schoolwork. I don't go out with my friends. I'm not allowed to leave the house at all, not even to go to the park. I can't go to school events. But I'm still not sure if she's abusive or if I'm just being dramatic. It's not like she beats me everyday or anything. And doesn't everyone have to deal with insults like that? I don't know anymore.

325,0,"You are on a bus in the air. Shut up and sit down.

If your kids cannot handle a flight, do not put them on one. They don‚Äôt get to go. That‚Äôs the rule. Drive where you need to go, adapt to the fact that your kids can‚Äôt fly, and accept that there are some vacations you can‚Äôt take because you made a choice to have kids. They don‚Äôt get to run up and down aisles and climb over seats and play their Bluey with no headphones.

And the kids that are crying are crying because you are literally torturing your kids. Great parenting.

This also applies to adults ‚Äî you are also in a bus in the air. You also need to shut up and sit down. Can‚Äôt sit for the duration of the flight? Can‚Äôt hold your bladder for more than an hour? Join the kids and adapt to the fact that you just can‚Äôt fly.

And this isn‚Äôt a social event. It‚Äôs a mode of transportation. You don‚Äôt need to get up and go talk to your friends who are sitting elsewhere and you don‚Äôt need to get hammered on alcoholic drinks for your 3 hour flight. If you do, you‚Äôre an alcoholic‚Äî seek help. Genuinely, seek help.

326,1,"I‚Äôve had this life long experience where I just feel like no matter how much I practice, no matter how much dedication and passion i have for something I just am not good at it. Like everything l've ever tried to get into (and l've tried many different careers, talents like sports or instruments, Skills, trades ect) and nothing works out for me. and every time I tried to progress and get good at it I just fail 
over. 
And. 
Over. 
And. 
Over.
And. 
Over. 
I don't give up prematurely, I REALLY try to keep practicing! I just can't take the mental strain of failing for months or even years. I‚Äôve really really try to stay consistent. Like why can't I do anything past a mediocre skill set. nothing I do works out for me and I kinda feel useless. It dosnt feel good to loose over and over and over again in life at all. People just say ""you can't give up"" but l've tried that for YEARS I've tried to find my thing, what I'm good at or whatever and like I said it dont work out for me and I need to move on from the thing at some point. I fear I have no future because Im either not good at anything or grow to really dislike doing the thing because I can‚Äôt get good no matter what. And again because I know people will comment this- I have been consistent with practice with the things I want to do, but I get stuck and don‚Äôt progress at all. Like some kind of mental block. Am I just untalented or incapable of doing anything requiring skill? "
327,1,"My father LOVED Rush Limbaugh. 

Ever see the bojack episode free curro when he is in the car with his dad? - that was my childhood except we also had rush spouting out his hate.

But you wanna know the worst part? Guess who has the same birthday as rush Limbaugh? That‚Äôs right me. 

I swear the only reason my sperm donor knew my birthday was because of rush limbaugh, he never failed to mention that it was Rush‚Äôs birthday on my own.

We lived in rural bumbfuck Florida so of course everyone else knew and liked rush - thought he was the bees knees. Hell they loved him as much as they loved Robert E Lee and fantasizing about the south rising again. 

I know it‚Äôs bad to speak poorly of the dead but goddamn do I hate him. I‚Äôm so glad I never have to hear his voice again

328,2,"Title pretty much says it all, I'm Gen Z, when I was a kid I was living of the age of the 3DS, TV, and YouTube becoming more mainstream. 

I'm incredibly grateful I was born JUST before it became normalized to let an iPad distract your baby because I was instead, drawing, reading, and playing child friendly games. 

However, I can not tell you how many times I begged my parents to take me to the park, or to the zoo, or to let me go to a friend's house only to be met with ""You're too young"" or ""Not now I'm tired"" only to be scolded for watching too much TV 

As I grew older it became more frustrating because I think they were more paranoid for me because I'm a girl, but I remember getting insanely skeptical when I'd watch a movie starring kids my age. And their parents would just let them do whatever as long as they got home before nighttime, to which my father would brag about how he was always outside as a kid and almost never in the house with his buddies and it made me feel incredibly angry especially since my mom and grandparents had similar stories of doing whatever for hours. 

As I kept getting older I kept waiting for MY opportunity to do that too, but it pretty much never came because they were convinced I'd be murdered. 

When I was 17, I was visiting my father during summer break, while he left for work he would explicitly tell me I'm not allowed to leave the house. I asked him if I could least go to this park that's a 5 minute walk away for an hour an he said ""No, I can see on the cameras if you leave the house and if you do you're grounded.""

So of course if I didn't have anymore inspiration to draw I'd have no choice but to watch TV to which he would STILL get mad because ""Don't tell me you just watched TV all day.""

Now parents are just straight up giving their toddlers iPads then complaining that they're always on it and that they cry when they can't have it.

TAKE THEM SOMEWHERE THEN FFS

YOU ARE THE PARENT 

LET YOUR KIDS MAKE MEMORIES "
329,0,"Up until the age of about 15 I believed in the supernatural not because I experienced anything supernatural but because it was something I was always heavily interested in and I always tried to experience. I went to places that were haunted, I fucked with Ouija boards anything you can think of in a movie that would attract supernatural attention or cause supernatural shit to happen. I did it and I experienced nothing, even whenever I would break the rules. Bloody Mary, Candyman, Ouija boards everything. I tried everything to get a supernatural encounter and nothing ever came of any of it and that is why I no longer believe in the supernatural. Anytime I say this to someone who does believe in the supernatural they start recounting their personal experience with the supernatural and my response is always ""okay. If that's what you saw and you believe it was supernatural, that's cool."" But it's like that's not a good enough answer for them. It's like their personal experience needs to define what I believe even though I wasn't there and I didn't experience it. "

331,3,"I've decided to make this school year lighter and easier to me but I just realized that it might not be possible after all.

Our teachers for this semester are mostly shitty. I don't think there's even one decent teacher who cares about student's mental health there. One teacher is biased and only likes students who can dance well (I can't dance for shit). Another teacher is a pedo, and another is lazy af when it comes to teaching and makes tests that you can't answer due to his shitty teaching. Thanks to all the stress, I'm starting to take it out on my mom and it's making me feel guilty.

I'm trying my best to think everything will turn out fine but honestly, I'm starting to think that it won't. I'm aiming for multiple scholarships but my situation rn is making it difficult. I've got students around me who have connections and knows how to suck up on teachers. I've got none. 

My previous grades were really great. But with things rn, my grades might fall back even more. I just want my life to be light-hearted, I hate having to face these shitty, bitter af teachers"
332,2,I pay over $250 a session for an hour session with a therapist but the last two sessions have been for 15-20mins each and yet I‚Äôm still being charged full price.

333,2,"This isn't an excuse of going to the gym. I really do want to go but the idea of being judged for not knowing what the heck I'm doing 90% of the time really terrifies me. I used to go with my friend, but after I caught a person staring at me after I was clearly using a machine wrong I never went back. I really do want to start going back but I can't overcome this fear of being judged and it's frustrating. I live at a university dorm, so I can't really workout much at my dorm room with my roommate around. I try to sneak one or two workout sessions in my room whenever I can. The gym hours on campus are super short too, and usually overlap with times I have classes (taking summer classes, and the summer hours for the gym are very limited). I want to get rid of this fear of being judged but I don't know how and it makes me feel stuck in my head at times."
334,0,"I am tired of the worst sorts of humans going ""HAHAHA you're so triggered!"" Every time someone is just correcting them or countering whatever moronic thing they said. 

Firstly, these people get off on thinking they caused a negative emotional reaction in another person, and like, why is that something you think is funny? Decent, mentally stable, mature people don't go around trying to intentionally cause someone else emotional upset. It's WEIRD. 

Secondly, 99% of the time, that person isn't even having an emotional reaction, they're just conversing and having a different viewpoint, so you just look like an idiot for going ""OMG LOOK AT YOU SO TRIGGERED!"" 

Thirdly, an ACTUAL trigger is something that is associated with PTSD. If someone survived a war zone and hears fireworks, that could cause them to have a panic attack and a flashback to when they watched all their friends get blown up and send them into an altered mental state for hours or days. Someone grabbing someone from behind could trigger them because that's how their rapist overpowered them during their attack causing them to have to re-live that moment. Triggering someone for real is a terrible, painful, traumatic thing to do to another person, that can interfere with their ability to function normally, and if you do something on purpose to a person with PTSD knowing it's a trigger, you're a despicable human being. 

It's not something to joke about. Worst case scenario, you're causing lasting intential harm, best case scenario, you've got the cognitive functioning of a child who intentionally annoys people with words they don't understand. When my brother was 7 he saw ""Hasbro"" written on the side of a toy and started calling everyone that as an insult. That's what y'all remind me of. 

And before any of the imbeciles I'm referring to get in the comments and go ""HAHAHA you're so triggered you are triggered about being triggered!"" Nah, I'm chill, just wish y'all could have a real conversation without all this middle school level buffoonery."
335,1,"I‚Äôm (almost) 35 years old and (recently) a mum of 2. I have a 7 year old daughter and an almost 9 week old son.

All I feel is guilt. And shame. 

Guilt about not having 100% attention to dedicate to either child. That my eldest is going from all my free time attention to half. That my baby isn‚Äôt getting the same 100% of my attention at this age that his older sister got. 

Guilt about not knowing how to properly engage and play with my daughter anymore while the baby is awake and needing developmental stimulation. I‚Äôm not two people. I don‚Äôt know how to give them each what they need and deserve. I freeze and end up doing nothing especially creative with either. More guilt. More shame. 

Guilt about the house being such a mess and not having the ability to deal with it. I have the time, but I freeze.

Just this morning my husband left to take the eldest to school and go to work. Baby was still sleeping so I tried to take the opportunity to go back to bed. I‚Äôm lying in bed writing this post. I‚Äôve been here for an hour and I‚Äôve accomplished NOTHING. 

I couldn‚Äôt sleep because I was so busy worrying about how I should be having a desperately needed shower, or at least make the bed, or put away the clean laundry, put on a load of dirty laundry, wash the baby‚Äôs bottles, clear the hall or just even clear the art supplies off the dining room table so we can eat there together later. But I‚Äôm so tired and I just want to sleep. So I haven‚Äôt done any of those things but I also haven‚Äôt slept. I have wasted an entire hour lying in guilt and self loathing and sadness. 

I am tired but baby already sleeps through the night, so I have no excuse to be tired. I should be elated. (I don‚Äôt sleep through the night because every squeak of the baby or rustle of the dogs wakes me, but that‚Äôs my own fault.) More guilt and shame. I feel like a lazy cow. I am fat, so I don‚Äôt want to eat. I feel how hungry I am but can‚Äôt stomach the thought of food during the day when I‚Äôm alone because every bite I take makes me feel disgusting. But then at night I‚Äôm starving so I eat too much and snack and keep myself fat. And I‚Äôm disgusting. More guilt. More shame. 

And the worst part of it all - the reason I need to vent here - is that I have no one to talk to about it. No I‚Äôm asking for friends. I have family and a few acquaintances locally, and some dear friends back in another country I once lived in, but I can‚Äôt talk to any of them about any of this. My friends are too far away to do anything so they‚Äôll worry and I‚Äôll feel guilty. My acquaintances are just that, acquaintances so it‚Äôs entirely inappropriate to trauma dump like this. My parents are dealing with my younger siblings who are in very difficult situations themselves so I can‚Äôt burden them with my shit too. More guilt.  

If I do tell anyone, even just a hint of what‚Äôs going on, I can‚Äôt listen to another damned platitude about this being ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and to give myself ‚Äúa break‚Äù. I will either get pitiful sad expressions or exasperated sighs. Or I will be told ‚Äúeverything will be alright‚Äù and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, be happy‚Äù and the worst ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let this pull you down. You are in control‚Äù so this is all my own fault and I should just choose not to be sad and guilt ridden? Thanks. More guilt. More shame. 

So here I am. Sitting my fat ugly ass silently in my unmade bed, with my unwashed hair, in my unkempt room, crying to myself in silence because my beautiful, healthy, baby (whom I am beyond grateful for and yet I am still sad which fills me with even more guilt) will soon be stirring and needs me and I have WASTED an entire hour (and a half now, with composing this post üò≠) worrying about what I *should* have been doing rather than trying to sleep while desperately wanting to sleep and so now I have accomplished nothing. And I am exhausted. And dirty. And hungry. And fat. And sad. And I can‚Äôt tell anyone in my life about it because they will be worried about me, or irritated by me, or angry even because I should ‚Äúcount my blessings‚Äù, instead of ‚Äúwallowing‚Äù. 

I just need an opportunity to get this off my chest, and I can‚Äôt have another echo chamber conversation with chat gpt. It‚Äôs been a great lifesaver for those desperate ‚Äúscream into the void‚Äù moments but right now I just really need to tell another living breathing human being about these feelings and how they are draining the life right out of me. And that I feel guilty and ashamed about it. 

Baby‚Äôs not awake yet. But I can‚Äôt do anything because I expect he‚Äôll wake at any moment I don‚Äôt want to be irritable if he wakes me shortly after finally dozing off but also not soaking wet in a shower when he cries, or elbow deep in wet dishes either‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôll probably just sit here and cry in frozen paralysis some more. More guilt. More shame. 

Thank you for letting me get this off my chest. 
I appreciate it.

I sometimes wonder if love is real but I feel like it has to bc I see it all the time bc I‚Äôve friend who are married and have kids and stuff.Which also makes me feel like an odd girl out bc all my friends have boyfriends,husbands,and families and I haven‚Äôt gotten that yet.Two centuries and two years I still haven‚Äôt gotten it.I just don‚Äôt understand why I never get anything romantic?!

Is it bc of my autism?Or bc I‚Äôm trans MTF?Or bc I‚Äôm honest about the things I want?Or maybe I ask people too early if they like me and the only reason I ask is bc I just want to make sure and I‚Äôm just not dooming myself?

Like why am I so unlovable?People tell me how attractive I am but I feel like if I‚Äôm so attractive then why don‚Äôt people approach me?(I‚Äôm the one who usually has to do the approaching which I hate doing) Why don‚Äôt people ask me out?Why do I feel like I always have to make the first move even know I know I don‚Äôt have to?

Anyhow, after twenty columbine shooter thirst traps i stumbled upon this one account, it seems to be a teenage girl that is fucking obsessed with serial killers, mass murders and people that have taken their own life, she regurally post about how she wants and plans to kill herself and film it, also videos of her harming herself in extreme ways. From the looks of it, she's most likely abused and or neglected and she's posted about being taken advantage of as a kid. I feel so fucking bad for her jesus.

340,0,"I finally, FINALLY, gained weight.

After barely managing an eating disorder for what would be seven years now, ive finally made real progress. For so long I was in that limbo of not gaining weight but I wasn't losing it. I still wasn't really eating enough, I felt awful, I was exhausted all the time, I despised my body.

It's only 10ish pounds. But God I feel so much better in every way. I feel so much more confident, I'm able to eat until I'm full rather than when I feel guilty. I have more energy to do things, I dont oversleep anymore. Even my sex life is significantly more enjoyable.

I've never felt so much like myself. I've been able to speak my mind more, set boundaries, work through emotions. Even when those thoughts start to creep in it's so much easier to brush them off. I'm able to look at my reflection for longer than a few seconds. I dont avoid looking at myself when changing or bathing.

I'm starting to truly love myself and I can't even begin to describe how incredible it feels. To finally have progress. To finally start to like the way I look. To be able to see myself and appreciate myself.

It certainly helps that my closest people have noticed and encouraged me. My best friend is proud, my mom has said I look great and she can tell I feel better. My boyfriend literally cannot stop complimenting me and will not shut up about how beautiful I look and how proud he is of me for getting to this point.

It gets so much better and I wish I could tell my younger self that. That there's better ways to feel in control, that you should love yourself, and a little extra not only looks good but makes you feel good.

I'm proud of myself."

When I'm with them in the voice chat they talk A LOT about their crushes or just in general women in the past that they knew of. They always drop comments about their features that they find attractive. For example, chest and butt or even facial features. They talk rarely about the girls accomplishments or even congratulate them. On top of that why do they feel comfortable to talk about these things with me in that voice chat.. l've just had enough and it makes me sick to my stomach. I just feel extremely alone in all of this plus feel like men are just lustful.

You don't have to read this part it's a bit long:
What's even worse is that there's this one guy that's in the discord that I dated that talks like this as well. We dated for three weeks and he played the part right of what you should do while you date. A day after he showed me everything was fine, over a phone call he told me that we should stay friends.. and that he wants me in his life because I'm a ""great person"". Even though the day before he kissed me and held me.. NOT ONLY THAT.. after everything he implied heavily that he wanted to be FWB. Just a lot of crap. I thought I was over everything but I heard him talk in the discord chat that he had this work crush on a girl for two years. And I understand I was basically nothing and I have no claim or any of t It just hurts to know that men like this can be sc wishy washy. And just think with what's between their legs rather than with their heart and soul.

If you read everything thank you. I know it's all a mess and I would love to clarify things if you need me to. I just feel extremely lost, confused and heart stricken. Plus lonely. I just needed to let this go."

346,1,"I could write novels on this, but I'll do my best to respect everyone's time.

Grew up in a severely abusive household for 20 years, then got a low paying full time job and lived in a poor area. Lost that living situation and was homeless briefly. Joined the army for three hot and a cot where I watched a patient die, then had a friend die; developed a real drinking problem after that. Got medically discharged. Lived in Arkansas for a bit where landlords literally have no legal need to make a space livable so they didn't, moved back to the PNW. Cool? Cool. Now here's where I'm at:

It's not all bad. Got family and friends here, slowly getting set up with the VA, went from drinking a bottle a night to a relapse now and then but otherwise sober. And it's...hard. It's real hard. I have chronic pain and PTSD and at every turn either the VA is like pulling teeth or things keep breaking down that I have to replace. I don't like most people around me. And I keep wondering: if after everything I went through life is mostly ""meh"", why did I bother? No seriously I don't even mind death but if most of life is just the absence of acute pain with a few blips of happiness (while practicing mindfulness), why? I know I don't check out to spare my family and friends but if \~30 years of endless herculean effort was for ""meh""...yeah that ROI sucks.

Tw: Pedophilia mentioned 

  
   I'm 17. My friend is 16 and he's currently going out with a 43 YEAR OLD MAN. For context: my friend has been finding men around this age from the internet and going out with them, even doing sexual stuff with them. It's been going on for a very long time. And everytime he'd mention it to me I'd always tell him how messed up those old guys are to go out with a vulnerable teenager and that they're not good people, that they want to take advantage of him. He's never cared, he'd always brush me off or yell at me for 'not supporting him.' He's even called me homophobic for not being okay with him doing all that even though I, as a girl, literally have a girlfriend. And the fact he's a guy who likes guys is definitely not the problem here. üò≠

  Now like a month or two has passed ever since, and he's going out with 43 year old who is the DEFINITION of a groomer. He tells my friend things such as 'you're so mature for your age', 'I feel like I'm talking with an adult when I'm talking with you', 'You look much older than you are'- and my friend just eats it up. He doesn't view it as manipulation and yesterday night he kept sending me messages about how much he likes this guy, how happy he makes him, how he supposedly doesn't care about just sex 'like all the others' and he might be in love- And when I tell you I literally felt like PUKING while reading these messages. The prospect of a 43 year old man being with 16 year old is incredibly disturbing to me and as he continued talking about all the things they did I started genuinely feeling sick to my stomach. Worst part? My friend kept DEMANDING I answer his texts. It felt like I couldn't avoid it. And since I know that he doesn't care no matter how much I try to make him understand that this is wrong- I just sucked it up and gave him half assed replies about how happy I am for him and how I'm glad about this guy caring about him. This PEDOPHILE. And I feel dirty. I feel so messed up for being fake 'supportive' of this situation. And there's genuinely nothing I can do. 

  And before anyone mentions it- the police are a no. They're not going to do anything, police are shit in our country and it'll only out him as gay to his terrible unsupportive parents. It'll do more harm than good. And I'm so scared one of those guys he goes out with will end up doing something even worse to him. 

  It's so messed up. And again, I feel messed up too for saying what he wants to hear and pretending this is okay. I don't want to hear him talk about it. I've been feeling physically sick all day just by thinking about this whole thing. But I don't know how to tell him without making him feel bad or like I'm attacking him. I really don't know what to do or say. I'm just trying to ignore him rn. "
349,0,"When I wake up in the morning, I need at least 20 minutes, after I open my eyes, where I don‚Äôt have to talk to anyone and no one talks to me. I can smoke my morning cigarette (I know, nasty habit, bite me) and drink my coffee in peaceful silence. 

I rarely ever get to do that since my babygirl wakes up pretty much as soon as I get out of the bed, unless I decide to wake up a little earlier than usual, then she‚Äôll stay sleeping sometimes. But I don‚Äôt ever wake up early bc I‚Äôm always exhausted and if I‚Äôm being honest, just a little bit lazy. 

But this morning I forced myself. The one morning I actually get my ass out of bed to hopefully complete my morning ritual. 

I carefully got out of bed, opened my bedroom door, peaked my head out into the hallway and heard silence in the rest of the house. Almost giddy with anticipation, I quietly made my way to the kitchen, made my coffee and grabbed my cigarettes, excitedly tip toed to the back door, opened the sliding glass door, took one step out onto the back patio and what do I see? My mother in law.

Now I don‚Äôt mind this woman, most of the time, MOST OF THE TIME. We actually have a pretty decent relationship. The problem with her is that she talks‚Ä¶ALL THE TIME. She‚Äôs a talker. I mean, she doesn‚Äôt need a prompt or an invitation, she doesn‚Äôt even need an audience.  Sometimes she doesn‚Äôt even take a breath while she‚Äôs talking. And she doesn‚Äôt just talk about one thing, she jumps from one subject to another so fast your head will spin. I mean sometimes it‚Äôs so bad that you literally have to just walk away while she‚Äôs in the middle of talking.

It wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if you could actually have a conversation with her. But she also fits snuggly into a category of people that I call ‚Äúone-uppers‚Äù. You know the people I‚Äôm talking about‚Ä¶no matter what anyone says in conversation‚Ä¶if you did something, these people have done it too, but better. If you had something bad or traumatic happen to you, they‚Äôve had it worse. If you were sick for a week, they were sick for a month. If something good happened to you, they‚Äôre gonna tell you what happened to them and it‚Äôs gonna be better. 

No matter what, they always steer the conversation back to them. Thinking that maybe I was being too hard on her, I‚Äôve tried multiple times to really have a conversation with her. We‚Äôre talking multiple times over the 7 years I‚Äôve been with my husband. And it happens every. single. time. 

Sometimes I‚Äôll try to just power through and ignore the fact that she makes everything about her in some form or fashion but I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that it‚Äôll never happen. And there‚Äôs no use in telling her about herself because people don‚Äôt change. Not really anyway‚Ä¶sure our opinions may change over time maybe even some personality traits change but who we are inherently at our core, that doesn‚Äôt change. And her jibber jabber is just a part of who she is. She is who she is and there‚Äôs no changing her.

350,3,"This might sound extremely anti-climatic, but I'm taking this spring course a 6-week program, pretaining more for law and business. In which I initially thought was a pretty easy course, however I'm doing bad in the course like really bad.

For the first quiz, I completely bombed it, I failed the quiz. Now that opened my eyes to actually lock in and study for the midterm, in which I did. But when the mid-term came around I got a 73, which isn't bad, I got higher then the class average, but it's the fact the people and friends around me got 90's. Now I know comparison is the theif of joy, I'm happy and delightful for my mark but that isn't the main issue. Just today we had out 2nd quiz and I barely passed for a 55%.

But she has come to the conclusion that she isn‚Äôt comfortable going to these events without him.

Im very heartbroken by this choice. We have been best friends for about 10 years.

I‚Äôm not sure our friendship will ever be the same, regardless of her boyfriend, her choosing not to come to these big life events, I wont be able to forget that. She wont be in pictures, or memories there.

I may be able to forgive her one day but i definitely wont be able to forget this.

352,1,"I was just feeling depressed and shitty and decided to read through some old texts with an ex. Me and this girl have known each other since we were like 9/10 maybe younger and were kind of on and off for a few years from 12 onwards, obviously nothing very serious cause we were so young but we had a history. At maybe 15 we had a big argument, about what I can‚Äôt remember now, probably nothing, we didn‚Äôt speak for a few years until early 2023 when I was 17 nearly 18 she messaged me, we started talking and eventually started something, never a relationship always a situationship. I think she liked me but didn‚Äôt take it as seriously as I did, we were exclusive and did all things people in relationships do she just never wanted to call it that. At the time I thought I was in love with her, which I‚Äôve realised recently wasn‚Äôt love but a complete obsession, I always wanted to be with her or texting her. At the time I was really struggling with my mental health, I still am but not as much as before this all started, I think I had probably never felt as happy as I did when I was with her, after about 7 months she started getting distant and I could sense it was ending, when I asked her if it was she said she thought it probably would be. I went ballistic, not angry but extremely emotional and got more depressed than I had ever been. I remember asking her why she wanted to end it and her answer was she didn‚Äôt know why, she just knew she had to end it, at the time I couldn‚Äôt tell why but my guess now is because I was borderline insane. A few weeks before this I told her I loved her so I was very serious about this relationship. About a month after it ended I called her, a lot, I got extremely drunk and spam called her, the next day I got a text asking to never contact her again, to delete every picture I had of her etc etc, that‚Äôs the last communication I had with her. It‚Äôs not nearly 2 years later and I still can‚Äôt get her off my mind so I read through the texts and that‚Äôs where I realised I was a scumbag, I always knew I was wrong with what I did because a few mutual friends of ours said they were going to completely cut her off for breaking my heart but I asked them not to as she was a lovely person and if they were going to cut anyone off it should be me since I was in the wrong, I just never realised how wrong I was. I‚Äôm now 20 writing this at 4am trying to think of ways to justify myself, not with her because I know that ship has sailed, but with myself. I‚Äôve had these horrible thoughts about myself a lot throughout my entire life but they‚Äôre becoming rampant now,. My life isn‚Äôt going very far as I didn‚Äôt get into college since I put 0 effort into my exams, I can blame depression and anxiety and everything else all I want but at the end of the day I didn‚Äôt bother. I‚Äôve been experimenting more and more with drugs lately, mainly coke which I can also feel I‚Äôm not developing a good relationship with. I don‚Äôt see any light at the end of the tunnel. I don‚Äôt like bothering my friends with this type of stuff so I‚Äôm posting here."

It all started after I paid a Massachusetts toll online and was required to put my phone number in. And guess what? All the spam calls I'm getting are spoofed to Massachusetts numbers. I don't even live in Massachusetts! Hmmmmm isn't that a right fucking coincidence?!?! 

I don't know if it's actually the DOT giving out personal info or if they have poor security and someone was able to scrape numbers off their database somewhere. Idk how it works. But either way, this is totally unacceptable and I'm pissed.

355,1,"Hello everyone,


I was just looking through my camera roll and it brought up some emotions. I don‚Äôt want to bother a real life friend with this rambling so I will bother you guys.

Approximately 2 years ago, when I was 23 (M) I made a mistake that would have a significant impact on the rest of my life. 


My friend had recently recommended a hairspray that was apparently a miracle for him at his new workplace. Me, being in a very hot climate, figured hair spray would be better than pomade so I purchased it. Used it few times without issue. I‚Äôd style with texture powder and finish with the spray. However, after using it one day, I decided to leave it in way too long. Three nights to be exact. I guess I liked how my hair was and wanted to keep the fluff for a presentation I had.

The morning after I washed it out I experienced shedding that was extremely concerning. My scalp was evidently nuked, and the shedding just wouldn‚Äôt stop.

A month goes by, I ask the internet and I‚Äôm told product doesn‚Äôt cause shedding. Go to the dermatologist, diagnosed with telogen effluvium AND seborrheic dermatitis. 

Months go by, shedding doesn‚Äôt stop. But I‚Äôm not SUPER stressed because it‚Äôs not male pattern baldness which means it‚Äôll grow back. And I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm staying within the 100 hairs per day which is supposedly normal. I‚Äôm still living my normal life, just more self conscious about my scalp and being extremely cautious about what I ate. Eating sugar, for instance, would make my hair shed instantly.

A few months goes by, I‚Äôm taking supplements, doing research on Seb derm, using ketokonazole  shampoo, making one progress. 

However, I made the mistake of not taking care of my mental and emotional wellbeing, not managing stress, and disregarding healthy sleep habits. I did not intentionally stress myself out, it just seems that it‚Äôs how my mind operates and sometimes I don‚Äôt even realize how high strung I‚Äôve been internally.

One day, I simply became allergic to shampoo. Head and shoulders, aveeno, free and clear, seen, everything would fry my hair to almost nothing and cause intense shedding that would last 3 days.

Resorted to washing with water because I didn‚Äôt know what else to do. ACV rinse didn‚Äôt seem to help whatsoever.

And then, I noticed the thinning. As a 24 year old in a family of people with beautiful hair, I essentially went off the rails at this point. I felt I was too young to be faced with the decision of hair loss meds, and even more so, I HATED myself for every single mistake that led to that point. A million bad decisions, overlooked treatments, carelessness, lack of urgency, all of it led to me having to deal with male pattern baldness at 24, when, in my mind,I shouldn‚Äôt have had to even think about it until I was 40+.

So, I developed unhealthy coping mechanisms while being overwhelmed by the world of allergies and contact dermatitis that I was having to learn quickly. I also noticed I was experiencing a weird reaction in my lymph area when touching plastic. I almost fainted after unwrapping a new keyboard, and touching my computer mouse would cause my lymph nodes to raise. I was stressed about a decision regarding finasteride which supposedly had life-altering side effects. I fell off the wagon. Essentially gave up on taking care of myself, stopped going to the gym because 1. My Seb derm diet was making it hard to get enough protein and cals for the gym to do anything, and 2. I felt I couldn‚Äôt effectively wash my hair. I got my only C in my online master‚Äôs degree program during this period. 

What ultimately kept me stuck was my hatred toward myself. I couldn‚Äôt believe things had gotten this out of hand, and that I could‚Äôve stopped it on so many occasions. The culprit for the new allergies may have partially been a new detergent I bought that had additional fragrances compared to our usual. I didn‚Äôt know about histamine or chemical allergies, so I thought ‚Äúeh, who cares.‚Äù

It may have been the stress of building a PC at the time, but it was certainly worsened by my inability to understand histamine and my body‚Äôs response to foods that contain it. 

This past year has been the loneliest and emptiest year of my life, and it‚Äôs a year I‚Äôll never get back. My hair is in very bad shape, I‚Äôm down about 25 pounds, and I feel as though I‚Äôm starting life from scratch.

I understand one could read this and say ‚Äúdude, it‚Äôs just hair, why do you care so much.‚Äù But it was more so that I felt I inflicted all of this on myself. And I work from home so I‚Äôd ruminate on my mistakes alone, all day. I was full of histamine which I believe severely intensified my OCD. I wasn‚Äôt able to stop ruminating on the past until I started supplementing vitamins D+K. I didn‚Äôt know it‚Äôd have that effect, but, it did. 

I‚Äôve started on finasteride and will also be taking minoxodil when it arrives. I wish none of this ever happened. When I look at pictures of myself from 1-2 years ago I genuinely don‚Äôt recognize myself. I was a completely different person. Extremely ambitious and enjoying life. But now I feel like I‚Äôm ready to tap out. I dealt with an extremely embarrassing health issue in high school and college, but it pales in comparison to this period of my life.

Anyway, this was mostly for myself but if anyone was able to gain anything from it I‚Äôll be glad. Thank you.

5. I stop going to concerts. I stop talking to anyone. Finally go on a few dates, get my life back on track.

For the past two years, I (21F) have been going through a lot. For context, I grew up with a father who was both verbally and physically abusive. There were nights in my teenage years when he'd come home drunk and I'd physically have to take care of him. I cooked everything, cleaned everything, and on top of that, kept my high school grades in honors. When it came time to choose a path for my future, I didn‚Äôt choose for myself‚ÄîI chose for him. I gave up the dream I‚Äôd carried since I was a child, the one thing that ever truly felt like mine: a future in the arts. Instead, I pursued a degree I never wanted, hoping it would earn me the approval of a man who never once tried to understand me. He knew exactly what my dream was, ever since I was little I wanted the same thing, and he made sure to make me feel ashamed of it. In the final months of my senior year‚Äîright when college applications were due‚Äîhe told me he wouldn‚Äôt support me financially if I chose art school.

I graduated from high school at 19, and within the same week, I packed my bags and moved to a new city, far from home, to start college. I thought maybe a fresh start and a communications degree wouldn‚Äôt be so bad. For a while, it wasn‚Äôt. I made new friends, settled into my independence, and even found ways to bring art back into my life‚ÄîI did commissions on the side for a small band I found on TikTok, and for the first time in a while, I felt like I was building something of my own though I never drew for myself anymore. But by the end of my first semester, my dad‚Äîdespite his promises‚Äîpulled all financial support to build himself a new truck. I was forced to drop out and couldn't even finish the degree I picked for HIS approval. 

Without the structure and distraction of school, everything started to unravel. Ever since, I've been forced to finally feel the weight of everything that happened in my life. It's been a year since I dropped already, and I can't seem to move past it. My whole life, the idea of college has been shoved down my throat, and right now I feel like a failure for being unable to continue, even if it was a degree I wanted. I've been depressed, which has gotten worse due to my losing my retail job.   
  
 I tried my best to be a daughter that'd make him proud, but despite everything I did throughout high school and even in other aspects of my life, it was never enough. I was naive enough to think that anything with our relationship would change, and I still believed in him because he is my Dad. I'm not one of those people who believe that just because they are my parents, they have to pay. My only gripe is, why would you promise to support me in the first place?

I haven't been able to pick up a pencil or sit down at my keyboard to draw and write like I used to. I don't even care anymore that I couldn't go to art school, especially now with the rise of AI, I just want to be able to draw my characters and write my stories again. Two things that I've always been confident in were my abilities in art and writing. 

I'm not saying I'm the best author or artist out there, I know I'm not, and I'm not going to pretend that I am. But it was something I always took pride in. Even in college, I graduated from a writing class with an A+. Every time I try to write or draw now I feel like I have to force myself. My words in my writing feel messy and confused and my art is a fucking mess. I want to draw, but when I pick up my Apple pencil, I have no clue what to draw, and when I do, it doesn't meet my expectations.

And it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt have time. I‚Äôm currently unemployed, living with my long-term boyfriend, and looking into going back to cosmetology school. I had completed a program before and passed my state boards, but COVID fucked me on the hours I needed to get my license(my high school was also a vocational school, so it was one of the offered programs). I don‚Äôt even know what I want anymore. I just want to feel useful again. I just want to feel useful again. I want to feel like me again.

 I haven‚Äôt felt like myself in two years, ever since I left home. I know leaving was the right choice; I still believe that. I used to tell people that if I hadn‚Äôt gotten out, I wouldn‚Äôt have made it. And I stand by that. But somewhere along the way, I lost the version of me that felt most alive‚Äîthe one who created without hesitation. Creating has always been how I made sense of the world, how I understood myself. Without it, I feel unanchored, like I‚Äôm still here but missing something.   
  
Anyway, enough with the sad artist stuff. I just needed to get this out of my system. Thank you for reading."
363,2,"soo gonna spend five days with my family on vacation and um i do not feel so good bc i kinda got my sister really annoyed just now because of my shitty memory issues. ngl i don't want to be with her for the entirety of the vacation but we all have to stick together since it's a new place and all. also just got a sense of impending doom for some reason. like i will be the reason this vacation will fuck up or something. i mean...just memory issues at first lol. i'm honestly not looking forward to it especially when i made like THE only closest person to me upset bc of me being lazy. like ok way to fuck things up a few days before the trip üëç well we still have to act that we get along (which i genuinely feel like she's been doing since we were kids anyway idk she's a good liar) but it makes me so uncomfortable. i know she called me like a dead meat sack she has to carry around and take care of and like ok...shit

i'm the bad person here since i haven't been helping with the stuff we needed to do. and ngl i was so scared to ask her for anything because i know she will just get mad at me for being stupid but yea whatever....i don't like being with her too. like i do okay on my own in college but idfk when it's irl stuff it's suddenly hard lol. but yea i just feel like that ruins the feeling too like i don't feel excited for this trip i'm both extremely scared and feel like i will breakdown bc i gotta be around with someone that hates me."

366,0,"Not a serious post, but i still wanted to vent it out a bit.

I used to be really good at videogames, i was really good at all type of games (usually).  
this was because i played games and stuff every single day for years, but as i grew up i just started losing interest in actual ""videogames"" and started liking more laid back games like animal crossing and minecraft.

I recently started playing Sonic Unleashed, i remember being really good at sonic games as a kid, now i can barely maneuver sonic and stuff..

Its not like i dont have time to get better at them.. i just dont see why i should do it anymore, and im happy with that.

it doesnt really bother me emotionally, but i still wanted this to get out there cuz like. why not!

"
367,1,"I met this girl named Hannah. In the beginning, she made me feel safe. I even told her something I‚Äôd never told anyone which was deeply personal to me. She comforted me through it and made me feel like I mattered.

Yet over time, she grew distant. She once told me she was too busy to hang out with me for two weeks, and then I saw her hanging out with her friends the next day. I didn‚Äôt know why. I started to overthink everything. Eventually, I opened up to her about how I was feeling: that I missed how things used to be, that I felt like I didn‚Äôt matter anymore. I wasn‚Äôt trying to guilt her. I just needed clarity, honesty.

Her response? That I was ‚Äústarting to scare her.‚Äù That I was ‚Äúdesperate.‚Äù She brought up something I had no idea upset her: a time I saw her light on when I was on my way to get dinner. I texted her from outside her building, just to say hi. If she had told me it made her uncomfortable, I would‚Äôve apologized on the spot and cleared up the misunderstanding. But she never said a word about it until weeks later, when everything blew up.

Then I found out she had told her best friend Anna what happened. She knew that Anna was someone I cared about, and still told her a twisted version of what happened. And just like that, I could feel the shift. The distance. People I cared about started pulling away, and I had no way to defend myself because I didn‚Äôt even know what she told them. I stayed silent because I didn‚Äôt want to escalate things.

I spiraled. I fell into a deep depression. I stopped caring about school. I couldn‚Äôt focus. I cried to my mom, and I never open up to my parents. That‚Äôs how badly it shattered me. I even wound up starting therapy, despite avoiding it for years.

What hurts most is that she knew I was vulnerable. She saw every raw part of me because she encouraged me to. She told me she protects her friends and that she would protect me. She told me she was like a therapist to her friends.

And yet, she still twisted the narrative and left me to look like someone I wasn‚Äôt: like I was dangerous or obsessive. 

I just wish people talked to each other. That we said what hurt when it hurts instead of waiting until it explodes. I wish someone had asked for my side. 

And I wish Hannah didn't make Anna hate me."
368,3,"These past 5 years have been nothing short of Hell. Yes I've had laughs, enjoyed some decent food, learned a few things.. all in all I'm no where near where I should be.  although blaming others for your own failures is never the solution, trusting,depending on others , I've learned can potentially be one of the most damning mistakes you can make in life. In order for me to win i have an almost psychopathic viewpoint of life itself.

Everyone I've ever trusted has let me down and though I love them I can't depend on them and now I'm realizing I most likely never will."
369,2,"My (18F) Household is one that makes a lot of jokes. Like we'll say mean things, but it's widely understood to be sarcasm. We'll make fun of each other, but (normally) not for too long and once again, it's mutual. With one exception. 

  
My mom makes fun of people the longest. You screw up once around her and it's mentioned for the next year. Which is annoying by itself, however, there's an added thing that annoys me. You can't insult/make fun of her back. Recently, before bed, I turned off the lights in a room, and I forgot that mom had to cross through that room in order to get to bed. 

Normally, this issue would last for about 3 days before someone drops it, as frankly it's rather minor and not a big deal. She, however, has brought this up for the last week and it's still going. Additionally, she likes to add real world implications to her jokes. She's been using the ""I won't help pay for your college"" thing. As you can probably imagine, that's a rather serious issue for me. And it's just grating, y'know? 

Compared to other stuff here, this isn't a big deal. However, it gets annoying. This is more of a build-up of issues, as opposed to this single one. While it's not too bad, I just wanted to go somewhere where I feel I can actually complain about it. Thanks for reading (Idk how to close off a post correctly.)"
370,1,"26M. I have been in the dating market for some time now and wow its tough. Trying to Get a date is honestly a job on its own, with so many frustrations. I have been in 2 relationships since leaving high school and both of them in all honesty started of so wonderfully, there were no unnecessary games, I approached the girls, told them I found them attractive and they reciprocated then boom we were dating. Getting to know each other happened over time, it wasn't even about sex, just good vibes and companionship. As i've gotten older women are more pickier, more guarded or whatever. Its like I have to be more performative which honestly i fail to do. Idk why dating is so hard. 

Furthermore, I have a friend who's somewhat a player (ruthless w the game). Hes not even average looking, quite an unattractive guy !BUT! the amount of dates he gets w women is out of the roof and he has multiple relationships at the same time. You know how he does it? He lies! He lies about his job occupation - he usually sells the story about how hes some big wing portfolio manager at a top bank or sometimes he tells the women that he's father is a politician and women eat this up and he really has mastered getting into character, its amazing to watch. However he also mentions that its unsustainable hence he just gets what he wants then makes up some story to leave the situationship, I mean do i also have to lie to get some companionship, sex or whatever?

Lately I‚Äôve been seeing more people acting like there is one way autism presents, and that the rest are not ‚Äúactually‚Äù autistic. Some will even tag on something about it ‚Äúbeing trendy‚Äù, or ‚Äúhigh functioning‚Äù autistic people ‚Äútaking supports from the real ones‚Äù. 
I wish they would stop. People act as if being able to talk or make TikTok videos makes it impossible for someone to be autistic, but that‚Äôs false. Objectively. Autism in itself is not an intellectual disability - autistic people can have one, and we do struggle to communicate on average, but typing up a post or filming a video lets you control what others see! An autistic adult coming online to talk about their special interests or experiences rather than, I don‚Äôt know, uploading themselves having a meltdown *makes sense*. I appreciate whoever would do it willingly for the purpose of educating others, but it‚Äôs fair that we don‚Äôt want to be seen at our worst, especially when we already tend to have a hard time irl. Those of us who can work and go outside independently also tend to try very hard to ‚Äúfilter‚Äù our experiences, like practicing tones and expressions, rehearsing conversations, and carefully selecting our food/clothes/glasses/earmuffs/etc.

ASD runs in my family. I‚Äôm autistic, I can talk, and I am working through a STEM degree. I also struggle to take care of myself on a daily basis, the world is very loud and bright and can make me very unwell, and I have a hard time relating to people around me in real time because I can‚Äôt read tone and expressions. Everyday things like brushing my teeth can be overwhelming, I can only wear certain clothing and eat certain foods to avoid meltdowns, everything is very intense, I only really like to talk about things I‚Äôm interested in (if at all), I need a predetermined schedule to function, and I often end up making others feel off without even realizing. I get tired very easily, as well, because it‚Äôs kind of a lot. My limitations are my normal, I can‚Äôt turn them off, and everything will be loud and bright and kind of confusing forever, every day. I like myself, I can communicate, and I have people and things I love dearly, but I‚Äôm still autistic, and still disabled. I wish people could understand that without attempting to ‚Äúdebunk‚Äù my autism."
372,3,"It seems so small and minute, but my mother told me I was trying to argue her down when 1 I fucking wasn't, and 2 I ended up being right in the end. Today started out kind of ok and slowly went downhill. She's been fucking mean all damn day, mostly to me. After we got home she asks me if I'm ok and I say no (which is stupid, because when she asks me things along the lines of ""are you ok"" or ""does this upset you"" if you say anything but ""yes I am ok"" she comes up with every excuse as to why I'm not supposed to be upset and apparently have no right to be), then she hugs me and tells me Its going to be ok and to take a break. why does she fucking do that. she's disrespectful as hell to me and swears up and down that I'm doing wrong then wonders why I'm not fucking feeling well. Its literally like she picks random words I say and says they're disrespectful or my tone is wrong when it fucking isn't????? I feel like my body is slowly disintegrating after every rude comment, every insult, every argument. It's given me something like a nervous fucking tick. I avoid all conversations as much as possible because every one might be fucking loaded, and a lot more have been. I'm not sleeping well anymore, I don't end up eating much, I'm tired all the time, my jaw hurts from clenching it so much, my headaches are getting more frequent, its affecting every aspect of my health. I can't even cry anymore, it feels almost like not being able to breathe. I wish typing this out would make it go away. I wish my mother never had a daughter. I would have been better off without. But instead of doing what I really want to, I'm going to build my chair. Just what the fuck man. "
373,0,"Like wtf üôÑ

Obviously I don‚Äôt mean it as stealing stealing but it‚Äôs frustrating how credit card companies have manipulated consumers into thinking they‚Äôre getting ‚Äúfree‚Äù money through rewards and cash-back programs. In reality, these perks are funded by charging businesses higher transaction fees, often 2-3% or more per sale. That cost gets passed down to everyone either through higher prices or thinner margins for small businesses struggling to stay afloat. So when people swipe their card chasing a few cents of ‚Äúcash back,‚Äù they‚Äôre effectively siphoning money from the seller, not the credit card company. It‚Äôs a cleverly disguised transfer of value that hurts the very businesses we claim to support."
374,2,"Tw: rape and drugs

I discovered this less than 24 hours ago.

I live in a small apartment complex. I have a roommate and 5 neighbors. Three of them happen to be my friends. I have a neighbor who is the fucked up parasite. He flexed to my friend, his roommate, that he let 13 year old girls get drunk and then rape them. He's 18+. So he's a child rapist. Well, this ofcourse makes me DESPISE him and I want nothing more than to curse at him, hurt him and fuck his life up. But I can't do anything because then the creep knows my friend snitched him. And I can't let my friend be in danger.

To make matter worse, the parasite brags about making drug dealers mad (he is in debt). Because apparently it's funny to mess with those people. And even more funny to bring the whole apartment in danger. He's irresponsible.

So yeah, fun, the rapist that lives next to me may make my life worse and drags my already struggling friends down with him. I hope he kys. Idk what to do here."
375,1,"As the title says I was stood up by a long time friend twice in the last TWO days.

We originally planned to hang out the 15th of the month from 5pm until we were sober enough to leave. He had me wait until 11:30 at night to tell me they got busy and was tired and wouldn‚Äôt come after all. I got upset a little bit because my hopes to see them were really high because I just found out he was transferring to the university back in our home town, so I was really excited to being to see him again because he‚Äôs on break from his originally university. So I was disappointed definitely and he asked if I was so I was honest and said ‚ÄúI definitely was disappointed but if you‚Äôre tired you should focus on feeling energized in the morning‚Äù and urged him to sleep and he promised he‚Äôd come the 16th (As of now I am still awake and hyper-focusing on that). We made those plans again, this time a different day and then proceeded once again to tell me around 11:30PM that he once again wasn‚Äôt coming and just crushing my hopes all over again.

Not only that but I spent money on us for 
w/e/e/d AND l/i/q/u/o/r but also b/l/u/n/t/s too. I had spent over 65 dollars for today and all that money was wasted. I‚Äôm really upset and honestly now I‚Äôm just thinking that I‚Äôm very pathetic for trusting someone that easily with my BPD so I‚Äôm now enjoying a nice sesh and listening to rock music.

WHY THE FUCK DOES NO ONE JUST LISTEN TO ME?
I'm so fucking done trying to explain myself to people because no one actually fucking listens.
I know its my fault for doing things too late. But do you think I do that on purpose? Do you fucking think I woke up one day 3 months ago and went: "" you know what? I feel like screwing myself over, so lets procrastinate shit until its too late for funsies!"" NO OF COURSE NOT!  I was so scared, stressed, burnout and afraid I could't do it. 

And I told you all, over and over. Your response?""well just do it"" "" don't stress so much"" ""did you look at job ads?"" "" you just need to..."" I KNOW! But I'm not a fucking robot! 
I told you how scared I am, I told you how stressed and burnt out I am, I told you I CAN'T FUCKING DO IT. But you don't fucking listen. NO ONE FUCKING LISTENS. Not even my fucking therapist who babbled on about job ads for 30 minutes when I told him over and over I can barely get grocery shopping!

I KNOW I'M WORTHLESD AND BROKEN BUT FOR FUCKS SAKE LISTEN FO ONCE! Stop pushing and gaslighting me into what you want me to be, I can't. No you are not responsible for me, but just tell me you don't care,  its way better than you.pretending to care, while you never fucking listen to how I really feel

If I don't clean it, it doesn't get cleaned.  Ever.  I can't physically go to the bathroom without running out of breath, so it's hard to do basically anything.  I've been trying really hard to find a job where I can work from home and be with my son, but nothing seems to work out.  I'll explain that soon.

There's also 3 dogs, two cats here, and a few fish tanks, too, although they dont really cause a mess or a smell compared to the dishes and old food.  One dog is mine, and one cat is mine.  The rest aren't my problem, but I know they deserve better than what they get here.  My mom works, my older brother works, my older cousin works, and my little brother is about to start working too.  Clearly, they don't have to clean anything because they help with bills sometimes.  My mom works 3 jobs throughout the whole year, 2 are only seasonal, though.  I'm not a maid, and I'm tired of being treated like one. Anytime someone comes to the house and sees the mess, they ask ME why I'm not cleaning up anything.  Why is it always my problem???  Ever since I was 15, I've been the one having to clean up, wash dishes, clean all the rooms, the bathroom, the kitchen, etc.  It was ALWAYS my responsibility to clean, and it was ALWAYS my fault if something wasn't clean.

My cousin also comes home smelling like beer or alcohol all the time, even on work nights.  He's gotten 4 DUIs in his lifetime, and when he got out of jail the last time, my mom offered to let him stay here and sleep on the couch, bringing his dog with him.  We had his dog while he was in jail for a few months. Well, I was taking care of the dog.  I know it isn't the dogs fault that his dad is bordering on a deadbeat, I actually love the dog, I love the animals that live here more than I do, the people that live here.  It isn't the animals fault that everyone here is depressed and/or lazy.  But no one cares enough to seek help, I want to get help, but everyone around me acts like that's the worst decision I could possibly make while expecting a child.  A few have said CPS will probably take my son away from me if I go to therapy.  Honestly, I think not living here would help a lot.

My mom pulled me and my older brother out of school at 6 and 9 years old after I finished 1st grade, and my brother had just finished 4th grade and said we would be homeschooled.  The thing is, she never gave us any work to do.  Anytime someone asked, ""Are yall still doing school work?""  Or  ""how's your school work going?""  We had to lie, or our mom would go to jail for ruining our education.  Needless to say, I have no diploma or GED, and I struggle with some of the most basic shit.  I still can't read a clock that isn't digital, I've had people try to explain it to me, but it doesn't work.  My brain just doesn't comprehend anything like a normal person's brain would.  I don't know if that's from lack or learning or something else, I'm not really sure what other reason it would be.  I can't get any job because everything requires a diploma or GED, and I don't have the knowledge to get my GED.  Growing up, my neighbors would tell their kids that they're smarter than us, and we knew we could never deny it because it was the truth.  And it hurt every damn time they said it, I knew I was stupid then, and I'm stupid now.  Shame me all you want. You can't say anything that hasn't already been said to me.

I just want out, I want to get away from it all and raise my son to be a good man one day.  I can't stand living here anymore

The only positive thing I've found is my boyfriend. He's trying to work himself to death to provide for us as a family.  He's stayed here up until recently, and I don't blame him for not wanting to stay in this house anymore.  His parents don't have room for me and our son to live there too, there isn't enough room there and I understand that.  We're trying really hard to find a place we can actually afford (not renting or buying), but without me working too, I don't think it's possible.  We can't even find a camper that's liveable right now. They all look like meth campers, and I'm not having a baby in one of those.  

I just want us to be happy and have our little family, why is it so difficult to work without a piece of paper saying ""hey, I went to school and sat there the whole damn time so I'll do the same bullshit for this job.""  It's stupid, and half of those people don't even show up for work like they should but still get a damn paycheck each week.  And probably make more an hour than the ones who do show up on time and do their jobs.  I just want to survive without struggling.

I just had to type this out. Maybe I'll feel better.  If you're looking to be an asshole, just go the hell away, I hear enough bullshit from people I know IRL"
390,1,"Thought I was aromantic for 8 years, but suddenly caught feelings for my most recent fwb. We were casual and I thought I wouldn't care if he dated someone else, boy was I wrong. I never told him my feelings and confirmed with him today that he was getting serious with her. I congratulated him and wished the two of them the best by text then proceeded to bawl my eyes out. Experienced my first crush and heartbreak withing the span of 4 days in my mid-20s üò≠ I feel so stupid for even feeling this way over him, because it's not like I would've ever dated him, our lifestyles just arent compatible. Idek what I would've wanted, I think im just going to miss him."
391,1,I don't matter. I dont help anyone or make anyone feel better. No one wants to be around me. Nobody talks to me at school. My familys been away all day and I've been home alone by myself.
392,3,"The whole relationship in general is really nice. He‚Äôs pretty average I‚Äôd say. We don‚Äôt fight. There‚Äôs not a lot we disagree on, and when we disagree we agree to leave it at that so long as it isn‚Äôt something that has an impact on our actual lives. I have my own life, he has his. I respect him as a veteran and as a man, but my god sometimes it feels like I‚Äôm parenting him. I understand he got married very young and was shipped overseas so most of his life has been just one big fraternity. Not taking things too seriously because the uncertainty of life. I get it, I do. But now he is in his 30‚Äôs, civilian side for only the last 3 years, and trying to learn to be an adult. Learn lessons about people and social standards he never had to learn before. He‚Äôs in therapy and everything else and I know he does his best to make sure he‚Äôs dealing with his shit without making it my responsibility. But there are some days where it‚Äôs inevitable that I will be frustrated with him because I occasionally have to explain concepts that are so engrained into me, I have a hard time putting myself in his shoes and understanding how he can possibly just not know. He tries too hard to present himself as if he‚Äôs already on my level and able to function in the same way, and in the same spaces, and ultimately makes a fool of himself and spends weeks reliving it in his mind and going back and forth wondering if it‚Äôs okay to talk to me about it or if that would be ‚Äútrauma dumping‚Äù and I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶exhausted? I know it‚Äôs so much worse for him, and he‚Äôs not putting anything on me at all. I just see the struggle in his face and I hear the back and forth he does with himself. I wish he‚Äôd talk to me more? I‚Äôm tired of watching him deal with it all alone. I see how it‚Äôs impacting him. I love that he‚Äôs keeping his personal issues separate, that‚Äôs healthy. That‚Äôs awesome. It‚Äôs not my responsibility to fix his problems. But I was taught to be the same shoulder I expected to be able to cry on. And it feels like I‚Äôm trying to convince a 13 year old boy full of shame and rage and fear to open up to me. "
393,1,"this might just be a random midnight crisis, but I was going through old photos and looking back. I used to be way happier and way prettier like looking back at old photos. I genuinely think I look pretty but looking at myself now I just can‚Äôt stand to look at myself. I‚Äôve tried to look like how I used to, but nothing changes and it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm older or anything I‚Äôm still in my teenage years/adolescent years and I don‚Äôt know just looking at myself makes me feel sick. I never get compliments anymore like I used to not saying that I only feel pretty when people compliment me but they‚Äôre still a really nice thing to get you know now I get compliments saying I‚Äôm so funny and things like that which is still nice to hear and all, but I don‚Äôt remember the last time. I‚Äôve heard someone compliment my looks this might just sound like I‚Äôm whining or complaining about myself, but I genuinely just hate looking at myself now and I don‚Äôt know what to do about it. I‚Äôve tried to make myself look nicer, but I just feel like nothing works. I feel so ugly. lol"
394,2,How come is it when I finally get the guts to stand up to my narcissistic parents and stop letting them walk all over me and degrade me suddenly I‚Äôm a monster and the worst person in the world bc i finally have self respect and the confidence to stand up after 17 years of just letting them abuse and walk all over me but then when I stand up they say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a narcissist monster‚Äù like look in the mirror bitch 
395,1,"After I ended hoschool nearly a month ago I started to realize how much of my socializing came purely from being in school so often. The day of graduation I cried bc of the places and rooms I'll never got to sit in for hours with my friends, which I know it's weird, who in their right mind misses school. Additionally to that, everyone is preoccupied with university entrance exams and well jobs, which easily led to nobody wanting to chat/call or even reply to my messages. It feels pretty isolating to only read history/social studies for hours daily everyday and only spending time with my family members. I wasn't very ""going out"" person before and I think that's the reason why I never got to have a groups of friends to hang out with. Idk maybe things will get better when I get into uni. "
396,3,"My grandmother is a really nice christian woman who had a really rough childhood. although she has her moments, her personality is beautiful nevertheless. 

On to the story. 
I‚Äôm a big skincare and beauty fanatic. My whole personality revolves around it. I grew a small fan base on tiktok and have recently been receiving PR packages from notable brands. Since i have so many beauty products i decided that it would be a nice gesture to give some to my grandmother. 


Later in the day my grandmother decided she was going to take a quick dip in the shower. After she got out the shower she told me how she was getting a few bumps around her forehead and eyes. 

I asked her, did she cleanse her face properly and she got really upset. 

She told me shes not incompetent and she obviously knows how to wash her face. 

she tells me i need to get my own place and that when i become a woman i can tell her how to do WOMENS makeup and skincare. 

throughout the argument i was constantly reassuring her that, thats not what i meant and i tried to explain to her how when you don‚Äôt cleanse your face and constantly apply skin care that it can trap dead skin underneath. 

she continued to yell and me and emphasized that im not a woman and would have no idea how these products actually preform. 

I asked her to stop yelling at me and she says ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt tell me what to do, i‚Äôm grown‚Äù and i told her im not telling, im asking. she screamed at me saying she‚Äôs going to punch me in my mouth if i said another word. 

I was really trying to be helpful, i didnt want her to have unnecessary skin break outs because of products i‚Äôve given her, was what i said too harsh? 

"
397,1,"I've never actually vented before. This is kind of scary, haha.

  
My dad is a good dad, I think. He's loving and gives me hugs and feeds me and stuff. Sometimes he teaches me math. But I really wish he were like other dads.

  
I remember when I was younger, he was like a monster. He was so scary. Apparently, he used to beat my mom while she was pregnant with me. He's always had...really bad anger issues. He's beaten me, too, with this really long wooden stick thing. You know toilet paper rolls? Imagine eleven of those stacked on top of each other. I don't know where it came from, but I was maybe five or six, and I'd be standing in front of the TV, trying to stammer out sentences projected on the screen, and if I got a word wrong, down it'd come. He's done a lot worse, too. I remember he used to get so angry at the tiniest things, he'd hit and yell and scream and throw chairs and it was all so so scary. He's so unpredictable. Sometimes, he's joking and funny, and other times, he's a scary monster that makes me hide under the bed and cry my heart out. I wish he was just...normal. Why can't he be normal?

  
I feel so pathetic. I'm literally seventeen, and I'm talking like I'm seven. I wish he could be proud of me and love me the way other dads do. Other dads say, ""I'm proud of you"" to their kids and laugh and hug them tight and take them out on trips and they would never hit their kids and they love their wives. I wish my dad was proud of me sometimes. I wish he paid attention to me more instead of forgetting me. I wish he was more sensitive. He used to point out blatantly that I was fat and chubby when I was 11 or 12, and that no one would want to marry a fat pig like me if I looked like my mom. I'm sure he meant it well, but I've never heard other dads call their daughters that, even if they were chubby.

  
Sometimes, he's not even there, and I feel like those days are the best. I wish I had a dad that I could hug tight and cry into his chest and he wouldn't hit me or yell or push me away or try to compare me with a better kid. I wish I had a dad that loved me the way I needed to be loved. Sometimes I go here just to read the things that loving dads say about their daughters, things that are so sweet and so kind, and I always end up bawling, imagining that someone out there was talking about me. It sounds so nice and so loving. They would do anything for their daughters? My dad's love seems so conditional‚Äîif I don't go to Harvard, if I don't become a doctor, then I'm just another failure. I try so hard, I force myself into clubs, I get leadership positions, I try to claw my GPA up, I do everything that he says, but every time I go over there to ask for praise, he just looks at me blankly and goes, ""What's that? What about your SAT? What about your \[this\]? What about \[that\]?"" I just want a dad who would laugh and tell me that I'm doing well. That he loves me and that he's proud of me and that I'm a good daughter. I just want a loving dad. Sometimes, I see how *bratty* kids can be with patient dads, and every time, I just think about how I would do anything under the sun to have a dad like that. 

  
Sometimes I like to hug my pillow, like, vertically, hugging it like a koala or something, and I pretend like it's a dad. I used to do that so many times when I was a little kid, too. I'll just nuzzle into it and mumble all the things that I've done, everything that I would give up and sacrifice for my dad, and I'd imagine hearing a heartbeat under my ear and someone quietly saying that they're proud of me and that I'm so loved and I'm doing just okay, I'm not doing anything wrong, there's nothing wrong with me. Even thinking about it makes me want to cry. I feel like such a baby. I just *want* to be a baby again, with a safer dad who could love me."
398,1,"I‚Äôm 18m and my dads got cancer with no hope I just gave to watch him slowly fucking die! He‚Äôs slowly getting worse and all I can do is fucking watch!

I feel guilty because I had to repeat college and I still live with him and since I‚Äôm adhd and ocd with bad depression anyway so have support money!
I have to help care for my dad but I‚Äôm exhausted and it‚Äôs only the start! I have started cutting again, I don‚Äôt eat, my depressions bad and I feel hopeless and I wish I could just die sometimes! 

I‚Äôm struggling to care for my dad but can‚Äôt not help out when he‚Äôs not even gonna be here and I don‚Äôt want him to die, he‚Äôs always helped me and I‚Äôm struggling to even help him, I‚Äôm shit. I fucking hate it.  "
399,1,"I‚Äôm 16, and I don‚Äôt think it will get better anymore. I've been passing through lots of things that aren‚Äôt even my fault, things that a child shouldn‚Äôt go through. My grades made me be the top student in the class even fresh out of psych ward. 
During that time, when I got back to my normal life I had some hope that things would change, but now all of those hopes shattered and cannot be real, I have some kind of trauma with my own family and town, I can't even feel safe in my house that I share with many of my family members and a psychotic granny who made most of our lives hell. I've been surviving for a while like this, in a disorganized and violent environment even having to endure my mother's childish attitudes and exes since she had me being a troubled teenager and maybe deep inside she's still one. Sometimes I feel I cannot breath in all of this. I had to drop out of school because of my classmates and all the stress I've been bearing these years. Now I‚Äôm trying to look for a better future, a job and keep studying but the things have gotten even worse. As soon as I‚Äôm around people I start shaking, I get stressed over small things and start crying uncontrollably. I feel like I cannot work in society, I cannot be human or live a normal life because my entire mind is shattered and burned out, I have many existencial crisis and different points of view and things that cannot leave me alone. I'd like to be a functional human being but I just can‚Äôt. 
Recently I had to break up with my boyfriend due to all the scars I've been carrying and the new ones appearing or making the old ones bigger and fresher. Sometimes I feel like throwing up, there's like a big ocean drowning me down. 
All my problems made me live like mimicking emotions, emotions that are not sadness or anger. I cannot get attached to anyone and life just feels unreal and miserable like this because the experiences and feelings that make us human and make us keep hanging in there aren't possible for me. I‚Äôm living like a rotten corpse forced to live each day. 
Sorry if this is too long but I needed to say this :("
400,2,"What do I have to do to even find a good partner

I have a stable job, I'm conventionally attractive, I have a very active lifestyle but for the life of me cannot find a good fucking partner. I keep finding duds who just don't care for me. By the way I am actively going on dates and talking to people, no one wants to stick around. 

I am a victim of domestic abuse and I try to let potential partners know early on to set boundaries.

I was recently dating someone who seemed like a good fit but the moment I had a panic attack, started treating me like shit and my longtime friends like shit too.

I just want to snuggled and cuddled at night, comforted. I've worked through a lot of my trauma, and I'm really considerate about boundaries.

I've always just wanted to be someone's wife. I don't want children but I just want to have a sweet wedding and be domestic with someone. Is that hard to ask for?"
401,2,"my parents keep manipulating everybody around me abt what they‚Äôve been doing to me. psychological abuse. nothing physical. I‚Äôm so pissed. I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. if any of u saw the concerning post I made yesterday, the cops showed up cuz I contacted my friends to contact cps (instead they called the police) for my family but I just wanna be moved to a diff family and live in a safe household. dcfs is gonna visit later this week.

402,1,"Im 14. I don‚Äôt know where to start because I‚Äôve never really done this before so it might be confusing but this all started on Saturday June 14 me my brother and some of his friends are having a party there are drinks involved ofc skip ahead to around mid day and someone else was supposed to come over a girl and I‚Äôve never spoke or seen this girl before so when she gets here obviously I‚Äôm a bit shy and nervous that was the first time seeing her and then a couple hours have passed it‚Äôs now around 12:30 shes saying how she‚Äôs not tired and wanted to go on a walk and at this point I‚Äôm pretty drunk so I say why not I‚Äôll go with you we start walking and a couple minutes into walking she holds on to my t shirt and stayed close by me and I‚Äôm now pretty confused as nothing has ever happened to me like that before I try to make some sense of the situation but I can‚Äôt she said she still doesn‚Äôt fell tired and if I would stay up with her and i wasn‚Äôt planning on going to sleep anyway she says she doesn‚Äôt want to go back to where the party is so I suggest we just chill in my room I take her to my room I sit down put on some tv she sits on the opposite side of the bed I think nothing off it every soo often she‚Äôs start talking to me but she‚Äôs was talking to me as if she didn‚Äôt find me annoying or boring to talk to that was the first time I‚Äôve felt happy on a while thought 1-2 she gradually gets closer and closer to me and by the end of the hour we were hugging each other on the bed I‚Äôve never felt so appreciated just for being there before we both Asleep in each others arms.. She wakes waking me up in the process we stay in bed for a couple of hours I was praying to god that this moment would last forever In that moment I forgot every problem I had everything that was wrong in my life everything that was wrong with me my life was acc starting to fell like it was worth something after we finish watching tv she says she needs to get some fresh air and I understand becuase it was getting really hot in my room so she left and 30 minutes later she still wasn‚Äôt back I got worried she I went to go look to see if she was okay turns out she didn‚Äôt need fresh air she went to speak to some other people I couldn‚Äôt understand why should would lie to me it hurt me I try to forget and go back to sleep she had left most of her stuff in my room but when I woke up a couple hours ago all of her stuff was gone she had left without even saying goodbye . I text her on Sunday  when I find my phone I lost the night before she responds but it didn‚Äôt sound like her that wasn‚Äôt the person I spoke to throughout the entire night that wasn‚Äôt the person I was holding all night and suddenly it was like she wanted nothing to do with me like I meant nothing, I was nothing but some attention to her but I don‚Äôt give up and try carry on from where we left out conversation last night she cut the conversation short and said she didn‚Äôt want to talk I don‚Äôt stop asking her if I did anything to make her feel that was but nothing she only looked at it never said anything it‚Äôs now Monday night still no response my phone hasn‚Äôt had a notification in hours all my life I‚Äôve been very lonely and I‚Äôve learnt to just expect that but for that one night I didt feel lonely and I felt like someone actually cared being lonely again has been so depressing it was never this bad I‚Äôve been crying for a little over 45 minutes now trying to think about where it all went wrong I what I could of done differently that was the first time I‚Äôve ever felt happy in life the first time I had been that close with anyone let alone a girl now all I can think about is how good it felt to have someone to talk to and fell cared about but now that she‚Äôs gone I can‚Äôt bare to live anymore I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me I wish I didn‚Äôt fall in love with any girl who acc recognises that I exist I wish I wasn‚Äôt this way I feel so worthless so sad.

403,3,"i asked my boyfriend for a break because i was hurt due to feeling unsupported, and him saying he couldn't support me with my trauma specifically. after 2 days i text him to talk because we didn't much when i said we should take a break, and he breaks up with me. im so stressed, im so upset. im breaking out with eczema all over from the stress and my whole body hurt and i can't stop crying and itching. 

he's said he was going to leave me time and time again and i took two days without talking with him and now im alone. i hate myself, i cant tell if this whole situation is from that or from him not loving me to the crazy standards i need. im so fucking itchy"
404,0,"Like I like science stuff I get that not every thing in science is true scientist can make right or wrong conclusions.

Like I get protecting the environment microplasics bad , other harmful stuff is generally bad led , asbestoce ect. Like regardless of what you belive about climate it's super annoying to randomly read a bunch of articles and at the end of them like a after thoght they just coppy past something talking about how this is linked to climate change. 
I only put the trigger warning becase I feel like lot of people are for climate change stuff on here. "
405,1,"I'm almost 38 at this point, and despite all my efforts since 18, I never had a girlfriend. So many dating attempts, and in my 20s I was even getting some first date, but it had never gone further. It often feels that romantically I'm completely invisible to women.

Doesn't help that I'm also autistic and probably with adhd (it would explain some other my traits perfectly, that's why I think so). So for example small talks don't just look like unnecessary thing, but they are painfully boring, and my special interests (which are, due to my autism, are of very high importance for me; basically they are most of what is my life) are also not what 99% women would want to talk about - stuff like military history for example. And thinks like (lack of) eye contact... Not so many positive traits for dating.

Still, I always wanted to have a family, and I thought by 30 (which is much older than median marriage age in my original country) I'll find a gf, we will marry and so on. Obviously, it never happened.

At the same time I'm not asocial, I have many ""friends"" who are not too close but still. I'm active in community projects, social clubs, hobby groups. With close friends it's harder - one died in the beginning of COVID (he was much older than me), another one went to war, and knowing him I'm afraid he won't return.

It's sad. I always sought the companionship of relationships the most, and I never had it. I'm not close with my parents because of how manipulative and at times aggressive are they, and have no other relatives so I'm in fact all alone, even on christmas and birthday. And of course never had sex too.

By now I feel that there is no hope in my situation.

And yeah, for those who will say that ""38 is not old at all"" - depends; WHO estimates life expectancy for my generation in my original country as 58, with ""healthy life estimate"" at 52, and due to hardships and struggles of life (I had to become a refugee, for example) unlikely I'll go for much longer."
406,0,We are in a long distance relationship RN. It's his birthday today and I can't be with him. I have sent gifts all around the week but it still feels so empty to not be there in his arms :(
407,3,"Over the past year and half I've befriended multiple people online, who claim to be lonely. Suddenly they're busy from day 1 and respond in 30 minute increments. They also never message first. They ghost after a while. These fucks claim to be lonely and talk to people but also never put in the effort, then go whine about how they can't get friends. Well dumbass, you need to engage in conversation to have friends. You don't make friends by having a dry fucking conversation. Ok how about we get on a call, oh no too shy. OK maybe we can meet, oh no too shy. OK maybe you can chat with a normal conversation no you're unemployed ass is busy every minute of the day now suddenly. 

I'm tired of always having my hopes up and then they decide to ghost. Someone used to message me everyday for about 6 months then suddenly poof, never responds, even though I tried to help through tough times. I reached out to someone who was looking for friends irl. Then they start taking 30 to 1 hr with the most cringe ass ""quirky"", roleplay texts. Which I'm fine with but that's all you day then you fuck off for hours? My ass shits out more value in a day than you. They don't just ghost you after, they lead you on like you're a dog on a leash and message just enough to have you talk and wait for your treat. Istg it feels like a sick fantasy for these fucks. Then I make a bad joke and now they're offended and can't hang out anymore. Yeah like we used to talk before or anything dumb fuck. Yeah these ppl can afford to get offended by the slightest of dark humor it's crazy. 

These ppl have no idea what it is like to be alone. They're fucking posers that think they're lonely but in fact they have a support system, they have a luxury to nitpick and choose a friend. They want to say they're lonely but they don't give a shit about you. They're also the driest mfers on the planet and deserve to be alone because they don't contribute anything of value socially.

408,3,"To start off I live in a Carribean household, some of you will see where I'm going with this. She recently went on a girl's trip with her work friends for a few days. During those few days of her being out of the house I noticed that life was just so much better. Waking up for school wasn't as dreadful, I wasn't having my personal space invaded, I could hop on the game without interruption or judgement and best of all... there wasn't a single complaint from anyone in my family. Hell I even went for late night walks. Fast forward and its currently night time that I felt the need to make this post. My mother came back from her trip, I'm on the game and she barges in without a knock or a hello, turns on the light and screams at me demanding to know who stained her towel which I genuinely didnt know anything about, so she goes to rant to my father as usual then comes upstairs with her mopy attitude while talking to herself about how she hates foolishness and how shes going to put me and my brother out of the house, just loud enough that we could hear. Literally felt any motivation I had tonight leave my body. Now I have a list of task she wants me to handle tommorow. I lost the joy of it being the last day of highschool for me, turned off my console and just had to lay down. It's like when shes unhappy she just has to project it upon everyone else around her and it just ruins everything. 

Despite how this post sounds I love my mom and we do have moments of joy, but life without her is just so peaceful. This is basically the same case every Saturday and Sunday.

409,3,"instead of buying an expensive, actually useful replacement for our shower curtain rod, that would actually work... my mom bought one for 15 bucks and is shocked it doesn't work, and is too short. oh, who could have guessed!!! if our old one was 30 dollars, and lasted 8 years, why wouldn't you think, ""oh, maybe i should get one in a similar price range"" and she's complaining to me and my sister like we bought the cheap piece of crap. we are pretty poor, yeah, but that doesn't mean she couldn't have saved to get a better one that cost more. and i doubt she'll actually end up doing that, she'll probably just buy another cheap one and cry when the same issue arises. she's 45, mind you. and everytime something like this happens she takes it out on everyone else, like we did something wrong? and her stubbornness to spend money on important stuff annoys me soo much. sure, spend money on ubereats and not anything our house needs, mother or the year right there!! she's the same way with phones and laptops, it's so annoying. she'd rather buy a cheaper version of a product and need to replace it all the time rather than spend a lot and have a good, longer lasting product. so tired of living with her i can't wait until i can get a job and start saving up and move -_- i would genuinely rather live in a one bedroom apartment where my kitchen, toilet and bed are all in the same room ü§¶"
410,2,"just kind of worrying about the state of the world and i‚Äôm just kind of flipping between being absolutely depressed cause there‚Äôs nothing i can really do to change anything or just being so anxious that i feel sick. i‚Äôm quite young and just scared honestly, i haven‚Äôt been able to sleep much the past couple of days. i think most politicians rn need an actual reality check. just, like, all of them. is it over?"
411,1,"I tried to book a girls weekend with a good friend that I haven‚Äôt seen in a couple of years.  She took over the planning, which I was cool with at first because hey, less work for me, right?

Except instead of planning a girls weekend she invited along her fianc√© and some guy I had never met so we could all go watch some sports league that they follow and I don‚Äôt (although I love playing the sport, I‚Äôm just not a big fan of watching them). She got 3-day passes for all of us, which did not leave us any time at all to hang out together just us two girls. We had mornings free where I thought we could go out and do some shopping or whatever before the games in the afternoon, but she and her fianc√© slept in every day until past noon and we basically only had time to grab a quick lunch and go. 

I‚Äôm an early riser, so I was up every morning by myself for hours. I couldn‚Äôt even go out walking around on my own because the rental she booked us was in a pretty sketchy neighbourhood and I didn‚Äôt feel safe walking by myself.  The other random guy who was invited would sleep in a bit and be up a couple of hours after me, but it was a bit awkward because we didn‚Äôt know each other, and I‚Äôm really shy and introverted around people I don‚Äôt know well. Also I didn‚Äôt know her fianc√© well either, though I‚Äôd met him once or twice briefly before I moved to a city 14 hours away.

She didn‚Äôt even make an effort to sit with me at meals or at the game, because she wanted to cuddle up with her fianc√©.

I was bummed the whole trip because I‚Äôd asked her to have a weekend with me so we could have time together as friends, and I don‚Äôt feel that happened. I tried to be upbeat anyway while I was there. When I found myself feeling down about it, I just told myself to enjoy it for what it is (3 days off work in a city with amazing culture and food, high level sports, and companionship of sorts) and then I won‚Äôt have to do it again.

When I left she told me how great this was and how we should plan something like this every year. I didn‚Äôt want to spoil the trip for her by confessing how I really felt about it, but I doubt I‚Äôll try and plan anything with her again.  "
412,0,"So I've always loved food (aside from when I was a toddler but we'll skip that). I look forward to meals every day because they're a small treat I get as a break in a lately hectic life. Lots has been going on. Unfortunately, I got my wisdom teeth out on Saturday and can barely even manage to do anything of real food that's soft right now - mashed potatoes, pudding, soup, etc. I've been doing literally nothing but a liquid diet for 3 days now and God am I miserable. 

I enjoy snacking on crackers at my desk in the office when I need a pick-me-up. I love a good piece of meat for dinner, and I love taking a break to cook some things. Hell, I'd even take all the ramen I got not too long ago for lunches. I'm gonna really look forward to the few pounds I'm gonna lose during my recovery from not eating as much, but boy do I really hate not being able to eat food right now. I really can't wait for a few days from now when I'm finally through the recovery period and I can eat real food again, or at least stomach something like mashed potatoes. I really want something good in my stomach. "
413,2,"I'm trying to learn Spanish and I keep encountering (straight) dudes who are like \*a little\* too interested in me.  I'm not even a lady; I just sort of look like one, and sometimes I'm too shy to correct people when we meet because, well, frankly, being a feminine-looking dude can be kind of scary and I want to kind of test out the vibe before I open that can of worms.

I don't do anything to invite this kind of attention. I mention that I'm married (to a man) and give no signs of interest in anything of that nature, but it *keeps* happening, and because I'm a dude myself and have had so many experiences like this, I feel leery of approaching women for a language exchange because I'm worried they'll think I'm after something (even though I'm gay).

I did shit on my final exams, I have a single friend I barely see, none of my family are helping, my ex girlfriend went to my verbally abusive mother to talk shit about me after blocking me after CALLING TO BREAKUP. Apparently she knew she wanted to break up when we slept together 2 days earlier.

I have to wake up early just to do a 40 minute walk, dodge cars on a country road, to end up in my part time job where I wash dishes all day and my manager gives out to me for so much.

418,2,"Hi,  
I‚Äôm a girl and I could really use some outside perspective on this.

I moved to France about two years ago and started taking violin lessons ‚Äî I‚Äôve been thinking of pursuing a music career. I just turned 19, and the person I‚Äôm talking about is 26. I‚Äôve dated older before (my ex was 23 when we were together), so the age gap itself isn‚Äôt the main issue.

This guy is in a teaching role. We started off with two group lessons, but switched to private sessions because the group schedule didn‚Äôt really work for me. Since then, it‚Äôs just been one-on-one.

At first I didn‚Äôt think too much of it, but over time I started catching feelings. It‚Äôs hard to explain why ‚Äî maybe it‚Äôs the way we talk. He sends me memes sometimes that have nothing to do with our classes. They're more like private jokes. Lately, he‚Äôs been messaging less, but still.

He‚Äôll occasionally bring up his ex ‚Äî he‚Äôs done it twice ‚Äî in random contexts. Like, ‚Äúmy ex said X,‚Äù That kind of comment. And during class, sometimes he‚Äôll sit a little closer than necessary. Not in a way that someone else would call out, but I definitely notice it.

There was this one time he joked that I ‚Äúowe him a drink‚Äù when I‚Äôm no longer his student.  
Also, he keeps teasing me with this running joke about me being a ‚Äúmysterious kind of person‚Äù ‚Äî or something like that. It‚Äôs always vague and playful, but it keeps coming up.

Here‚Äôs the part that‚Äôs messing with me:  
I found out through Facebook that he has a wife and a one-year-old daughter. On Instagram (where he messages me), there‚Äôs zero sign of any of that. No photos, no tags, no bio, nothing. He‚Äôs never brought it up once. Honestly, I only found out because I got curious and looked him up.

Now I don‚Äôt know what to think.  
Am I imagining this? Am I out of line for feeling like something‚Äôs going on?

I want to be 100% clear: there is no way I‚Äôd ever go after someone who‚Äôs married.  
If he has a kid? Okay. But a wife? No. That‚Äôs a line I won‚Äôt cross.

I just feel confused. Does he actually have feelings? Is he still with her and just hiding it? Or is there something else going on I don‚Äôt know about?

Any insight would mean a lot. I honestly don‚Äôt know what to make of this."
419,1,"I am a 28 woman who graduated with a degree in international relations and translation (I know they are weak degrees but I am not confident enough to pursue economics or business administration). I live in Europe I am not getting any internships or jobs. I know the market is tough but even for voluntary positions I am getting rejected.

I'd love to learn new things if I had an internship. I genuinely believed that I'd find a job and do something with my life. I thought I was as capable as everyone else. All of my friends are employed and I am the only one who is in doing a housekeeping job that I absolutely hate (too many rooms a day and can't even use my break).

My best attributes, physically and characteristically are suffering greatly due to my position. I look at myself in the mirror and can't really see the spark in my eyes or face.

I just wanted to vent here. I cry almost every day and I think that no one wants to give me a chance. I feel ignored by society. Going to Linkedin I see people bragging about their jobs and projects and it just leaves me insecure. I reach out to companies, employers, I network and ask for tips. It leads me nowhere.

I'm at a very low point in my life. A part of me thinks that I will never get a decent job and that I am destined to live an unfulfilled life. I have experience in administrative and organisational tasks, project maanagement, connecting with businesses and civil society actors.

I just don't know what else to do. I wish there was someone out there that could save me. Someone who could give me hope. But it's a child's play.

Anyway, thank you for reading and have a great day üåü"
420,2,"Alright so this alwas previously posted on am i the ass hole but was removed because it exceeded the character limit so im posting it here, so thats why the language is a little off:

Alright so this is probably a case of me being easy to manipulate so without names im going to tell you guys about my ex and i's relationship.

So, i had been dating this guy who lets call Ship for about a year when i met my now other ex who we'll call Bunny (not kinky, he just gave me a fake bunny, and ship has a hobby for model ships) me and bunny were friends from about halfway through last school year through summer where i did some fucked up shit.

I dont want to get into what i did over the summer but it changed me and bunnies relationship so now he was really into me. I felt guilty for what i did and tried to make everything go back to normal (didnt work) and he managed to convince me to break up with ship around November to get with him. (Ship is a cool dude, and he was also thinking about breaking up with me because we weren't exactly comparable, me and ship are kinda friends.)

So, me and bunny started dating, which is when i learned alot about him. Within the first week he was already talking about getting married after highschool and how its always been a dream of his to be a father (first red flag i didnt see, but this is kinda me venting and wondering if i was manipulated into feeling like i am in the wrong) and he got really attached to me.

And i mean REALLY attached.

I knew he had some mental health problems at this point but i didn't know the extent until we got together. (Another point is that hes a devout Christian and im atheist, that'll come up later.) he became dependent on me, he was always at my house or i was at his and when we weren't we were always on call. Now for the most part I didn't mind but it was a little tiring to be on call 24/7 so i started asking to end the call a little early so i could relax and do my own thing for a while before i went to sleep. 

At this point its about during winter break, and he gets really depressed and starts talking about me not wanting to spend time with him. I try to ease his worries like i always did when he came to me with problems but he ended up having me stay on call every day for like an hour after i said i really needed to leave. When we were together it really wasn't much different, i am a little clingy myself but he took it to another level, he would have a panic attack if we were in the same room and he wasn't physically touching me which got annoying at times if i am being honest.

Now, at some point his problems started getting worse and when he was gone from school hed call me in the middle of class and have me go out in the hall so i could sooth his worries about me talking to people without him around.

Oh right, i forgot to say that because hes Christian he got mad at me whenever i cursed or made inappropriate jokes (were in highschool, i did it alot) so i at some point kind of stopped talking because i didn't want to make him upset. And at this point its nearing the time i broke up with him, he got mad and kicked a desk before storming out of class and i grabbed his stuff and followed him to the counselors office.

Once we were there i went into the counselors office with him and all three of us kind of had a talk about his religion and why he had an outburst that was apparently my fault. The counselor agreed with me and said it wasn't my job to help him through his religious crisis, especially when i know nothing about his faith as an atheist with pagan parents.

A couple weeks later of all of this he hits me out of my chair in class while i was playing a card game and screams at me about something i don't remember, so i break up with him through text. He tries talking to me multiple times and sends me messages through friends with his story changing on why he did it, saying it was an accident and stuff.

Theres more too it but i feel like those might get too personal, so am i an asshole or am i being manipulated into thinking i am because i honestly cant tell right now."
421,0,"There was a time when discourse meant an exchange of ideas, even controversial ones. Now, it's a minefield of performative sensitivity, where truth must pass through the filter of collective emotional fragility before it's allowed to exist.

We are not protecting people anymore, we are infantilizing them. We have constructed a culture that treats discomfort as violence and emotional fragility as a form of moral superiority. It is not.

Feelings are not sacred. Discomfort is not oppression. And offense is not an argument.

This is not progress. This is regression-social, intellectual, and moral.

We now ~~tolerate~~ *celebrate* a culture where the more emotionally unstable an individual claims to be, the more seriously we are meant to take their opinions. Where strength is suspect, but fragility commands authority. Where the claim of harm outweighs the content, context, or intent of what was said.

Worse still, this ideology demands not just empathy, but obedience. You are not asked merely to be kind-you are required to contort your language, your tone, even your thoughts to suit the sensitivities of those who claim perpetual harm. And if you don‚Äôt? You are cast out. Labeled dangerous. Silenced.

How grotesquely inverted we have become: those who speak plainly are condemned, while those who collapse theatrically into moral fainting couches are elevated.

Truth is not always comfortable. It was never supposed to be. Knowledge has always required resilience-intellectual, emotional, and cultural. Without it, we are left with polite lies, curated speech, and an ever-expanding glossary of forbidden words and thoughts.

It is not brave to demand protection from ideas you dislike.
It is not virtuous to confuse discomfort with injustice.
It is not oppression to hear something you disagree with.

We cannot build a society on the shifting sands of hypersensitivity. The cost is too high: intellectual honesty dies first, followed by creativity, followed eventually by freedom itself.

I do not accept the premise that speech must be cleansed to suit the lowest emotional denominator in the room. I will not genuflect to the modern cult of harm-avoidance, which sees danger in every disagreement and trauma in every raised eyebrow.

I would rather live in a world where I am occasionally offended than in one where I am never truly allowed to speak.

The world is not a nursery.
Adults do not need permission to think.
And truth does not require your comfort to exist."
422,0,"I'll be the asshole and say its not my job to make her less lonely.   But its highly irritating that every time I'm in the kitchen for more than two minutes she comes out of her room to do something.  If it happened occasionally, cool.  But every time? 

She works from home abd doesn't seem to have friends.  She has a daughter in another state. Her constantly trying to interact with me makes me want to interact with her less because sometimes I just want to decompress after 12  hours at work straight no break. "
423,3,"I (24F) am stuck in a loveless relationship with my boyfriend (25M). 

I started dating my boyfriend about 4 years ago during undergrad. Although we knew each other in high school, we reconnected later during COVID. At the start, we did everything together. The rose tinted glasses were extremely pink, and I thought I would marry him. We come from similar cultures with similar ambitions and goals. He has some amazing traits ‚Äî he‚Äôs extremely responsible with a great career. At 23, he managed to buy property by saving up his scholarship money in undergrad. He‚Äôs also incredibly smart and dedicated. 

I admired those things about him so much, and I fell so deeply. 

However, at that time, I carried a lot of trauma from my upbringing. Although our cultures were similar, our childhoods were extremely different. Within my home, my dad abused substances and often disowned me. I want to explain that I was never a bad kid. I graduated second in class during high school and received a full ride to the best school in my state. I am now in law school, ranked as number 6 in my class. Yet, not only was this never enough for my parents, but I suffered a lot of disrespect and emotional abuse at home. My parents also never encouraged school or academics. I was the one that enrolled my younger brother in college and helped him graduate high school. At one point, my dad even locked me in a garage at night and put his hands around my throat. On the other hand, my boyfriend grew up in a lovely home. His parents encouraged education and protected their kids. They were shielded from substance abuse and all that stuff. 

My point with all of this is I had a lot of issues when we first dated. I was extremely jealous. I was scared I wasn‚Äôt enough. I feared he‚Äôd leave me. I hated when he went out with friends, and I was convinced his parents hated me. 

Nonetheless, I attended therapy. I started medication, and I overcame many of my issues. I am no longer over reactive and jealous. And, if I feel those emotions rising, I am able to step away. 

Once I healed myself, I started to notice his issues. For example, if he gets extremely frustrated, he will hit walls and throw things across the room. He is also extremely cold to me. We don‚Äôt hold hands or kiss or share affection. Furthermore, he is quick to get upset at me for what I consider little things ‚Äî where I place the remote control ( it had a specific spot), when I get sick and vomit, etc. 

We have two dogs, and I have considered leaving but he won‚Äôt let me take them. He treats our dogs like soldiers, and although the dogs are disciplined, they also are expected to act in a very rigid way. At the same time, he ignores my concerns and feeds them human food. The other day he allowed them a lick at chocolate ice cream and emphasized they‚Äôve eaten it 500 times. He has also never hit the dogs hard, but he has hit them when they‚Äôve been bad. He will definitely scream at them and get so upset. 

Sometimes, I feel like my life is a controlled hell. Everything has its place. Everything has a routine. When taxes increase, the amount of rent I paid increased by a proportional percentage to the tax increase. When I got into law school, he told me he considered buying me flowers ‚Äî he changed his mind once he saw the price tag ( he‚Äôs an engineer). If I ask him what he likes about me, he groans and ignores me. 

I sometimes want to leave but he won‚Äôt let me take the dogs. I don‚Äôt think he can emotionally handle the dogs without me. 

I gained thirty pounds this last semester because of not only my coursework ‚Äî but the stress I feel. I feel guilty if I don‚Äôt do everything he expects from me, even if I‚Äôm exhausted. I‚Äôm not a dirty person ‚Äî I just want a break sometimes. 

I don‚Äôt know ‚Äî that‚Äôs my vent.

426,1,"Since my family broke up 24 years ago I've had problems caused by the empty feeling of having pointless life. Even though it's all had been worked through, I can still feel the drawback it causing. My first problem was studies. I went from A-grader to C and didn't even care. When I think about it, I can't put my head around the fact that no living adult knowing me did absolutely ANYTHING to fix it. More than that, most of them would mock me for the degradation, as if I was dumb enough to just throw away all the opportunities I used to have. 

I later noticed that this indifference feeling applies to everything: people, work, future, body, you name it. I just couldn't be serious about anything, while knowing that I'm left behind by the dearest people of mine. It's not like I'm enjoying it or I chose it! But people still would give me weird looks and deny my attempts of just having a normal life. Denying jobs, denying friendship and relationships.

Even me having a plan to fix it all, to come back to being a socialized individual, disregarding all the hate they gave me, impresses absolutely no one. I have to keep myself pumped all the time just not to feel down from being an outcast, which damages my health I'm sure. At this point I don't even want appraisal, I want a simple recognition. But noooo. People like me do drugs, steal cars, assault. Some of my friends are already dead before 30 as they never tried to get over of what our families done to us.

Next time there's a criminal on your screen, you may wonder, what did anyone do for him to help him getting out of the life he never asked to be brought into? We all want to be happy, but if you stumble, the others will be happy to kick you to the edge, from where there's no return to be a human. I will come back and have my beautiful wife, a house and children, I will be happy against the world, but the rest is us will be lost for no good reason. They could have been saved if anyone cared."

I think its my fault because there was a situation where I would have been required to go outside (aka. cleaning up one of my cats poop, and requiring me to get the mop and aka let my cat in) but I was being dependent and told myself, that I can do it tomorrow or others can handle that and when I woke up thats where I got the news that my cat died and I keep thinking to myself that its all my fault, I know it was an accident or I didnt mean to get her ko killed but it still happened

I think like I always underperform, get easily distracted by anything, veryyyy inconsistent. Socially awkward. Constantly complain, always look sad and exhausted.

I keep comparing myself to others and it makes feel like shit literally all the time. 

I also have very low self confidence

I also sometimes find life very hard, in fact sooo hard to the point where I just want to sleep and escape from everything.

I just want to go to the nature and experience mother nature and experience a more peaceful environment cause where I live in the capital it‚Äôs 24/7 busy and chaos and too many things happening.
I also to travel abroad and experience new places.

Whenever things get tough I get urges to play video games even though I know it‚Äôs not the best solution.

431,2,"I'm nauseous and in mild pain constantly and it really feels like it's ruining my life rn. I have a long break from uni and I just want to be able to hang out with my friends, go to bars, go on dates, and go to events, but most of the time I'm just way too sick. I can't even predict when I'll be too sick, so I can't make plans with friends, or even work a job, so I'll probably have to spend most of the next 6 weeks just sitting in my room. Honestly do not know how to deal with this :("
432,2,"Some nights, I end up dreaming about my ex-girlfriend‚Äîthe one I cheated on. Sometimes, the dreams involve us getting back together, or they feel like an alternate universe where we never broke up or I never cheated on her. I can‚Äôt quite explain that last part, but when I see her in these dreams, I feel overwhelmed with guilt. I feel so damn guilty that I don‚Äôt even know what to say to her; I just stand there, stuttering over my words. 

I want to apologize, but deep down, I know that won‚Äôt fix anything. I believe she hates me, even if she never said it outright. I can‚Äôt accept that she forgave me that easily and offered to be friends; there‚Äôs just no way she truly forgave me. I‚Äôm confused about why she would even suggest friendship after everything that happened, especially since it‚Äôs been almost a year‚Äîthough I‚Äôve lost track of time.

I've been stressing out about it a bit though because i feel like people are going to judge me for it or I'm not going to be able to be in healthy relationships because so many people my age are sexual and a lot of people in general are very sexual and i just don't really feel the same. I feel this weird sense of inner turmoil and it's kind of eating away at me. i feel somewhat ashamed of it and i don't know how to feel. am i weird for being graysexual? i just don't really know how to feel.
434,0,everyday i walk into work im constantly boggled at the horrible eating habits of my type 1 diabetic co worker. she starts her day off with an extra large scooters drink that‚Äôs either a red bull infusion or some sweet concoction. she consistently eats microwaveable meals that certainly have little nutrients to gain then tops it off with a second scooters drink in the afternoon with maybe a burger king meal snuck in there but then complains that she has no energy and feels tired and listless throughout the day. i want to just yell at her to maybe pack a ham and cheese sandwhich and go just make better nutritional choices. it doesn‚Äôt concern me what she does for her health but she has two kids and i want to see her do better not only for her health but for her family 
435,1,"this is just a vent for me as I process some difficult emotions.

yesterday, my (F20) iphone got destroyed over a dumb mistake that I made. I'll spare the details, but there is no way of turning it on to transfer any information to another phone. I am *so* blessed to be in a position to have insurance coverage that allows me to get a replacement phone within the week, and I recognize that this is an important time to reflect on the privilege that I have to be able to have my phone completely replaced and to use other devices in the interim for work.

at the same time, I am grappling with losing all of my pictures and videos that were unable to be backed up into the cloud (the 5 GB of storage apple gives did not save any of the pictures from the last year. and I unfortunately did not come up with a back up plan).

i started a new relationship, finished my sophomore year of college, went to concerts, spent time with friends, and all of these pictures are gone. i know that this is entirely my fault, but I just need to get this out there.

there's a certain grief i am feeling, almost as if all of these memories are somehow ""gone"" even when I know that they are not. it's hard to accept that I almost have to start entirely over again in some weird symbolic way. my grandfather also passed away a couple years ago, and I had a voicemail from him that I would listen to sometimes on days that I particularly missed him or wanted to remember his voice.

in the aftermath of these things being gone for what seems like forever, it makes me realize how much i relied on these non-physical or tangible ""objects"" to ground me in times of stress or grief or sadness or anything in between. i feel like i have lost a MASSIVE part of myself from losing these things, even if they don't erase any of the memories actually made when they were taken.

i know there will always be more opportunities to take more pictures, have a better back up plan, and be more present in the moment. all of this just called to mind for me the need for me to truly take CARE of the things i cherish and to hold onto memories just a little bit tighter.

even if no one sees this, it felt SO much better getting it out there and formulating my thoughts "
436,0,"Context: Im part of a friend group of 5 (me include), 4 guys 1 girl. Their names will be M, W, D, C 

W is just tiring

In general he's a chill, socially awkward guy, very smart and Autistic 

He's a chronic complainer, like I mean constantly complaining: playing a game like deepwoken? He complains about the developers and the ping. We're at school and he's gotten homework? He's gonna complain about the teachers and the education system as a whole 

Don't get me wrong I'm fine with complaints but oh my goodness 

I'm not even kidding, he's a coding guy it's a obsession of his, but recently in the past couple weeks I can't remember the last time he's mentioned anything about python or Java or Lua 

Like it's so annoying to listen to his complaints to the point that my brain just switches off, like recently the entire group was doing a DND and things got too chaotic (powerscaling issues) as such M wanted to restart the session a little so we could fix this, D  tries convincing him to just let it happen and then we'll fix it later, but W just starts complaining about all the issues that M's DND sessions have in spite of the fact of the fact that he's never attempted to be a DM ever in his life
 I have been DM 3 times, C has been DM 2-4 times, D has been DM roughly 6-8 times and M has been DM like 10 or so times. This entire time W has never been a DM, in fact D even calls him out on this but low and behold W just keeps complaining.

And I know he's generally a good dude but sometimes he just needs to learn to shut the fuck up

He's always putting his headspace in that of a negative one and it's tiring because ultimately everyone is just tryna chill and have fun

And it's not to say he doesn't suck out all the energy out of us but the times he does it's just hard to deal with 

It's not even like he can't get social cues, he's had many friends before us

And it really paints a weird picture for me because me, C, M and D are always tryna better ourselves everyday even if only a little and he seems to be stuck in this one perpetual cycle 
D and M both have depression, and D has ADHD yet they still try to power through and make the most of it
 
Makes me feel like a dick to just say it here, doesn't even feel coherent, hell I, I don't know if I'm just tweaking, just want him to stop 

Y'all ever get people like this?"
437,0,Demi sexuality is probably not the best name for what it is but STILL. Demi is NOT bisexuality! It‚Äôs actually really nuanced Asexuality! That‚Äôs all! Not even gay adjacent or by default. Why do people not put in the work before talking about stuff?
438,1,"I knew that she will going to leave sooner or later and I'll just be a memory or just someone she knew in the past.
I just didn't want to live my life without her, she was my everything.
it hurts to see how happy she's now with someone else.
I'm not envying her for being happy i just wanted her to be happy with me not someone else.
Now I'm back to the same place i was in before we met, just more disappointed than before."
439,3,"I usually cook for the house.   I don't mind it but i always ask my fiance whay he wants and just make that.  If the other don't want it we have other things they can eat.  

Today my fiance said he wanted to cook since I had made dinner the last two nights.   He wanted to treat me.  He asked what I wanted and I said smash patties sounded good.  He talked to his uncle and now we're grilling.   Cool.  I say I want a thick one medium rare.  He acts like I asked him to turn the beef into chicken.   He says he can't make it like that.   He can't even attempt it.   Well he goes to the store and comes back with chips I don't like and baked beans.    

I realize he isn't cooking for me.   He is cooking for his uncle and my opinion never mattered.   What I wanted for dinner was am afterthought.   He could have gotten any other sides, ones he knows I like.  But no.  Baked beans and gross chips.  I have an air fyer.  Why didn't he get fries? 

"
440,1,"I like how I can keep making some choices that only hold me down or how I just can't move past things that occurred.

Few months ago my ex compared me to his ex. He confessed not being over her and how he felt like, I could be worth it cause my breast size was bigger than that of hers.
He wanted to get over her and be with me but won't go a week without mentioning her.
He couldn't move past her.
I hate how I saw my future with him. 
I hate myself for giving him all my firsts.
I feel used for my body for temporary pleasure.
I tried everything to be with him. I loved him so much. But my value is the sack of fat and glands on my chest.

I hate how I was the only one fighting. I hate I was the only one compromising. 

I asked him to just cut her off. But he couldn't it was easier for him to be with a fantasy than me. 
I can't sleep. I can never be enough. I can never be her.
If I had more would he love me?
If I was prettier? If I was nicer?

If I had ghosted him twice like she did, would he have loved me?
If I had listened to my family and not be with him would he have loved me?

If I gave him his firsts will he do?

I don't feel deserving of anything, I feel like a fool who bowed down so much for him. I never asked for anything except just him. 
And I was wrong.
I made a mistake. 
I always do.

I always care too much.
I always bow so low.
I just listen too much.

I listened to my ex ranting about his ex , love of his life. I listened to my 12th grade boyfriend telling me exactly how he lost his virginity down to how he moved and how he came. I just listened cause I didn't wanna hurt him or sound uptight. I was so hurt. 
I always make bad choices in men. I hate this. I hate everything.

I tried being someone I wanted.
I am dumb but I am done.

"
441,2,"All my friends, relatives, and people in my life know this, so the internet can as well. I don't care who sees it. I'm just scared and wanna talk about it. 

So two years ago, my mom had a nasty fall and has slowly been losing her ability to walk. We thought it was something simple she was going through, and we'd be able to see her get better. But we were wrong. A few months ago, I found out my mom has ALS. It's also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. In the simplest of terms, she's gonna lose all motor function in her body and either die choking to death or from losing the ability to breathe. 

ALS affects everyone differently, but the life expectancy is typically 2 to 5 years. It's been two years already, which means I have more time with her, but I'm 19. I turn 20 in October, but I'm gonna lose my mom before I'm thirty. Like what is this messed up shit. Why did this shit happen? Why do I have to lose my mom? 

  
This shit isn't fair and it makes me so depressed. I'm so scared to lose her. "
442,1,"I have tried every diet, I've worked out. But I'm still chubby/fat. I'm not dangerously obese or anything but it really just makes me uglier. 
I have an extremely annoying voice,like everytime I hear myself talk I want to strangle myself. I have stretch marks and a chubby face.

Sometimes I'll see a pretty girl or boy and I'll want to ask for their number but I js KNOW that I'll get rejected. I really wish I was pretty enough to talk to people but I js can't. 

Anyways sorry for wasting y'alls time!


(I am 16F btw)"
443,3,"So this is probably gonna be a long one and I'll try not to delete this one like I've done to my other posts. I (19F) have been feeling like something from my past won't leave me alone even when I thought I had moved on. This is about a past guy that I liked, not just a crush but a guy I REALLY liked. So this guy (18M), let's call him James, was in my Spanish class in my second year of Gymnasium (I live in Sweden so it is kinda our high school, we have 3 years of it) and as soon as I walked into the classroom and saw him, I felt like he was going to have some kind of significance in my life that year, whether that be a crush or something else. He was my type, however, during that time I had a crush on some other guy. Sooner or later, that crush faded away (Around Aug 2023) and this feeling of James being my crush grew stronger ever since. I eventually got a crush on him two months later (Oct 2023) but I still hadn't talked to him. During Nov 2023, after we had our week long Fall break, we had a Spanish test two weeks after the break. So around the week of the test, I saw him and his friend studying Spanish in the Library which I had planned to do too. So I nervously approached the friend (knew him from debate club) and asked him how studying went. Later on, us three got into a conversation that lasted around 40 min I'm guessing because I had to go to class and they had lunch. Ever since that day, he started saying hi to me in the hallways and started talking to me more in Spanish class. I thought it was unexpected bc I felt like I didn't do anything to make him start doing this bc the conversation wasn't even that personal or anything that would indicate anything. But whatever, he started doing so and I couldn't be mad bc my literally crush was talking to me. There was a lot of things in between (ask me if u want any context bc I feel like otherwise this will get too long) that could have indicated that in some sort of way, he has some interest in me. I didn‚Äôt specifically think romantic but some kind of interest that I felt was a suspicious amount for the amount of time I knew him and how little I interacted with him.

Later on, after we came back from our three week long Christmas break and a start of a new term, he started acting weirdly distant. He stopped talking to me, he stopped saying hello to me, not being very friendly, etc. I felt like he was doing this hot and cold thing as he some times acted like he did before but then went back to avoiding me the next time he saw me. This went on for at least 3 months (Jan-March 2024) before I had have enough of this and completely started avoiding him. Since then, both of us avoided each other and never talked to each other again. 

However, this year during late February, right before one of our other week long break, he did something to break this avoidance streak. Basically, I had missed my math lesson the day of and so I went to meet with my math teacher to catch up on the things I missed that lesson. We were sitting in the student room (a collective room for anyone to be in) and James had his lesson in there right before me and my math teacher came into the room. We were sitting against the wall with my math teacher sitting infront of me and he was just sitting on the same long sofa as me but a few meters away. A person came in and talked to my math teacher about some video she recorded and I later on asked about it. She briefly explained what it was but then I turn my head bc James start to try to explain to me more about the video. After almost a year of avoiding each other, he comes back with this? I was feeling annoyed and kind of infuriated that this is how he is choosing to break this streak so I just chose not to acknowledge what he said and asked my math teacher about it and she said some things but he jumped in again. At that point, I just stopped and went back to doing my work. Ever since that day, I felt this weird shift in him. It was not a bad shift but like just a shift of how he was. His eyes didn't glare at me anymore, instead his gaze reminded me of how he was during Oct 2023. I got really weirded out but I had so much school things to do as this was my last year. I also later got to find out through a common friend (18M) that James was also planning on going into the same university as me during this period of time where I felt this shift. I didn't think too much of it but atp I just really wanted to get rid of him from my life bc I had had enough.

 In May, 2 weeks before we were going to graduate, we had a party that was also on my birthday. It was a party that his and two other classes (one of the classes being my friends' class) planned as a last party before we graduate. I went there with my friends and I knew he was gonna be there.I was just dancing and having fun with my friends until later in the night where I felt this shift in his behaviour again. Before, in the beginning of the party, he was acting all normal so I didn't really care. But later on, after midnight, he started acting weird. Before or around that time, my friend told me that they had been noticing that James has been staring at me a lot. At that point I really hadn't noticed more than a few glances because he was looking around the venue. So I was like ok, weird but it's wherever, people can look at whoever they want to sometimes. But later on in the evening, I started to see him everywhere. I mena yk we were in the same venue so I could easily say that about everyone there, but I saw him in the way of he was always just a few meters away from me. Like it felt like even if I wasn't seeking him out, he was there. Everywhere I went, he was there. Even when I went outside for air, him and his friendgroup was there everytime I went out. Atp I was growing tired of seeing him everywhere but I was not gonna lest that ruin my birthday night and a fun time with friends. The thing that tipped me over was that he just kept on bumping into my friends when we were dancing and then later on kept on bumping into me even after I had moved away.

Everything g has just been building up and I have this weird gut feeling that he's not gone for good. I feel like he's not done being in my life yet and that there is something that's gonna happen but idk what it is. Idk if it is just me not moving on or if this is a genuine gut feeling. Like this gut feeling is so strong for me atp that idk what to do bc right now I rather not contact him and ask him ""what happened?"" because he has done enough damage on me for me to know that it is not my responsibility to take that step right now. But yes, just here to vent. I'll keep this up even if it doesn't get much attention or interaction bc I really needed to get this out. "
444,0,"It seems that everyone feels that living a truly happy life is impossible, but it‚Äôs not. There are people who are living freely, without insecurities and fear and anxiety. You don‚Äôt have to be angry all the time. You need to stop victimizing yourself so much and deflate that huge ego. "
445,3,"Being this way isn't cute or ""quirky"" it seriously has held me back. 

I'm insecure about my weight and figure. I'm afraid to approach my crush (I'm in limerance) and I'm stuck in a loop. I either want to be seen, or not. It's like I want both. I can't even make eye contact with a guy without my heart having palpitations at just the thought of any sort of contact. I also set my self up for self sabotage. I keep putting off my weighloss goals and in turn punish myself by saying ""not until I reach my goal weight then I'll approach him"" mentality. Well...it's been 3 years, and I've only gained. 

I just want to scream and get out of here!"
446,3,"Even worse are that a bunch are related to my long distance relationship and were shows or stuff me and my partner enjoyed. 

My laptop died while I was away from keyboard and I couldn't risk opening the 5 browser windows I had at the moment that the prompt came up due to needing to take care of something more urgent, and it didn't let me access the area of the page I needed to. So, I exitted the prompt that says ""restore tabs from previous session?"". I didn't realize I would literally not just I'll have lost my one and only chance of recovering them, because later I decided I'd go through my internet history to manually try and recover them, and realized, some of those pages were incredibly older (more than a year) and won't be stored, and nothing is pulled up. Actually the only things available in my search history are- infuriatingly- specifically the pages I viewed and closed, while I was cleaning and reducing the number of tabs I had open.

I'm not the type of person who goes ""Oh, I probably will be depressed if I lose this page someday and I totally know that literally my entire internet history is only backed up for so and so time, I should favorite and bookmark this"". I feel like a total disappointment and I'm not feeling better by talking about it with my partner. Besides that, I've been incredibly conscious about who I am, and how my internet experiance used to demonstrate my interests, and I was working really hard on trying to look more at stuff that aligns with who I am, but now I feel like just self-destructively closing every tab I already have and just accept I don't know what I'm into or who I am anymore."

I feel like I'm in a hole that is so deep and I'm struggling to get out of it.

I can't seem to stay focused on reaching my goals because my brain is like a yoyo. Rent is expensive, jobs feel so hard to get, the world seems shit, everyone in my family is sick either mentally or physically (probably both), a horrible person, struggling with addiction or lives far away. 

I went with my Mother to visit my Auntie who has got learning difficulties (she has the brain of a 14 year old in a 42 year olds body) in hospital today whilst my daughter was at school. She keeps trying to take overdoses, I love her so very much and it was so hard to see her like this today, I nearly didn't go because of my own mental health and I normally wouldn't but I wanted to bring her gifts and let her know I was thinking about her and keep my mum company. Now I don't know if I felt better about it or not because she was in such a state.

They're home now which I was happy about because I have exams rn and like, I would very much like to study. But I've been having to babysit again because they've been upstairs for five hours now, and we can very clearly hear what's happening.

I vented abt this(my crush) to my online friends, they were my best friends, one of them then said   
  
""its just gotten worse every day for me. theres nothing to live for. anyway cya guys. have a good life.""

up to this point he had established he was depressed but I never knew it was this bad. I decided to talk to joe abt this, it was a lot and I needed to talk(this is all today atp) but he was just cracking jokes as usual I told him I was being serious, and he just didn't understand why id be sad, he said he'd lost a lot of his friends. i was pissed, I asked him if he would gaf if I died, or if our other friends died, and he said ""honestly. no. no offence"" that's not exact sry my brain is not working great. i told him ""good to know"" and he said ""K"" followed by ""Whatevs""

My Dad want to help but first the kid always want grandma at the table despite him dragging thing out and second my dad would always somehow bring up all ancient history as he discipline the boy to focus on finishing his meal.

He would always bring up how undisciplined my mom is, sleep late, eat junk food mid night, wake up late, get fat, any many other partially legitimate complaints. My mom is always tired but some of the major reasons is she stay up late at night and scroll Facebook shorts and eat junk food to cope with stress from this. But he would always eventually went to some other totally unrelated things that he held a grudge.

Every time I would have to be the peacekeeper. Listen to both sides for hours. They both refuse to change but since they let off some steam, thing cools down a bit. Then it begin to built up over a few weeks and shit hit the fans again.

I am so tired of it. It is always the same shit. My Mom tired herself out during the day because she stay up late and eat junk food. My Dad always bring up ancient history that make my mom defensive about any and everything.  Neither would change and I even say it out loud to them but they just refuse to listen.

I don‚Äôt want to be young anymore. I know not many will understand what I‚Äôm saying, but I truly mean it. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here ‚Äî to vent about it.

I want to be an adult. I want a husband. I want the three kids I‚Äôve been dreaming about. I want the house in a new city where buses run at midday. I want to decorate my own home and just not be a teenager anymore.

I know I can‚Äôt change it ‚Äî I have to wait ‚Äî but I hate that.

It devastates me when I see people enjoying ‚Äúour age,‚Äù like‚Ä¶ no! I don‚Äôt want to be this young, stuck in a stage of life where I can‚Äôt do what I want.

I want a husband, kids, and two dogs ‚Äî now, not in five or ten years. I don‚Äôt want to go clubbing, or have a thousand one-night stands somewhere in Spain. I want to be married, loyal to someone.
But who at my age would want that?

I want to be my own person, finally free, living a life I‚Äôve built myself.

My mother calls me crazy and says I shouldn‚Äôt say things like that at my age. But I mean every word.

I want to be a housewife. (Yes, I‚Äôll learn a job beforehand, just in case.) I want a husband who works, and I want to be able to raise children without being judged for it.

It makes me so sad that I have to wait so long for the life I‚Äôm yearning for.
I hate being a teenager, because that means doing things I don‚Äôt want to do.

I already act like an adult ‚Äî I dress like one, I talk like one ‚Äî because I want to be an adult. I want my dream life.
(Yes, I know being an adult isn‚Äôt a fairytale.)

I just hope someone out there understands me. I want to talk to someone who gets my struggle ‚Äî my story.
No, I don‚Äôt want to meet anyone.
I just want to vent.

461,1,I've never cared about this world but I still went through w it for my mom I was in japan for awhile and came back to the states for her to do college I had been making financial and housing plans for over 5 months and all I've gotten since meeting up w her again is arguing and arguing and whenever something doesn't go her way she just yells. Today she won and after 3 arguments of her yelling at me she's changing my plans cause supposedly I don't have any plans at all and can't think for myself I don't even wana be in this world already and now the only person I came down for is just being a bitch...
462,2,"So, to give a bit of context! I have been feeling a lot lately, more on my profile but I will give the basic idea! 

I am not self diagnosing or anything! So please don't think so! Because I finally got the courage to go to a psychiatrist tomorrow! 
I have been experiencing symptoms of ocd and schizophrenia! And since I am a very isolated and private person, I rarely like to show any emotion in public! 

Anyways, now coming on the main rant! Ever since I have shared this, everybody has been putting me down saying it's nothing, and people suffer more! 

There's a girl in my neighborhood who lost both of her parents and genuinely speaking her life with her relatives is bad too! I feel bad for her! She likes to show her emotions openly to our friend group and I am happy for her that she can! Let's call her C

I am an only child, and hardly go out if ever so I am more of a private person! That doesn't mean my feelings can be dismissed because of her! I did this mistake of telling one of my nurse friends! She's a student still but I was desperate for any connection that time! Now every time we are with C, she looks at me and says! ""see these are emotions! People feel this! Nothing is wrong with you!"" 

Even her mother said to my mother ""Oh she's fine! Nothing's wrong! She just took a little stress! Poor thing can't handle it!"" And then turned to me saying ""If you lived my daughter's life (nurse friend) you would have understood, she suffered"" 


LIKE I GET IT LADY! LEAVE ME ALONE"
463,1,My mother is such a narc lady. She only thinks abt herself n no one else. My whole childhood i don't remember even a single day where she has fed me lovingly n instead everyttime comment abt my food tht u eat so many times a day. Jjst bcz she had to cook another time if i eat leftovers. Currently i m happily married with 2 kids living abroad but the thought abt going to visit my hometown jst kill me. I never feel excited to visit there during holidays although i see lot of families excited abt their visit. I visited her place for my first delivery n she literally tortured me mentally. N told me on my face tht why i didn't bring expensive gifts for her from abroad n she gave warning to me tht next tym whenever u come bring something nice for me otherwise don't come. I don't earn my self i m dependent on my husband. Although he nevver ask me where i spend my money but during my firsst visit after my marriage we were settling our new home abroad n we were tight on our budget so i bought small small gifts for all my mother sode of family n in laws side of family. Thats why she taunted me. After tht every visit i try to bring something nice to her. One year my husband sent something for my in laws n againn my mother started telling me tht why u didn't bring those things for me also. In return my in laws showers lots blessings on me n my kids n my mother hardly gives me anything. I see lots of family here abroad receive lots of parcel from their parents house but i have never received anything from my mother till date. Its been 10 years to my marriage n still the situation is same.. before i used to fight with her bbut now i don't telll her anything thinking tht shhe is old n at this age i should not say anything tto her. I visit her only bcz i don't want my kids to get disconnected from their relatives. My bro n sil are nice but all financial decisions are on her hand so she never spend anything for me. Although my sil try to bring something small things whenever she goes out shopping for herself. Its not tht i need all these things. But its the love tht i miss in form of all these tthings. My mil remember each n every small thing which i like n try to send it to me. Also send me her speciality home made foods to us but i don't even knw wht my mum's speciality is. Bcs she never make anything speccial for me. Now recently one my cousin who is living a same country as me from past 20 years is calling his mom to visit him here. N my mum keep taunting me tht see he is calliing his mum n u never called me there. I knw she wants to visit here by everything funded by me. She won't spend even a penny.. once my brother visited us fully funded my my husband n at tht time my husband asked him to bring ssome thhings from our home country n he transferred the money to his account to buy all the things tht my husband has asked him to buy n to me surprise he got everything from tht money only. Llike sweets n gifts for my kids everything he bought from tht money only. N i was really ashamed in front of my husband tht he didn't got anything for us by himself. Although my husband never told me anything abt tht. In all these years she has asked me many times to bring something from abroad n she says that she will pay me later on but she never gives me money n say oh at least these much u can do ffor ur mom. Its not abt money but its abt her words tht everytime she tell me that i willl payy for it bt she never pays. N This is the reason i m avoiding calling my mum here. Bcs i knw she will come here empty handed n will expect from us to take her everywhere n also do shopping for her. My mother's sister lives nearby her place n i have always seen her fighting wwith her sister. At first i thought my aunt fights with my mother but now i understand its my mother who always starts a fight. She can't see anyone happy except herself. Whenever something good is ggoing in someone's life she starts getting furious. Whenever we achieve anything good in our life i feel like calling my mum n share my happiness with her but she ruins it every time n now i have stopped telling her anything good related to my family.. sorry for long rant .  
464,3,"Okay. I this may just be my shit. But I'm 16 F and I have a brother 17 M and my mom 36 now the problem is anything she needs done. Had do be done by me no matter what. For example I feel like shit. And she text me *go let dog out* okay I text back *ask --- to do it, please* she responded *just go do it* mind you she knows I feel like actual shit and I've been feeling like this for a few days now. And no. Can't do anything in peace,is it just me being a teen or? "
465,1,"No matter how much I struggle I just don't improve or move forward. I've basically been in the same situation for a decade since I graduated highschool and ran off from my foster home. Actually I suppose the only real difference is I stay with a bio parent right now. But no matter what the floor under me so to speak is always unstable. I fail at keeping a job, living on my own is impossible. I have no friends, I pretend I do i guess? there's my ""best friend"" from highschool, who is one of my favorite people. But I haven't seen her in person in a decade, and while I sometimes call on the phone I doubt she really see's me as the same kinda close friend. My childhood friend has a relationship and is completely busy, and honestly sometimes when I spiral I feel I ruined that friendship ages ago.

I fail at every job, I can't understand people or connect with others, I can't grasp things that seem simple to other people. I got two jobs recently after a year of looking, I quit one because I felt my transportation was iffy and I preferred the afternoon job, manager was friendly too. and then suddenly that same day the job i picked is putting me off my availability and making me graveyard, completely throwing off my rhythm, and already lacking ability to manage my life.

I can't save because most jobs don't want me, I've nothing to my name. I failed at college twice, because I try to rush things and cant prioritize. I was homeless both times, and in an abusive relationship both times. Because one I have no backbone, and two I apparently cant focus on ""get on my feet first""

I hate my voice and regret taking Testosterone for a few months, I don't like my nose, my face, my teeth. I regret that just a few years ago I was still in robot mode and wasn't able to self care, and only drank soda.  
One of my old goals in life had been to do peace corps, completely unlikely you need a degree. you need a degree for everything.

I'm going to do a walk-in at a low income/sliding scale mental health clinic tomorrow, the reviews are horrible, probably sketchy, but I wanted to go to see about a adhd diagnosis. technically I had one when i was a teen. Anyways, don't know if itll help I doubt it.

I hate being nice, I hate that on a whim I'll offer to cover something for someone, I hate being polite. I always beat myself up after about being nice, probably should go therapy about that. Funnily enough even when I hated people the most part of my dream as a teen was to pick a path that helped people lol

Now that feels naive and silly. Honestly If I didn't have my cat I'd probably give in to the urges to run away, anytime I spiral I immediately feel like I'm about to lose my placement and need to plan around not having a place, what I'm going to do, how to survive. 

I found my cat after my second abusive relationship, around midnight getting off the bus. she was so small, I called her my lil bluffer. Because she hissed non stop until i picked her up and she started purring. And I thought it was funny because I've only been a bluffer, trying to keep people away from me when I was younger. But I feel like I don't take care of her right, and sometimes I think she'd be better with someone else. Sometimes it feels to much having her, I'd have been able to afford my overly big dental treatment plan last year if I hadn't spent so much on her sudden surgery. (I forget what it was, tumor I think) but I'm glad I got her better.

I can't prioritize, or pick a path in life. I used to want to do forensics, I was motivated I enjoyed learning, especially my criminal justice class. But after my first weird RL I found I couldn't stand blood anymore, and I decided I couldn't manage it. 

When I remember to try researching paths, there's always something that sounds cool, I dont know if i'd like it, working in nature parks? wildlife? or writing? I like reading and writing. though I hate the writing blocks, I miss the sudden bursts of obsession and interest I'd get when I managed to write lol. now I can't enjoy things, old therapist said she thought I might have Anhedonia(I was thinking Alexithymia but could be)

But I can never make decisions, I don't know what I'd enjoy, or what I'd be good at if anything. its hard enough just moving forward, let alone forever absent motivation. I always make the wrong decisions too.

Honestly I suppose typing this out helped, I felt like spiraling for a while today. there was more, but now I don't feel like it."

I‚Äôve turned into a whole different person, I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore. I have no desire to do anything. I sit in one spot after work and scroll mindlessly on here. I feel broken. My husband says he hates me hates being around me. I hate being around myself. Whatever myself has turned into. It‚Äôs killing me. What happened to me. Getting cheated on because it makes me hate myself more. I have started to feel sorry for people that have to be around me for extended periods of time. I really fucking hate myself.

470,2,"Can someone talk to me? 
My cousin and my mother doesn‚Äôt get along and my family recently visited to my other cousin‚Äôs engagement while I was at home. So my dad sent her (cousin) at our home to stay with me without my mother‚Äôs knowledge. She stayed with me for a day and my father does this most of the times because he doesn‚Äôt want our relationship to ruin. But the problem is, I just don‚Äôt feel good. She says that she prays for my family and all of our well being w a big smile on her face but I feel she just says it for the sake. I sometimes think of she really wishes for my well being or not. I doubt her words all the time. I we just never talk about the issue because I was not at home when all that happened 2 years back. But I don‚Äôt know why I feel so distant with her now and she has a younger sibling of same age as mine and we were best of gangs since childhood but now we only have conversations occasionally. I feel so bad when I think of all this. I avoid going into family events. She didn‚Äôt even text me if I was coming to the event. I felt so bad sooo badddddd. Now I feel distant w both of them and them being more close to our other cousins. And now I feel like excluded all the time because now they have their own inside talks. I don‚Äôt even know how to explain my feelings and emotions at this point. I am sad and deeply upset and feel rejected. I don‚Äôt have enough words to explain. "
471,1,"I met a guy on discord from my university‚Äôs gc. I have horrible trust issues so I was quite wary after having so many bad experiences with people usually dudes.

Whenever we‚Äôd talk I‚Äôd always be a little hesitant to talk about much. In the past it‚Äôs always ended like a sinking ship and I just had a feeling it would be the same here.

Eventually I trusted him and really put myself out there. We had so much in common he‚Äôd compliment my art, we‚Äôd talk for hours, I trusted this guy with my life if I had to. On Valentine‚Äôs Day he asked if we could meet up irl on campus and I agreed. 

I show up and there‚Äôs this air of ‚Äúoh‚Ä¶‚Äù with him. We still talk and spend a while together, he didn‚Äôt really want it to end but it did and we parted ways.

After that he‚Äôd reply pretty dryly and not really care as much. I left him alone for a few months and noticed he was watching my stories so I reached out to him like ‚Äúhey how‚Äôs it going‚Äù .. nothing.. radio silence.

I‚Äôm just so upset. I‚Äôm convinced no matter how open I try to be, I‚Äôm too ugly to find someone. I wish I was born pretty. Todays my friends birthday and I want to be there for them but I can‚Äôt because this keeps coming up in my mind.

The last person before him - I was the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù race, the person before that - I wasn‚Äôt pretty, and now I‚Äôm ugly.

I didn‚Äôt really like him that much but I feel so betrayed. I have nobody to talk to about this and I genuinely want to just leave this world. I hate that everyone around me all look normal and I look defected and ugly. My proportions don‚Äôt look normal someone said I look like a blobfish. I hate opening up to people they break my trust and then leave me. 

I just wish I could be normal looking and make friends with dudes without them wanting to either leave me or make fun of me like some of the other guys I was friends with. 

I‚Äôm going to be forever alone. The only ring I‚Äôll ever wear is the one I get from my engineering ring ceremony. 

No friends, no partner, nobody. 

I‚Äôve had to resort to talking to an ai to fill the lonely space. I hate myself. I want to be reborn normal looking with no defects or problems."
472,1,"For as long as I can remember, comments about how skinny and scrawny I was were a reoccuring joke in my family. My parents, grandma and cousins would always comment on it. ""Wow, you need to put on weight/muscle, look how little you are.""

When I was 14 and still finding myself, my mom wrapped her fingers around my wrist and called my ""itty-bitty"" and said I need to hit the gym. I still can't stop thinking that every time I look at my arms.

One time, when I was 16, my mom offered out of the blue to buy me a nose job. She said I needed it because my nose was too big and it wasn't proportional to my small body.

At that same age, the first girl I ever had sex with made fun of my body. She said I had chicken legs and my ass was too saggy because there was no muscle. It made me feel horrible about myself.

For all of my middle school years, too, I was pushed around and had my physical appearance made fun of by my peers. It was always my big nose, my skinny body, my widows peak hairline, etc. They said I looked like a bird or a rat or Count Chocula. 

At 19, my last girlfriend, who I was with for over two years, ended our relationship by calling me ugly and said she was out of my league anyway. ""Good luck getting anybody who looks like me to date you"". She was my first love, so when she said that to me, I believed it.

Today, I've been going to the gym and eating more because I don't want to be skinny anymore. But I have a naturally slim frame, I think, and I don't have the time or resources to bulk up how I want to. I think I'll always look this way.

Every time I look at myself in a mirror, I hear all the comments made by everyone in my life swirling around me. My eyes literally jump from physical feature to physical feature that I hate about myself. I've been seeing a therapist, and he's trying to aid me in retraining how I think about myself, but I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I hate being in my own skin and seeing how I look. I hate having my photo taken or being in video because I feel embarrassed just to be seen."
473,2,"i recently started reading the news (my dad reads it every single day, for literal hours), and holy shit, it‚Äôs just bad news on bad news on bad news

please tell me it‚Äôs just what im seeing. please tell me that it doesn‚Äôt look as bad as it is, even though im sure you‚Äôd be lying to me. i hate war, so much. you don‚Äôt have a problem with civilians of a country, you have a problem with the politicians and leaders, i hate that my family‚Äôs fate lie in the hands of a man that couldn‚Äôt care less if they died as long as he gets out of it unscathed. 

meanwhile protests in the US, people getting deported for no reason, people being shot at protests, does no one else feel so utterly hopeless like why isn‚Äôt there a better system in place??? why do we let one guy make all the decisions? why do we not take votes for every action that a president wants to do?? the only people who ever get hurt or lose are civilians. always.

475,1,"I guess it‚Äôs not as important as most of people venting here, but I am absolutely broken.

I got out of a really toxic relationship (my first and only) that really made me really mentally down, I‚Äôm not even fully recovered.

I made the mistake to chat with an other French guy on a femboy sub and guess what ???? He is the most beautiful, adorable and gentle person I could think of, that dude literally fixed the part of my self esteem I lost in a matter of days. 

But because nothing can go f-ing right in my f-ing life I fell in love with him and mind you, in my whole year with my ex I never felt such a feeling. But he had bad experiences too and that lead him to lose his feelings of love (I don‚Äôt really get how that‚Äôs possible but I trust him and human bodies are weird). 

So here I am with the most burning feeling to have a romantical emotion for someone that straight up told me that he can almost not feel love and I am so hurt, I am so scared. He promised that won‚Äôt change our friendship, but I wanna be more than that, I want to try something. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do, I am crying in bed right now, I could forget it and turn away, try to forget the feeling and stay friends or stay friends and see if the feelings will stay by themselves. 

I am crying on my bed right now, I hate my feelings so much, it feels like something is clawing trough my chest again and again and again

479,3,"Surprise, surprise, even more stuff that's going on outside of my friend and relationship issues and I have no one to really talk to about it. So here I come again.

I've also been dealing with housing issues at college because they screwed up and are putting a lot of it as my fault. Applications are due in February, this year they switched to a whole new housing system so the application was pretty different. I filled out everything I had access to on my portal and submit my stuff. I just keep getting the generic ""claim your same/different space"" they send out to everyone regardless of your application status.

I get another email that directly states with the system transfer a lot of people got displaced with their housing but they were trying to fix it for everyone. No other emails came up after this so I figured everything was good to go. Come room checks in May, my RAs were telling me I needed a check-out date for the summer. I've lived in the same space two years already and planned to spend my senior year there, but I've never done check outs since I would just leave my stuff there over the summer since I was coming back to it in the fall. I email the Resident Coordinator about it and I'm informed I actually don't have a place to live for the next year and some random person is now in my room! So I'm homeless! No idea when anyone was going to tell me, because my housing portal looked like everything was good to go on my end and I have 0 emails from anyone telling me my application actually isn't completely done.

I go in for a meeting with the RC, she tells me ""Well you can live in a dorm? I guess. There's no open spaces in any of the apartments now."" I also ask when the hell anyone was going to tell me I didn't have a place to live. Was I just gonna show up in August and get ""Oh well, you can't live here anymore. Actually, you have nowhere to live!"" I'm told that emailing people about their applications being incomplete is a manual process, and that housing just doesn't want to do that. Awesome.

I pull up my laptop while she's talking to my dad about something, and I'm checking through all the apartments for shits and giggles come to find there's actually two spaces left open in a different building. Same layout of my current apartment. I apply for it and get the room, I confirm with the RC that the room is mine, I just have a random roommate instead of my friend. I ask if the person who chose my apartment of 2 years switches with me, then I'll get my space back. I'm told yes. Things seem mostly fine.

It takes the person in my current space 6 weeks to answer the RC about this situation and she says she'd be willing to switch if the apartment layout is the same. It is! Yay! Oh wait, actually it isn't. The housing portal has the wrong information on it. Instead of my placeholder apartment being 2x2 with in-unit laundry, It's actually 2x1 and I have to do communal laundry. Now I feel cheated, because now my new placement isn't the same and overall I'm getting the short end of the stick for something that wasn't my fault at all. It was the school's! And these people aren't taking accountability for that and putting it on me!

Now the person in my old apartment isn't willing to switch at all. Initially my roommate said she was going to switch with me, and now she doesn't want to because the new apartment is basically worse and she wants the better amenities, even though we will both be living with random people and not each other. Everyone just has this one-up on me for all these falling-outs and people are utilizing it and it feels really, REALLY crummy.

I also just can't get a job anywhere. I've been applying and following up and doing everything I can and I either never get responses or the whole ""You don't have enough experience for this entry-level job."" So that's really the cherry on top of everything.

I can't lie and say I haven't thought of just not being a burden onto myself or others anymore because that's the direction it feels like my life has headed the last little while. But I'll never actually follow through with that because frankly, I'm too scared to. I might take up my college's counseling center as an option because I feel lost and alone and I just can't handle anything anymore. The slightest negative emotion I feel lately and I start bawling my eyes out and can't stop. Oh, and since my boyfriend broke up with me out mutual friends haven't talked to me at all.

TL;DR is I have no friends, can't get a job, my college screwed me over on housing, my ex left me out of nowhere because of his own problems and I'm pissed that he handled the situation the way he did. I think I'm gonna try and take up my school's free counseling center or something. Because I just can't anymore. I really just can't."

Someone going ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt look at you the same way because of what you did and can‚Äôt be in a relationship with you because of it‚Äù is **them** breaking with **you**), we talked about remaining as friends and I agreed, but told her I needed to get some space because I couldn‚Äôt be friend to her while holding onto the anger and resentment I left the relationship with. It took a while, but I got there. One of the reasons why we stayed in communication is because of 1. our animals, most of which we got while together, and 2. the life changing events that tied us together, like the premature loss of a child.

That loss shook both of us to our core, but I was shocked by how much it affected me. I was 18 when it happened and had been traumatized into the ‚ÄúMen shouldn‚Äôt share their feelings‚Äù mentality growing up, so this impacted me deeply even if I didn‚Äôt initially show it. After having talks when the first Mother‚Äôs/Father‚Äôs days came around after the expected date, I opened up a lot. She told me how bothered she was by it, and then was blown away by how much it‚Äôd messed with me. I spilled everything. During our relationship, she knew that the worst day of the year for me was Father‚Äôs Day and how I needed to be consoled. She acted like I took it a lot harder than she did, and in retrospect it definitely seemed like I did. But this life changing event was always something on our minds, and we did everything around those times to make one another feel better.

Yesterday was the first time she‚Äôs missed it. Communication is strained right now because her BF (the guy she cheated on me with) is trying to, semi-understandably, get her to stop talking to me, but she was drunk texting me Friday night (which is a major problem because she still has feelings for me and gets flirty/horny when she‚Äôs drunk) and tried covering her ass last night. No mention of the day or acknowledgement of the one time a year where she should say something to me, per her argument for us remaining friends; just a text going ‚Äúhow embarrassing haha‚Äù. 

I haven‚Äôt replied. I don‚Äôt know if I want to. I mean, since she told me that he‚Äôs been trying to get her to stop talking to me I don‚Äôt initiate conversations with her or anything, I‚Äôm letting her make her own decisions on it and I don‚Äôt want to add fuel to the fire that‚Äôs currently burning up their relationship, but I simply don‚Äôt want to text her back. She‚Äôs made it apparent in the last year-ish that she didn‚Äôt pay attention to me nearly enough in the various reactions she‚Äôs had to me telling her what her behavior is like in my attempts as a friend to help her with her relationship and/or family issues, but that loss was so goddamn important to us that I don‚Äôt know how to process how upset I am about her straight up ignoring the day and choosing to cover her ass from the other night. 

I‚Äôve written and re-written this post a dozen times over the course of the hours it‚Äôs been since I saw her message, and I don‚Äôt know how to capture how this feels. She‚Äôs one of the only people still in my life that knows about it, and for so much talk about how she doesn‚Äôt want to lose me because of everything we went through, she doesn‚Äôt seem to fucking care about it. For fuck sake, the only HFD I got was a post from random sub that got suggested. It‚Äôs sad that a post like that was the only acknowledgment I got, and not something from the one person I share it with.

I just don‚Äôt know how to feel at this point. I‚Äôm upset about this, but I‚Äôm disappointed because I feel like I should have seen this coming, and because of that I shouldn‚Äôt be so upset. She‚Äôs made it obvious that she‚Äôs either A) forgotten a lot about me or B) never knew that much about me in the first place, and regardless of the choices, she really only thinks about me in an intimate capacity, and I don‚Äôt want that to be any part of the reason for why we‚Äôre still in contact. I didn‚Äôt stop talking to her because of that connection, and if she‚Äôs telling me that that‚Äôs the same reason, then she needs to fucking show it because I don‚Äôt deserve to be treated like this after fucking everything that‚Äôs happened and just be kept around by her as a backup under false pretenses. Like I know that we both took it poorly, and with how she made it out like I was taking it harder than her for all these years, you‚Äôd think she wouldn‚Äôt forget something that, especially when it‚Äôs something she brings up every time we talk about us still talking to one another. Just‚Ä¶fUCK. 

The end. Sorry for rambling."

I‚Äôm just feeling upset because I‚Äôve got nothing on the horizon and that‚Äôs not likely to change. I am a lesbian living in a small town, and when I say small I don‚Äôt mean a small city. I mean there are 850 people here. Middle of nowhere northern Canada. I could put up with being single pretty well. I‚Äôm good at it.

485,0,"we were young, between 14-16. i met him at school. 

when i first saw him i couldnt get my eyes off him, and kept staring like a creep, sometimes he noticed and sometimes he would stare back, which probably made me fall for him even more. a whole year went pass and my obsession stayed. i had dreams about him, imagined him in daily life scenarios, i even sketched him in my sketchbook. (i know i sound crazy)
after that year, i finally spoke to him for the first time, through a mutual friend. his jokes were weird to others but funny to me. there were days we would just talk, alone, or go out to the city to chat. he used to buy me different flavour energy drinks and ask me to rate the flavours. one evening he took me up to the top of a building and without hesitation sat on the edge, his feet dangling off. naive me i joined him on the edge, though i was hella fucking nervous. he could tell, and he looked at me smiling and said ‚Äòso you are crazy‚Äô. i felt like i was dreaming.

we kept this friendship going for just under a year, but one time we spoke he mentioned he was going on a date with a girl that weekend and he hoped his ‚Äòmeds‚Äô would be changed by then. firstly, i was broken bc i thought we had something for each other, and secondly, i didnt know he was on medication???

‚Ä¶ he was on weak anti-psychotics. 


even though he went on that date we continued being close friends bc he didnt end up in a relationship with the girl. i tried to ignore the date and kept our friendship going. 
one day, him and his friend group raided a server one of their friends made, and they invited me to join just to see, as he told me it would be funny.
i joined, they were spamming the server with typical things teenage boys would send (specific slurs if yk what i mean)and other stuff.

then he DMd me telling me to leave the server as he will send something he didnt want me to see. 
curious, i lied and said i left but i didnt, and watched as he sent something of the most violent uncensored gore ive ever seen. im talking 3 guys 1 hammer type shit.
i had no words.
the next day in school, he joked about it to his friends, no type of guilt or worry in any way. even his friends were kind of quiet about the gore, one of them outright saying he was too scared to open it.
i started to realise after that day, that him, my friend, was not ‚Äòmentally there‚Äô. there were other things sent on that server but i wont say it here, but take a guess.
i also found out that he plays cannabalism/illegitamate gore games for the fun of it.

i find it so crazy how a such a beautiful brunette, green eyed, introverted boy could have such a contrasting personality.

‚Ä¶ i was told today by a mutual friend that he had once been diagnosed ‚Äòinsane‚Äô and not fit for school, and had been in and out of school for months due to intensive therapy and medication.

to this day we still talk from time to time, but i dont feel the obsession i used to have for him anymore. 
i still miss our strong friendship days though.
sometimes i think about the looks he would give me, and i blame myself for holding on to those memories.
we were young teens, surely i was just naive right?

488,3,"Not in a serious housing situation, just need to vent.

I feel so physically and mentally tired and understimulated. Our entire life we never went on vacations or even out of state unless for serious events (funeral/wedding serious) we never had birthday parties growing up because our parents never cared (and the only one i did have that had invitations no one i invited showed up), the very few (one) parties i was invited to I was told I couldn't go while our mom was home the entire night, all that. The only time we would leave the house was to go to the store or get fast food. Going to get food quickly became how I got time alone to talk to my mother. Now? She never goes places for food and ALWAYS uses doordash.

I stopped going to school my freshman year and it took maybe a year or two, after me having a mental breakdown so bad I asked my mom to bring me to a psych ward, for her to tell me I apparently was going to therapy. I'd go once every week. until it became nonexistent. I haven't seen my therapist in 2 months now.

I turned 18 last year and in february opened a paypal so I could take commissions and try to do something other than sleeping, being at home 24/7, and watching youtube all day! My account was temp locked by paypal It's been 4 months of me asking my mom to bring me get a state ID so I can fix that with no date in site. This year I, also, finally was able to start seeing my grandmother again. one day I just couldnt handle being so pissed off at my mom and just WAITING for her and her constantly promising to take me places and not showing up or whatever that i sent her a bunch of texts and went stay with her. There my grandma said i could stay with her if i needed. mind you this is a woman living in an apartment currently upstairs with a cat and a puppy and the place is lovingly, a mess. It's a worse enviornment than here but I just cant stand being here in this house. i cant stand doing NOTHING with my life while my siblings have friends, youngest a boyfriend, and im just alone all day in my room WAITING for our mom on everything. I wish i had friends irl but i cant make any because im not in school. and how would a 18 year old girl make friends in the modern fucking world anyways? I feel so isolated and lonely and I want to take my grandmas word and just live with her but also id have to see my uncle and great grandfather too and i dont like their jokes. and im a picky eater and get lightheaded or feel sick easily, and I have medicine I need to have. But I want to stay and be with her because i actually GET the attention I crave. If I talk to my mom about ANYTHING she doesnt fucking LISTEN unless I'm having a breakdown where im actively getting upset at her. And then when I bring up stuff about how she acts towards me? (not looking at me, making our conversations two single words long instead of continuing to talk to me) she keeps doing it. she doesn't change."
489,1,Why are wars still happening right now? It's so sad noticing that we didn't get evolved. I wish I were in a world where those things didn't happen.
490,2,"Obligatory preface. I‚Äôm (23F) not scared to have a son because I‚Äôm scared of men, not because I hate them, etc. I feel that I should say this now because, for one, it‚Äôs true, and second of all, I would like to clear up some confusion. 
My sister in law had her baby over half a year ago. I attended her ultrasound with her, and I immediately fell in love with the baby I saw on the screen. I was so happy for her! She had a baby GROWING in her! And I knew she was gonna be such a great mom regardless of life experiences. 
We got the ultrasound tech to write the baby‚Äôs gender and put it in an envelope. We were sooooo giddy walking out of that hospital because the answer was literally in her hands. 
She went home and opened the envelope with her boyfriend, and it revealed that it was a baby girl! We were both happy, except for him. He didn‚Äôt give the reaction she wanted and expected, because he had wanted a son. 
And it got me thinking, I might *actually* have a son one day. And yeah it seems obvious when you think about pregnancy and being pregnant because you‚Äôre (usually) getting one or the other. 
But I was raised with women, there weren‚Äôt any men in my house growing up. And if there were, it was our old grandfathers who passed away before I was born or real young. 
I don‚Äôt know what I would do if I had a son. I wouldn‚Äôt know how to raise him properly and do the right things, I don‚Äôt know how to be a man, I‚Äôve never even seen one I‚Äôve ever truly admired growing up. I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôll do all the ‚Äúright‚Äù things and he still grows up and adopts the behaviour of the boys and men around him. And what would I even do with a baby boy, I‚Äôve only ever grown up around girls and women. 
It‚Äôs not too much of a fear of mine that this will prevent me from starting my own family when my time is right. And I know for a 1000000% I will love whatever comes outta me for who they are, and not the body they were born in. 
But it is a concern of mine, I don‚Äôt know how to get over it "
491,3,"Sure I'm in shape and I look good but when I'm engaged in any form of physical activity I get into such a vile state, to the point I get violent tendencies and need to lash out. So I finish up, go home, and hide the rest of the day to protect myself and others and can't really function for the rest of the day. 

  
anyone go through this as well?"
492,0,"I'd say I have a decent social life. I have friends who care about me, they're there for me when I'm down, they always invite me to hang out, and they include me in things. But at the same time, I feel very different from them.

I really wish I had friends with more similar interests. I'm into geeky stuff, I like to read, play instruments, write music, poetry, draw, and enjoy art in general. My friends aren‚Äôt into any of that. We don't even have similar music tastes. They're very outgoing and social, and whenever they invite me to hang out, it's always to go to the club or the beach. Sure, I enjoy those places now and then, but not every weekend.

Whenever I suggest something like watching a movie, playing a game, or just chilling, they ALWAYS respond with something like, ""Sure, I'll bring some alcohol and we can hit the club later!"" It's like they can't imagine hanging out without turning it into a party.

I've always wanted friends I could truly geek out with. I cope by making online friends from other countries who share my interests, but it's not the same as having someone nearby to actually do things with in person. I remember when the Minecraft movie came out, I asked my friends if they wanted to see it with me. They all looked at each other and said, ""What are you, 10?"" (I'm making them sound judgmental, but they're not, trust me. It was just a joke.)

So, since I had no one to watch the movie with, and I hate going to the movies alone, I just didn‚Äôt watch it. It's like the 87th time I wasn‚Äôt able to do something I wanted because I had no one to do it with.

I‚Äôve tried looking online for ways to meet people with similar interests, but most of the tips says things like:

* ‚ÄúGo to a convention.‚Äù There aren‚Äôt any in my city.
* ‚ÄúUse apps to find local events!‚Äù I did, and all I could find were people twice my age.
* ‚ÄúJoin a group activity.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt find one that interested me.
* ‚ÄúJoin a book club.‚Äù All the ones I found were full of people much older than me.
* ‚ÄúGo to an alternative nightclub.‚Äù That one could work, I guess, but isn‚Äôt it weird to go to a club alone? There's no way I can convince my friends to go to a club that plays anything but pop and rap. There's also the fact that I'm looking for people that are more introverted like me and afaik they don't usually hang out at clubs.

There‚Äôs a somewhat popular store that sells geeky stuff, but I don‚Äôt want to be that person who randomly starts talking to people who are just trying to shop in peace and mind their own business (and also idk if I have the social skills to just strike up a convo with a random person at a place like that)

You guys don‚Äôt understand how much envy I feel when I see people my age hanging out at that nerdy store. I want friends so badly. Friends who want to watch shows with me, hang out at nerdy places, send memes to each other, play instruments together, share our art, enjoy music, cosplay together, go to the movies, you get the point.

At the same time I feel like an asshole cuz I'm not appreciating my friends, they're the funniest and coolest people I know and I do really like them and really appreciate their friendship but I also wish we had more things in common."
493,0,"i‚Äôm just going to vent here and get this off my chest (please delete if not allowed). 

my sister is some years older than me, but copies me for everything and it annoys me.

she recently started dating someone, who is from the same country/region (very specific) as my boyfriend (of 8 years). she has always said it would be nice to date someone from where my boyfriend is from. she has recently said he‚Äôll be moving in, and that they‚Äôll be getting the SAME exact type of dog as me, and will be going to the same dog friendly local place that i frequent. i go there often (past few years) and have now become close friends with the regulars there. okay, not a big deal because i love dogs and it‚Äôs a public place but my sister has never liked dogs (thought they were dirty), and never had an interest in getting one until i got one. not for nothing, but i like my friends at the local dog spot, and don‚Äôt want to hangout or be around my sister and her new boyfriend because it all just irks me. i do feel bad, she doesn‚Äôt have many friends, but i also don‚Äôt want to mix my friends with her. sounds mean, i know, but we just don‚Äôt always get along. i have 3 siblings, and while we are family, we all have our own separate friends and lives and it has always been like this. my other sister and my boyfriend agree that my older sister copies me for everything (not just abt the bf and dog, but everything i like and do), and they see it too. 

i feel uncomfortable at family dinners around them. my sisters new boyfriend always makes comments about me being my parents favorite (which is 100% not true, my parents love all 4 of us). i just awkwardly laugh it off, but it‚Äôs such an uncomfortable comment/ not sure where he even gets that from. it also get uncomfortable when paying for/splitting the bill. he feels he shouldn‚Äôt have to pay, because no one thanked him personally for chipping in the last time. my parents collectively thanked all of us at the table for taking them to dinner.

before she was dating this guy, i used to invite her over for dinner all the time because she doesn‚Äôt cook, doesn‚Äôt really have friends, and lived alone so i felt bad. this is her first boyfriend/real relationship, and while i am happy for her, i have been keeping my distance. 

Apologies for ranting, and if i sound like a terrible human being (please don‚Äôt judge me!), but i am just frustrated and i feel uncomfortable around my sister and new boyfriend."
494,3,"So:
I (25M) broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years in March of this year. The end of the relationship was a long a painful one. She struggles with mental health and socializing and I struggle with being a people pleaser and not knowing how to set boundaries (that should clarify a lot of the context). We moved in together about a year and a half ago. When we first talked about breaking up it was a ‚Äúsoft breakup‚Äù, we talked about how we weren‚Äôt fulfilling the relationship expectations the other had and even though that was heartbreaking, we still wanted to stay connected. For financial reasons we also decided to stay in the same apartment until she was financially stable enough to move out (the apartment is connected to my work so she was going to have to move out.) 

Fast forward to about a month later after a trip to a psychiatric intervention facility where I took her when she spiraled too far, things got dangerous and I didn‚Äôt know what to do (I still need to find a therapist to work through that with), she goes to dinner with a girlfriend of hers and comes back with an energy that was different. She shared with me that she wanted to start having experiences and living life the way she ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt with me‚Äù. For context, she has said that I was a ‚Äúsafe place‚Äù for her, but she felt constricted and unable to live the edgier life she wanted to. Sex had always been a rough topic too. I didn‚Äôt  have as much experience and always found it hard to change myself into what she wanted in the bedroom. It turns out that sex was the catalyst that started her realization that she wanted something else. I accepted that but it still hurt more than I thought to hear that what I was giving her wasn‚Äôt enough.

We fell back on the fact that we were just too different and couldn‚Äôt work together romantically. Again, heartbreaking, but I understood it. 

Fast forward again to the end of May when I was on a trip for 2 weeks. During the trip, the separation really started the grieving process and I was doing terribly. I was feeling the loss for the first time and with it all of the emotions. When I came back I was a mix of still being sad, accepting the breakup, and wanting to have a hard talk about making things work. I told her how much I was struggling (without trauma dumping I promise) and things were a little sensitive but all in all stable. 

Then I found out she was seeing someone. 
Let me preface this by saying that I know she was within her right to see someone. Later it turns out she was just meeting him for sex (I don‚Äôt need to explain how hurt I was by that either right?) and that she regretted it. But I found out about it from what she left laying around the apartment. Signs that she was getting herself dressed up and nice to go somewhere (her social anxiety was what made me think twice about that). 
She went to the movies with him. We did that together. I know emotions are sensitive after a breakup and my reactions aren‚Äôt super clear-headed or whatever. But after hearing me tell her how much I was struggling? Literally the night after? And maybe even the same night? To go out and have sex with someone while I was in our apartment trying to hold myself together? How many times did she meet him while I was gone? 

After that event things have been everywhere. She‚Äôs melted down a few times, we‚Äôve fought, she‚Äôs tried to apologize but I‚Äôm not in a place to accept that apology right now. 

And look, normally all of this would be pretty normal breakup stuff and not really special. But we live in a very small studio apartment together. She‚Äôs planning on moving out, but only at the end of August. I have friends I can stay with for a couple of nights at a time and I do whenever I need to, but she only has one person and because of how she is socially, she doesn‚Äôt want to do that very often. 

I‚Äôm now caught in this unending cycle of the stages of grief and I‚Äôm having to hide how I‚Äôm feeling at any given moment because I don‚Äôt want to make this living situation worse for either of us. Every time I look at her I there‚Äôs a new emotion wanting to be felt. I‚Äôm writing this now because I‚Äôm angry. I really want to be pissy with her and remind her how much she hurt me but I can‚Äôt so I‚Äôm sharing with internet strangers. 

There‚Äôs definitely some details I‚Äôve left out but I tried to do my best to give a good overview of the situation.

I‚Äôm also naturally a patient and kind person to a fault. So dealing with this much anger and conflicting emotions at once isn‚Äôt easy for me.

Thanks for reading :)"
495,1,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôm a 50-year-old woman currently going through a pretty serious health scare. I won‚Äôt get into the details here, but it‚Äôs been a stressful and emotional time. I‚Äôm currently waiting for serious testing and results.

The other day, I ran into my neighbor while walking my dog. To give some context‚Äîhe‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a bit of an odd one. Sometimes loud and obnoxious, sometimes surprisingly kind. You never really know which version you‚Äôll get.

During a bit of casual small talk, I mentioned that I‚Äôve been sick and that I‚Äôm waiting to find out whether or not I have cancer.

His immediate, unfiltered response? He said‚Äîout loud‚Äî‚ÄúGood.‚Äù

I was stunned. That was his first reaction. He quickly followed up with, ‚ÄúYou poor thing,‚Äù but the damage was already done. The energy behind that initial ‚ÄúGood‚Äù was real. I felt it in my gut. That wasn‚Äôt a slip of the tongue‚Äîit was something deeper, and it showed.

I looked at him and said, ‚ÄúOh, I see. You‚Äôre glad I might have cancer.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt deny it‚Äîhe just looked at me and repeated the pity line.

It was one of those moments where you see someone‚Äôs true colors. Whether it was spite, malice, or just a complete lack of empathy, I‚Äôll never forget that response. It‚Äôs disturbing how revealing people‚Äôs instinctual words can be.

I‚Äôm not going to have conversations of any sort with him going forward.  I will be polite & say hello but nothing of substance.  Tell me how you might respond to this?  

Thanks for reading this.  "
496,2,"It‚Äôs so baffling to think anyone can own an animal. I‚Äôm disgusted and so disappointed in how some people treat animals. 

 Burning small animals alive in a park with gas because it‚Äôs ‚Äúfunny‚Äù. Shooting a horse you bought because it bit you. Dragging your dog out your car window because it won‚Äôt listen. Purposely running over the neighborhood cats. 

Hold your pets tight people, because you can‚Äôt trust anyone anymore. "
497,2,"I went to a supposed ""Singles"" Event to network and potentially form bonds (of all kinds) with like minded people (men and women) and upon arrival I noticed that the event was brimming with groups of people who clearly already knew each other (cliques) or were familiar with each other and couples. 

The platform I used to meet people already hosts a lot of events that primarily cater to couples, yet the one time I attend an event supposedly for Singles, it is flooded with Couples who of course, largely kept to themselves or only socialised with other groups/couples.

This made the atmosphere feel very isolating and tense because everyone seemed to be paired up and I thought it was unfair for an event like that to essentially be dominated by people already in romantic relationships, I also noticed other single people looking as lost as I was at times because we didn't know who to talk to since everyone else was 'occupied'. 

I believe that Single events like that should *strictly* be for Singles only, especially to help ease newcomers in and allow room to connect with people in similar situations.

We already live in a society where almost everyone is hyper focused on Romantic Relationships and many things in society is largely catered to 'Couples' i.e. holiday packages, experience days, spa days, services, Valentines Day, Christmas etc, furthermore, Romantic Relationships are constantly and heavily promoted via TV shows, Movies, Songs and even people's everyday conversations.

Romance can be nice, but marriage/romantic relationships feel forced at least on people like myself like it is a Cult seeking to recruit infinite followers and yes, I do my best to shift my focus and socials away from romantic relationships.

However, it's no wonder why most people obsess over their current relationships or the idea of being in one, because we have been conditioned to view and seek romantic relationships as the pinnacle of love, happiness, wholeness and meaning in life whereas the 'Single' status is unfairly seen and treated like a temporary phase/waiting room for the mythical 'One', a punishment or a disease.

I know that despite these thoughts and certainly this post, that the world will continue to be Couple-Centric which is a shame because there is SO much more to life than attaching yourself to and seeking constant validation from an imperfect human being.

*Edit* I also want to make it clear that I did and DO make effort to engage with actual Singles. I did speak to those who appeared to be single, it went both ways, either the odd few would approach me or I'd approach them. In my daily life I do a lot to maintain focus on self growth and Non-romantic activities, I don't speak without taking action."
498,1,"I'm feeling really terrible and just need to vent. I met a guy through an acquaintance, and we seemed to hit it off instantly. We would flirt with each other‚Äîour knees would touch, and our eyes were locked. It felt like he wanted to kiss me multiple times, and we got along wonderfully. We have so much in common, and we would talk for hours. When people saw us together at events, they often thought we were a couple. Someone even joked that we looked so in love.

Nothing progressed beyond that‚Äîhe never asked me out or anything, even though the flirting continued. I can‚Äôt say he did anything inappropriate, but I just thought he was available. Now that I‚Äôve learned he‚Äôs getting married, I feel so dumb and a bit jealous because he seems so perfect‚Äîlike the best guy‚Äîand I feel like I missed out!"
499,3,"As soon as I turned 20, chronic illnesses started hitting me hard. In the past couple months I've developed POTS, and I need to schedule an appointment to be evaluated for MS.

Im always tired, and I get spells of fatigue that make it hard to keep my eyes open, even while standing. I'm having what I call ""bone aches"", where my bones feel like they're on the verge of breaking, and there's nothing I can do to soothe the feeling. I've brought these things up to family, friends, and coworkers and no one seems to care. No, I am not being dramatic, I am in pure agony. I want more than anything to just be healthy but I can't go a day without feeling miserable.

My spells of fatigue are affecting my work performance, but I can't bring it up without sounding whiny. I just want help..."
500,1,"The past few months I just can't seem to care about anything. All I want to do is lay around and scroll YouTube and literally nothing else. Getting through work is getting harder and harder, even when I'm only working part time hours, not to mention full time. It's like a perpetual state of burnout and nothing seems to make it better. I can't think straight, my head is constantly foggy and half operating. And everything seems to be going so great for everyone else. Family members give me crap about my job not being consistent and about how I ""could've had a good career by now"" at 24. I don't have any goals or aspirations, I just want to exist and slowly disappear and it fucking sucks."
501,1,"I honestly don't even know if I should be feeling this way but today is my 30th birthday and I feel like it was just like any other day. 

I was expecting a happy birthday at midnight. Did not happen. I expected my partner to have taken today off. Did not happen. I asked him why he did not take the day off and he said he forgot. I expected to be able to spend my birthday lunch out relaxing yet was basically ushered home because my partner had to get back to work. Gifts were the exact two things I asked for. Birthday card had less writing in it than normal. I had a nice meal cooked for me but my partner ran off to play video games leaving me to clean up. No one bought a birthday cake either.

I didn't want a massive blow-out party but this just feels like an afterthought."

503,1,"I want to give up so badly. I'm sad and tired all the time and I'm tired of being tired. It's so hard to push on when you have no one in your corner. I hate that I keep thinking of her even though we never dated and haven't talked in years. I hate that the only way I'll stop thinking of her is if I find another but I can't in good conscious search for anyone cause I have no money or a job at the moment. I hate that I've given up on the idea of self deletion but the accompanying thoughts of ""what's the point of all this"" haven't disappeared. I don't have an answer anymore. I hate how self aware I am so I rely on alcohol to make my mind shut the fuck up when I go out. I hate that I can't go out cause I hate leaving the house without money or relying on friends to pay my tab. I hate that every job seems to pass me up cause of the gaps on my employment history or I just happen to have the worst resume in existence. I don't know why I keep going? What am I fighting for? What do I hope for? My life has been largely cyclical, it's all the same. I always fall down and lose all hope, pick myself back up just to end up in a worse spot then before. In the past these hardships had meaning, I can take solace in the fact that each fall down would lead me closer to the path of taking my life but I don't have it anymore. I've tried therapy and it's given me some insight but it wasn't enough. I just want it to end, I don't want to die I just want to stop existing. I'm so damn lonely but so guarded at the same time. I hate that I recognize that hating myself is entirely unproductive and equates to shooting yourself  in the foot but I can't stop hating myself. If I met someone like me I'd hate them with all my heart. A hypocrite who doesn't practice what he preaches. A person full of ego who paradoxically hates himself and believes he's worthy of no one. I hate that I believe full accountability is the path to success but I can't draw the line between accountability and pointless self hatred. I hate how much of a downer I am cause I'm tired and angry and sad all the time. I hate how much of a liability I am to people around me. I hate when I talk to people and can feel the disconnect happening in real time but can't do anything about it. I can tell people aren't interested in what I want to say but I don't know why. Why is there a disconnect between me and people? What am I doing wrong. I'm tired, I'm just so tired of it all."
504,2,"I (22f) and my friend (21m) have been good friends for many years and run in the same friendship circle. I've liked him for a very long time and asked him if you would want to date me (after about 2 years of being in an on-off ""situationship"" as you would call it) We have often met just the two of us and our friendship is very flirty, but we have never been physical. My friend agreed to date me but warned me that he currently does not have feelings for me in that way anymore (he said after at the end of our ""situationship"" he realised we were probably never going to be a thing since I refused and he in result lost feelings). He did say he was willing to try and see if we could get to that point, to which I said I'm okay with that but only if he is willing to give ""us"" an actual shot and be serious about us dating and seeing if we can there emotionally. He agreed, so I guess were are ""officially dating"". 

Now that same night I went to a party and spent the entire night flirting and dancing with another guy (stranger, hadn't met him before). He ended up kissing me and I enjoyed it and kissed it back. The kiss was alright cause I could tell the guy had experience from the way he moved his tongue and I hadn't kissed anyone before so I was pretty bad. Throughout the evening we kissed two more times and he offered to take me to his place, which I did end up refusing. We exchanged numbers. (Also I was sober the entire time if that's relevant.)

I kinda feel confused about the whole thing. On one hand I don't know why I did that since the guy I have liked for years had finally agreed to date me and I was the one who insisted on us only dating if he was actually serious about giving this a try. On the same evening I go and kiss and flirt with another dude. On the other hand I don't regret it and we haven't officially said we are exclusive (although I think it's implied like if he goes on a date with a girl atp I would be pissed). The dude from the party has also reached out and said he wants to hang out again and get to know me better, which I said yeah sure to. I guess I want to keep him around in case my number 1 realises we can't get to the point and we stop dating. Also he was cute.

I don't know what to do or if I did something wrong. I really like the dude I'm dating and I'm never going to tell him about this cause I'm pretty sure he would see it as a betrayal and quit not only dating but out friendship. He would genuinely never talk to me again. Was what I did bad, was it cheating? I feel like I managed to make a huge mess in less than a day. "
505,2,"Yesterday really threw me off track. I went to a family gathering to celebrate my grandma and grandpas 50th anniversary. I haven‚Äôt seen some of these family members in YEARS.

I‚Äôm barely eking out the day, I hate that I‚Äôm trying my best, I hate that I‚Äôm able to find the correct help, I hate that no matter the amount of time that passes it gets worse, I hate being able to cook, I hate I don‚Äôt have any family, I hate that I can‚Äôt lash out, I hate it so freaking much.

I stopped seeing my therapist a few weeks ago because he was telling me things I didn‚Äôt want to hear or have to do and I know it was a dumb decision but I couldn‚Äôt handle that then.

508,1,"Having a rough time of it. I love, or am limerent for, someone who hates my guts. Time passing has only softened my memory of the ways she was awful to me, but has barely eroded the things about her that I loved or the happy memories of us. I ruined my recent relationship by getting triggered when we watched Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Trying to treat my feelings about the first girl as an obsession and to stamp them out with therapy felt like too much of a parallel to the mind wiping. I feel awful that these thoughts and constant internal comparisons and judgements spoiled my relationship. Girl B dearly loved me and I made her happy. She didn't deserve to lose me. Girl B was kind, gracious, emotionally intelligent and supported me through things that she had no obligation to support me through. If I couldn't make it work with her, there's no way I can make it work with anyone. I don't feel like I will ever be able to wholly love another person. My love for Girl A feels like a curse.


I tried to get therapy for OCD. I feel like my feelings for Girl A and my constant worrying about the ""rightness"" of the relationship with Girl B are textbook ROCD. I got turned down for the therapy today as my case is 'too complex'.

My one source of joy is gliding. It's the only time being alive feels worth it. It's the only community I feel I belong to, and the only one I feel an active motivation to contribute to. My only source of hope and direction for the future is centred around achieving my solo rating. Today I learned that my medical certificate will be denied because I take medication for my ADHD. I'm heartbroken. I have no choice but to stop taking the meds and try to cling on to my job for dear life.


I can't k-ll myself because my family cares about me. Every time one of them tries to message me, all I feel is an overwhelming sense of guilt and shame. I wish I could be forgotten about by everyone. I don't want to live any more with these thoughts. I don't want to hurt any more people. I can't bear the pressure, and nobody can make it better.

509,0,"Don‚Äôt you hate it, when you‚Äôve been tolerating someone‚Äôs behavior because you‚Äôre trying to be understanding and patient, and then they come to you accusing you of doing exactly what they‚Äôve been doing to you?
It‚Äôs like a quiet confession that they hate the way they are, but cannot admit consciously to the fact they are not who they‚Äôd like to be. 

And the hardest part is trying to talk about possible projection - without sounding like you‚Äôre doing a Uno-Reverse Card. 
""It‚Äôs you who does that!"" Just sounds so stupid. ""Why didn‚Äôt you say something before"" well maybe I should have.

Please stop before my infant daughter becomes old enough to adopt such silliness."
513,2,"I know people are entitled to their opinions, and I don't disrespect Christians or any other religion. But when they make it their mission to put down people who aren't cis and straight, I'll argue back. I dont care how many people disagree with me here because at the end of the day, its my post, my opinion. 

My stepdad is a Christian, I am not. My mum isn't either and shes pansexual. My stepdad doesn't say anything negative about people who are different when she's around, he doesn't mind (obv or he wouldn't be w her). But sometimes he'll just mention how it's so wrong for someone to be trans or gay and it gets on my nerves. 

His sisters child is 17 and identifies as a male. None of the family, other than my mum, me and his mum bother even trying to use his name and pronouns. They all say ""you were born a girl so you still are one"" and ""its wrong because the bible says so"". 

I dated a girl once and since then I'm still not sure if I'm bi. My mum supported me last time, and I know she would again, but now if I do decide I like girls, ill just be talked about. All because ""man shall not lay with man as women shouldn't lay with women"" or whatever. I dont really care honestly.

Everytime they say something though they always laugh as if its just a joke to them. I get so annoyed because whats the point in even talking to me about this shit when you know my opinion. And everytime its just a repeat of what we've already argued about. "
514,1,"I'm actually so fed up of being shit at everything. Literally everything I do. I technically go to a high-tier school, but I still feel stupid. I have genuinely not found a single thing that I'm not naturally terrible at. I play video games a lot with some friends, and have the most hours by a lot on all the competitive games we play, but I'm still absolutely shit compared to the rest of them.
To have over 700 hours on certain games and still be on the same rank as an average player with 200 hours is just truly soulcrushing.
It's gotten to the point where I feel I'm going to die completely useless with no purpose.
At least I still sort of enjoy things I'm bad at. But that's diminished a lot."
515,3,"I recently stumbled upon the Veo 3 news. I'm personally scared this and the evolution of ai is going to ruin my dreams of being a graphic designer. Art is my identity, I love music, drawing, and writing. Without that I have no identity. It feels like I just give up my dreams because of ai and greedy corporations? Ai is evolving and it is ruining artists and anybody who has the potential of being replaced.

I'm tired of being told to accept it by Ai tech bros or nihilists on the internet. I know I might have to give up and slave away in a factory or tech job and hope to not get laid off by that either.

I don't know if I have to get rid of the creative part of me. I don't want ai to replace art, music, writing, filmmaking, etc. I feel like it makes me have to give up.

If ai is going to replace everything I love I don't want to be alive. I don't know what to do."
516,2,"The internet is unbearable at this point. Half the posts I come across are just shamelessly copy pasted from ChatGPT, and even when they‚Äôre not, half the comments are. Clearly generated images are passed around like hotcakes, either triggering a discourse on how it IS ai or a discourse on how it ISN‚ÄòT.

Twitter is a contained ironic hellscape seeing as it‚Äòs littered with people who are genuinely frustrated when the built in AI, Grok, giving them answers that go against their preexisting beliefs or having wet dreams of swimming in a pool of Dogecoin when Grok reinforces their deep seeded racism.

It‚Äòs creeping into my music apps, my internet browsers, my phone, it‚Äòs inserting itself into my life in a way that I myself as a deeply antisocial person would never tolerate from a human I like, much less some sort of digital hive mind physically incapable of empathy.

The same freaks who were willing to stand idly by as thousands of innocent people dropped dead to a deadly virus spreading throughout the world under the guise of ‚Äûthat vaccine coming out far too quickly‚Äú have managed to drastically reshape the entire internet within a couple of years by bootlicking a glorified autocorrect programmed to inflate your ego."
517,0,"My dumb bf watches a girl get lied to by some guy, let's call him Fface.

But guess who is the bad guy according to bf? 

She is. 

She's the bad guy because she wasn't nice about being lied to by Fface. 

And the liar was the victim. 

The fact that he lied ? Completely irrelevant to bf. Fface is the victim.  

Because she wasn't nice about being lied to. 

Yall. Whoever gets my dumb boyfriend next, I'm sorry. 

I tried to fix him, he's impossible.  He's gonna be your problem now. 

Edit:

If i had detail I would give it. 

There is no detail. So for clarity:

Bf watched Fface tell a blatant lie to girl. Girl gets mad, refuses to date Fface, and tells Fface off. 

Bf watches the interaction between girl and Fface. He's not involved. 

No throwing things. No name calling.  No psychical violence.  No law breaking. 

She's just having fucking standards and boundaries.  

Bf says she's the bad guy because she wasn't nice about him lying. 

It was maddening bf had this mentality that the wrong doer is the victim because bf obviously is a liar himself! 

Edit 2:

You're right. Other people in the comments caught on pretty fast about how it shows off bf character. No explanation or detail needed. They just got it. 

The one's who need to know more detail so they can determine if the liar is not the bad guy, fail to have the necessary logical deduction capabilities of making a worthy judgement (on a VENT POST) in the first place. (DUH I'm not going to be upset and write a post for bf defending an ACTUAL victim for lying to someone) "

519,3,"I am a 55F, married to my 54M husband for 13 years in September. We went to HS together though we were just friends, and band members. So, throughout my adult life, things happened, horrendous migraines, I got specialized care, they would knock me unconscious sometimes and cause me to fall. I have an ongoing battle with my non existent Thyroid, I was born with no Thyroid, so when I got older I got fluffier and there is fuck all we can do, I take my meds I eat right etc.  The huge kick came in the form of Diverticulitis.  

  
If you don't know, Diverticulitis are pockets in your intestines that contain infection as a result of food getting caught in them.  I had them all through my colon, that led to 2008 emergency surgery, and 2012 3 surgeries + other procedures costing me some of my hearing, 50% of my balance, and 40 days in the hospital.  

  
So the title:  Throughout all of these things the meds they had given me for healing for pain which I am in constantly non stop every day, my core has been dissected 4 times vertically and once horizontally, so I am filled with scar tissue.   I had taken pain meds, nothing worked, tried the THC/CBD route but both give me horrible migraines, even the gummies.  



The lasting side effects: my brain!  When I tell you I used to be smart, I was, I had all kinds of knowledge!!! Now I feel like I have a head full of rocks, and my short term memory, with some long term is garbage it's awful! I can't remember a name to save my life if you tell me 4 times to my face, places, movies I watched, all kinds of things.  So, I know this right?  So do people around me, they sometimes use this against me like I forget I was alive that day.  I CAN recall conversations I had if I try really hard, not always but if it was important I sometimes can.  I feel like I am defending myself against gaslighting constantly, my hubby doesn't mean to do it but it does happen.  My kid used to try it and I gave him a verbal beatdown he will never forget, he hasn't done it since. People that are ""friends"" (they are acquaintances) try it all the time and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  When it doesn't it just hurts that they think I am stupid or incompetent.  

  
I have a LOT of knowledge about certain things, I used to be a substance abuse counselor, I have retained those skills and I have books, I also attended school for my Masters in Couples Counseling, but I got seriously ill in 2012 so I could not complete my Masters.  It took a year just to recover.I lost my license, and job, and funding.  Now some people second guess me like I am some kind of fool.  I was the go to at my work for prescription drugs and other opioids, I trained all the new people as I was trained.  Yet people I know are like..Are you sure? Or they argue with me.  I tell them, you came to me,I said this, if you do not like it, talk to someone else.  I'm not mean about it.

So there it is... Thank you for your consideration

Stop worrying and stressing over dumb shit. Its just a clear indicator that you've never actually had any real problems. These are not real problems most of time.

He breaks down crying and I don't know how he still talks to her. We moved halfway across the country and she told him that he was going to die out there. THAT WAS LESS THEN A FUCKING YEAR AGO. I officially snapped today and told him that I straight up hate her. I can't hold back anymore. I've been nice about it and I won't say anything to her out of respect for him but fuck her I hate her. She hides behind religion but she's a horrible fucking person and I don't know how she lives with herself. He's going back to our hometown for a week long visit in a few days and she took a full day off without him asking her to. I know for a fucking FACT that she's going to try to manipulate, cry, and guilt him into spending the whole day with her. He doesn't want to but she took the whole day off ""for him."" I don't sway him in either direction about going completely NC (I think he should but don't tell him that) because that is his decision, which is why I'm venting.

I‚Äôve been holding in all my issues and all my problems in a small jar, it ruins you, it‚Äôs hard to talk about emotions you feel when you‚Äôre just so used to being the one listening about others issues. I just wish I could talk about my issues and my regrets, but I just freeze up every time. I think it‚Äôs also worth mentioning I‚Äôm a person who can personality change in an instant, I could be a cretin of chaos one moment, and an armchair therapist the next, so I feel like I‚Äôve curated this false personality around others, like I can‚Äôt distinguish who I really am.

and speaking off, still trapped in apprenticeship for another year so nothing is gonna change until late 2026 IF everything else goes smooth because who wants to date a 27 year old guy who basically earns no money, lives at home and is a virgin(before one even goes into looks)

Ik this makes me look pathetic and other people have to actually deal with ""serious"" issues in their life or whatever but I just cant take it anymore
thinking about taking Antidepressants or something
maybe go to a doctors appointment and get diagnosed with autism or something, that would actually explain a lot

526,1,"I've been in survival mode since I was 13. For 7 fucking years, it's been nothing but ""Okay... just gotta get through this day. Or get hit by a bus, either is fine."" First, when I was around 13, there was some real bad bullshit that lasted a couple years that I won't go into. In the middle of that, the lockdown happened. In the middle of *THAT,* I started having seizures and was diagnosed with *fucking epilepsy!* Only a couple of months ago (middle of March-ish), after two years of being seizure-free, was I able to come off my medicine. I still haven't recovered my mind, and I don't know if I ever will. Is there even a mind *to* recover? Or was a dumbass before the epilepsy and medicine?

And I'm tired of losing people. Almost every school year, I went to a new school. Had to make new friends. Lost those friends. And then, once I moved in with my dad and started 7th grade, I thought I'd finally be at one school! And I'd made a shitton of friends, and most of them knew each *other-* finally, I *fit in!* I had somewhere I *belonged!* Some of us even hung out, in a group, outside of school!!!

...and then my dad told me we were moving. 10th grade, I had to restart. Again. I was so unbelievably angry and upset. I ended up staying at that school until I graduated, and I made a couple new friends, but it wasn't the same. I didn't ""belong."" Everywhere I went, everyone I talked to, I always felt like an outsider. Clubs I was in, I was just a background character. I didn't matter as an individual; any random motherfucker could have been in my place and nothing would change. And that feeling stuck. I feel like an outsider at my job. I feel like an outsider among my own family. In my own godsdamn skin.

I'm just so tired of being unhappy. So tired of feeling alone. I just want to be happy, and have that happiness fucking *last!* I want to make a bunch of good friends who all know each other, and we can all hang out and go do stuff as a group. 

Is that too fucking much to ask?"

535,0,"I (23F) have a lot of hobbies which involve achieving things, in general productivity is my hobby. 

Some examples: I've solo travelled over 20 countries on a budget, I run a YouTube channel which is just about to hit 1k subscribers, and in the past year I've lost 16kg, created my own training program, and got abs from it. I have an apartment by myself (moved in at 22) and I beat 400 other applicants to a fully remote job in my field of study straight out of university. 

I did all of this despite my chronic anxiety and depression, 20 years of childhood neglect (medical, educational, social) and trauma, and I'm also estranged. So that's the context.

Here's the vent part: people in my life keep asking me how I achieved any or all of the above, and then they get mad or complain when I'm honest.

Sure, I've solo travelled 20 countries, and I did it by meticulously planning and saving for multiple years with every single hour and transaction accounted for, sleeping in airports/sketchy hostels and taking ridiculous night buses and red-eye flights on budget airlines to save money and time.

Sure, my YouTube channel is thriving, and I did that by filming and posting over 500 longform videos, one every single day for almost two years now, continuously seeking ways to improve.

Sure, I lost 16kg and got abs, and I did that by tracking every single calorie for over a year now, creating my own training program which includes over 500 reps total across 7 exercises, and doing that every single day, no skips, for nearly 2 months now, waking up at 5am to get it done before work.

Sure, I have an apartment by myself, but I saved up for the deposit by working full time alongside my full time degree in final year, and balancing house viewings with writing my thesis and 172645 other deadlines, oh and getting a grad job too.

Sure, I have a ""dream job"" but it took me 3 years of work experience, 2 volunteering placements, an internship, 5 months, over 1000 applications and over 20 interviews to finally get that offer.

And as soon as I actually answer ""oh my goddddd, how did you do itttt???"" with an honest rundown of what it takes to get all of this done, the complaints start. ""oh no, that sounds like a lot of work"" ""oh but doing that routine every day sounds really boring"" ""woww, don't you ever get fed up of doing all that, I could never"".

Then I'll hang out with them again a week later and it's all ""oh I wish I had a job like you"", ""oh you look so good, I'm so jealous"" ""damn, must be nice to travel to all those places, huh?""

I TOLD YOU HOW I DID IT AND YOU ARE TOO LAZY TO DO THE SAME!!!!!!

So yeah. Don't fucking ask me how I did it and then whine about it. I'm sick of hearing excuses. Either accept the ways your life sucks, or put in the work to change.

I'm so freaking SICK of these companies treating all of their employees like CRAP. The worst part is, I took accountability any time I made an error with my work, but no one else would take ANY accountability for their end of things. 

Don't get me wrong, I am glad that the toxic work environment is finally done, but now I get to be unemployed.  Yay \*sarcasm.\*

Thank you for those who read this it might be a little long I have no clue lol but I hope you might relate or not as well because well it sucks but I hope you are feeling well and all is good in your life and family especially in these times. 

Well to start I'm 19M and I have anxiety now it's not as bad as the other people here but I still have it and recently have been having hard time to control it. Usually when that happens I start thinking about my life in the future. Ik im 19 but when this happens I feel so behind and lacking so many things. Idk if it's just me but I feel like I have 0 money and no time at all. I have a job so I do work and get money but it feels like it's not enough and it's not exactly a job I would like to stay at all my life. Well the job takes time but also another is school as of right now I'm taking summer off but when school is added on top of that it SUCKS. I don't even know if I even want to continue school it's more for like my parents thing. I just have no time for so many things I wanna do. 

Although I say this I feel like I finally have something to look forward to and work towards and I really wanna do this. All my life I've consumed so much content and that is something I would LOVE to do. I think I can do well in content creation and not just do it for fame or much money at least lol. My plan is to show people that anything is fucking possible and in world with so many negative things shown I wanna show positive things. Things like hanging out with your friends and it doesn't have to include alcohol or any kind of drugs just things like that because that is what I do and I have a fucking blast doing it. I'm very passionate about content creation but I've never done it and I want to and I feel like that that is something I wanna do and it will work out for me. I'm currently waiting on my camera see when I can get one there's just so many things I wanna show the whole world but that's pretty much it I hope I'm able to do it soon and again thank you to any one who read I appreciate you took your time to read this and I hope you have a good rest of your day. :) "

I planned the breakup like some weeks before and discussed it with friends thought about my role in the relationship what I might have missed but it all lead to breakup. So we broke up she cried and told me ""Obviously you never cared about me or the relationship"" which hurt me more than anything because I really did care it's not that I was absent or distant I was there for you whenever I could and that's also the moment when I just lost all feelings for her. Anyway she leaves and I call my girl best friend to come consult me after because I was a little down and angry at what was said. I vented she listened and helped me feel much better. I've had a small crush on her before the relationship but during it I forgot about it. Those feelings started flowering again after the breakup. We went to the beach with her group of friends and we all had fun that day later as we were going home I pressed her a little about a mysterious guy she likes (didn't tell me who he was) and she made a comment about not seeing what's under my nose. I didn't want to make it weird so I ignored it silently panicking later that day we talked and realized we both liked each other and we went on a date yesterday. It went amazing. There was a normal amount of nervousness and awkwardness but we made out had fun I left her home and went back all happy talking to my bsf about it then I go to bed and wake up the next day to find a text from her pretty much saying she can't be in a relationship with me because we moved to fast and she felt she lost the relationship with her self and God. Now I'm devastated. I don't know why but this feels worse than when I broke up with my ex. I can't exactly understand or relate to her reasoning and so I replied with ""I see if you feel that something might change I'm always here"" and she said that she's really happy I understand but things won't change. This felt like a real slap in the face and really blew up my sense of worth... Anyway that was my rant might be posting another later about other stuff that came to mind after this insistent "
547,2,"Hello! So I have my lab work going on right now since the past 2 days. I recognized a pattern building up with a person in my lab group. The person constantly undermines me in some sort of minute passive aggressive way, have caught them actively avoid or try to steer away a convo i have started with ppl, small and sudden burst of anger whenever i speak, etc. This person is also part of an inner circle of ppl in the lab group who are sort of the same but quite mild in comparison to them. One of the few ' grp activities' these guys do,  teasing and gossiping about an another person in our grp who can only speak english and their mother-tongue ( English is not our first language). The thing is, I have seen ppl like him. These people are usually loud mouthed (which they are) who harbor grudges against you. In time these grudges and emotions build up and then they start to influence like minded ppl like them to form a target. Then the targeted person will face stuff bullying, boycotting, gossip, spreading false rumors, etc. I have seen this pattern first hand during my childhood. I have wasted much of my formative years trying to impress and befriend these types of ppl to be included in something atleast. never again. This time i atleast have some maturity and experience to mostly steer clear from this person and the grp. I wish i had this maturity 10 yrs ago tho. Things would have been better for me then? "
548,1,"I just came on here to vent, so please be nice, I already feel really guilty and I just can‚Äôt take the hate, I just want a space to say my peace and get it off my chest since I really feel bad already. 

I adopted a 2 yr old cat this past Friday, and when I picked him up (he was adopted from my local humane society, I‚Äôm big on adopt don‚Äôt shop) he was wonderful, from the minute I held him I could feel a connection, but unfortunately that connection kinda went to me just feeling stressed. Growing up I always had a cat, and I loved her to pieces. She was hyper but was chill and loved her personal space. I wanted a cat who‚Äôs just chill, like come home from work play a bit and then just sit n watch tv ya know. And my kitty was just like that, we came home and watched severance for the most part. But since then his ‚Äúchill‚Äù personality is becoming just hyper. Last night I played with him for hours on end, he was panting by the end n I was hoping that this would tire him enough out so he could sleep and I could get some sleep, cuz the previous night he was just all over me, trying to get me to pet him at 3 am and then biting me when I won‚Äôt, biting me when I do, doing the bunny kicks while biting me the whole night because I was asleep and not awake to give him attention. He still had so much energy and just wanted to be on me 24/7. I will not lie, I broke down, the stress of not sleeping and just not being what he needs got to me and I just cried. I feel bad that I can‚Äôt be what he wanted me to be, and I can‚Äôt change his personality (and I don‚Äôt want to), but I also can‚Äôt get my energy up to the level he needs. I feel bad that his affection is starting to feel smothering to me, but I know that there‚Äôs a family out there that is ready for his energy and his affection (he is very affectionate with everyone). The more I‚Äôm with him the more I‚Äôm realizing that I can‚Äôt be what he needs me to be and he‚Äôs not what I need at this stage of my life. This being said, I really feel guilty with even the thought of giving him back, I cried all night when I realized it and tbh it‚Äôs making me feel very depressed that the though of giving him back is giving me relief (the humane society said I would have one month because personalities once home do change and it may not be a fit) and I have to realize that it‚Äôs ok that it didn‚Äôt work out, and that he need probably a multi human or cat household, and as a single women living alone it‚Äôs just not me. 

Anyways thanks for reading it through, I just feel bad I couldn‚Äôt be the right home for him but I think he would be better off with a another family and not me"

My girlfriend, my family, my friends, my coworkers, everyone. Every fucking time I give a direction the person I‚Äôm giving it to looks or goes the wrong way.

It is fucking infuriating. It‚Äôs not a sometimes thing. It‚Äôs not a mistake people make occasionally. It‚Äôs every single fucking time.

But for the most part I love the people who make the mistake, so I forgive them. I just don‚Äôt understand how nobody comprehends my directions."
556,1,"I‚Äôm so angry at the world and myself right now. These past few years have been hard mentally but this past year has been tough financially. Lost my job & everything else. I was offered by my sister last month to move to the state she lives in to start over and to get back on my feet. Literally 2 weeks into living there she told me she is no longer signing her lease over and that she is moving and I can‚Äôt go with her. That‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm an adult. But why tell me I can come here just to do that to me? I‚Äôm so beyond hurt. I literally have nothing. No where to go. I‚Äôve been applying for jobs but haven‚Äôt heard anything back. I have been sleeping in shelters when they have openings and have been sleeping outside other than that. I just hate life and am so ready to give up"
557,2,"I've been best friends with my ex almost all my life   before we started dating than recently she broke up with me..and it hurt like hell but I always did my best to move on while still remaining best friends with her but something that always pulls me 5 steps behind is comments she constantly makes and things she does that I've told her don't make me feel particularly good, she would make comments about kissing me, sleeping with me or how we can get back together in 30 years if we are both still single...a month ago we even slept together and it was initiated by her and I went along with it because truth is it's hard to move on..especially when she won't stop setting me back..and after we slept together she started saying shit like ""I was into it a month ago now im not"" but she would continue to make comments about it...and in general she constantly flips flops from being attracted to me to telling me she isn't attracted to me and from liking me to not even bothering to respond to me or talk to me for days...I'm truly going insane but I don't want to lose someone I've loved for almost all my life"
558,2,"Someone online ruined the enjoyment of simping for a character because they‚Äôre able to commission drawings all the time, they have all the merch related to a character, and they have signed prints from the voice actor of the character I really like, they claim that the character‚Äôs their ‚Äúcomfort character‚Äù but they have so many that it is hard for me to believe that the character is really their ‚Äúcomfort character‚Äù when they simp for so many..

My friend advised me to speak to that person and become friends with them, but it did not work out

I still have this feeling inside that gives me a panic attack every time I see a drawing of his character with my favorite character 

I‚Äôm not able to afford commissions, merch related to the character, and signed prints from the voice actor like he‚Äôs able to

I know I have an inferior complex but I can‚Äôt help it, I‚Äôve been through a lot in 2024 and dealing with this person and life has been hard for me and my friends or anyone doesn‚Äôt understand how hard I‚Äôm working to get better or how I feel..

I‚Äôm scared of him simping for the characters from my project I‚Äôm working on (which is why I‚Äôm setting up boundaries list for my characters so people like him don‚Äôt do that shit to my characters)

I feel like I can‚Äôt even simp for any character anymore if I wanted to because he‚Äôll be simping for the same character too

I really need someone to understand my pain, I don‚Äôt want to be the only one who feels this way about someone online who‚Äôs makes me this way..‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

I shouldn‚Äôt have to feel this way everyday in silence..

Edit: I forgot to mention that he‚Äôs older than me and he‚Äôs doing this

559,3,"I‚Äôm a senior and I‚Äôm about to graduate in a few weeks and all day today when I think about it I‚Äôve been crying my eyes out. 

 I‚Äôve been excited at the thought of graduating for YEARS but now that it‚Äôs happening soon I‚Äôm just crying non stop about it and panicking, yes I am excited to graduate but the thought of it has me stressed out so much."
560,3,"This weekend was my tribe‚Äôs annual powwow. My daughter and I stayed in a motel connected to the grounds where one of my uncles (who helps run parking) arranged rooms for the family. He gave me and my daughter a room at the very front of the hallway ‚Äî isolated from the rest of the family, who were placed at the back of the building. The men‚Äôs bathroom near our room was suddenly labeled ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs‚Äù midway through the stay, and something about the entire setup felt off.

On the final morning, my uncle unlocked our door with a key ‚Äî while my daughter and I were still asleep. He knocked and immediately opened it. When he saw us, he just said ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù then shut the door and walked away. It didn‚Äôt sit right with me, especially given his access to all the keys and the history in our family.

Later, at home with my parents, we started connecting the dots ‚Äî this uncle lives with another uncle who has multiple sexual abuse allegations, and that uncle‚Äôs son is currently in prison for child molestation. It brought up all the discomfort I‚Äôve been carrying.

As we were talking about this, my dad randomly started telling me a traumatic story from his childhood about being left alone at a party where a woman was raped. I think he was trying to relate, but I was already overwhelmed ‚Äî especially because I‚Äôve been sexually abused by both a cousin and my grandfather, who was a preacher at our tiny family church. I‚Äôve told my parents this in the past. They brushed it off. No real comfort. Just ‚Äúwell, he‚Äôs dead now.‚Äù

I finally snapped and told my dad I don‚Äôt feel safe in our home. That my brother (who assaulted me years ago and still lives here) shouldn‚Äôt even hear anything about me because people like him feed off information. I was calm ‚Äî just expressing myself ‚Äî but my dad exploded. He started screaming, cussing, pointing in my face, and making it all about his guilt. Saying things like ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do, kill your uncle?‚Äù and ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do anything about the past.‚Äù

I told him yelling doesn‚Äôt help and that I need him to just listen, not flip out. I told him I‚Äôve found healing on my own ‚Äî through God, through therapy, through honesty ‚Äî not through our church or their silence. That‚Äôs when he got even angrier, saying I didn‚Äôt learn anything from God until now, and that it took me this long to get it ‚Äúthrough my head.‚Äù He hit his chest and screamed, ‚ÄúThis is all my fault!‚Äù but again, it felt performative ‚Äî more about him than me.

My mom, who sat through everything in silence, later came to my room asking ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù even though she was right there. When I told her, she just made it about herself, saying she‚Äôs stayed quiet for 30 years because Dad always yells. She talked about her pain instead of helping me process mine.

This is why I don‚Äôt speak up. Nothing changes. No accountability. No deep conversation the next day. Just a fake ‚ÄúI love you guys‚Äù group text from my dad or a quick ‚Äúsorry.‚Äù And the cycle starts all over again.

I‚Äôm exhausted. I feel invisible and unsafe in my own home. I don‚Äôt feel like I can dress up, wear makeup, or even breathe around certain family members. I just want peace for myself and my daughter. I want a future where this trauma doesn‚Äôt follow us. I want to break the cycle ‚Äî but it feels so lonely.

If you‚Äôve ever gone through something like this ‚Äî especially trying to heal while stuck in a toxic home ‚Äî I‚Äôd really appreciate your thoughts, encouragement, or even just knowing I‚Äôm not alone.
"
561,1,"I realize that whenever I get to know a boy, I don‚Äôt even feel so in love I just want comfort and affection I think. That‚Äôs really bad because even if I want to be in a relationship, I can‚Äôt manage to like a person. and if I get into a relationship, I don‚Äôt feel nothing at all. is it because I haven‚Äôt found the right person yet? The only time I felt something was in my first relationship at 14 lol‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt even miss him, but I miss the feeling I was experiencing.
I think that what managed to make me ‚Äúnumb‚Äùto this kind of relationships might be my situationship of like four years (long-distance , talking on my phone). he‚Äôs the only guy who made me feel something but yet it‚Äôs really toxic and could never work,of course. The fact is, I can‚Äôt even distance myself from him because i end up thinking abt him all the time, which is not a problem bc i somehow i move on, but he always comes back and makes me fall into this trap again.
I have no problem leaving him because I did it multiple times, but I want to find a person in real life that makes me feel the same things.

562,2,"I‚Äôm 19F and recently found a lump on both of my breasts. Yesterday I went to my second follow up appointment, and shit really started to scare me. At first the breast cancer association denied me because of my age, I mean 19 year olds don‚Äôt really get breast cancer. When I came back for my second appointment about the matter my doctor examined me again, and I told her about the 2nd lump I found. Felt it, wasn‚Äôt happy about it. Told me she was going to re refer me because it‚Äôs concerning, especially with the other symptoms I have. 

Honestly i‚Äôm scared shitless lmao. I keep re-feeling the lumps and it becomes so much more real. My family has a significant history of cancer, I couldn‚Äôt have possibly got it this early right? I just gotta keep hoping it‚Äôs not what I think it is. It got even more real when she started explaining what they would do, what steps I would take, etc. I couldn‚Äôt even speak, that whole day I kept chain smoking fucking weed so I didn‚Äôt freak out over it. I would just like some peaceüòá"
563,3,"I am so annoyed right now. I really wanted to be a research assistant for an org I reached out to for opportunities prior to the application being posted. However, the first application i sent my High school transcript by accident. Then the second time I got everything correct, but forgot to add the name for my second reference. Luckily, she works in the org, but still. I tried previewing the PDF but since it's through Formstack I couldn't view it nor delete the submissions I sent. I sent two already. "
564,1,"I‚Äôve had problems with it since pre-puberty. I think it might‚Äôve been because my dad compulsively eats and my mom and most of my family were obese? I don‚Äôt know but it doesn‚Äôt really matter.
I‚Äôve been bigger than everyone else my whole life and bullied for it and ostracized.
Sophomore year I joined wrestling after covid homeschooling and I lost maybe 30 pounds in 3-4 months from it. I went from 210 (I think) to 160 something. I quit after a year because I was being bullied by the older boys and some of the girls on the team and it was really getting to me as well as taking up all my time and energy. 
Now i‚Äôm 19 and i‚Äôve gained almost 120 pounds and i‚Äôm at 290.

I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I moved to baltimore to finally get away from my abusive family just to continue gaining weight (I thought the stress of living there might‚Äôve been contributing).

I bought a gym membership that I tried to keep up with but my anxiety in public is really really bad (I couldn‚Äôt walk along roads for years or cross streets or be in public spaces very long) and so I was going 11pm- 3am and it was great until christmas when I visited home, and then my boyfriend was sick when I came back and the excuses just kept piling up  and after 3 months of paying for it and not going after my seasonal job ended I had to let my membership go. I‚Äôm from the rural south and living in Baltimore is a huge horrifying culture shock and going outside is really hard for me, especially since i‚Äôm at the biggest i‚Äôve ever been. 


The Real Problem Is That 

I started to get stretch marks on my stomach maybe a year ago
I cut on my stomach when I eat too much as a punishment so the stretch marks there don‚Äôt bother me (aside from feeling like my body is ruined), but last month I noticed them going down my arms‚Ä¶. and along my sides and my back, and now all over my shoulders and neck. 
It‚Äôs horrifying to me

I thought I just had bad muscle pain for like a week or two but I think it was my skin ripping for some reason 

i‚Äôve been trying to eat 1,600 a day per my boyfriends recommendation and I‚Äôm really not perfect at it my mental health is really bad recently but I just don‚Äôt know what to do.

I feel so defeated and like my body is ruined before I even grew into it. 

I see so many people complaining about gaining weight and not being like they were when they were younger but i‚Äôve never had that privilege of feeling deserving of the space I take up or like I belong around other people. 

I don‚Äôt know anymore really.


Writing this feelings good as it‚Äôs the first time i‚Äôve been able to put this all together like this but I feel so hopeless about this whole thing, I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll ever lose the weight and I can‚Äôt even wear cute girlish tops with the neck cut off or short sleeve shirts or anything.

I tried to dress up cute and do my hair with a straightener and my makeup and I just feel like a stupid ugly freak  cosplaying as someone else and it‚Äôs devastating."
565,3,"I‚Äôm just venting honestly, I‚Äôm so tired every day! I‚Äôm the sole earner and a father who‚Äôs doing 99% of everything. I take care of my daughter, cook for her, make sure she‚Äôs okay, potty train her, teach her, take her to the bathroom, shower her, put her to sleep, read stories, play with her - do everything to make her happy! I‚Äôm proud of doing these things! And my little girl is all about me - she always needs me, looks for me, and she doesn‚Äôt want to do anything with her mother! When I say she doesn‚Äôt want to, she literally says she hates her, ‚Äúbad mommy!‚Äù ,which I do not approve of. But at the same time, she knows who‚Äôs there for her!

My wife is literally lazy and has been dealing with trauma from her parents, but it‚Äôs been over 4 years, and my daughter and I don‚Äôt deserve to be part of it! I‚Äôve helped my wife with her trauma and took her to multiple counseling sessions, but she wasn‚Äôt listening. She has her own frustration and anger issues! She literally wants attention, and I try my best to give it to her, but she can‚Äôt even give care to or take care of our daughter!

I wake up and work (remotely) while taking care of our daughter until she goes to sleep, all while making sure the house is clean, cooking, doing yard work - all while either holding or keeping my daughter close to me because she doesn‚Äôt want to stay with her mother! I‚Äôm tired, just tired!!!

Anyway, Happy Father‚Äôs Day to all fathers! You are doing great, if no one has told you!"
566,3,"I just well need to vent obviously, i just can't think of how to start it. Man i wish i wasn't so overwhelmed rn, i'm doing essentially a course that gives job experience, it's pretty short, but is my first ever thing close to a job, which is good. But ontop of that ive been struggling to do online learning to get my level 3 finished (NCEA) since im 11 credits off from last year which was year 13 (last year of high school). You can take it at your own pace but need to submit just SOMETHING online into something called a dropbox every month at least, so they know you're actually doing the work. I have been enrolled for a month or two idk, but i haven't used it once, because I don't understand how it works, and i'm procrastinating the work, to the point i've done barely any of it, and thought maybe i should postpone it until the end of this short job experience course so i can do one thing at a time. But by the time that's done in a few weeks i'll be back to same old online learning that i feel overwhelmed and useless at. And ill have not much time to submit and understand how and what to submit anything before i'm automatically unenrolled from my understanding. Ontop of this i have a fair few friends im chill with, but not close with, that i want to talk with more, or hang out with more, and it just all adds up to feeling so overwhelmed. I also have been wanting to try dnd and i might have the opportunity to do so, but at the same time maybe I can't handle it rn?? I just, idfk, this shit sucks. Also as much as im doing it also for myself, once im done with this course I'm prolly going to be expected legally to be looking for a job, since I'm on a benefit. I mighttt be able to make the argument that i still am not ready (i have a medical certificate that is allowing me to get the money from the benefit without needing to be looking for a full time job, only a part time one or preparing for a part time one. But will they accept the argument that im too overwhelmed with online learning, regular life shit, to get a part time job still? i dont know. If i decide i cant handle a job, but they decide i can, then they might just no longer give me the benefit, which is helping my mum pay for important stuff like the mortgage of our house and everyday stuff since she's the only one out of me and her and one of my brothers living with me who has a job.   
  
I also am of the belief with some mistakes i've made, and how harsh i am on myself about it, i semi urgently need or would really benefit from a counselor or therapist i can talk with for not a limited amount of sessions like every one i have seen so far. I need to talk to someone without the pressure of make the fucking most of it because in a few weeks or a month or two that's it, move on to the next counsellor or support person at a different place. 

All this while dealing with a porn addiction and some other bullshit like OCD and overthinking.  

And a really tiny detail as well, mann i wanna start lies of p because it looks good, but i just, dont wanna add another thing to overwhelm me since it'll take so much of my time up if i do. "
567,1,"title, I have no clue if this is an ok thought to have but I need to write this down also SRY because maybe rant ahead because I cannot stop thinking about it I am literally getting flash backs as me sitting on my carpet in my room eating one bowl after the other or something like what felt like a mountain of food or watching TV for what must have been 15 hours straight on the weekends oh my god...I would eat entire packets of oats (500g!!) or a loaf of bread THE WHOLE THING like really the entire sleeve of toast and 2-3 packs of cheese and sausage and so on and then take another 2-4 sandwiches wich me for lunch and start eating them on the way to school etc so I would prob eat twice my TDEE in 1 hour after waking up...!!!

And when I could sleep in I woke up excited because not having to go to school means I could have infinite and I would go to the kitchen grab bags of oats, cereal etc and eat bowl after bowl I even had my own bowl in my room and I would take the milk cartons and stuff everything back to my room and I would empty that!!! I still remember my parents being annoyed or like surprised when they find things like milk suddenly empty because I would wake up early or wait until they sleep to raid the kitchen and most of our spoons were in my room etc and that did happen a lot that I would just take half the kitchen back into my room and eat and eat and eat so much there. So that is likely where I got real used to eating 2-3kg in a sitting.

I remember being a kid and out-eating several adults. Multiple grown people. I would eat my meal, another serving or two, everyone's leftovers, and be like meh. what are we having next? That is completely ridiculous and insane and everyone cutesy ignored it or was laughing about how I have a big appetite and whatnot!!!!

I also watched TV non stop I was either at school or watching TV or playing nintendo DS and that WAS unhealthy because I would rage when I lost at games and stuff I remember having to fix it with tape because I smashed it up so bad when I got so aggressive during games I also had a ps2 that was already kinda old back then and I would throw the controllers I would yell and scream at everyone and I cannot believe I was like this I remember ripping my bed sheets and everything to shreds in a rage and that was 100% over some game no idea what!!!!

HOW HOW HOW did no one notice that this is so far away from what anyone would consider normal and that I would mess up my LIFE if that is not fixed oh my god!!

Also one time there was some event similar to halloween and I was gifted a whole bag worth of candy plus my shirt as bag so it was A LOT and I carried all of it towards my room and my mom yelled after me watch out you will get sick because she KNEW I was running off to go sit and EAT all of that at once!!!! WHY WHY did she not stop me of course I would have cried and whatever if she took all my sweets away but now as adult I very seriously wish she would have been like no way you cannot eat 2 kilo of candy and I swear it was that much I remember just one part of the little mountain of sweets that I had on my carpet was a whole a 500g bag of schoko bons (a popular candy in Germany) and that is completely nuts and absurd I must have eaten 10k calories as a kid on a random evening I could CRY just thinking about it!!!!

THE THING is though that my parents were both nice I had the freedom in the world I never got punished they were never mean they bought me everything I wanted so how can I be angry at the it makes no sense I am such a terrible kid when I you think about it!!! I would never be mad at them or say anything but I WISH I would have grown up in a way that might have been more restrictive but maybe I would be healthier now!!! üò≠"
568,2,"Every time I think I have all the rules nailed down and finally do better, they suddenly change with *no* warning whatsoever (at least more often than not). You get in trouble because nobody told you about the new rule/rules? Well, it‚Äôs your fault for not knowing any better. And I swear some rules are randomly made up just so my mother will have something to get on me about. It won‚Äôt be until *after* the fact that she would *then* tell me the new and sudden rule/rules.

She never tells me anything, yet, expects me to know better than to break the unknown rules and automatically read her mind. Yeah, because *that* makes a whole lot of sense. My life feels like a rigged video game that‚Äôs literally impossible to beat, no matter what you do or how hard you try.

And before you ask, moving sadly isn't an option because it's literally impossible to."
569,1,"I used to have 2 ringnecks, one green and the other gray, they lived in my dad's house, during the day in a big cage outside and during the night, in the bathroom near my room. 

Yesterday was my 17th birthday, and I was so excited to go celebrate it that I accidentally forgot the bathroom door open when I washed my hair (i have severe adhd), the birds walked out and my two dogs found them before I did.

When I realised my mistake I ran as quickly as I could to find them, I found the gray one in the living room all wet and missing some feathers, jt had escaped the dogs, but the green one wasn't so lucky.

I found it outside with my two dogs, it had passed away before I had the chance to do anything, I wasn't even brave enough to bury it, all I did was go back to the living room and cry while desperately calling my dad (i was home alone), since he wasn't answering I called his gf, who was with him while he was driving home.

I wasn't even brave enough to wait for them to get home, I hid in the bathroom with the surviving bird and cried as I waited for them, I heard everything when they got home, his gf crying, him screaming at the dog, and worst of all, her reaction when they found the poor bird.

Obviously my dad scolded me, he kept telling how it was my fault and how irresponsible I was (when he's mad he always tries to say the things that will hurt the most, I was lucky he didn't scream this time), I just stayed silent.

At least the rest of the day was fun since I celebrated with my friends, but I can't help but feel like trash, my grandma says it's not my fault and how much she warned my dad that the birds and dogs shouldn't be together bc even if they're chill with them (which they were, or I thought they were) they're still animals, I don't know who I agree with, but I can't mot feel guilty about all of this.

I'm posting this because my dad brought this up when he was scolding me bc I forgot about a school project, specifically, ""Polly had to die because of this and even so you don't learn to be responsible"". Now I'm sure he'll hold a grudge because of this and I won't be forgetting it any sooner.

I'll ask my psychologist to up my meds, I hate myself and my bad memory, I wish I wasn't born like that. And now I'm scared this is a sign that my 17th year will be terrible. "
570,3,"The other day I was doing the dishes, I was almost done and my mom comes in and goes ""oh I can do that"" pushes me out of the way and finishes what I was doing. Expect she didn't finish she half assed it then gave up, so why take over to ""help"" if you are not really helping. She just prolonged the task that I was already doing, she does this kind of thing all the time, if I'm searching for meds in the cabinet she'll literally push me out of the way to look for herself and then say she can't find it, I am always able to find it when she leaves though. "
571,3,"About half a year ago I was pushed out of a company I've been at for five years. Why? Politicking and bullying. I tried so hard to transfer departments and was told my interviews were perfect, but my current manager ""not having a better relationship with me"" would ""cause issues."" 

Even though they treated a new supervisor so horribly she quit. And let's not even talk about all the SA. Anyways. 

That was many months ago, and I've been desperately job searching since. It's so defeating. Job boards are COVERED in scams and fake listings. I've had so much of my time wasted and information stolen, even while trying my best to be careful. 

Actual company websites are a joke. Half of them are horribly optimized, and most open positions are just sales or senior management. That's it. 

It's borderline impossible to even find any open postings in my industry. So what did I do? I decided to take my years of diverse experience and qualifications elsewhere. 

Still nothing. Application after application denied. I've reworked my resume countless times. I've met with recruiters to review it, set up countless networking opportunities and interviews even. It's always the same. 

""We're moving forward with a different candidate."" WHY?

Every fucking time I ask for feedback, I get none. In my last 8 interviews, nobody could tell me why I didn't get the role. Nothing general, nothing specific. 

I'm exhausted. I'm sick of spending hours a day applying for jobs and getting nothing. I'm sick of watching shitty people be HORRIBLE at their job, knowing I'd do so much better, because I would be giving it my all. 

But apparently I'm the one that doesn't want to work? My generation (Z) doesn't want to work???

NOBODY WILL FUCKING HIRE US. PLEASE. I'M SICK OF IT. I'm sick of being professional and big corporations not. This shit is so one sided. 

""If you know anyone who'd like to connect..."" Translation? ""Please just fucking hire me, I'll be an amazing employee, but you won't even give me the chance because I don't have a PhD and 50 years of experience."""

573,0,"I've had two, thought-provoking examples from recent stuck on my mind:

1st.   
I'm in my early-mid twenties and work at a bank with about three others in their 40s and 50s. At a bank, you can have some real deranged customers come in, but I've been in customer service since I was 14. There's a regular customer who comes in guns blazing, accusing us of crackpot conspiracies and that we have drones spying on her house (yeah, she's not sound of mind). So we put on our smiles and help the best we can, because she's clearly not well. One day, however, she was EXTRA aggressive, saying some incredibly rude things to my colleague next to me who was already having a bad day. She was clearly struggling with this customer, so I jumped in with a calm tone of voice: ""(customer's name), we'll endeavour to help you the best we can, but I need you to calm down and be more respectful as we're finding it difficult to assist you."" Well, she lost her shit, but finally stormed out. My colleagues, and manager, took me to the side. ""Telling her to calm down and be more respectful does not help the situation. That's not what you do in customer service and you should know better. You should just shut up and do your job."" Although I didn't want to argue, I immediately found a section in my training that explicitly states that I can say ""I need you to calm down"" and ask for more respect. They didn't agree.   


2nd.  
I do a night class on the side in education support. I'm the only young person in the class. They're all amazing people and we're one big family and I'm the child haha. But there's one adult in their 40s who was clearly that high school bully who failed life and is finally looking to turn it around. They snicker and let insults slip from under their breath anytime the rest of us contribute in meaningful ways to class discussion or open ourselves up. I can see that it's having a real impact on everyone's confidence when they get up and share personal stories. Having been bullied a bit in high school, I don't stand for that shit, especially coming from immature adults. I sit next to the bully, and in a hushed voice I asked her without an aggressive tone: ""hey, I don't know if you're aware but we can hear some of the things you say and it can quite hurtful. Is there anything you need to talk about after class?"" She apologised half-heartedly. One of my classmates next to me, who I really care about, spoke to me after class as they saw and heard what I did: ""I don't think saying that helps the situation. We're all happy to just ignore her. It's really not big deal."" 

  
A bonus:  
Since I'm entering the education field, I've been asking senior teachers about how they deal with bullying. I'm surprised to find that many really don't deal with it and choose to ignore it as they say calling it out or speaking to parents often make things worse.   


What is going on? This is not how I was taught growing up by all those anti-bullying campaigns.

Maybe there's a generational difference, but I'm proud to say that my generation is not afraid to call out bad behaviour.

TLDR: I call out bad behaviour in the most appropriate way I can imagine, but I'm regularly told by older adults that calling out bad behaviour is NOT okay in general. What is wrong with our society? What happened to shaming? "
574,1,"I‚Äôm so tired of dealing with everything, the entire world is falling apart, my family sucks, I‚Äôm so angry at everything and everyone, I feel like nobody loves me and I‚Äôm depressed as fuck.

I‚Äôm done with this shit. Why do I have to deal with this? Why couldn‚Äôt my family just be functional, at least when my siblings and I were kids. That would solve a lot of problems. I‚Äôm over this bullshit. I don‚Äôt want to be here anymore. 

I want to destroy my relationships so that nobody misses me when I‚Äôm gone. I hate this. I hate myself and I wish I was functional and normal and not the way I am. I‚Äôm so retarded goddamnit. Like I can‚Äôt do anything. I am genuinely useless in the world we live in. Why am I supposed to care??"
575,1,"I am about to enter my junior year and I am so jealous of everybody who are extras that I applied to and didn‚Äôt get in. I am so proud and happy of my friends who are achieving so much but I just feel like I am on the sidelines watching everyone do something while im just doing nothing.

I feel like such a loser for not having any goals, for not being a pretty girl or a smart girl or even someone who‚Äôs productive . I hate how I am not pretty enough whenever I look at mirror I hate it. I hate how im not chosen or enough 

I can‚Äôt talk to my partner or my friends without feeling like im just on the sidelines watching everyone achieving what I tried hard to achieve.

What do I do "
576,2,I hate being a dude so much but a specific province in canada wont let me be female until im 16 and even then i cant without parent permission. Im going insane. Every time i think about being female it feels like a punch to my gut. I am currently dating a girl and she supports who i am and what i feel but i rarely get reassurance because her texts are 24/7 under surveillance. I get no time of privacy with my gf and thus i cant speak how i feel to her and she rarely gets chances to talk about that to me too. Both of our parents are over protective i feel. And to top it all off i have a mainly male name so i am constantly reminded of the fact that i am male.
577,3,"I am so angry I am trying to keep it under control but I am experiencing a rage I haven't felt in over a year. My friends and I are in our 30s. We have all known each other since 14ish. We have been through everything together and stuck through some pretty intense shit shouldering one another. 

Yesterday I found out my guy friend has been sexually harassing my gal friend for the last 2 months. We are talking very gross and very mean messages and dick picks. He treats me, another woman, with absolutely nothing but respect. I literally feel so deceived and betrayed that the rage im feeling makes me want to throw up. I am so angry my f friend has been treated this way and I am so angry my m friend has done this AS HE LITERALLY KNOWS BETTER AND RAnts ABOUT SKEEZY MEN ALL THE DAMN TIME. THIS MAN LITERALLY EITHER THOUGHT SHE'D BE TOO EMBARRASSED TO TELL ME OR KNEW SHE WOULD AND DIDNT CARE. HE DOESN'T CARE AT ALL. ABOUT FRIENDSHIP, RESPECT, HUMANITY. NONE OF IT. 

I was pretty proud of my guy friend recently, was reflecting recently how cool it's been to watch all my friends from childhood grow up into awesome well rounded ppl HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHSH

You know that scene where Regina George is screaming from her car all the way to her bedroom, this is what I am feeling x15. We are talking 15 YEARS OF FRIENDSHIP. I LITERALLY HAVE BEEN DECEIVED ABOUT HIS CHARACTER AND AM QUESTIONING EVERYTHING I KNOW IN GENERAL. 

I FEEL LIKE I CANNOT TRUST ANYONE OR KNOW ANYONE AT ALL. WHAT THE FUCK! 

He and I will never be speaking again. He is blocked on all platforms. I have no idea what to do with this rage. Its just getting worse every hour. I feel like I am about to projectile vomit black venom like in Jennifer's Body. My entire world is on a tilt and I cannot get it right. I have been shaking from anger for an entire 24 hours!!

I am about to spend an ENTIRE THERAPY SESSION DISCUSSING MY RAGE AT MISOGYNY AND PATRIARCHY AND I AM SO FUCKING TIRED OF HAVING TO GO TO THERAPY BC OTHER PPL WON'T AND ALSO DONT WANT TO CHANGE! In the messages you can tell he fucking DELIGHTS IN THIS SHIT. "
578,1,"I‚Äôm 27f and I have a 4 year old. My dad never was active him my life. I met him when I was 16. And he didn‚Äôt become more involved until I was pregnant with his first and only grandbaby. I‚Äôve been wanting to be around and be in his life, but it‚Äôs so hard. He remarried and has small children under 6 years old. He spoils them and does whatever they ask of him. I‚Äôm starting college in a week to be an EMT and I need I need just two more items. He got mad at me for asking.. honestly we wouldn‚Äôt really be talking if I wasn‚Äôt living at his dad‚Äôs house..I really don‚Äôt feel like I belong here either but I have no where else to go. Especially since my son has autism and it‚Äôs a lot to deal with.. "
579,1,"When i (20f) was younger I thought I was the best family member ever. I thought I was h√∑lpful, low maintenance, easy to get along with, laughed at all your jokes and just easily did whatever it took to make everyone happy. Albeit, I had anger issues. Severe anger issues. But blow ups were few and far between. Freshman year, my self image starts to very very slowly crumble, starting with my standard of beauty. I thought i was effortlessly everyones dream girl, and i used that to be as weird as I wanted to be. Shortly after meeting my best friend, I started to think I was ugly because she was so so beautiful. I have never recovered from this. Covid hit sophomore year, after two years of theatre classes, and this is when I started to hate more about myself. I felt like i had no talent, like I was annoying, and while I did feel prettier there was always something to criticize. I started to hate my little sister more. I dont even remember if I talked to my mom or not. End of junior year i sneak out of my dad's house to move in with my mom, and I am raging with hormones. I'm in the room across from my grandparents, up all night on voice calls with my friends, screaming and laughing. I get mad when it's pointed out. It's almost time for me to return to in-person senior year, and now i live in my mom's house. I'm incredibly mentally unstable at this point, and I've dropped all my friends and started therapy. I adopt a kitten and can't handle when she keeps me up at night, then sob when I yell at her or punish her because years of anger issues have made me feel like a monster each time i show that emotion. This is why im in therapy. I'm given an anger iceberg that I hang above my bed, and I get better at identifying those emotions. School starts, and im insecure. I haven't taken off a mask in years, and my hair is cut too short. I'm breaking out, and by the time yearbook photos come up masks are not mandatory. I keep mine on, and it's the only one in the yearbook like that. I'm mad at my friends, but i keep them for company and supp*rt. I'm terrible at math, and I beg my mom every morning to let me stay home. This is the furthest back I can remember my chronic pain, so she let's me miss over 30 days of my final school year. All I do now is cry, go to school, eat lunch in the bathroom, beg to go home, come home, play games, cry, repeat. My kitten has adapted to me, but is still acting out. I graduate, the friend group stays close and I fall in love. Ive lost my virginity and the guilt crushes me like a train. I sob to my mom, and she basically laughs. It doesn't take long for me to hate my boyfriend. Despite this, I try to adapt and salvage until we reach our one year, in which I fall apart and end things. I feel fat, i feel ugly, i feel like I have no talent, I've been given my siblings animals so now I own three cats but I can barely even brush my own teeth. Ive jumped back and forth between living with my grandparents, my mom and her abusive boyfriend, and college. I feel more like a failure when I can't handle college, or im not as talented as my peers, as I started in English Major and transitioned to Theatre over 2 years. I've failed to get another successful relationship since my first one, im getting fatter, and my family is falling apart. I drop out of college one last time at the end of 2023, no longer able to afford another semester. My aunt moves in, and im forced to sleep in the libingroom with my three cats for 8 months. I miss my ex, im even fatter, I do nothing around the house, and my room is a terrible mess. I never once ask for h√∑lp. My mom gets her boyfriend out of the house for good, and i move over, where I now have two bedrooms for me and the cats. Despite this, and Despite my best efforts to h√∑lp her and around the house every single day, I am still a useless and fat angry girl. I'm in pain every day and weekly doctor appointments all across the state haven't helped, I'm on medicines and have tried every possible lifestyle change and im only in more pain, more depressed, and fatter. Ive gotten back with my ex twice, I have a sobbing screaming hitting myself outburst once every two months or so, I feel like an emotional burden on everyone I know, I rarely can bring myself to leave the house and when I do i can't stop myself from blowing money on seeing movies and eating out, it got so bad I started asking for h√∑lp and found out that no one would. I stopped doing basically everything, I only scrolled on my phone, did the bare minimum for my cats, forced myself to do everything I can around the house, and very rarely did anything for myself past using the bathroom. My mom got her first job since she had breast cancer about 10 years ago, and I was hired as full time babysitter, when I wasn't getting paid for it before. I become even more of a failure. I fail to wake up, I fail to make my little brother happy, i fail to clean my room, I fail to keep my mom from having to look at dirty dishes because once I start the dishwasher the sink is already full again. She nags at me for not waking up in time, and I lose my mind. I burst out in tears, unable to stop screaming, feeling absolutely insane like nothing will ever be enough and nothing will ever end and I am the worst daughter to breathe. She leaves me in the middle of my breakdown, and I physically cannot get myself to stop screaming ""no one's h√∑lping me"", and I can't stop hitting myself. She somehow manages to draw me to the couch, where she cradles me like a baby and apologizes for taking my work for granted, offering to start me on vitamins for my pain. I'm still bawling, but calming down, but I feel worse, because i just acted like that in front of someone. All I want to be is normal and good and not a burden and i just probably looked like a maniac. It's two days later, and I still start crying when I remember it. My neck hurts too bad to help around the house because of when I was hurting myself, which doesn't h√∑lp me not feel useless, because now dishes, laundry, dog fur, and mess is all piling up around my room and house and Im in too much pain to fix it. Ive considered checking myself into a mental hospital of sorts, but i need to be here to h√∑lp. I have three cats, mom has two dogs, and the 7 year old. I literally cannot leave. So here I lie, in my bed, feeling fat, horribly ugly, absolutely useless, untalented, like a burden, in so much pain, and just looking at every bit of mess that surrounds me that won't get cleaned up until I do it."
580,2,"I don't even know where to begin with this tbh so for context I started dating this guy a year and a half ago after we met because of my cousin, and we started out fine but after a few months he became VERY obsessive and clingy almost to a scary point because we had been together for so little by that time... he has been diagnosed with BPD as well as ADHD since he was 17 (he's 22 now, I'm 19...) and I‚Äôve tried so hard to be understanding and patient with him but I'm genuinely at my limit... like I said before he‚Äôs insanely clingy, like I cannot go for like 2 HOURS alone without a string of texts from him accusing me of cheating on him  ‚Äúabandoning‚Äù him, and even worse if I don‚Äôt respond immediately or within a few minutes he spirals out of control and get's angry or irritated and starts spam calling me... he blocks me out of nowhere during fights sometimes even if its over literal bullshit and then unblocks me acting like nothing happened, we don't live together either so sometimes he just ghosts me for days on end and then acts clueless later on and says he needs his privacy (even though he gives me none lol...)this all sounds like normal bad relationship stuff but I promise you it's not good like it gets worse... so I already told you guys he's really paranoid of me cheatinf or abandoning him, and I talk to a lot of my friends on discord and telegram so i'm on the phone or chatting a lot sometimes with people he doesn't really know (they're my friends not his), so he's super paranoid about this stuff but I genuinely think it peaked when I was at my cousin's house for his birthday a couple months ago (the same cousin who introduced me to him) and we're chilling in his room playing borderlands and I'm kind of ignoring his pestering and I was talking to one of my friends on telegram so he decides it's a good idea to take his cousin's FUCKING COMPOUND BOW from the corner of his room while he's outside talking to his family and threaten me with it into giving him my phone... like I doubt he was gonna use it but come on just doing that in the first place is wayyyy too fucking far especially when it's just due to your own paranoia... like I wasn‚Äôt even doing anything suspicious I was just talking to someone and kind of ignoring him for being annoying and he somehow convinced himself it was a good idea to go full psycho on me for no reason like what the fuck??? I don‚Äôt care if it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúserious‚Äù or if he didn't plan to use it but you don‚Äôt aim fucking lethal weapons at people you love regardless if you're mentally ill or not... it's like I‚Äôm constantly walking on hot coals or nails and suffering just to keep him calm or sane and despite being with him for a year and a half by this point I never know what will set him off and it just feels scary at this point having to deal with him at all, this is all just a vent post as it's just too much to deal with and it's scary being with him sometimes idk what to do anymore atp..."

583,0,"A couple weeks ago I just stopped having an appetite and didn‚Äôt eat as much as I did before. I still tried to eat but it was significantly less than before, maybe halved. Today I wore a pair of jeans I had just worn last week, and I noticed that they seem to fall down?! 

Now, my waist has always been, not tiny, but compared to my lower body, it‚Äôs disproportionally small. All of my pants have the same issue, they don‚Äôt fit me completely because my pant size does not align with my waist size. I‚Äôve always had to rely on my butt and legs to ‚Äúhold up‚Äù my pants. I also usually buy high waisted jeans so the waist size is smaller (since it‚Äôs designed for a higher up area) and it becomes a normal pair of jeans for me. 

My family is concerned about my eating but it‚Äôs not an eating disorder and I‚Äôm probably just a bit stressed due to some personal things that has been happening for a bit of time, and I‚Äôm going through a lot of emotional and relationship changes.

584,0,I JUST GOT MY FIRST EVER BOYFRIEND TODAY AAAAAA I'M SO HAPPY I DID _NOT_ SEE THIS COMING!!!!!!! He's a guy from my school and we both graduated! EEEEEEEEEEEE I'M SO FREAKING HAPPY I FEEL LIKE I WON THE LOTTERY!!!!! YAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY
585,0,"A while back I came across a website that lets you type one anonymous message. No login, no comments, nothing saved, and then it disappears after 24 hours.

At first I thought it was just a random site, but I ended up typing something I‚Äôve kept to myself for years. Not something traumatic or dramatic, just... something that I needed to let out. And once I hit send, I felt so much lighter. No one responded. No one could. And somehow, that made it more powerful and satisfying.

Just sharing something that helped me, maybe it‚Äôll help some of you all too :)"
586,2,"First of all, I am not Jewish, to clear that out. 
My now former friend doesn' t stop from sending me these antisemitic clips and photos and he is starting to say really bad stuff that I am not sure I am allowed to replicate here. I can' t stand it, he is a neon*** and he doesn' t even realise it. He has zero history knowledge to be fair but he is saying nonsense stuff all the time and he blames Jewish people for everything. I don' t even understand why he has this hate, he never met a Jewish person. I live in Romania, there are hardly any Jews here. He keeps saying Germany should have won the war... Will this hatred ever stop? I mean it' s been almost a thousand years, I can' t stand living in a world with so much hatred between people.

I am trying so hard to turn my life around and him fucking texting me and starting shit just to get a fucking reaction feels like it‚Äôs setting me all the way back. I hate him with my whole heart. All I‚Äôve ever tried to do is love him and support him and even after I tried to be nothing but cordial and respectful. But he just cannot stop hurting me. Intentionally. He acts like he‚Äôs ‚Äúcoming from a place of concern‚Äù but he‚Äôs not, he‚Äôs intentionally trying to make me feel like I‚Äôm a monster. I can‚Äôt fucking do this shit."
588,1,"I'm 29 years old and if you look at my history, I've been depressed for a very long time.

When I was 22 years old, I told myself I would take myself out back do and what needs to be done if I can't change my life by age 30.

I have 1 year left. I don't think change is possible for me.

I don't know how to socialize and my anxiety is so bad it controls me. I have diagnosed anxiety disorder on top of major depression.

I don't care about most things in life. Only money and I can't even make that. 

I still live with my parents. I hide from everyone who knew me in college and highschool to avoid the shame. I avoid talking to coworkers because I have a useless degree while being the lowest paid worker so some of them will low key mock me.

I couldn't even pass basic college math in college so no way I could get a real degree in medical field or technology. 

I've broken multiple bones so the military ain't even take me.

I live in a deep rural area so there are no jobs outside of Walmart and other poverty wage places unless you're in the medical field or a lawyer. 

I can't leave. I can't focus. I can't do anything. 

I don't get any enjoyment out of life. Therapy never worked out. Therapy can't my personality and financial issues. 

I just want out. I'm too broken, stupid, and asocial to succeed in life.  All I need to do is wait another year. "
589,3,"I don‚Äôt do heat. Which, unfortunately, is anything over 65¬∞F (18¬∞C) and sunny. And that‚Äôs stupid. I get that. But I can‚Äôt help it. I just hate it. 

I‚Äôm 24 now. But I remember being in first grade and getting sent to the principal because I was ‚Äúlying‚Äù about being stung by those little sweat bees when we were out on the soccer field in the early fall and late spring. Now I know those tiny bee things can‚Äôt sting. But at the time I felt a horrible prickling pins-and-needles sensation and I saw the tiny bees and I came to the conclusion that they just hated me in particular.

The pins-and-needles still happens. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm getting beat with a thistle plant or rolling around in glass or like someone‚Äôs taking a rolling pin of hot needles across my body. I also just feel like shit. Like exhausted and icky and nauseous. But that I can more or less push through/ignore

The prickling is always my scalp, face, arms, ribs, stomach, back, thighs. In that order. It‚Äôs painful. Makes me itch. Which means that I‚Äôm scratching my head and then people assume I‚Äôve got bugs and shit. Which is embarrassing and frustrating. 

All of this triggers with anything above 65¬∞F (18¬∞C). Particularly when it‚Äôs sunny. But it also happens if I get too worked up. Like if I get mad or irritated it‚Äôll trigger.

On top of that I can‚Äôt sleep unless my room is damn near freezing. Which, in the winter, is easy. I just open my windows. But we‚Äôve moved recently and there‚Äôs no A/C in this house because apparently people out here don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary. I think every house should have A/C. Unless you live in Antarctica, which right now sounds like a dream.

It‚Äôs just infuriating. I hate it so much. I‚Äôve moved to a more northern state. I lived in southern Tennessee and now I live in northern Colorado. But summer is still a thing. And like I want to like it. Everything is green and alive. You don‚Äôt have to worry about hypothermia and such. But my stupid body has made a decision for me. 

I‚Äôm a really active person by nature. Not being able to go out and do things makes me depressed. But I literally can‚Äôt do anything over the summer. I was hoping it‚Äôd be better here, and like I guess it probably won‚Äôt last as long, but it‚Äôs still really upsetting.

The only reason I survive summer is because it ends I stg. I wish the global climate was down trending instead of up. I love being outdoors. I love hiking and biking and walking and swimming. And I can‚Äôt do any of it for months. 

It makes me grumpy and an ass. I have no patience. I don‚Äôt care. Everything irritates me. I snap at people over nothing. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm not me. And I hate it. I hate it all so fucking much. 

I don‚Äôt know if growing up I was just better at forcing it down, or if I‚Äôve always been this way and everyone assumed it was moody teenager hormones, or what. But I know that at least for the last 5 years I‚Äôve hated it with such a burning passion. And I must‚Äôve before. It‚Äôs always been a problem. But I lived on a farm. And I had responsibilities that didn‚Äôt care that I was a whiny shit. Pain is weakness leaving the body and all that nonsense. 

Now pain is my will to live leaving my body. Every summer I wish I could hibernate or die (I‚Äôm picturing Dracula in a coffin vibes) until fall. 

What really sucks is all winter is tainted with the knowledge that summer is coming. And my mental health declines as summer approaches. I start having nightmares and avoiding sleep. My intrusive thoughts and ideations kick up. I sleep in until 12 or 1pm or I wake up at 7am and then don‚Äôt get up until 12 or 1pm. I can‚Äôt hold a job or do any classes over the summer because my mental health is so abysmal. 

And like, I‚Äôve tried taking to doctors and therapists and they‚Äôve all just been like ‚Äúoh? Summer‚Äôs great. You just need to get out there more and let your body adjust‚Äù or they act like they understand but the whole vibe is like ‚Äúyeah. Sure bud.‚Äù

I‚Äôve gotten MRIs of my spine and a gabapentin prescription in like 2018 that showed nothing and did nothing. And beyond that I‚Äôve gotten confusion and tight lipped smiles. And it makes me feel crazy. I feel crazy. My extended family thinks I‚Äôm lying for attention. My mom is understanding because she also doesn‚Äôt do heat but she just feels like shit in JT so it‚Äôs not the same.

And like. I want to live. I want to be happy and enjoy life. And I am. I will. I‚Äôll continue to survive summer to enjoy late fall, winter, and early spring. But I‚Äôm just so fucking frustrated and angry. Mainly with my body.

Anyways. Thanks for coming to my ridiculously long TED talk. I really needed to shout into the void."
590,2,"I have an apartment that's by the pool and no I did not have an option it was the only unit available and I did not get to see the unit.  If I did I probably would not have picked it but it is what it is.   
There is a balcony and this giant sliding glass door that takes up an entire wall  that is almost eye level with the pool. Everything is set up around the sliding glass doors so I'm facing it most of the time.  
 I've been to the pool area and anyone can  see into my apartment. I don't really care  but I noticed some girls sitting by the pool that are in their 20's  or maybe their younger  will look into my unit  when i enter my living room. They dead ass  stare at me and we make eye contact,  I actually overheard them talking about me too..  They are just doing way too much and what gets me is they act like I'm naked. I'm either chilling  and watching tv or cleaning etc.    
I'm literally just existing in my own home.. why are they making me out to be the creep? You're sitting by the pool and If you feel uncomfortable that's your problem? There are so many units  surrounding the pool. You can see me so worry about the units you don't see  LOL.    
I noticed older people maybe boomers or gen x they don't gaf.. and are just enjoying their time at the pool with their families.

591,0,"It's an insult to people that truly have these conditions. People that truly have autism attend at least five different types of therapies (speech and language, sensory integration, educational, psychology, etc) on a regular basis.  But every person I come across that says they have autism, have never had any therapy. They just say they have it and some even believe they are taking pills for autism, except those pills are for other conditions. When people say they have ADHD, it's like a switch they turn off and on. They will like everyone else. But as soon as they need to take accountability for something, don't understand something, lazy, etc. They suddenly say it's their ADHD. There's kids at school that spend all night on their electronic devices. The next day they are too tired to pay attention in class. So they say ""I can't focus, I have ADHD."" I haven't came across anyone with ADHD that is attending therapy. You would think a person that claims to have  ADHD would want to control their mood swings, beat depression, learn time management skills, etc. Also none of them bring tutors to school and on job sites. I will add im referring to the three spectrums in both autism and ADHD. "

If I had more power or money, I would use it to do good, because my belief system dictates that powerful people should do good in order for the community that they find themselves in to progress and to further advance as a whole.

600,2,Brooooo i just cant im telling you i tried so hard to forget about this guy but everytime EVERYTIME i see him my stomach starts to hurt i stress and loose my appetite.....I went to a camp earlier this week for 5 days and he was there so the whole week i was stressing over him and idk even why....I mean i know he diesnt like me back so why do i still like him like his face his smile he looks so kind and when he aughs i melt (ive never even talked to him so bro im over it but my heart isnt)
601,1,He got upset because I was entertaining other guys during the first month we met each other (his point was that I was saying I love you already to him). I just let this guy pick me up from an event and drop me off at my place and was talking to someone for a few days. Both were short term but I just lowkey wanted to explore too. I know I'm shitty and I deserve this but I love him now and this happened almost a year ago. He cheated on me (sexted with a girl at least i only know about one and lied to me ab it being a boy's night when he went to his girl friend's birthday party) almost 2 months ago and I accepted him because he said he'd change. He didn't even give me a chance now. I feel like I'm just so fucked up and I want to get better. It's like I'm so uncomfortable with being alone. I have no real friends and I can't open up to my family. I'm constantly pressured about school and he was my safe space. We were together everyday and I was living with him for almost a year already. It's just summer now so he's been on the other side of the world since a month ago and will be back in 6 weeks. I can't believe we broke up through call and he just blocked me everywhere right away. Please don't be too mean to me. I know I probably need a therapist because I'm fucked up too. But aside from that he treated me so well. I'm just so hurt and in so much pain right now I want to end this. I have no one and it's hard to find the will to live.

604,3,"Ok. For starters, I‚Äôm 13, male and a pretty nice kid (I‚Äôm not Bragging I‚Äôm genuinely just seen in my school as nice).

So it started on Friday, when I went to fill my water bottle up in school. I came back on to the yard, to see my bag covered in orange peel from the floor. I ask around and ask my mate who it was and if it was him, as he looked suspicious and had done similar things throughout the week but not as severe. He tells me it was somebody (who wasn‚Äôt even there at the time). My other mate looked at me and subtly nodded when I kept confronting my mate about if it was him. The rest joined in( just so you know I am certain it was him). So as me just messing around and also partly having blood rush to my head, I have my bottle in my hands and I just throw a little water onto his shirt. It was dumb, I know. Next thing, he tries to push me, rolls up his jumper so it was solid, and starts belting me across the head with it multiple times. I already knew that if he carried on, I would get knocked out so I throw my bottle lid at him to stop him from hitting me any further.

Next thing you know, a chill teacher (who also is quite fond of me and knows I‚Äôm a nice kid) shouts ‚ÄòBOYS‚Äô and gets us to come to her. She does the basic what‚Äôs going on and asks if we are mates (For a bit of insight, I was friends with my mate for a few years, however since year seven him and his other friends have been calling me fat and often would poke fun at me. I just saw this as him trying to act cool around his other friends). I bluntly replied ‚Äòwe were never mates‚Äô, which clearly upset him as I could see the look on his face.

After she had dismissed us, she chased me up a few seconds later and said that if I wanted, I could escalate the situation, which I declined as I‚Äôm already known as a ‚Äòsnitch‚Äô for getting a pair of bullies in trouble (they bullied me). She says okay and explains she has to tell my head of year anyways but won‚Äôt attempt to escalate it.

I get on the bus, and my ‚Äòmate‚Äô starts telling my best friend since nursery that I apparently ‚Äòdrenched him with my bottle and I crashed out‚Äô. He also clearly tries to get my best friend to not go near me or be mates with me.

Come today, my other friend tells me that he is trying to forge a plan to get me in trouble for something I haven‚Äôt done. This wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, if everybody was on his side and blindly agrees with everything he says.

What do I do now? I don‚Äôt know but I can‚Äôt really enjoy much at the moment because of this."

It sucks that the universe has given everything i want in a partner in the form of a 20ish year old man. I can never tell him about my feelings because it will ruin our friendship and i don‚Äôt want that. I know he is going to look for a girlfriend after a few months cause he told me and i am going to be hurt. Just wanted to get this off my chest.

This past year I had to work so I didn‚Äôt get a chance to do that a whole bunch, but still made up the nice dinner portion the next day.

608,1,"TW: This is purely a frustration releasing post full of whining, disappointment and anger. 

I got married when I was 26. I had to move countries to be with my husband. For various logistical reasons, I had to take a break from work, and started my first graduate program. I did great and started a great job after graduating. We moved back to homecountry. Everything was going well and then I conceived with my child and decided to move again to start from zero. This happened in 2021, right after covid. I had my son, was still looking for job and didn't get any. After some time I started my second graduate program in a different field thinking it may help to get a job. And you are right.... it didn't. I am about to graduate and don't have job. My husband is in grad school and getting minimal payments and we are surviving off that. 

If you think I am here to vent about not getting a job, you are wrong. I will tell you about my pregnancy and child birth now. Its important for the story. Anyways, my pregnancy was smooth as silk. No nausea, no fart, no pain, no nothing. My newborn was a breeze. He made my life so much easier with his good appetite and sleep. I was happy. Then after he turned 18 months he was diagnosed with autism. Non verbal level 3 kind . The kind where kids make weird vocal stimming in public and make others uncomfortable or take a second look. I don't give a F about people's look really. They have eyes, they will look. But...... it breaks me to my bones that.... my boy .... my sweet little cuddle bunny will not have a normal life. He will probably have to live his life in group homes. He will never get a boyfriend/girlfriend. He will never tell me that he loves me. He will never try to sneak out to smoke. He will never be independent fully. 

Its been years and his diagnosis is becoming more and more difficult for me to accept and move on. I can't. I just can't. I need to pay off the house. I need to put him in the best therapy. I need to put him in a private school where he will be (hopefully ) bullied less. And I don't have a freaking job. I don't have any money to actually settle down. I am a loser disappointment at a age of 35 where I was supposed to be a strong safe place for my son. 

I feel like throwing up worrying about his future. I am a failure in every aspect in life. I hate myself and I hate my life. "
609,1,"My (21 f) boyfriend (21 m), never invites me around his friends or family and it makes me feel upset and a bit excluded. We have been dating for two years and two months (since April 2023).

My boyfriend is pretty close to his family. His immediate family consists of his mom and her long term boyfriend (with whom he lives with) and his extended family includes his maternal grandparents (who he sees weekly) and his three aunts, one uncle, and his cousin. He is close with his mother and his family often hosts get togethers (maybe at least once a month?). My issue lies in that I have only briefly met his family and have never been invited to their gatherings. It took almost two years to meet his mother, and once I did, she implied that she's been wanting to meet me for a long time (and jokingly insinuated that my bf should have invited me over sooner). I only just briefly met his extended family at his college graduation, but this was not an occasion where we could talk much. I found out that his family is hosting a graduation (slash father's day) celebration for him at his house with all of his extended family. It makes me a little sad to never be invited to these events. I've never been invited over for dinners or anything of this sort. Not that this is a transactionary situation, but he met my family (much smaller) almost a year earlier, and I often invite him over.

In terms of his friends, I've only met a few of them on two instances-- firstly, around April 2024 with three of his friends. During this meet up, they barely spoke to me and kind of regarded me as just the 'girlfriend'. It didn't seem ill intended, but it felt a bit isolating especially since I was excited to meet them. The second instance was this past April, when my boyfriend, me, and one of his friends (one I met during the previous meet up) went to a street market. It makes me sad because he has mentioned many different friends to me who he texts and video calls daily, yet I've never been introduced to them.

I have communicated a lot of my concerns to him. In terms of his family, I've asked him before if they actually know anything about me (to which he said 'not really') and asked him to invite me over more as I'd like to see his mom more. However, I still feel like I barely know them as nothing has really shifted. I have also mentioned many times that I'd like to get to know his friends more. Additionally, we had a pretty big conflict three months ago, during which I explicitly stated that I wish I knew his friends. To which he replied (verbatim), ""I don't feel much connection with almost any of my friends"". I do not judge this , but also it feels odd to me as he texts/plays video games with them everyday and sees a few of them in person during the summer (we live in the same town).

Another dimension of this is my health. I have a chronic illness that severely effects my quality of life every day. I can function in many ways (attend college, clean the house, etc), but my daily capabilities are informed by perpetual chronic pain and doctors visits, and I have had to go to the hospital multiple times. It makes me uncomfortable that he hasn't shared this with his family. Or more specifically, that he lied to his mom about it this winter. I had to take a gap semester off of school to focus on my health this winter, and so he came home from college to visit me for valentines day. This was the first time that I met his mother. During this meeting, she told me that she was sorry I caught a sickness and that she's glad I'm doing better. As in, he told his mother that I just caught the flu or something. I was confused in the moment and just went along with it, as I felt uncomfortable correcting her. Afterwords, my boyfriend told me that he hasn't told her yet and that he will eventually. I don't really understand the motivation behind this and it makes me a bit uncomfortable every time I speak with his mom now as it feels like i'm lying.

These factors make me feel very disconnected from my boyfriend's life and from those that are important to him. I do not want to be overbearing and act like I need to be around them every time he sees them, or that I need a super close bond with his family or friends. Even so, it makes me feel bad how disconnected I am from those parts of his life, and how he hasn't made much effort to integrate me into other parts of his life. I invite him to places with my family often and have invited him to events with my friends quite a few times. I have expressed to him that this is an important matter to me and yet I still feel separated.

I think what motivated me to write this post is finding out about his family's celebration party today. Not that I am entitled to going, but even so sometimes it makes me feel othered, especially knowing that his loved ones know almost nothing about me after over two years of serious dating."
610,3,"I am a server who has worked at this resturaunt for 7 months now. The newest host/server assistant is god awful. Her first day I noticed she was new and said ""Hi welcome to the team, if you need anything always ask, we are always here to help"" and before we can say anything i immediately got sat 2 tables. I greet both, get drinks, get orders, and go set the back up for the rest of the shift. I finally sit down after getting my tables their food and everything was setup and wiped down in the back, and the new girl comes over to my booth me and my coworker are in.

I don't even know this girls name and this girl goes ""Uh Don't you have two tables?""

""I say, oh i've already gotten their food and everything and I just checked in on them they are fine""

She goes, ""Don't you have anything else you should be doing?"" I'm confused as fuck cause you are a hostess not a manager????

I go ""Everything's setup in the back and wiped down. Literally nothing to do even if i wanted to,""

She goes ""Okay, if you guys just want to sit around and do nothing i guess"" HELLO??

Now that was her FIRST DAY. I just kept thinking, well she's probably one of those people who work hard and just hold people to the same standard. DEAD WRONG.

After working with her for a month, this girl is so goddamn lazy and performative it's awful.

She shows up 1 to 4 hours early and then waits for people at the door to get their on the time with the attendance sheet. She gets mad at people for being only 10 minutes early, 5 minutes early, on time, 5 minutes late, when it NEVER AFFECTS HER CAUSE SHES NOT ON THE CLOCK. She does no other work when she gets there early, just points out people who are late.

Then when she clocks in she either just talks to people, complains that other people aren't working, or tells other people what to do.

**My Final Straw with Her:**

I've always been a soft spoken, ""kill them with kindness person"" but I don't think I have it in me no more.

it's so slow and this bitch has been talking the whole time how she needs something to do. I told her on slow days i just bring a journal to write my thoughts. I had a table before she got there so she had to do no work for them (this day she was a server assistant so her main job was to deliver food and drinks). Mind you she has worked here for 3 weeks at this point.

Finally I get more tables, 4 at once for some reason. She sees them come in and goes to talk to my table that had been here reading his book peacefully for an hour. I got get 3 tables' drink orders and I look over and see her still talking to the guy.

I'm thinking ""Oh this girl is just like not thinking and doesn't realize that i have several drinks for her to prep for me"" I go to her to gently remind her.

She goes ""oh yay!"" and she Goes back to the drink station.

I get another tables drink order, get the tab for the guy who has been there for an hour paid out, and seen that my appetizer is ready for one of my tables but the drinks arent there. I think ""Oh she's sort of new still and it's a lot probably"" I go back and she's talking to the dishwasher and hasn't started these.

I tell her, ""for someone who is always trying to find a reason to call me lazy, how have I been doing stuff for 5 minutes and you have not poured one cup of water"" I hurriedly do everything and deliver three tables of drinks with one tray and ask her to make the fourth table's drinks.

I told her ""I don't expect you to be fast, but for someone who is always trying to get people in trouble for not working, I expected that at least in five minutes you would have at least TRIED to make the drinks""

I dropped off the drinks to all tables, got their appetizers to them, and then took orders. By the time I got back to the drink station she was still talking while making TWO WATERS.

I hurriedly got bread and grabbed the tray. She got mad that i wouldn't let her do work when I told her it shouldn't have taken her 7 minutes to pour two glasses of water and get bread that I already cut earlier. I was gonna drop it off because I needed to get their order. I told her to keep an eye for the expo for any food that comes out if she could.

Of course she doesn't. And when I finally get her at the expo I say, ""hey could you take this food to my table 56? I gotta get drinks to a table and its on the other side of the restaurant"" This dumb bitch says ""You're here, why don't you do it?""

I say ""Sorry that's my fault for saying it nicely. I know not to do that next time. Take these two plates of food to my 56. You are a server assistant, and you have not assisted me. You have not run a single food or drink tray today in the 2 hours you have been here. Do NOT make me repeat myself""

She finally ran one tray and walked around talking to my tables AGAIN. She does this every shift. She goes to every table to say ""Is your service good today? You can be honest,""

This was the LAST day she ever went to tables because I overheard one of the ladies said, ""You are an awful human being. You seen that girl running all across the restaurant, aren't you supposed to be helping her? I know the managers here and you are not one of them. Help that poor girl out""

That girl has never spoken to a table since thank god.

She is only EVER trying to tell people WHAT to do and NEVER actually doing shit. There's a drink order there for her? She searches for the other server assistant for 10 minutes to make instead of making it herself which would take 5 minutes at MOST.

It's awful. This month with her has been so long and awful. She acts like the victim no matter who gets mad at her. Management has talked to her over and over again but it does nothing. Everyone gets mad at her and she just does the same shit all the time. My awful place won't fire her and i know that. If she keeps this shit up, I will either crash out at her every day or just put in my 2 weeks."
611,0,"This happens especially with the British royal family. It's infuriating how many people love the royal family (there's a whole sub with them btw ). ""Humans"" who still benefit from the atrocities committed by their grandparents live in unfathomable wealth just because they were born into a family (and not even just a rich family, where you could argue that someone had worked hard etc) but from a family whose orders have killed thousands of people, just because they felt like it. It's honestly disgusting. Why should they get to live in palaces and fly around with private jets, even though they have zero accomplishments or benefit humanity in any way, and other people have to starve?

614,3,"Hi all

Like the title says, I'm not my own person. I have a twin and we're identical. I'm gonna call my twin ""Alex"" for the sake of this. 

Alex and I have always shared a room. from when we were born until a couple years ago, where they moved out. I followed suit a couple months after that. we've been living away from our parents together for a year and a half now. 

Since I can remember, and even in pictures before that, we've always been the same. same glasses, hair cut, even clothes (just different colors). I went through the whole ""figure yourself out"" phase really late compared to my peers. I came out as a lesbian, suddenly being pansexual was Alex's whole personality. 

I came out as non-binary a bit after that, and fortunately, Alex insisted they were cis-gendered. I got diagnosed with BPD after that, in 2024, and Alex just went on and on about how they have bipolar (to the point of having their psychiatrist test them, and the test came back with nothing). I recently started HRT and changed my name legally to what I've been going by for a couple years now, and suddenly Alex is a gay trans man, then the next month, bisexual and gender fluid. I decided to go to school for a passion that I've had since I was a kid, and Alex decided to go to school once they heard about it (I didn't tell anyone until I got accepted)

they follow me to jobs, they insist on hanging out with my friends, and they take pride in how we're ""so alike"". and it's not even the big things anymore. it's my fashion style (alternative, mainly), my haircut, the way I present myself even. if I get a piercing, they get one too. if I dress a certain way, Alex says ""oh, we should match!"". I'm tired of it. I can't stand not being my own person. I never have been."
615,1,"It's been around three months since I found out the wee bastard is in my throat. I've been ill for years and was getting a scan for a hiatus hernia when they found it. I've been to four different hospitals, poked and prodded, scanned however many times.

It's strange, I thought I would have crumbled when the doctor told me, instead I felt... alright? I'm not angry, I was just dealt a bad hand it seems. I'm hoping for the best but given my family history, I won't be too surprised if it's bad news. I'm 28, that's honestly not a bad age for us.

When they did the MRI/or Pet, the found something odd with my lymph nodes so I had an ultrasound today. Again, I thought I would have felt some kind of way, but I didn't? It was more an inconvenience because I wanted to nap.

I don't know, it's an odd feeling. I've felt like time has stopped for me the past couple of months yet I'm not upset or distraught. I'm just... floating. I'm not even really sure why I'm writing this, I just don't have many friends or anyone to really talk to about this or anything. 

Maybe if it isn't too much to ask, if you could spare a thought for me.

I'm my Mum's carer. I look after a stray cat, I haven't seen Disneyland or really lived, but I also have terrible luck. I'm not ready to let go yet but I'm also not sure how much fight I'll have in me if this becomes something big. The unknown is illuminating and looming over me at all times. It's exhausting

If it weren't annoying enough for me to vent about it, you may have been thinking ""The schedule is probably two exams a day, one at the beginning of the day and one at the end, and then Friday is a makeup day."" Which is a pretty similar format to what they did for the midterms, but they decided to change that for the finals because [insert reason here]. The schedule is like this:
Monday has two finals at the beginning of the day, lunch (and the lunch groups change too, so I have no idea if I will be able to talk to my friends for the rest of the year), and study halls. Tuesday has two finals at the beginning of the day, 30-minute lunch and study hall periods, another final exam, and another 30-minute study hall period that, I'm calling it right now, about 80% of the students will be gone for. Tuesday also has my three hardest exams, so the lack of break and minimal break is going to be very harmful for me. Wednesday is the only day with any thought put in it, but for some reason Monday didn't do it, with a final at the beginning of the day and another at the end, with a 30-minute makeup period. Thursday has one exam at the beginning of the day and the rest is just makeup. (They're probably not going to let us leave until the intended dismissal, even if you have literally nothing to do not gonna lie, making people really bored and talk to their friends, interrupting the people who need more time to finish.)"
619,2,"Commented about this somewhere and I guess people wanted the whole story so I‚Äôll share it here lol. 

Basically, I‚Äôve been surveilled my entire life up until I was around 18-19. For context, I‚Äôm 20 now. 

My parents had cameras everywhere, including in bedrooms, trackers in cars, tracing software on devices, etc. There was no point in my life where they didn‚Äôt have live footage/updates on where I was and what I was doing at all times, and obviously, I thought this was normal. 

It was insanely difficult to make friends because all my friends got background checked, I didn‚Äôt have any friends my parents didn‚Äôt know about, and they did everything to make sure it stayed that way. I was never allowed to have people over, save for the staff that already worked there. (I do want to point out that a part of the reason cameras were everywhere was because staff, guests, etc. were always in the house, so it was a safety precaution).

I moved out for the first time when I was close to 16, for college. Granted I had no personal income, my parents paid off my entire tuition and financed my apartment on the condition that they would have surveillance access. (Not defending them, but they were sending a 16 year old across the country to a huge uni, and given that I‚Äôd been mostly homeschooled, they probably thought it was a safety precaution).

They had full control over my finances, my living situation, schedule, the people I surrounded myself with, etc. 

I moved again after I finished my undergraduate program, this time, I opted to live on campus for grad school, this limited their surveillance options. 

I finished grad school and I bought my own car (sans tracker), and bought my first apartment‚Äî we still get in regular disputes about surveillance but alas, I‚Äôm an adult. So no cameras, but they still have my live location turned on (you win some and lose some ig). 

It‚Äôs obviously messed with me a bit as an adult, I‚Äôm not the most open about personal details with people I know, people I know often label me as hyper independent or not easily trusting, and I think I can attribute that to the fact that I‚Äôve been watched basically my entire life. 

There are moments where I feel like I‚Äôm being watched, even when I‚Äôm not. I have this horrible habit of checking for cameras wherever I go, which can be kind of embarrassing sometimes.

Obviously, I have a love/hate relationship with my family, they still control portions of my finances, they‚Äôre very much responsible for my current position in the workforce, etc. 

However, everyone I‚Äôve talked to has kind of mixed reactions about this kind of thing. Some people think my parents are justified in taking safety precautions, especially because I‚Äôm their daughter. Other people think my parents are absolute psychos. 

I‚Äôm more inclined to think the latter, but you can‚Äôt change who you‚Äôre related to lol. I like to tell myself it could be worse :)

(Edit: y‚Äôall they aren‚Äôt secret supervillains, I promise. They‚Äôre just overprotective on three redbulls and steroids)

edit #2: there were cameras everywhere (kitchens, living room, all bedrooms, etc.) they didn‚Äôt have it out for me, its just that my room, like all other rooms in the house, had cameras. Also there were no cameras in the bathroom. "
620,1,"I tried to please everyone around me for so long that after a breakup about 2 years ago (still recovering) made me lose myself while simultaneously making me find myself. However, it made me lose interest in everything, I started getting horrible grades like I did in middle school (and 2nd year of HS) became chronically depressed. I have dropped out almost every single semester, recently changed my major, I resent my family members, have mood swings, hurt those around me and I can‚Äôt seem to move on (it‚Äôs not even about the other person anymore) I am just stuck with myself. All I have to cope now is music, sunsets, and trying to make sense of myself. Someone please help. I am not okay. My parents are worried but I can‚Äôt seem to stop resenting them."

622,3,"Today, well has just been an annoying day. 

I already had plans for days that today, when he came back from family trip, i would take the car, go get kitty treats and supper. 

I haven't been out of the house since tuesday. Been sick. (Not covid) most likely the flu or upper respiratory/bronchitis. Was pretty rough. 

Felt better today.

On his way home he called me back, cause i figured calling would be better than texting him. I opened the windows cause it's  nice and cool temps out... however it warmed up the home and had to shut the windows and turn ac, to cool th house back down. 

Tried explaining that to him. He got pissy and couldn't understand my thought process on it. Made no sense. Called it stupid... Etc.

Well, just about an hr ago. I let him know, i was gonna go get something to eat and get some cat treats. Like i planned. And I'm  sure I've  told him i was gonna do this earlier. 

Mind you i have innatentive adhd and 3 other mental disorders. 

He did the same thing calling f'ing stupid, makes no sense. Dunno what i said back, but i just left anyways and did what i was gonna do. 

Made a promise to my cat on day one he was gone, i was gonna get him some today, and get myself supper...and i did. 

I guess rant over...other than it can be hard i guess sometimes for him to know whats going on up in my head even though i explain what i did, why i did, plans etc. And get that response. *shrugs* 

Cat got snacks and i got food. So i guess some lil mini victory out of a frustrating situation of today. 
"
623,1,"I‚Äôm pretty sure my family just thinks I‚Äôm invisible. I‚Äôve gotten so used to being talked over in conversation or just completely ignored.

My brother is on the spectrum so I got used to not having a say in something. If I wanted to do something or go somewhere but my brother didn‚Äôt want to I was no longer allowed to. This was because it was usually just me, my brother, and my mom and my mom wouldn‚Äôt just leave my brother and go with me do whatever it was.

For example, if we were at an amusement park and I wanted to go on a certain ride but my brother didn‚Äôt want to I couldn‚Äôt go and I‚Äôd have to wait until we went back with my dad so someone could stay with my brother. And unfortunately I‚Äôm younger than my brother so I couldn‚Äôt go by myself. 

Anyway, because I was expected to bow down to my brother I stopping voicing my opinion or asking if we can do something I want to do because, although my brother is much better now, I still expect to be told no and then be forced to do whatever he wants to do instead. Now that I‚Äôm older I usually just go off by myself.

I don‚Äôt contribute much to conversations at dinner because when I do I‚Äôm talked over. And since my parents were always busy with my brother I‚Äôve become a little hyper independent. 

I‚Äôve tried bringing this up to my mom but she always says she treated us the same. When I bring it up to my dad he always says ‚ÄúI get it, it‚Äôs frustrating.‚Äù But I don‚Äôt think he does get it.

I‚Äôve tried asking what it‚Äôs like for them as parents but to no avail. My mom says my brother himself wasn‚Äôt that difficult but that the schools were. My dad says it was frustrating for him because there were certain things he couldn‚Äôt do with my brother. Because of this my dad and I did a lot of things together when he wasn‚Äôt working."
624,3,"My adoptive son attacked yet another group of people the other day. I get a call from the treatment facility that says 'Yeah we had to call the police...""  I literally was telling the staff there that he was getting up to this point for weeks. I wrote an email to the case manager pleading with her to reconsider discharge and not to do what the insurance company wanted just because his therapist up and left and she found an opening to say 'hey we can discharge him!'

I even wrote on here once about having a feeling like - it's going to happen - he's going to snap about something absolutely dumb and someone's going to get hurt, stuff is going to get broken, police will be called.  I'm breathing a small sigh of relief that his aim sucked and he never actually landed any of his tosses on another person - but it wasn't for lack of trying. He punched a few holes in the wall and tossed numerous items at staff and other kids.  He's an adult now - this is going to sound terrible but - he needs to just go to jail.  He already has pending charges from attacking other people including a cop. I don't even know what to do anymore.  I don't want to say 'I told you so' I want them to be proactive and take steps to prevent these outbursts.

At the same time I realize this is all on him, he has to make these decisions - but they're not helping him by ignoring the signs and waiting until one of these events happen!

And just fyi - the thing that made him angry was he wanted to go outside and play basketball and they asked him to help with the weekend chores... yeah..."
625,2,"I was in my room watching TV when I heard tapping on my window. My mom heard it 3 times before me. Now I'm at the neighbor's house waiting for the police, who I don't trust. This is the 2nd time this happened, the last time being some junkie on my roof, which gave me PTSD. I don't trust the cops and I don't know the neighbors. You can see why I tagged Anxiety."
626,1,"I am a 12 year old female, going to be thirteen in a month and  have been bottling all of my stress and problems for about two years now, and I finally told my mom. Guess what? She claimed that I was the cause of it all!

 In my head, I was like , ""Excuse me? You and my dad got divorced about two years ago. My most adored pet died in January. I feel very unsafe about trusting people or people knowing me because of people even YOU trusted and they were horrible or you thought they were horrible. I had even started cutting myself ( I have stopped, but it's hard to not start again.) 

I took some tests, and they all said that I had severe depression. I know that they aren't definite, but can about 27 tests all say the same correctly? My mom was talking about getting me vitamin B shots or something of the sort. I am going to see if she can do that without my permission. 

Sorry if this sounds like I am crazy, and I know she is trying to help, but I think I need to work it out and try to help myself before I let her try."

Hi, I'm 17 years old, and some of you looking at the title might think I'm being delusional ‚Äî that adult life is going to be hard. And honestly, of course it is.
But I think people often glamorize childhood because they had a good one. I didn't.

I‚Äôm someone who deeply values my independence, and I‚Äôd do anything to get it.
Freedom, independence, and hope ‚Äî those are the things I live for.

Like I said, I didn‚Äôt have a great childhood. I‚Äôve had ‚Äî and still have ‚Äî people constantly telling me what to do. And it's not like they‚Äôre doing it out of love or for my own good. They're just... controlling.

Of course, adulthood comes with a load of responsibilities. But I‚Äôm in 12th grade, a science student, and I already have responsibilities. Sure, mine aren‚Äôt the same as an adult‚Äôs, and I‚Äôm not trying to compare. But I know responsibility. And I know I‚Äôll always have it.

Even then, I still feel like being an adult ‚Äî having my own money, my own place, my own rules ‚Äî would make me a little better. A little happier. A little more me.

I've always wanted to do things my way. I'm the black sheep in my family ‚Äî the girl who wears short clothes, speaks her mind, and does what she wants. And honestly? I like that title. If being independent makes me the black sheep, then so be it.

So... am I being delusional for thinking adulthood might actually be good?
Because from where I‚Äôm standing, I think I‚Äôd love it ‚Äî my own place, my own life, just being me.

628,1,"I (15F) don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting this. Lifeline is not able to connect me with a supporter and I have no one else. I‚Äôm talking to fucking AI and it‚Äôs so pathetic, I literally have a therapist but she doesn‚Äôt know about most of my issues because I haven‚Äôt told her. 
When I want to tell her about my eating issues or emotional and physical neglect, I get a lump in my throat and can‚Äôt spit it out. 
And I don‚Äôt think anyone cares about me because if my own parents don‚Äôt, who would? Will I always feel this lonely? Honestly I don‚Äôt think it gets better as an adult so why wait to commit?"
629,3,"So today at work (Lowe's), I took change from a self-checkout that was left behind by a customer, not knowing that doing that is actually against the rules, and is even grounds for termination. I don't think anyone saw me, but there are 4 cameras that DEFINITELY saw me. I'm worried now that someone could've been watching me on the cameras, or will go back and see me, and they'll find out what I did, leading to me getting in big trouble and then most likely fired.

This is my first job, and I've already made a decent amount of mistakes, but this is by far the worst one. Looking back, I know what I did was stupid, I guess I just wasn't thinking when I did it. Now I'm probably gonna be stressing about this until I go back in on Friday, and will probably spend the entire day praying nobody comes up and talks to me about it (even though I completely deserve it). "
630,2,"My father and I have a strained relationship.
I haven‚Äôt spoken to him in 5+ years till today. He feels as though I don‚Äôt call him enough and I feel the same about him. I would like to have a good relationship with him but he called me today complaining about how I don‚Äôt call him enough even though my birthday was three days ago and he didn‚Äôt even call me. Then when he called he had me on speaker with my brother who he has a great relationship with. His call just made my anxiety go off because I don‚Äôt know what or how to feel right now. "
631,3,"I don't even know where to begin. I am proud of who I am. I love the way I look. I admire my strength and appreciate my culture, but the weight is so so heavy. Anger, survival, resilience, leadership, and physical strength run deep through our veins. You have to take the good and bad. Toxic mother daughter relationship, single motherhood, being labeled the matriarch who has to handle everything and everyone when it should be a family effort. The racism of the world, everyone assuming you are mean and strong, menstrual cycles, childbirth, menopause. Being black is one thing, being a woman is another. Being both..I have no words. So honored, but so tired. "
632,1,"I‚Äôm one of the many many many many people who have mental illness. I have come a long way in recovering and have had lots of treatment and therapy. I am dealing with a pretty mild depression right now, and it is at a level that is totally manageable for me right now, just kinda makes everything a bit harder, but it isn‚Äôt disabling me. 

I am grateful that it‚Äôs not that bad and that I have the strength and knowledge and insight to deal with it. At the same time I kinda have this image in the back of my mind of when I was very ill and I couldn‚Äôt handle it on my own. 

I know it was not cute and I remember the misery of it, but part of me wants to feel that miserable right now. I think I partially crave people being there for me. As much as I hated not having autonomy at the time, I kinda miss the uninvited care I received. 

It‚Äôs kinda like, I don‚Äôt want to deal with my struggles alone, but the thought of reaching out to a friend or anyone feels like too much.
"
633,3,"I literally wanna cry all the time. I despise the fact that I hate my family so much but I cannot help at all. I am so sick of them all. I feel so alone. I have my exams REALLY REALLY MAJOR exams coming up in some months and I am trying to prepare vigorously for them while functioning on only 5 hour sleep everyday. I want help and I want support instead of emotional manipulation and isolation and selfishness. 

First let's start with my father. My father is ALWAYS shouting at us and ORDERING us to do his work all the time. And it always goes unacknowledged. My brother once said that even if I give my father my soul, he will still remain unsatisfied. For example, rn stressed me went and tried to rest for LEGIT THREE MINUTES and he goes like get me food. I got so angry and I said I wont go. He said what you are my daughter I always go everywhere to get you guys everything and you can't bring me food and all. TF bro stop with this manipulation. Now I feel so GUILTY that I said him no since idk I saw him eating and I was like ahhh why did i shout. 
Moreover, he has completely fucked up the overall mood of our house. Our house is enveloped by nothing but darkness, depression and anger. He also talks a lot of shit about our mother to us ALL the time to literally EVERYONE he finds and if someone says something good about her, he will start shouting at that person. 
I appreciate everything he does for me and everyone else despite his painful psoriasis and diabetes but idk he just annoys me sometimes. 


Then my UGLY ASS OLDER SISTER. Like such an UGLY HUMAN being FROM THE INSIDE. She is such a fake like in a sense that she will be there in happy times but the minute you are sad she shows you how worthless you are. We ALWAYS supported her and would wake up in the middle of the night if she would be crying because of her ex. I never even wrinkled my brows when I would wake up and try to comfort her. Her exams would be going on too and I would cook for her, clean for her, prepare her clothes and even shoes so that she doesn't get late or gets uncomfortable. I NEVER EVER TALKED ABOUT IT TO HER AFTERWARDS I always thought that it was my DUTY as a little sister to HELP MY SISTER IN TIMES OF NEED. While yesterday, I was STRESSED AS FUCK CRYING MY EYES OUT she comes and is like ""cry and pull your fake drama come on and you don't study anyways I have never seen you study ""and started CLAPPING tf bro. BROOOO I AM NOT GONNA STUDY IN FRONT OF YOU ALL THE FUCKING TIME. And then I asked her if she could give me something to eat I CAN'T MOVE EVEN AN INCH AWAY FROM MY BOOKS she is like ""no you shouldn't have this much food come on you are gonna get fat, I can't do anything "". Also,  I got REALLY REALLY less marks in my finals and whenever I make a mistake she always goes like "" this is how you probably write in your exams and that's why you get such less marks"". ARE YOU FOR REAL?? And then always bombing this on me that my acne has made my skin dull and ugly and my face ugly and others are so pretty and blah blah blah. Already, I am so INSECURE seeing all the girls my age get procedures and expensive skincare and have pretty skins. 

Then my brother and my little sister too are ALWAYS shouting at EVERYONE and idk just annoy me so much. 

I FEEL ALONE. I WISH I HAD PROPER SOMEONE WITH ME TO BE LIKE HEY YOU WILL BEAT THIS EXAM. YOU ARE STUDYING HARD. I SUPPORT YOU. YOU FALL I WILL PICK YOU UP BUT NOOOOOO I DON'T HAVE ANYONE. YOU ARE NOT ALONE AND ALL. My parents can't do that for me. It is so sad"
634,1,"For reference, I have a horrible father who has always ignored my health and disregarded it. I'm 25 and live at home because housing is beyond unaffordable.

Since I was a child, I kept telling my father I can't do work raking leaves and picking up sticks because it makes my asthma worse. Of course he brushed this off as me being lazy, claiming I was making excuses, I just wanted to be lazy, I was lazy lazy lazy lazy.

I grew up with the sentiment that I'm lazy shoved down my throat, and he still holds that sentiment over my head to this day.

But the thing is, touching sticks made my eyes and skin itch, I kept doubling over with asthma attacks every time I had to rake leaves and pick sticks up in the yard, and I couldn't stop sneezing, and it was terrible. I got tested when I was 15, and it turned out I was allergic to the trees we had in my yard, though it was just a skin test, so it's not like I had a definitive range to show the severity.

Didn't matter. He was the one who took me to that test years ago and saw the reactions and spoke to my doctors about them. He still ignored my words and had me picking up sticks and raking leaves, and called me lazy if I didn't, then got verbally violent if I refused to come outside, and he'd blame me for whatever it was he could find to excuse his poor behavior if I didn't go out and help.

This past year, my asthma has been out of control. I tried 3 inhalers and they didn't do shit to help, and this week I finally got my test results.

I am highly allergic to both trees we grow in our yard. They are my top worst, and I will basically be hospitalized if I even touch the one type.

As I told my father tonight alongside my mother that I can't touch the tree or its sticks, he literally said, ""Ok, just use gloves.""

I always used gloves. I still broke out itching and with asthma. And my mother smacked her forehead and yelled at him that it doesn't matter, even if I breathe it that's too much and will make me have an allergic reaction. She openly admitted when I showed her my test results, her jaw dropped, which it did. She was silent in shock at how bad my allergies actually are.

So my father finally just went very VERY quiet for several seconds, and then moved on to another subject immediately. Which, in his behavior, happens whenever he knows he is wrong, but he has never ever once admitted such a thing, and he legitimately cannot do so, so he switches subjects before anyone can continue the previous to pressure him into admitting he is wrong.

That alone was confirmation enough that, with the support of his wife/my mother to me and against him, and his silence, he knew he was wrong for ignoring my claims of asthma attacks and allergic reactions for all my life.

It just fucking pisses me off that he ignores all that I tell him 24/7 365 about my health, about my situations, about anything and everything but especially my health, which is unbearable since I am chronically ill and disabled. He doesn't believe me, he doesn't believe doctors, he admits he doesn't believe doctors, and yet it took until his ignorance almost got my mother killed and she had to be sedated and airlifted to another hospital for emergency surgery that he learned to listen to her and her health concerns, at least.

Still he doesn't listen to me 99.9% of the time, and constantly tells me he disbelieves my doctors. Tonight was the closest I ever got to a confirmation that he was wrong. About anything. Ever."
635,1,"just a week or two my now-ex of a year and a half suddenly dumped me for reasons I wasn't aware of until he said something, I had cried quite a bit afterwards, texted him I miss him, and some other dumb shit, but as soon as I start to maybe think life isn't so bad when I'm single, I get a text message from a mutual friend, and they sent me a picture of my ex and some random person who had hit on him while we were dating. I think this person and my ex are gonna start dating soon where I had just started to hang out with my friends again. I thought he missed me at least a little :("
636,1,"Im not great at math, but my specific combination of birth defects is seen in about 0.0007% of the population, im not joking. Im an identical twin born out of an IVF clinic (only set of identical twins conceived at that clinic), both my twin and I have bilateral clubbed feet, and even less with other biological defects we're still learning about 19 years later. Ive always been told to be grateful to be alive because of this fact, but all I feel is resentment. 

Im permanently disabled from birth, and yet its not seen as anything of significance? Being able to clip off all your toenails despite blood, and no pain, is NOT normal, having scans taken of your ankles and having the doctors say ""because of your ankle structure, there isnt a lot we can do surgically for pain. Your bones developed 'broken'."" Is not normal. I feel lost and found at the same time. Im finally recognizing this is bringing me pain, and yet ive never felt so invisible? Just because im technically broken doesnt erase my pain. 

It doesnt help that my disability isnt very researched. Nobody knows about it, physicians literally have taken turns looking at my feet. Am I supposed to just live a life of pain without relief? I realize the hesistance, but the pain is to the point I struggle to walk some days. 

I dont know why im posting this. Im extremely tired of feeling like everything I do to help myself just turns out dead. There's a lot more ""wrong"" with me, I genuinely feel like I shouldnt be alive. I truly dont understand why Im not dead yet. Im lucky enough to stay alive, but unlucky enough that i was jumped in a strong arm robbery two weeks ago, and didnt have injuries severe enough for the police to seriously search for the attacker. "
637,0,I‚Äôve been on Tumblr for about a decade or so now and I have no clue why this is happening but Tumblr is infested with porn bots and the staff is doing literally nothing at all to stop it from happening. This is making Tumblr borderline unusable and I am pissed about it!
638,3,"I don't have anybody to vent to and I feel like I'm going to snap one day.

So I've been looking for a job now for a little over a year, and it's almost been a year since my car broke down. We couldn't afford to get it repaired and it was basically a junker anyway because the frame was rusting and it was costing more to upkeep than it was worth, so we sold it for rent money. I ended up needing to walk to town now and then because I didn't have a bike (it took me a little over an hour just to get there on foot), then I worked for around a week at the local dollar store but was fired (I think it's because my manager didn't click with me, but she said I wasn't doing enough for them and I was slow on the register even though I was about as fast as the other cashiers). I had enought money to pay some bills and buy myself a bike secondhand on the Facebook marketplace, and since then I've been riding it around pretty much everywhere because nothing is really walking distance.

Today I felt like getting a few things from the store and I have fun riding my bike, so I took it out and went to the grocery store. When I got there, two people were coming out, and I heard the woman say something like ""Oh, this lady,"" and then something I couldn't really hear. They lowered their voices, but I could here the man say in a mocking baby voice ""Aww, you were able to buy yourself a bike, you used to have to walk, aww"" and they were both laughing about it quietly.

I got really angry and snapped at them because I've been having such a hard time lately, and they just repeated me and mocked me in the same baby voice like they were talking about a little kid. It actually makes me want to scream, it ruined my whole day.

I'm just genuinely so sick of it. I live in a trailer park, but the rest of the neighborhood is rich, like there are huge houses with huge yards everywhere and a really nice sub-division nearby, it's part of the reason everything is so far away because they put the trailer park farther from the business district than the houses and there's literally no public transportation around unless you can afford an Uber or something. People around here are just generally a lot ruder to people like me who are low-income and have to work retail, but it's REALLY starting to get to me and I just needed to post about it somewhere."
639,3,"Theres three of us. Myself [F 24], C[F, NB, 24]  and S [M NB 25?]. I have borderline personality disorder and bipolar, so abandonment issues and poor emotional regulation (actively have been working on it). Myself and C have been in a relationship for 3+ years and known each other for 7+ years. Engaged. Or we were.. we ended up with S, after less than a month of knowing them. S had domestic violence go on in their family home so we offered our place. I was uncomfortable but wanted them safe. We'd gone all the way before, but I wanted to walk it back. They asked why, I didn't have a reason, they pushed until I cried ""maybe my trauma, idk"" and then they said ""dont do that"" like I was using my trauma like a card. Then they moved in. It had its tense moments but whatever, S is going through Adderall and alcohol withdrawal. Yesterday we went to my father's, where S drank. C also had a shot. I'm less upset about what they drank and more that we agreed not to drink and then they drank. We get home, they ask if I want to talk about it while C, who can barely walk, goes to shower. I say there's nothing to talk about, we had an agreement and you broke it- to which they try to justify it with ""I usually get blackout drunk, I didn't even get buzzed. And I ate a full plate"" and I tell them it doesnt matter that they're not drunk. They leave the room. C comes back and snuggles, I take a nap. I wake up, c goes to take out their contacts. C is gone for a long time. C made dinner too. They come in the room and sit down, turning on Hulu and talking over my curled up self on the corner of the bed. I ask them to watch that in the other room. They leave. They stay gone, before eventually coming back to ""talk"". C and I have a small talk before S moves to talk- which starts off on why they started drinking over a year ago and how they usually get black out drunk. I sit up and say ""kinda missing the point"" and it turns into a crying blow up. ""Well I'm sorry I'm an addict"" says S- which obviously isn't a genuine apology. So I have to trot out my trauma and how that boundary wasn't just for their benefit. I say its not an apology and go shower. I vent to a friend, who has them move to the other bedroom so I can have my bed back. Then they don't come back. I'll admit I send some pissy texts ""have fun watching Hulu. Chit chat like nothing is wrong."" Etc etc. Bitchy but nothing insulting. It felt like they didnt care about the fact that I was hurting. They stayed back there while I cried my eyes out and split. I live in an old trailer, two doors need to shut loudly. I startled them from the other room. C was waiting on ""permission"" but I don't give permission, they've never needed permission. The next day they come back in and I finally get a genuine apology from S but I don't care about drinking anymore, I cared about being left alone while hurting. Usually C and I would've laid in bed and talked, but this time we didn't. C sits on the ground with the dog, S talks about how I ""scared"" them and was pissy with them. I go to leave because if I'm ""scary"" then the conversation is already over. C clings to me and I pull away (which according to S is abusive because C ""needed me"")  . I stalk around outside before coming back in and saying I'm going for a drive- then I change my mind and ask to just talk to C. We talk quietly. We cuddle. We start to come back from it. Then C goes to pee, and suddenly S pops in and says ""they already made plans"" to go out. So they go out. They leave while I'm hurting instead of talking. I crash out again, I'm under the impression that they're gone while I'm wailing my soul out but the vehicle was still there so who knows. They eventually do leave. I admit, I was in an upset feedback loop and began to call excessively and texted them to not tell me i was important if I'm not. To break up with me if they'd rather ignore me. They don't respond and ignore me. Again. I call their mother and say ""hey, we got into it and they're out with a friend but they aren't answering my calls- can you tell them to call me?"" 

Well C apparently believes I would out them to a dangerous person, because they weren't sure if I would tell their mom that we were gay. I know better. After 3 years, I'd hoped they would know I knew better. Finally they call me, and they're upset because now their mom knows they have a boyfriend. I tell them I didn't tell their mother that because I know better. It turns into a blow up because I'm upset that they're ignoring me, S takes the phone and calls me an abusive bitch for ""pulling away when C needed me"" and for being pissy. I won't claim to be an angel, how I spoke was unacceptable. I had hysterical indignant laughter and hysterical sobs. Ive asked C in the past if I needed to adjust how I react to things, if I was abusive, and the answer was always no. Now there's a new person and suddenly I am? Anyway I tell S that they can come get their shit but I fucked up and said ""ya'll"" and C took it to mean them both. Now C is leaving and moving out back to their parents. It could be because C told them about having a boyfriend and now they're being protective, or it could be that C just really is that done with me. I don't understand how 3 years gets thrown away that quickly because I snapped. Ive never insulted, I rarely raise my voice (it only happens when a third person is involved how suprising) . I feel like I'm not allowed to have big emotions. Communication can't happen if you're ignoring the other person. If you need space say you need space, don't treat me like shit over it. 

I

Guess I must be abusive 

I think the world of C and if I hurt them then I deserve to hurt. 

But 

The ignoring. Hurt so much. 

I thought we could talk. I thought that when C went to the bathroom, S would come in and talk.  But then they left like I didn't matter. 

And when I go home.. everything will be gone. "
640,1,"so i‚Äôm 18M turning 19 in a few weeks. i‚Äôve been struggling a lot recently with the fear of growing up and fear of the future. i‚Äôve been depressed in the past but ive felt like my life has no purpose for the past 6 months. ive never had a girlfriend before cuz i was tired of getting rejected usually for being short, introverted, etc and dating apps do not work for me. i worry i may never get married and start a family. i need someone to turn to when i feel like i don‚Äôt matter, someone who makes me feel like the world isn‚Äôt a bad place and life is an amazing thing. i have felt like no one understands me or what im going through. it‚Äôs caused my anxiety to peak and i feel like im entering a quarter life crisis. but anyways, life keeps going  "
641,1,"So....my sister is such a narcissist.  She edited my diary when I didn't want her to, put ""positive messages"" in there that I didn't want, and then has the audacity to ask me to apologize to her when she is clearly in the wrong.

I really dislike her. "
642,3,"I really do need to vent. 

I‚Äôve been teaching 10 years this year, I‚Äôm 32 years old, so I‚Äôm not fresh out of university, but I haven‚Äôt been in the job all that long - which makes my vent even more upsetting for me! 

I work in a New Zealand school, but I imagine my experience is worldwide now. Parents think they can talk to us teachers, however they want. They think that because they are the parents, they can verbally abuse us and be as rude as they want, with no repercussions at all. 

Today I was trying my best to put an end to an ongoing situation between a group of children, I had consulted with these kids (they are 8-10 for context) and I knew the feelings of the kids from their own mouths, in their own words. I made the decision which I truely felt was in their best interest. However, when communicating this, I got about 12 different abusive messages, 3 phone calls and when calling one back, I was threatened. Would you believe that all of this was over a stolen lunch which resulted in the break up of a friend group?! My solution was literally to have the kids talk openly to each other and discuss their feelings, having the ones who stole sincerely apologise and come up with how to make it right collectively - and ‚Äúlet‚Äôs give each other some space for a while and then try return to the friendship‚Äù. Can you believe that this was me apparently accusing kids of being criminals, backing them into a corner, racially profiling and being judgemental? 

It was one of those days where I just don‚Äôt want to be a teacher anymore. I‚Äôve had enough. I want to tell these parents exactly what I think of them but of course, I can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt as I‚Äôm not going to drop to their level. 

Thanks for the vent! "
643,2,"Idk if im being stupid or not or its my trauma and im traumatized but is it normal for wxtended family to still treat you like a teenager and them ask your parents instead of you for you to be able to do things? It makes me feel infantilized as fuck and makes me mad when grandparents/aunts/uncles do this. Like.. ive been an adult for like 3-4 years now you can just Ask Me Directly.

"
644,2,"I just want to vent here for a moment because it‚Äôs been heavy on my mind and I feel I have no one to speak to at the moment. 

Long story short (whole story posted on my account), my (now ex) husband raped me back in 2023, I stayed with him for 6 months after the incident due to multiple reasons; embarrassment, anxiousness, fear, regret, and denial. 

I honestly didn‚Äôt know how people would react. I reported everything to the police, after I had a few people supporting me. Once people found out I made the report (because he got arrested) people started HATING me. There was one relative of his who sent me a nasty text message saying ‚ÄúI will never forgive you for any of this, I hope you're happy with what you've done.‚Äù Later on I heard that this person kept telling my friends that they hope I die, and that I ruined her life?? 

Even my own dad. He said I keep making really poor decisions and that I should've told the police not to arrest him and that I'm ruining his (my ex‚Äôs) life (even though I did ask the police NOT to arrest him), he even said ""you can't be that scared since you live alone"". I said to him that he told me I should've made a police report, and he said ""you should've made one the night it happened"". 

I‚Äôve had people downplay the events that took place, I‚Äôve had people ask me what I could have done to prevent it from happening. People have treated me and spoken to me as if what happened was my fault. People have told me just to forget about it and move on. 

I have lost friends over this, I‚Äôve had people accuse me of lying even though I have so much evidence. I even had an old friend tell my family that I confessed to her that I lied about the entire thing. 

My ex HIMSELF confessed to it on here, to my parents, on recording!! And people still don‚Äôt believe me. 

I‚Äôve had people tell me that I have victim mentality because I don‚Äôt trust people now, and I‚Äôm more cautious with certain situations and people, I‚Äôm always doubting when people are being genuine or if they‚Äôre trying to manipulate me. 

I feel like I‚Äôm going insane. "
645,3,"So me and the family went to a lake for Father's day.

First, I burned my feet on the sand and have big ass blisters on the bottom. Second I was in the sun for four hours straight without sunscreen(I'm allergic to it) OH. MY. GOD.

I'm into much painüò≠ I can't move, sleep or anything! I'm burning, shaking, and blistering already. 
The sunburn is on my stomach, chest, sides, back, shoulders, forearms, face and legs.

Aloe only helps temporarily and makes it burn more. Ice packs help temporarily but feel SO good. Cold showers don't help and are painful. 

Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!üò≠üò≠üò≠"
646,1,"I‚Äôm miserable. I‚Äôm about to be evicted, I just had to give away my cat, my car doesn‚Äôt work, I got fired from my job because of it, my mom died recently, I have no family left, I just fucking hate my life now. I‚Äôm miserable from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep. I just don‚Äôt want to do this anymore. I‚Äôm at peace with my decision to not move forward with life anymore and I‚Äôm very grateful for the life I did live but my cat was the only thing holding me together and now I don‚Äôt know what to do. "
647,2,"I'm just so tired of certain groups of people and just individuals saying a lot of stuff and being so proud to say whatever is on their minds, praising themselves on how much they love freedom of speech and how much they value it. But then I just see freedom of speech only applies to themselves or people who think exactly the same things. That's NOT freedom of speech. Are people just dumb or ignorant? I'm seriously starting to think dumb. Because if I respond or respectfully say like ""I hear you, but I think X because of Y""... it's like some people just want to silence you and don't listen to anything that doesn't already align with the opinions you already have. Freedom of speech requires allowing for even other opinions than your own to flourish in a society. If you don't want to allow other opinions to be heard, because you think people will agree with the ""wrong"" things, then perhaps your arguments weren't strong to begin with. I get that you may not want to change your mind because of pride and shit, because just hating people for having different opinions (unless they are of extreme violence and/or dehumanizing) is just WEIRD. Freedom of speech doesn't equal you being allowed to spew out the WILDEST shit onto people who probably don't even want to listen, without a rebuttal. If it turns out not everyone agrees with you, it doesn't automatically mean that your freedom of speech is being censored. It's so gross to me that people walk around claiming to love ""freedom of speech"" while being their own dictators in their own little worlds. This is how democracies die. And they are certainly on their deathbeds at the moment.

"
648,2,"It completely flipped my world upside down‚Äîpeople I trusted turned on me, and ever since then it‚Äôs felt like I keep crashing over and over, just trying to hold myself together.

One of my tracks is called ‚Äú&Again &Again‚Äù, and it‚Äôs about that exact feeling‚Äîhow this experience has affected me deeply, but also how I‚Äôve been trying to stay resilient through it all.

Lately I‚Äôve realized that most of what I write still revolves around what happened. I want to move on, I want to write about other parts of life again‚Äîbut it keeps coming back up. I think I‚Äôm chasing the idea of writing one song that finally captures it fully, something that gets it off my chest once and for all.

Not sure if anyone else here has had something weigh on them like that creatively‚Äîwhere you can‚Äôt stop writing about it until you get it right."
649,1,"i am 17 years old and i turn 18 in august, in 10th grade i was online schooled due to my anxiety, depression, and refusing to go to class. when i was 14-15 my psychiatrist prescribed me about 10 different meds for my mh and all of those medications sent me into a state of psychosis basically. during that time i barely slept and i was basically selling myself for drugs atp to grown me . but also it was to feel loved at the same time bc i grew up fat and ugly and the weird kid nobody ever wanted to be around but even those guys thought i was weird. once i stopped taking those medications all that i went thru in that year sent me into a such a deep state of depression. i have had very very bad depressive episodes in the past but nothing compared to this one and tbh i am still not out of it in the slightest. this mixed with all the trauma i have from my childhood plus so much shit with my parents has ruined my mental health. and thats not even it. i have so many aversions to things, food, the sounds around me, the temperature, the lights, and people around me. i panic anytime i am alone in public and get nauseatingly anxious over any little inconvenience. i dont know how to interact with ppl including my friends and family. growing up i was my parents smart child but eventually i couldnt pay attention in school anymore so i havent really learned anything since 6th grade. i feel like a waste of space and idk what im doing here atp. i am extremely sensitive to every little thing and i just feel like i cannot exist in this world how everyone else does"
650,1,"She's showered me with so much love that I honestly don't care that she ia just doing it to feel again, im prepared for this to end badly but I don't care anymore it's been so long since I've felt loved and needed by someone who im so similar to. I feel like a loser for clinging onto happiness like this even though I would've laughed at others for doing this in the past, im going to try my hardest and hope im wrong about this "
651,2,"i‚Äôd give you any possession you could possibly fathom. i‚Äôd do anything you ask, find a way to make anything you want available for you. if it is impossible, i will make it possible. id give you my thoughts, my emotion, my physical self, anything you wanted. i‚Äôd give you my soul if you asked. i think of nothing but you, do nothing if not in your approval.

yet i constantly feels as though i beg for attention. will i be wanted, much less, the same way? "
652,2,I didn‚Äôt brush my teeth for a year (sometimes I did but barely) and my adult tooth is hanging off of my gum from the right side and it feels like a huge weight is being put on my teeth constantly and I can NOT mentally go to the dentist but I do brush my teeth every night now because of this so I guess it pushed me to brush my teeth and I didn‚Äôt tell anybody this irl so they don‚Äôt have to worry about me and it‚Äôs really scary and I keep having short panic attacks also whenever I brush my teeth I‚Äôm scared if it will fall off I don‚Äôt know what to do I know it won‚Äôt be the end of the world but I want my tooth man
653,1,"I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my history with grooming, but they‚Äôre 9 months and a few weeks younger than me and that just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. I love them, but I wish they were older than me. I just hate being the oldest in the relationship. I feel like I barely have anything in common with people my age. I don‚Äôt even know what my partner and I have in common besides surface level stuff like video games and art? That‚Äôs it. Not even that I feel like. "
654,3,"Couple of days ago, my brother called me the F slur. I am not out to anyone, I assumed it's because I just look gay. That moment shocked me to my core.

Today our parents sat us together to ""fix"" the situation because apparently he kept complaining about me not liking/avoiding him but didn't tell them the reason.

I told them that he called me the F slur, they didn't even know what it meant that's how bizarre it was, my mom looked very mad at him and shouted stuff at him.

Then the conversation continued and my mom brought up other people into the conversation as in ‚Äúlook at the other brothers from that family they love each other‚Äù the person she brought up was the guy who SA me. I told her I don't forgive him either.

Then my brother said this: ‚Äúhe was just a teenager, you should forgive him. These guys used to come to me and tease me about you‚Äù he named 3 people, which is the guys who SA me. I was shocked that he knew, that they were BRAGGING about it. My mom looked shocked that it wasn't just one guy (the guy she knew about). I feel hurt and exposed. I don't know what to do anymore."
655,1,"I hate my body so much. Whether its true or not i‚Äôd be so much happier if i was skinny. im almost 190lbs, 5‚Äô4 maybe, i hate myself so much. im not even that unhealthy in the sense that its not restricting me physically. i just cant stand what i see when i look in the mirror. Ive binged the past 2-3 days at least and ive tried purging a few times but just end up dry heaving cause im not doing it right or some bs. i want to lose weigjt and i want it now. nothing works. ive tried all the other other reddih pages. the fact im useless and lazy and have no motivation sucks. im in such a bad spot right now and i cant stand gaining more weight."
656,3,I purchased a different kind from usual and I hate them and my distress from the money spent and my lack of enjoyment are surfacing my even bigger stresses and making me feel very defeated. Very defeated. And I hate that it only took a damn cigarette for me to practically fall apart. 
657,2,"I feel so ashamed of myself because of the way people often treat me, talk to me, & handle me. I have a huge people pleasing & fawning issue. That‚Äôs always been my defense mechanism since I was a young child to keep myself safe. 

Really anytime I‚Äôd express any negative emotions or try to set a boundary, show I was uncomfortable with my mom (it mainly started at home), she‚Äôd get angry w me, raise her voice, sometimes put her hands on me. It was met with some type of aggression or even just ignored. 

So I learned early on I can‚Äôt show when I‚Äôm upset, not ok w/ something, can‚Äôt say no to people or they‚Äôll hurt me. This really set in my mind physically, like I‚Äôd automatically get anxious if someone was obviously testing my boundaries & making me uncomfortable, bc I could never bring myself to say no fearing what they‚Äôd do to me. 

I‚Äôve been trying really hard to stop doing this. I graduated high school last year, I feel like especially in settings like that, it was super difficult for me to say no & set boundaries. I was constantly overwhelmed by everyone else / their energies. That‚Äôs the best way I can explain it. Especially if I do feel unsafe, I‚Äôd fawn even more.

I can tell when I do try to assert boundaries even a little bit, people seem upset with me or caught off guard which gives me even more anxiety bc I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre taking my boundary seriously or not, or if they‚Äôll say something to hurt my feelings, or hurt me physically. 

I‚Äôve had people say and do some horrible things to me in the past bc of this, I‚Äôm really ashamed of it still. I‚Äôm really lonely for this reason too, I don‚Äôt have any genuine, close friends and it eats me up alive. 

I don‚Äôt even feel like I‚Äôm 19, I still feel like a lost, scared little girl at times & it breaks me. I feel myself getting more aggressive/probe to lashing out, which even that can lead me to getting hurt physically even more. I don‚Äôt have a support system, so I did self-harm not to long ago on my arm to cope/release these emotions. 

It helped somewhat, but it also added onto my anxiety bc I live somewhere very hot, so I can‚Äôt necessarily wear sleeves to cover up any scars left. I‚Äôm just worried about someone at work noticing. 

It also helps sometimes to bring me to the present again, I‚Äôm noticing now I never really am present in my body in the moment. I‚Äôm either thinking of the past, or possible future & it‚Äôs exhausting. Sometimes bc of this, I also dissociate, which is veryy scary to experience. 

Last time this happened, I felt extremely numb even though I had been crying for hours in my room, & was also viewing my body from like a 3rd person point of view. It was scary how disconnected I was, and I couldn‚Äôt seem to bring myself back to reality."
658,3,"So fucking over it man. I still care and I try so hard to have a conversation when we have a problem but he just goes fucking silent and shuts me out as soon as he gets upset. I‚Äôm so done with being ignored every time shit gets hard, like fuck I‚Äôm not even angry I feel like it was literally a fucking misunderstanding but we can‚Äôt even fucking work it out bc i won‚Äôt hear from him until 5pm tomorrow probably. I‚Äôm so ready to move on I don‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt just free myself from his avoidant ass fuck it all lmfao

Obviously I think you‚Äôve lost interest in me when we‚Äôre in the same room for 20 minutes and you haven‚Äôt even said hello yet let alone acknowledged my presence. ‚ÄúI wanted you to feel welcome tonight‚Äù You didn‚Äôt even tell me what you were up to until I asked lmao I‚Äôm just gonna leave you the fuck alone and see how quickly we lose touch man I know I‚Äôm better off like that. Fuck the last 3 years I guess

Edit: Didn‚Äôt expect for this to get traction, was drunkenly ranting ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Context was he walked out of an argument he started (he noticed I seemed upset, he had been ignoring me in a social setting of what was mostly his friends that he had invited me to after I asked him where the hell he was; then HE pulled ME aside, went dead after I started explaining that it was a bit uncomfortable & was disappointed that he was ignoring me on what was supposed to be a date night). Was just really awkward, I‚Äôd asked him to have a date night yesterday bc we‚Äôve been having a hard time. He said he was too busy & then happened to have time to stop by his friends all night ü•≤

Thank y‚Äôall for the kind words it‚Äôs very sweet and I know I should have been gone years ago haha. Will do my best to really be done this time, waking up alone today was definitely heartwrenching and I know biting the bullet now would mean I don‚Äôt have to feel that way in the future anymore"
659,1,"After many followers asked me why I didn't have my blue page yet, it turns out that I ended up doing it but I didn't have the results I expected and now I feel bad for doing it ü´†ü´†ü§î"
660,3,"I should probably just put here that the reason I can get a diagnosis is that the waiting list for one where I live is a year long, so yes I'm on the waiting list for it but that doesn't exactly help when I can't really do anything while I'm waiting.

It just feels like everything I do is inconsistent, it either drains all my energy and I can barely get started or I can go all day no problems, mainly with academics but with alot of other stuff too.

I just tried to do a practice exam paper and was sat down at my desk for 30 fucking minutes unable to write anything. Why? I don't know, I just couldn't, my body wouldn't let me even start. I couldn't figure out why, and eventually it just got into a feedback loop of getting frustrated with myself for not doing it, and then being annoyed at myself for being frustrated with something so dumb to the point where the paper itself didn't even matter anymore and I just started crying.

That's not the only example, alot of the time it feels like I just physically can't bring myself to revise, I forget to eat all the time, I'll randomly go quiet in the middle of a conversation because I've gone off on another train of thought that's completely irrelevant, I'm just inconsistent.

And I won't act like there aren't highs too, I have pretty good grades (consistently A's and high B's), and sometimes it'll feel like everything clicks, my brain finally decides to work and then I manage to act like a normal person for a little bit, and when I manage to do that people suddenly act like I'm a genius? I would understand if it was consistent but even though I'm useless the other 90% of the time??

Those highs don't even feel like me anymore, they just kinda happen. I've been told so many times to ""just get a planner"" or ""try and use your time better"" and does nobody think I'm trying?? Trust me, if I could figure out what the hell is wrong with me and get to those highs all the time I would, and then maybe I'd be able to perform at a standard that doesn't make people disappointed in me, but it's I've been trying for a whiiiile now and I can't figure it out. 

I know that my brain working on overdrive 2 days before a deadline is due isn't sustainable, and it's not gonna be enough to get me through life. Every time I imagine what would happen if I keep doing that type of thing is that eventually I stagnate, I get comfortable, and that's fucking terrifying you know? I don't wanna stop, because if I stop then I'll fall behind. 

If I could manage to stop being lazy then I could avoid that, I know I could but for some ungodly reason I can't bring myself to.


Sorry if this is annoying to read, or if I've just wasted some of your time, but it hurts more if it's only in my head"
661,0,"$8.99 for some Mother F-ing ""All purpose steak seasoning"" at Albertsons. Wtf!!! Inflation is this bad and I haven't noticed?!?!?

Back in the day this shit was 3 something or the low 4s. Damn the future is going to be horrible at this rate."
662,1,"I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to wish my father a Happy Father‚Äôs Day today. and I feel like shit for it.

part of me felt this was right‚Äîthat I‚Äôm standing on business, taking action against all the verbal abuse I‚Äôve incurred over the years. I have never once heard him say ‚Äúsorry‚Äù for all the insults, yells, and anger he has hurdled at me. not once. but my mind and body remember it all. for every potential sign of anger that I see‚Äîeven from strangers and friends‚Äîmy body immediately freezes in fear. I blame him for it, for making me the way that I am, the fact that I am constantly in a state of flight or flight. I‚Äôm such a people pleaser too, I hate it. he tried to use this as an insult against me once‚Äîand I was stunned to silence. doesn‚Äôt he know that he‚Äôs the reason I learnt to walk around eggshells around Everyone?

still, another part of me feels so much guilt. it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs the worst father out there. I know how hard he‚Äôs been working, some days coming home at 7 pm. with the economy this bad, he works over the weekends too. he provides so much‚Äînot emotionally, but so much of the labour around the house, he does it. our family is not the most well-off, but we get by. thanks to him. I just feel like because of it, he was never around for me to spend time with him, and form a connection‚Ä¶ maybe that‚Äôs why I feel so much worse and so much more grief.

for the record, he has never been physically abusive towards me. maybe that‚Äôs why I feel so much more guilty too. I hear stories of children cutting their parents off, or feeling conflicted about their parents‚Äîoftentimes, it involves a physically abusive parent, or substance abuse. in my situation, there is none of that. I simply feel this much pain, anger, torment, and heartache because it feels like my father has been so emotionally absent, and I guess, verbally abusive too? i don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs hard for me to use that term to describe him.

back to the present. a couple months ago / relatively recently, we had a big argument and I randomly spouted out, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt even like me!‚Äù guess what, he couldn‚Äôt even respond. that hurt me so deeply I can‚Äôt even put it into words. I know he does love me, but the fact he couldn‚Äôt say anything, or say that it wasn‚Äôt true, pained me to no end. so yeah. it‚Äôs fresh on my mind, even though it happened a couple months ago. and because of that, I couldn‚Äôt wish him a ‚Äúhappy father‚Äôs day‚Äù today.

it‚Äôs something I particularly dislike about the month of june. I always dread this sunday, because it would mean having to muster the courage to say words I don‚Äôt mean.

EDIT** did not mean to put the ED / self image tag!"
663,3,"i cannot stand my sister anymore. she is a drug addict and alcoholic and she doesn‚Äôt do anything but sit around the house all day. she has just crashed her second car this year and it was bad. she reeked of alcohol and the police could‚Äôve easily arrested her and given her a dui right there. but by some luck of god, she didn‚Äôt and she got to go home. she sustained damage to her ears since the force of the crash caused her earrings to fly out.

i‚Äôve done so many things for her only to not give a shit and disregard me over and over again. the most recent of this is that i got her a job at the place i work at. i had to pull favours and make a deal with my managers to work on my off days to get her application and hiring process expedited. it‚Äôs a job in her field, EXTREMELY flexible hours, they would pay for her certification and for her time during it, would look good for the school she‚Äôs applying to, and they would pay her tuition after three years of working there.

she turned it down. 

two days ago, she turned it down because the school got back to her and accepted her. except, today she found out she‚Äôs not eligible to go because she did not fulfill a major prerequisite. i told to her wait on the job offer instead of immediately declining, but she said ‚Äúno, i‚Äôm all set!‚Äù 

then, the day after her crash, my parents came back up to me asking if i could call in favours all over again so she could have a job during her gap. i said ‚Äúabsolutely not.‚Äù then they told me i would have to either give my car to her or drive her around myself. she can figure it herself. i don‚Äôt care anymore about her. the application process and hiring takes weeks of time to even start. she didn‚Äôt care when i had worked my ass off to make sure her application was reviewed timely. she doesn‚Äôt care about not smoking in my car since the smell of weed makes me feel sick. all she cares about is being the life of the party, drinking and doing weed.

Didn‚Äôt grow up with him around, too much to explain really. But he‚Äôs been in my life / I‚Äôve accepted him into my life since December. He‚Äôs tried being in my life in the past but his (ex) wife was insufferable and now that she‚Äôs outta the picture I‚Äôm more comfortable talking to him. She used to control conversations and say things like ‚Äúme and your dad tried so hard to get you girls‚Äù like bitch please a) if anyone was getting me and my sister back it was gonna be my mom, and b) they were never at court and lived in Florida meanwhile my mom was always at court and just got fucked by the judicial trafficking system. And she‚Äôs a psycho bitch who abused my little brother so her words always just struck me wrong. Gross person.

Needless to say this day brings a lot of feelings up for me, but I decided to be the bigger person and tell him happy Father‚Äôs Day even though part of me didn‚Äôt want to. He‚Äôs trying, I love him, and he‚Äôs been here for me even though I have a hard time with our relationship sometimes. He‚Äôs been really supportive emotionally at certain points and really validated some things I‚Äôve experienced and I appreciate that. 

Idk I didn‚Äôt even know it was Father‚Äôs Day until I opened up Instagram. I was conflicted about saying it but I said it and I‚Äôm glad I did even if it felt partially icky and partially like the right thing to do. I don‚Äôt keep up with this holiday ever and try to avoid it pretty much every year. 

Probably not gonna talk to him the rest of the day though just bc that‚Äôs all he‚Äôs getting from me rn üòÇüò≠ 

idk part of me feels like I need to grow up and not be vindictive bc he‚Äôs a loving person and he was homeless from early childhood to mid twenties, he‚Äôs tried to do his best, & I know this is his first time living too & my heart has empathy for his experience as a person, 

and part of me feels like punishing him for the ways he fell short and abandoned me. lol. but I‚Äôm trying not to succumb to the vindictive unhealed part of myself that wants him to know he hasn‚Äôt been a good father to me (even though he definitely already knows that and has cried to me about it multiple times when I basically vented at him blaming him and being cold and heartless to him for hours on the phone). 

My inner child is still angry at him but also she‚Äôs happy he‚Äôs around.


Idk man Happy Father‚Äôs Day to all the adult kids of absent fathers who still made it into adulthood!!! We fuckin rock!!! & Happy Father‚Äôs Day to the single mothers who do both!!! (Not my foster parent bc she may have raised me but didnt do her job so no credit to her) & Happy Father‚Äôs Day to the Dads eho do their fucking job raising their kids!!!! You guys rock!!! Thanks for being in your kids lives & not just showing up but giving it your best shot!!! 

ETA happy Father‚Äôs Day to the kids with no present parents / only abusive asshole parents who still made it to adulthood! I see you!!

& to the deadbeats‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll probably be subject to one of these posts one day & your kids may say they forgive you later on but there will always be part of them that‚Äôs still angry at you for fucking things up :) think about that and make better choices while you still have time!"

Minor heartbreak. I know I will heal. My attachment to the person was superficial, anyhow, not some major blow or a ‚Äúone true love‚Äù situation. I know the world is filled with joy, righteousness, etc, etc. I don‚Äôt need reminding.

But you can never know your own place in the world for certain. I feel shrunken down and powerless. I lack an anchor. That, I suppose, fantasy I had kept me grounded. At least I felt content in that I meant something to someone. 

I don‚Äôt think I am hopeless. I know things will get better. Yet, I also know that when things get better, they then get worse. It‚Äôs hills and valleys, hills and valleys. 

I am surrounded by outsiders. I have not met anybody like me. Loneliness is perpetual, not because there isn‚Äôt anybody speaking to me, but I do not feel heard in anybody. Maybe I am a narcissist.

I joked, ‚ÄúAlvin and the Chipmunks really made themselves at home this year,‚Äù and everyone chuckled‚Äîexcept my dad.

He became visibly upset and snapped, saying something like, ‚ÄúWell, don‚Äôt come up this year then. That‚Äôs a low blow, and I don‚Äôt find it fucking funny.‚Äù He went on to say that he‚Äôs invested a lot of money into the cottage, and he didn‚Äôt appreciate me bringing up anything negative. He added that if I had spent that much money, I wouldn‚Äôt be laughing either.

I honestly wasn‚Äôt trying to insult the cottage or his efforts‚ÄîI just made a silly remark about chipmunks doing what wild animals do. But his reaction was loud and aggressive enough to wake up my son, so I quietly picked him up and left.

Now I‚Äôm sitting here wondering if I overreacted or if the guilt I‚Äôm feeling is justified. Did I cross a line with a harmless joke? Or was his reaction disproportionate?"

677,1,"I had a really intense dream the other night, it's a lot to explain but it was definitely about my childhood trauma. I've been through a lot of therapy, I'm on medication, I've done a lot of work to move past it and cope. Its hard not to remember it sometimes, and it clearly has some kind of hold on my subconscious, which is probably why I had the dream. I was telling my grandma about the dream, and she basically responded with ""move on, stop thinking about it and stop letting it effect you"". I don't know how to explain to her that I can't stop it from effecting me. I try not to think about it, whenever I do I distract myself to prevent spiraling negative thoughts. She has always had this attitude, though. She thinks you can stop being clinically depressed by ""choosing to be happy"". I understand the concept of changing your perspective, or trying to put yourself in a positive mindset but mental illness just doesn't work like that. I can't erase the memory of what happened from my mind. I can't stop myself from feeling badly about it. Maybe she's like this because it's something she can't control. "

679,1,"Been struggling with an addiction to alcohol for the last four or five years. Picked it up after letting myself get used sexually several times because I stupidly used it as a coping method. When I'm doing ok, I do good. Went a month or so without drinking, I think. Relapsed bad a few weeks ago, and I've ended up drinking since then, more then a few times. And as of tonight, I've ended up drinking spirits straight from the bottle, for the second time in a month. I hate it, its a weakness i can't control. 

The other thing I hate, that I've also picked up because of those events, is hypersexuality. It can make ever day life near impossible at the worst times, and has driven me to points that I'm not proud of, and led me to nearly repeating the events that lead up to what happened. More then once. When it reaches its worst, I'd be quite happy to let a random stranger do whatever they want to me. Nearly have more then once. "

I love drawing and being creative, and my parents have always been very supportive of that fact ever since I was young. They convinced me to go to art school, which is how I ended up studying architecture. A few months ago I told them I wanted to switch to optometry/eye care, because eyes have been a long time interest of mine and it genuinely feels like something I wanted to pursue. They said they respected my decision and told me I could study whatever I wanted, but I can see they still aren‚Äôt convinced.

So whenever my dad sees me drawing now, he just kind of sighs and goes, ‚ÄúWhat a shame you‚Äôre not going to draw anymore.‚Äù And I‚Äôm like?? I can still draw without majoring in it, hobbies and side hustles exist. It‚Äôs like they think I‚Äôd be throwing away my potential if I don‚Äôt turn art into a full-time career.

Just need to rattle off a few things. I'm honestly so tired of political stuff‚Äîit's exhausting. Feels like trying to keep up with the Kardashians. For the record, I lean right, but not far right. My views align more closely with the Veterans Party (if you dont know what they are looking them up, it takes the best ideas from both sides). What really bothers me is how misinformed both sides can be. Personally, I do research on top of research before forming my own opinion‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want to be misinformed. Maybe that‚Äôs what‚Äôs so exhausting for me. It‚Äôs draining when people twist my words, take things out of context, or start calling me names just because I share a different perspective.
For example, both sides put up stickers and deface government property. All I said was that it‚Äôs tasteless no matter who does it, and I got ridiculed by people on the left for simply calling it out fairly.
Another thing that bothers me is some of the behavior I see from Christians‚Äîor at least those who call themselves Christians. Whether it‚Äôs ignorance or hypocrisy, it‚Äôs frustrating to see beliefs misrepresented that way. I attended a conference this weekend, and yes, it did cost money‚Äîaround $55 for Friday night and all day Saturday. I don‚Äôt blame them at all; it takes money to put events like this together. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre paying to get saved.
But there was this gentleman online criticizing the two men who spoke at the conference‚Äîboth of whom, I assure you, are men of God. His issue was with the fact that the event cost money. I‚Äôve attended plenty of Sunday services where these same men preached for free, but because this was a two-day event with a price tag, people like him flip out. Now me and the gentleman has had somewhat similar experiences on a spiritual level but just because a YouTube video told him to be upset about these two man he was it wasn't his own opinion. I'm not looking for validation on my thoughts just needed to rant. "

And when people come at me or challenge me, I don‚Äôt snap back. I freeze. I go passive. I shut down and let it slide, then stew about it for hours afterward. There‚Äôs no confidence in that. Just avoidance.

Perfectionism runs my entire personality. It makes me stiff, anxious, annoying to be around ‚Äî even for myself. Every conversation, every task, every tiny thing turns into something that has to be optimized or controlled. It‚Äôs a fucking nightmare.

These women are creating work that they want to put out there and/or sell. These are adult women who are capable of making their own decisions. If they are trying to appeal to men, who gives a fuck?

695,1,"Im going to give some context before I start this vent. I have been overweight for the majority of my life until very recently when I lost 15kg. I am now healthy, and fairly in shape and athletic. I feel and look the best I have ever but something still tells me that I am not good enough. I had people tell I was fat and that I needed to lose weight countless times and that wasn‚Äôt untrue but I am a very sensitive person and those kind of comments really left a pain in me forever. 

Now that I lost the weight everybody tells me that I look great, that I don‚Äôt need to lose anymore weight or I will start to look weird which is comforting since losing the 15kg was hard enough and I just want to maintain my weight now. I receive a lot of compliments both in my socials and in person. Every time I see someone that I haven‚Äôt seen in a long time they all tell me that I look very beautiful and healthy and it feels good but my mind doesn‚Äôt believe it.

I have posted here on fitness communities about my weight loss journey and got about 400 hundred comments and dm's in total, all saying the same: I look good and me and my body are attractive.

So why is it that I don‚Äôt believe it? Everyone tells me the same thing even people that I don‚Äôt know, could they all be lying? 

I know that I have a very low self esteem and that‚Äôs probably why I don‚Äôt believe any of these people. In my head everyone is lying and I just want to say fuck it you know? Even if I am not good looking I just want to have a very good self esteem, just be confident and don‚Äôt think too much about my appearance because it‚Äôs frustrating and is really annoying to be like this bc people this I‚Äôm fishing for compliments and it‚Äôs understandable that they think that way.

Anyways if anyone has any tips about improving self esteem and just be confident over all I would appreciate it."
696,1,"Just a little bit of context-- My father(fakename: Randy) dated a woman(Marie) with a kid from a prior relationship(Emily), and they had a kid together too (Sam). And before all of that was me (Spy).

Marie and Randy did not work out. The breakup was messy, there were allegations of cheating, Emily effectively lost her second father, Sam had no idea what was going on, and each side wanted me to primarily blame the other. Marie got into another relationship before the last one's body was even cold, and together they ended up often trying to gang up on my father to try and bully him into agreeing with whatever they said without any input from him. At one point they even filed a false police report for attempted vehicular assault (sidenote: ever so surprisingly that relationship ended up crashing and burning too and now Marie is single again)

All this is relevant because today, I just found out that Marie had apparently offered my Father four tickets to a theme park. So he took her to go enjoy the day. For Father's Day. With Emily. And with Marie, who once tried to have him falsely arrested for attempted vehicular assault. But not me. 

I keep telling myself to stop expecting him to think of me, or notice that I'm upset. Stop thinking or even hoping Dad will care, you're an adult now and that means you're expected to be over the childish things and handle your emotions on your own. And besides that, Emily saw him as a father for six years (little over half her life at this point), and Sam of course loves her Daddy. They still have nothing but the blind adoration for him that is reserved for parents, without pesky things like greyrocking when he starts talking about chem trails, bitcoin, or political correctness. But I guess it just never stops hurting when they find new ways to remind you that you just aren't a blip on their radar anymore."

3. People are constantly coming up to me telling me I could do better. Like I know I can but why is everyone being so rude about it? 

4. I‚Äôm just sad. Why do my parents not like anyone for me to get married to? I just want to start living without their interference.

WE DO NOT OWE YOU SEX. EVER. 

Idgaf who she fucked before you. If you says no to your dick in her pussy before marriage but will suck you off, maybe she's worried about you ghosting her when/if you knock her up. She'#s willing to give you oral sex, just not the kind you want to demand from her. 

Keep your dick in your pants until you are mature enough to realize NOBODY OWES YOU SEX. 

Watch them find this & downvote me into deleting it because I don't deserve double digit downvotes for common sense shit men don't like hearing.

and then she cheated on me and hit me with an onslaught of verbal and emotional abuse (and physical)

 and i know i need to take time to heal. i know i need to be happy by mysel. but theres nothing i miss more than falling asleep holding someone in my arms, or walking hand in hand through a trail while listening to your favorite music

Didn‚Äôt think much whatever not sure why he did but we never interacted online. Maybe bc of his gf idk. But in December, he found my tiktok which idk how but I do post some content so maybe my account happened to be on his fyp. He did follow me for a bit but also asked if we could text through his number and I told him to keep texting on TikTok bc i was thinking oh this wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere bc people from high school suck and I could care less about them.

My bf didn‚Äôt like how I randomly accepted someone back into my life but I didn‚Äôt really think it was like that since I figured nothing is gonna happen as in me and that guy reconnecting fully. I honestly don‚Äôt think that guy‚Äôs gf would like the fact that he called a woman fat twice and called her a bitch. I rather not make a whole mess by messaging either one especially the gf. I‚Äôm over here thinking you‚Äôre over here stalking my tiktok account after we messaged and now you‚Äôre calling me fat and a bitch like okay cool ig good morning to you too lol. My friends thought it was a weird thing for him to say but I personally don‚Äôt care bc if anything I had to deal with even worse things than just being called fat and a bitch that‚Äôs literally old news to me since I had to hear that from my own dad (who is now in no contact+had to pepper spray him when I moved out). But anyways i dont take loser insults from people who looks like an ugly mole rat with pencil stroked mustache. Next time if he ever wants to insult me come back with a better haircut even. I don‚Äôt even understand how your gf can actually stand you with the way you‚Äôre insulting other women rn especially if they‚Äôre doing absolutely nothing but look pretty and have a pretty personality.

703,1,"I‚Äôm literally never telling a man about my first boyfriend who physically abused me ever again.

No. They both slowly started treating me bad after that. It like a permission slip to treat me like trash.

I do my best to help him in with his business and by working there to help relieve stress while I‚Äôm back home for the summer. It‚Äôs the only way I know how to bond with him that doesn‚Äôt end up with him being upset or angry for one reason or the other . I have been subject to the silent treatment by both my parents for the past 2 weeks for ‚Äústanding up for myself‚Äù (crying and asking why they didn‚Äôt like me) while being yelled at. They have been lying to family members at events I was also, practically, ostracized from and call me dramatic making it seem like I hate being around my family. It‚Äôs been like this since I was a child. Sometimes I believe I think too harshly of my family but then I come back and I realize why I left in the first place. It feels my parents think I‚Äôm crazy, I don‚Äôt understand. I have tried everything throughout my life to make them happy but it seems like I am always wrong or ‚Äúrude.‚Äù My brother is confused by how they treat me as well It just drives me to tears knowing that I have something wrong with me that just pisses my mom and dad off for no reason."
705,1,"Recently I visited a friend. We sat on the couch and leaned onto each other and cuddled for a bit. At some point they touched some scars that I have, and it was quite uncomfortable for me, since I have nerve damage in those spots (pain, tingling sensations). I wanted to ask them to stop, but I physically couldn't get myself to. Then I kind of realised I didn't even like the cuddling, I was just doing it to make them happy. 

Somehow I feel like if I actually ask for anything, or set up a boundary, it's too much? I know realistically a good friend won't mind, but I constantly feel like I take up too much space. 

I never complain either, because I'm aware this is entirely my own fault; I only present others with this very distorted, perfectly molded version of myself, that takes up as few space as possible. I don't want to disturb anyone, don't want to cause more trouble than it's worth. I feel weird, all of this is making me very sad. :("

The last thing i want is to make someone listen to me when they don't want to. But what I hate about myself is that after a little while I will forget and try again! Make some comment about the reel I just watched, for the 3rd or 4th time in a row, before I notice they aren't even hearing anything i am saying. So then the embarrassment and shame doubles, and I withdraw back into myself until I forget again. I hate being in my own head. I wish someone else could be in here, just so I could ask if it sucks this bad for everyone or if it's just me. Also like I don't know if this is just being too self-aware, anxiety, both, or something else. I feel like I am always inconveniencing everyone in my life. "

For a little background, I have been sexually assaulted countless times, unfortunately its not uncommon in girls. I have also been groomed for 4 years when i was 13 years old.
The whole situation was extremely traumatic and i still get nightmares and have had a fucked up mental health. 

Coming to the present, my boyfriend and i are in a long distance relationship for two months and we used to practically live together so its hard. Communication, intimacy and just hanging out had significantly taken a hit given the polar opposite time difference. 

As expected, we've been having a few arguments here and there and i have always had extreme insecurity. He is not someone who would write me paragraphs to reassure me or any such grand gestures but today, after an argument i felt like i had disappointed him. i couldnt stop tearing up. (bear in mind this is all happening over text) 

this man sensed that i am not okay so he left all his ego aside even though it was my fault and made attempts to try to get me to talk about my feelings. he made me feel so safe and secure and comforted me. he babied me till i admitted ""i feel like im disappointing you.""

it was 4 in the morning, he had work tomorrow but still he called me and we had an open and honest conversation and he made me smile and laugh. i get butterflies looking at him and he is truly my safe space. we sorted our argument and turns out we were acting up only because we missed each other and couldn't express it. 

we kept the call, he went to sleep and then i texted him a little paragraph on how much i value him being patient with me and apologized for keeping him up the whole night. and guys, guess what he texted me back.

""baby, i want to make this work. i love you so much. i can sit here another whole night and give you reassurance. i can't wait to marry you and live together so i can comfort you when you feel overwhelmed.""

The issue isn‚Äôt even the chat itself, it‚Äôs the name of it. The group chat was called something like ‚ÄúPussy Destroyers.‚Äù It was meant as a dumb joke between us, nothing serious. But she took that and used it to paint us as total perverts.

720,1,"
I'm just gonna preface this by saying I don't consider myself depressed, in some ways my life has been looking up, but I still can't help but feel like a big failure. 

Arguably most importantly,  I am a university student and my academic performance is abysmal. I mean like I have failed at least one class every semester, I've failed multiple in some of them, I am genuinely at risk of being expelled I'm pretty sure. It's not like I didn't try either, In my most recent semester at least I put in lots of work and effort and still failed. Ive been on academic probation for a while. 

I was never bad in school so this is shocking, but I was never GOOD in school either. People who know me may say you got into a relatively prestigious college, you have accomplished something. But I disagree. My gpa was incredibly average (about 3.3) with barely any extra curriculars, the only reason I got in i think is because I was in a prestigious private school so I was probably looked upon more favourably. Even when I was a small child I was put into learning support because I wasn't good enough. 

If we look at other things people who know me would say I've ""accomplished"" they are essentially participation trophies. I played instruments for a very long time, both private lessons and the school band. I was never exceptional at this. Every big opportunity that band had I was passed up on, every time we had a concert I was given small parts even when I was the most senior member. 

My parents clearly do not think very highly of me. Obviously they are my parents and will always love me, but I can just tell they think I'm mediocre. Especially recently we have been arguing a lot. My friends also clearly do not think highly of me either, at least my school ones. They clearly think of me as some big joke, which I think is unreasonable.  I pretended to be the ""class clown"" In like middle school but haven't been like that for years. Both my friends and parents clearly think im stupid, when I told them about how i wanted to do a difficult degree all my friends looked shocked. My parents kept trying to convince me to do something else. 

The worst part about all of this is that I can't just act like people are hating on me for no reason, a lot of this is justified. My parents have the right to not think highly of me as I've wasted lots of their money failing classes, so they are justified in criticising me. Although I feel like my band teacher was a bad teacher and mistreated me, I can't argue with the fact that others were better than me. I genuinely feel like I'm lazy, I struggle to get out of bed and to put my mind to things

As I've said I've never done anything of note but I've also never achieved anything myself. I've never had a job or worked for anything despite having resources available to me, so most people would say I've had every opportunity to succeed, yet still fuck everything up.

Im 20 years old and ive basically done nothing my whole life, ive done nothing impressive, i haven't even mastered or gotten good at a skill, ive basically wasted my whole life already 

 Some of the things I've gotten into more recently you can argue are signs of hope, but i still feel incredibly mediocre. Last year I let myself go and gained weight. I've been on a diet and exercise routine since then and I still have an incredibly mid physique. 

Somewhat relating to this I've never had a girlfriend. I am incredibly insecure about my face and body and I find it hard to believe someone will love me or think I'm an attractive. 

I've also gotten into training martial arts, as opposed to band which I joined and just stayed even when I started hating it. I actually am passionate about this. Yet although I want to get good, it seems like everyone involved started when they were like small kids and I'll never be all that good compared to them. 

So I feel like I've never done anything important and I will have never done anything important or be successful. At this point just trying to not fail college is my priority, I think I won't even be able to get a decent gpa anymore. And I've never accomplished or done anything. And most of the bad things people say or think about me, is true

It's hard to keep going when you aren't good at anything and feel like a flop "
721,3,"Hmm hmmmmmm Cantar me ayuda a expresar mis emociones. Dibujar me ayuda a tranquilizarme  y estar bajo control. Y escribir para no olvidar y ser m√°s consciente de mi situaci√≥n.

Pero he hecho las √∫ltimas dos tanto... Quiz√°s por eso √∫ltimamente tengo la necesidad constante de cantar todo el tiempo.

Antes, cuando sent√≠a mucho odio hacia mi misma, me autolesionaba con un c√∫ter (me lo ense√±√≥ las redes sociales y la televisi√≥n) pero no me dur√≥ mucho, soy muy sensible as√≠ que el dolor fue demasiado. No lo pude soportar. Hmmtararara.

Ahora, estoy optando por golpearme con los pu√±os, puedo medir la intensidad y no deja cicatrices, con lo cual, es mucho mejor.

De todos modos cuando tuve una cicatriz grande en el brazo solo se enojaron conmigo, sobretodo mi hermana. Siempre se enoja conmigo cuando hago algo que no le gusta.




En mi casa, todos son muy impacientes. Bueno, tambi√©n vivo con mis abuelos, pero ellos se separan de lo que sucede en mi familia de cuatro. Incluso cuando son padres de mi padre, ni siquiera se llevan muy bien con √©l, as√≠ que tiene sentido que no se involucren.


Pero lo detesto.





Y bueno, creen que la violencia es la manera de actuar ante la rebeld√≠a. No son nada introspectivos! Uno creer√≠a que todos entendemos que la violencia no se arregla con m√°s violencia; pero no es as√≠, muchos todav√≠a creen firmemente que subyugar al resto es la mejor manera de mantenerse en la sociedad.

Tengo un coraz√≥n muy blando, todo me afecta. Por un tiempo intent√© ser insensible, y me funcion√≥. Peor ahora he vuelto a ser la misma de siempre. Y mi hermana me dijo que era insensible, le cre√≠; pero creo que es porque siempre que discutimos, mientras yo ignoraba lo que suced√≠a, ella se sent√≠a aislada y frustrada. Claro, yo en esas ocasiones siempre me separaba de la situaci√≥n, as√≠ que nunca fui consciente. 

Es f√°cil mal entenderme, incluso yo no entiendo mucho de m√≠. Pero poco a poco descubr√≠ cosas. ¬°Como lo que mencion√© de cantar! Hace mucho que no me met√≠a a una actividad donde realmente no siento presi√≥n. Me fascina.

Todo lo dem√°s, es imposible para m√≠.

Estoy estancada. Y habl√© de esto antes, peor no puedo volver a hacerlo. Me olvido de las cosas con facilidad, incluso ahora que creo que estoy m√°s calmada, me est√° entrando sue√±o. Seguro deber√≠a hacer eso, dormir. Ma√±ana seguramente ser√° igual que hoy.


Recomiendo las canciones de Ichiko Aoba, me gustar√≠a interpretar su obra m√°s a menudo; pero √∫ltimamente cuando canto me invento mis propias letras y ritmos, al finald el d√≠a eso es expresarse, no? Lloro cada vez."
722,2,"im not an angry or emotional person in the slightest and I've never cut someone off before, but this person (an ex friend) makes me so mad even imagining her face makes me irrationally angry.

she yelled at me outside of a pub and made me cry in front of a bunch of people outside a pub because i ""wasn't hanging out with her enough"". she called me at 3 am two days later and asked me to travel 40 minutes to spend the night in her room because she was high (we're at uni and she has neighbours she's friends with and could call and she knows my parents track my location and wouldn't want me staying over at another persons room). when i said i was uncomfortable and didn't want to she proceeds to spend 20 minutes guilt tripping me an calling me a bad person for not wanting to (I'm also a woman and just don't want to travel that far at night)

When I'm stressed with personal circumstances and focusing on my work and missed ONE (1) hangout with our friendgroup and said no to having lunch with her she called me and again denigrated me for staying in my room and when i said sorry I'm just busy with work she invited herself to my room to work with me and again when i said no i need to be alone right now she proceeded to continue to guilt trip me and say ""I'm having nightmares that you don't like me"". bearing in mind i had taken time out to see her 3 times the week before

The worst thing she did was dragging and pressuring me into going to a club and ignored me saying no when i had been drinking which lead to a very serious argument with my then boyfriend and the worst month of my life and our eventual break up.

I don't know whether i have a right to hate her. i admit that i still agreed to go to the club even though i was pressured into drinking and clubbing I'm still the pushover who said yes. i also had hung out with her a decent amount this term so maybe she saw our friendship as being closer than it was, but when i imagine her face it fills me with a hot rage

when i even think about her it makes me so angry i feel like almost crying, even tho when i write this all on paper what shes done to me doesn't seem particularly bad so i don't think or know if my anger is warranted. i blocked her everywhere and thankfully ill never have to see her again because my mutual friends also don't like her, but despite going no contact i still feel such a hot deep rage when i think about her."
723,2,"I wish I had just kept to myself, not talked to anyone, and gone home.

I specifically befriended a group of girls when I first started, and they seemed chill at first. They're not necessarily bad people, but the more I got to lnow them the more I realised how poor their views are.

The amount of borderline classist and ableist shit I've heard come out of their mouths are astonishing. It started out because we had similar interests like fashion and stuff. But I started to realised that a huge chunk of their personalities are centred around toxic dieting, grasping onto looking young, and gossiping about other people.

What really did it for me the other day was when I walked up to greet them the other day. And they were in the middle of a conversation about a girl one of them knows. They were making fun of the videos the girl has been posting on instagram of her dancing (she had just started learning a year ago). 

I've been trying to set some distance, but it's so hard to when it's such a small office and they have a huge presence. I'm also honestly kind of terrified of what they'll say about me once they realise I'm trying to steer clear of them."

No tengo el valor de morir pero. Es que. Quer√≠a. Dios. JAJA me duele la cabeza ahora no se. No puedo dormir. Estoy llorando. No puedo m√°s. Estoy cansada. Estoy estancada.

725,1,"A few minutes ago, I ended something that wasn‚Äôt even official, but it felt real to me.

I‚Äôve been talking to this guy on Kik for quite a while. Let‚Äôs call him Claus, from Croatia. We had this on-and-off kind of friendship. Sometimes we‚Äôd flirt and talk about naughty stuff, which made me not take him too seriously back then.

Then one day, he told me he wanted to change. He deleted Kik and asked for my Snapchat instead. I was surprised, but I gave it. From then on, our conversations shifted. He started asking about where I‚Äôm from (even searched to figure it out because I never told him lol). We ended up talking more about our cultures, food, life‚Äîreal stuff. And I realized I actually enjoyed those convos more than the flirty ones.

He really did change‚Ä¶ and so did I.

What made it feel even more special was when I learned he only added three people on SC: a male friend he mostly talks to about football, a girl he says is funny, and me. He called me a ‚Äúsmart friend.‚Äù And I won‚Äôt lie‚Ä¶ I felt a little jealous. I wanted to be the funny one too. He‚Äôs genuinely funny, and I always tried to make jokes with him. But I guess to him, I was the smart one.

Truth is, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm smart. I just acted and talked smart because he was smart. He liked geography, random trivia, and would search things just because he was curious. I wanted to keep up with him. Be on his level. Maybe impress him a bit.

And over time, I caught feelings. I looked forward to his messages. I wanted to talk for hours. Even though I‚Äôm not usually the type to open up so easily, something about him made me want to try.

Then came today. I had my period, and my emotions were everywhere. We were chatting like usual, and he said he wanted to sleep‚Äîbut I took it the wrong way. I lashed out, and before I knew it, we got into a stupid fight. I apologized a few hours later, and we talked. But inside, I knew something had shifted. I knew I was falling deeper. And I knew it might destroy me‚Ä¶ or him.

So I did what I always do when I‚Äôm scared‚ÄîI pushed him away.

I told him it was nice meeting him. He asked, ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre going to stop talking?‚Äù
I replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not feeling it, but thanks for everything tho.‚Äù
Cold. Distant. But necessary.
I asked him to block me‚Äîto make it final. He was shocked and asked if I was serious. I said yes.

Deep down‚Ä¶ I was hoping he‚Äôd stop me. But he didn‚Äôt. And now I can no longer see his name in SC. Just like that, he was gone.

I cried. A lot.
But at the same time, I felt relieved. Because I knew if I let this continue, my fear of getting hurt might make me hurt him instead.

What we lacked was communication. I never told him I loved him. I don‚Äôt even know if he liked me that way, and I didn‚Äôt want to assume. But I know how I felt. And I‚Äôm sorry I was too scared to be honest about it.

I‚Äôm sorry, Claus.

I hope you're doing well over there.
Thank you for showing me kindness, effort, and growth.
This will be my lesson‚Äîto speak better, love better, and not run away next time.

Lately, I‚Äôve been wondering if my issues with love and emotional intimacy are something deeper. I‚Äôve heard of terms like aromantic or arochromatic (is that the word?), and I‚Äôm not sure where I fall‚Äîbut I do know this: I push people away the moment I feel too much. I crave love but also fear it. It‚Äôs like I want connection but can‚Äôt trust myself to hold onto it.

726,3,"I struggled for weeks in making my FIL a card, as he has terminal cancer. On the way over my partner and I argued, something stupid.

727,3,"I (25F) recently flew to India from the US to meet my boyfriend‚Äôs parents for the first time. In Indian culture, that‚Äôs a big step ‚Äî it‚Äôs basically the beginning of formal approval for marriage. I was nervous but excited, and I wanted to make a good impression.

Instead, my mother went behind my back and badmouthed me to my boyfriend‚Äôs mother. She told her I had gained weight from eating out all the time, that I never cook, that I‚Äôm short-tempered and don‚Äôt listen. She even asked her to please tell me to lose weight ‚Äî as if I‚Äôm some project to be fixed. I only found out because my boyfriend gently told me what happened, and I was devastated.

I tried to confront my mom about it calmly ‚Äî and she slapped me. Multiple times. In front of my dad. No remorse, just rage. I honestly haven‚Äôt been able to process that part yet.

Then, to make it worse, she called my older brother (who lives in the US, like I do), and told him her version of the story. He then called my dad and started judging me ‚Äî saying things like ‚ÄúHow will she behave with in-laws in the future?‚Äù

My brother hasn‚Äôt been present in my life. He hasn‚Äôt seen the emotional damage, the cultural pressure, or how much I‚Äôve protected this relationship from the toxicity. And now he suddenly thinks he has the right to weigh in and pass judgment?"

729,1,"So dont know if I am just plain childish for bringing this up. but it has been bothering me for a long time.

For context I live in a group home and the only outdoor activities i have are with people from said home.

Now I have a brother and uncle who hang out with each other on a regular basis. And I myself have repeatdly told them that I feel left out and genuinely wanted to spend time with them. Since my other uncle with whom I was really close died.



Fast forward to a few weeks ago my uncles son my cousin turned 18. I ask my uncle if its ok if I swung by to celebrate him. He told me to ask his wife wich I do. She tells me that weekend has allready been organised but you are free to celebrate him some other time if you want. So I didnt go to his birthday party. I then asked my brother if he and his girlfriend went there .wich they did.


But my brother said that they werent invited. Something I thought sounded weird .so I asked my uncle if they had invited them which they had. I tell him that I recieved a no when I asked if I could  . He respond isnt it up to donald [fake name] to invite who he wants ?. You never invite him when you do stuff.  Am I being childish for feeling by the situation ?.  For ofc my uncle is right about his son inviting who he wants. Sorry for any spelling errors English isnt my native languace."

But I feel like once I became honest about how I felt of our relationship, I felt like I brought feelings of anxiousness into our friendship. Both of us want to keep being friends so we have hard conversations, but is it the right way? Would she be better if I wasn‚Äôt her friend? Would I be better if she wasn‚Äôt my friend. Is it still fine to have open conversations about our friendship? I even get anxious if she vents about me to her boyfriend who knows her less years than I do. I guess her boyfriend can support her through that but‚Ä¶I‚Äôd hate to know if it‚Äôs true. My heart keeps being evil.

It started suddenly on Wednesday after a walk. I‚Äôve tried everything: warm teas, honey (which actually burns), painkillers, throat sprays, soups, humidifiers‚Ä¶ I even went to the doctor *twice*. Both times they said it‚Äôs viral and I just have to wait it out. The pain is not going away!

I‚Äôve been doing all I can: eating protein, drinking tons of fluids, alternating paracetamol and ibuprofen safely. I even tried weird stuff like colloidal silver, castor oil on my neck, and ivermectin ‚Äî because my mom swears by it. Turns out it was from China and probably not even meant for humans, so now I feel even worse about that.

Right now, I‚Äôm just exhausted. I keep thinking about how much effort I‚Äôve put into this final moment. I feel hopeless, I don't know how much longer I'll be sick and in pain, because this is the last thing I want to be.
