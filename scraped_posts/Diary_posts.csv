1,"2025 May 6: Dear Diary,

Barnes and Noble is my favourite store. Being surrounded by great works of literature does wonders for my soul. Truly, I can feel my vibrations rise whenever I set foot into the store. I am not usually one to like corporations or materialism and libraries are definitely better, but I still do like walking around Barnes and Noble.  
  
Today I walked into Barnes and Noble to see if they had a copy of Albert Camus’ “Caligula” which they sadly did not. Despite not having the play I wanted to read it was still nice looking around at books that interest me. Admittedly I do buy more books than I read. I should absolutely read the books in my collection which I have not before buying more. The fear of missing out hits me though when I see one copy of a book I am very interested in. If Barnes and Noble does not have what I am looking for, Thrift Books would usually be my next choice.  
  
Although I did not buy any books today, I did go to the café. I had a caprese sandwich, a chocolate cheesecake, and a caffè mocha. This was the first time I had ever had a caffè mocha and I liked it a lot. Looking around and seeing the other people in the café was nice as well. I usually do not like the presence of other people and either get very overwhelmed or annoyed, but in Barnes and Noble I do not tend to have that problem. It is nice to like the presence of people rather than loath it. Truly I know there is a part of me that loves humanity. My hope is that reading becomes more popular. I still need to read more myself.

2,"Returned the clothes from stitch fix today 200$, went to the bank and had help with my insurance dispute from three lovely ladies, and went boxing.

With business concluded for the day I took a lime down to waterside to sit and enjoy the weather. 

One of the few times I feel old makes me feel connected to people in the past and future. Just ambient noise, a strong breeze, shade, and plenty of water. I’m going to leave it here I want to just enjoy this moment right now instead of writing.

3,"My friend had some family disputes, which ultimately became her brother's reason for recalling his loan.

Since my friend hasn't found a job yet, she came to me to borrow money. I'm not in a great financial situation either, so I only lent her a little bit.

However, I'm going to consider this money spent. It's one of my ways to stay positive and also prevents me from becoming a bothersome person who constantly asks for favors."
4,"I seen my oldest son tonight. I can't recall the last time I've seen him it's a horrible thing to say actually out loud. 
I cried I cried so hard and hug him so tight! my heart feels so good and it hasn't felt like that life that beat for a while I didn't realize something was missing there.
Did I mention, I hugged my son tonight! He is working a good job making good money and he's been there for almost a year I'm so proud of him. He is making changes and I couldn't be more proud.  I know I got a ways to go but I will bounce back from this. And it feels good to feel safe and secure with forgiveness with my family. I'm all up in my feelings this evening. 
Now I wAit patiently for when my other two kids want to include me in their life. (I'm not a horrible mom my children are adults unfortunately got pulled into a situations couple weeks back but yeah I just wanted to clarify that) we all need time.
I felt a tad relief with knowing that progress is coming. 
Thanks for letting me spill out

5,"I decided to try to become a pstar. Yes it sounds very stupid, but it has always been my childhood dream and why not. 

I’m a high school dropout who was working as a simple kitchen worker with no degree. I have no risk so who cares.

I live in Japan and moved to Tokyo. Then I found some amateur actresses and shot some videoes with them. And then I did something extremely stupid and now I’m way over my head.

Marketing. I used to be a stupid dishwasher kitchen worker. I didn’t know marketing was a thing and how important it is.

So I spent all of my life savings (I’m 24 so not a lot) on paying the actresses and now I have three videoes I don’t know what to do with.

But that’s not all. What’s worse is what is about to come. I’m on my way right now on a train from my countryside home in Yokohama all the way to the big city of Shinjuku. Because I thought it was a good idea to dm this big p-star actress with 80 k followers and pretend like I was a big shot. And now I’m losing my shit on the train because I know she is going to sense that I am full of it.

Wish me luck.

6,"After one issue after another at the end of the day i have been able to organize and complete all of the tasks i could possibly do today. It’s unfortunate that this hustle only incurred after hearing about an unexpected 900$ on top of my car loan but then having my insurance also being raised to 271 a month due to having to get comprehensive and collateral for my banks insurance. 

Besides the car business I’m glad that I was able to get my dental appt moved up to this week instead of at the end of the month and I ate relatively good today. I stuck with my breakfast, packed lunch, and only bought a slice of pizza at the end of day. 

The only two things I am disappointed in was that I forgot to take my medication and I opened my mail box today to see more bills. Atleast they’re spread out but sheesh I’m blessed that I can take care of everything by myself. With all of the changes i still don’t feel differently about how these next few months will go. Fun and a lot busier! Add being tight to the list and we’ve got a recipe for discipline!

9,"Dear diary, today I was so boring, I went to job hunting as usual but forgot that today is Monday. There is no job posting on Sunday. So I started watching drama, the resident playbook, but I couldn't finish it so I started learning Japanese. Learnt a lot of new words and seems like I'm getting quite forgetful now as I cannot really remember the new words I learnt. Gonna practice more. Then started reading the book I just started, it was so boring and I couldn't concentrate to read tho my mind just keep thinking of the girl I texted in the morning. And she didn't reply until just now at night only reply. She is just someone who doesn't reply at work huh just like me last time. Then, at night I play badminton with my cousin. I lost almost all game and won just 1. Indeed, they are still better than me. Gotta do better for my badminton! "
10,"2025 May 5: Dear Diary,

I think I should renegotiate my hours at my job. I probably will not today, but most likely the next day I work. Last night I got out of work at 11:30 because it was a special day where I was among the people who needed to count the products when the store was closed. That was fine in itself, but I was also taking a lot of caffeine in order to keep focus and when I woke up this morning I had back pain.  
  
Usually I get out of work at 9:30 or 10:30, but I do not think I should work past 8:30. I really want to get back to a time where I am in bed by 10:00. About a week ago, I went to sleep before midnight. That is the first time this has happened in what has to be five years. I tend to go to sleep an hour after midnight and I think that may be bad for my health. This year will be a year I treat myself first and do what is best for me. Going to bed early might be a thing I need to start doing again.

11,"What really guides me. The choices I make, are they really mine? If I was this or if I was that, would my beliefs really be the same? Do I choose my morals and ethics because of my limitations or in spite of them? Is it because I'm pathetic? If I was as perfect as I dream would I really be such a good person. It's really a question that haunts me. Am I a good person? Who am I to say I am? Why does the world seem so full of life but so empty in my eyes. I try to grasp at society but like water it just flows through my hand leaving me empty. I feel as though I'm just an observer my words don't reach and and I am not seen. What don't I understand. Is reality real? Am I dreaming? Can I wake up? Is there anyone who can see me who would want to? Can I see myself anymore? It's been a long day. I'll try to sleep now. Reality won't wait for me to wake up."
12,"Nostalgia....



A feeling that I would never understand.



Sheer intensity, sheer vagueness—



are those memories or imagination?



Did I feel the same,



or am I just exaggerating?



As for the color:


a greyish purple—


hidden,


mysterious,


yet sweet,


like a name that I forgot


but always at the tip of my tongue.





A ghost of existence,


haunting your thoughts—


is it a legend or a reality?


No one knows.

14,I broke sobriety last night. In doing so I breached a wall that I must have been standing in front of metaphorically speaking. Life is about to get a lot busier and more rewarding. And I’m going to look and feel better than before. 
15,"I’m overthinking again

Am I being too much again?

So, I’ve got this “penpal” I met about two weeks ago. And honestly? I’ve been really enjoying our exchanges. We have this ongoing letter we call our “little book”—and it’s long. Like, *really* long. We even divide it into chapters now. Every time we write back, we somehow manage to make it longer than before. We both just keep rambling into each topic, and I love it. I’m genuinely enjoying it.

On top of the “little book,” we also have these casual chats that somehow spiral into full-on letters too. It’s funny—what starts as a simple question turns into an essay. Like he said, we both seem incapable of keeping things short. We’re both just natural-born palaverers.

But of course... I’m starting to overthink again. A pattern I know all too well—God forbid I actually start enjoying something.

What triggered it this time was while I was working on a reply to his “little book.” His last letter was 9,294 words. Mine so far is at 7,303—and I’m not even halfway through responding to his. On top of *that*, our casual convo also blew up into this chunky wall of text. Not something you can respond to in a minute or two—more like you’ll need a solid 30 minutes of quiet time to tackle it.

And now I feel bad. I feel like I might be too much. Again.

Like... what if I’m overwhelming him? What if he’s just being polite by matching my energy? But then again—ugh—I know how much effort it takes to write that kind of letter. That’s not “just being polite.” If he wasn’t into it, he could just ghost me. Or reply half-heartedly. Or stop altogether.

Still, I spiral.

Why can’t I just enjoy a good thing while it’s happening? Why do I always overthink and ruin it for myself? The worst part about overthinking is you think you’re keeping it to yourself. You tell yourself you’re not burdening anyone. But it bleeds out. The energy shifts. It shows up in other ways, even if you’re not saying it out loud.

Fuck. I hate this. I hate spiraling like this.

Anyway, I’m just writing this journal to let off some steam. I *am* still going to finish our “little book,” no matter what. Whether he responds or not, that’s okay. I still had fun writing it. It gave me a chance to practice my writing. It made me think. It was worth it. That’s still a win, I guess."
16,"Dear diary, I woke up at 6am and went for marathon training. When I reach ttdi park, it was under renovation omg... So I had no choice but to go Bukit Kiara that has many slopes. I tried to jog but its tough man... So in the end, most of time I just walk. It took me 1hr plus to finish 7km... 

I finished reading the book "" courage to be disliked "". There's a phrase, what is happiness? It says that happiness comes from able to make contributions to others but without seek recognition. I think partly is correct tho, sometimes we just need to contribute without any expectations and I felt happy. And 1 more thing it mentions that always learning also brings happiness. Keep improving oneself be it reading, or working, as long as you think the thing you did bring improvement to your future is also a happiness. 

I also finished watching a drama called welcome to samdalri. It was an okok drama that brings values. From the drama, it showed that people who take grudge and never forgive would only bring suffering to yourself and others. 人嘛，应该要看开一点，应该要 move on and be positive and brave to continue living. 

Then, I started a new book called deep work, omg this book is gonna be so hard, I only read the introduction but I just keep losing focus reading it although it reaches us how to focus on doing things hahahah 😂. 

Also I finally pm the girl that my ex colleague intro to me. Should I continue chatting with her or just 敷衍 her by reacting? I have no confidence to actually chase her or take interest in her because I haven't found a job yet!!! Damn... I wish I could land myself a job soon to gain back my confidence tho... So, what should I do? Continue take interest or perfunctory? "
17,"2025 May 4: Dear Diary,

On Charles Bukowski’s gravestone are the words “don’t try.” This is not necessarily about not making attempts, but rather not chasing anything. With it being Star Wars day this sentimentality also reminds me of Master Yoda’s quote, “do or do not, there is no try.” Going through my writing I can see clearly for myself how true this is.  
  
Whenever I try to write something good, it tends to come out in a way I do not like. I get so stressed about my work being perfect that I do not even try to attempt writing. This is a good reason why I should not “try” to write. When I just allow myself to write without caring about the end result, it typically comes out fine, if not good. Sometimes the writing does not make sense, but it is something that gets improved.  
  
I have been writing these entries more than working on my short stories probably because this is all just some experiment. I want to see how I feel if I make myself write everyday and put most of the entries out for the public to see. In this way I feel I am overcoming my fears of needing my writing to be perfect and being perceived by the public.  
  
I do not care all too much about these entries, but I do like them a lot. The more apathetic I am to my writing the better it ends up being. This paradox is mind-numbingly absurd, but nevertheless exists. Thankfully the more of these entries I post the more apathetic I grow to people interacting with them. Showing every part of my psyche, the good, bad, beautiful, and ugly to either be praised or criticised was once something I was too cowardly to do. Now, I feel taking the risk has paid off.  
  
The last thing I would ever want to be is boring. I know that if I care at all about how I am perceived, that is what will happen. Maybe these entries will help with my story writing or maybe they will not. What matters is that I complete this challenge and write without trying.  
  
Sincerely,  
  
Torinico"
18,"Dear Diary, 

Today has felt like a normal day so far, it is currently 21:26. I started off waking up at 9 something am yk the usual time on weekends. And I stayed on my phone for a few minutes until u got up and unplugged my charger and went to my room to drop my stuff off. I then went downstairs to eat the breakfast my Mom made, I had 1 egg some scrambled egg and fried rice, I of course the. added some salt, pepper, soy sauce and some parsely from my cupboard. I first put the scrambled egg and rice in the microwave and then the seasonings then my sunny side up egg, a funny yolk is the best yolk. I then went back upstairs after drinking some water. I entered my room and stood for 20 minutes so my food can digest quicker and then I sat down on my chair to play some games on my laptop, alone. I went on roblox first and watched some YouTube for a solid 2 hours I think, I was playing this game I've been obsessing overecentlt, Grow a garden, it's fun ig. After I decided to watch some pokemon On Netflix while I played my Minecraft survival world, I watched pokemon for atleast 4 hours or more I've started to watch it recently a few days ago and I'm in love, it gives me one piece vibes Ngl. I built an enderman farm, I died 2 times in the void which kinda sucks but it's okay. I stopped playing at 6 to take a shower. It was super duper cold like always, I don't normally take cold showers, my heater is just broken. After I took a shower I went downstairs and my dad asked me if I wanted to go to our usual take out place instead of ordering online, I said yea as it was just a few minutes walk, it walk aight ig we talked about camcorders and if he had one since I want to ask him if he could get me one or if my mom could get me one, I'm hoping to get a digital 8 camera from Sony, it's their VHS ones, it looks super cool and the quality of the camera makes it look like a forgotten memory ho early. I ordered a kebab with some fries and salad and my dad ordered chicken strips and bought 1/2 period period chicken for my mom to have breakfast tomorrow. We went back home and I started to eat my food it was quite nice, would I order again? maybe, maybe not I just wanted to try it. I the. had to take a dump for a solid 10 minutes and went back to the couch and after 20 minutes I had to take another one, it was even worse. Aside from that I went to the kitchen to drink some water. It was very refreshing. I had to vacuum but my dad said no because ""it was too late (as in the time) "" and I was supposed to do it yesterday but he said the same thing ughh. I want to feel productive I really do and right now I feel useless, not to spill some business but I think my sister smoke! I was looking into her bag cus I was looking for her camera to get some if my pictures and I just saw a pack of cigarettes in there, I just put it back and left it where I found it I didn't want her to know that someone looked into her bag. Also just found out my dad has diabetes when I found out I died a bit inside, I was looking through old photos on his phone and there in saw, Mr (my dad's last name) we believe from your symptoms that you have diabetes. It didn't say that exactly but it said something like that. He's had some money struggles lately since he's been paying for my sisters driving lessons and uni for my brothers so he's been struggling. I hate asking my parents for things, I just feel guilty, I've been trying to find a job that I could do but without my CV I can't I feel so useless. Useless useless useless.atleast ik doing well in school, my friend group sucks though. I mean they are nice people but I was dumb and stupid and racist . Thankfully I'm not anymore, I've learned that no matter what race or ethnicity you are , you are beautiful. Everyone is beautiful. I'm always reminded of that one song from Pocahontas. Anyways my friend group has a bunch of proud racists and homophobes, they are genuinely bae people, but I can't tell see them as bad people because once you talk to them normally they can be okay to talk to but their hatred from certain groups of people, I just can't out that aside, it's starting to piss me off I don't know what to do I've built a reputation for being nice and for giving but deep down I want to drop them but still want to talk to them normallyand the worst thing is is that they find that kind of stuff funny and complain when popular people do it but they are literally doing the same thing. There's nothing I hate more that hypocrites. Anyways aside from that after I was told no to vacuum I went upstairs angrily and decides that I want to start a diary. I've been listening to creep by Radiohead for the past 2 hours on repeat I love that song it never gets old for me. 

Peace out dudes it is currently 21:55."
19,"Listen, yes, you, the one sitting in silence, the one staring at the ceiling, the one aching with something they can’t quite name. The one scrolling through Reddit, itching to proclaim!

We are all writers.

You, me, them!

Whether by ink or by thought, by journal or by soul, we write. Every breath we take etches a sentence in the margins of existence. Every tear we cry becomes a stanza in the poem of being. Don’t you dare believe your words are too small. Don’t you dare.

You are a writer.

A freaking writer!

You don’t need a stage, a bestseller, or a stamp of approval from someone who forgot how to feel. You need truth. You need your heartbeat tapping a rhythm against your ribs telling you it’s time.

Time to write. Time to remember. Time to reach through the silent black and let someone hear you, see you through these glass walls.

So smile in the mirror. Smile for me, for you, for every soul who pens the invisible in silent view. 

Smile for the little guy behind the curtain, trembling, unable to press the post button.

Grab your keyboard, your paper, your breath.

Be the scribbles of unique you.

The void is not empty, it is listening.

Inspire! Teach! Reach!

Write! "

21,"**And just like that, after him, I reverted to that little girl again—**  
The girl I worked so hard to make proud.  
There I was once more:  
Vulnerable. Defeated.  
With those same overwhelming urges to disappear,  
To numb everything out,  
To simply *cease to be*.

But it wasn’t because of any act of cruelty.  
It was because the love I felt for him  
Was too great a loss to bear.

The idea of continuing a life after seeing color—  
After knowing love—  
Feels darker than the life that little girl once knew,  
Back when she had nothing at all."

But its also kinda nice to have four seasons you know, its a beautiful spring time here and I am totally enjoying it. Maybe I will shift the mindset to looking forward to spring instead of blaming myself for the deadness of winter🤦🏻‍♀️

Also, animal crossing sent me a message “whatever you think before bed is unlikely to have a solution until the next day”

 Why do these words exist separately? Translated into Japanese, both mean the same thing: ""further away.

 There are many English speakers on Reddit, but can any of them explain the difference between further and farther?

 By the way, I am Japanese. I am studying to speak English. I learn a little bit every day. It's fun.

Sovereignty won the race. American Promise was the horse I chose, but luckily I bet no money. When I came home at 7:00 I walked through the door and was told to pick a horse. American Promise was the one my eyes were drawn to first. Pouring myself a glass of Woodford Reserve, I watched the race.  
  
I was not too invested, but it was still exciting to watch something others care about. I hope to someday go there in person to see it. Although I do know it can get rowdy.

His article taught me this is something I should look out for within myself as well. I would prefer to never become what I criticize despite knowing it is always a possibility.

25,I need to listen to my mom forreal. She's been right in everything she's said and l've just disregarded it. She was right all along. And I hate realizing that now so long after. After all those talks with her. She’s been spot on in her analysis before I even told her. 
26,"I live in a two-story house, and I absolutely hate the second-floor bathrooms, not because they’re ugly or because there’s something inherently wrong with having an upstairs bathroom, but because if a toilet overflows and leaks into the first floor, it’s the most frustrating thing I’ve ever had to deal with. It makes me miss single-story homes. Not to mention all the damage it can cause, and the fact that I’ll probably have to spend so much money just to get it fixed. It’s extremely, extremely frustrating.

My life is very mundane...most of the time. I’m usually busy cleaning and cooking. Cooking can be fun, sometimes baking too, and I also handle finances, just everyday responsibilities that most people deal with. But I do it in a much more frequent, assistant-like way. It’s just what I do.

I live somewhere that feels pretty isolated, not like a forest, but isolated enough that I can’t just walk out and boom, I’m in the city. I’m a city girl. I’m totally used to the city, but we had to move inland. I do love living close to the forest and beaches. The dream is to get land in a more isolated private location. Though at the moment I don’t really know how to make use of the little free time I do get. I’d love to do more than just watch a bunch of novellas. For a lot of people, this might seem like a great life, but as someone who always had bigger dreams, I feel like there was always something more out there for me than what I have now.

The strange part is, this is technically the life I once sought out. But the problem comes when the life you choose isn’t filled with the things you truly hoped for. As much as I adore the little ones in my life, I always wanted to be a fashion designer. I wanted to direct movies, write a book, and open my own store. My plan was to go to New York, study, learn to design and create, and become a creative artist who changed the way fashion and art was seen.

Though I’ve seen that many of those shifts in fashion have already happened, I still feel like there’s more I could have done. More I wanted to do. Of course, I wanted to be a fashionista, a diva, but now, I’m just here. Just me. I wanted to travel the world. I guess I thought choosing love was the right path.

But when you realize that love isn’t truly reciprocated, you feel like you failed your own life. Like you lived for sorrow and disaster, instead of living to fulfill your mind’s joy, to awaken a world, make people dream again, to create a stir.

I had lots of field interests. Another was to become a philosophy professor, as well as studying psychology deeply, learning literature and brain-based medical perspectives. I wanted to know the ins and outs of the brain. I wanted to understand human behaviors and find answers no one had thought of, simply because those questions were considered too radical or improbable. That’s who I am, but it’s not who I became.

There are so many things that keep me from fulfilling those possibilities, and yet others would deem me capable, without understanding why I feel I’m not.

In my current position with education, many would label me unfit simply because I don’t align with the traditional rules of academic understanding.

I don’t fit anywhere right now. My mind is a blizzard of awareness, and yet here I am, useless, deprived, because my thoughts don’t conform to the same knowledge others deem worthy enough to produce intelligent results.

Have they ever considered that a puzzle can’t be completed until the right piece is found? Don’t they understand that every piece carries its own unique intelligence, and when combined with *""the right others""*, it could unlock the answers of a millennium?

To be human is to be ignorant. I'm even aware of my own. 

What more can be said?

27,"Yep. The universe must be fucking with me right now. The day after my last post, my job finally has the financial buffer to pay their employees.

 **But now here's the kicker of what just happened to me.**

I was taking my sister's dog out for a restroom break, when I fucking get my foot punctured by a nail sitting outside. It drew blood and stopped before hitting any nerves near my pinky toe. Mind you, I have no idea how long it's been out there, and this nail has probably been getting soaked by the rain for quite a while. Now I have to worry if I need a shot or not and if I'm going to get sick.

28," I just need to write a little. Let the thoughts out a bit. Let my mind breathe. Lately I've felt a lot more pessimistic. I see others now and I just recognize the worst. So much just feels like an act, as though we do what we do for convenience. It feels like everyone has a filter no one can be real, no one want to be real. I like the world but there's so much pain it hurts to think about. I'm no better what am I doing. Am I doing enough? Probably not. I thought things were going well but a bomb was dropped in my life. And it's making my mind feel as though it's filled with static. I don't know what's real anymore. I don't know how to react, how can I fix anything? Late nights are just peaceful, but it's not good. It's just a distraction like everything else. I just need to think. But right now I just need to relieve the pressure. Tune out the static. Let my mind rest. I don't know what to think.

This one person appeared to have several versions going about business zooming off.thus way and that only to reappear here or there. 

They were too far away and I'm eyes suffer distortion for me to verify their faces however they were clearly meant to look like one another. 

Stunt doubles I suppose. 

But of course I have seen this before under different conditions and knew it was part of my mind being entertaining when I'm feeling blue. 

It's a genuine attempt to cheer up by my subconscious.  A sweet gesture. 

But then sometimes it will get twisted and include less savory bits. 

Then I wonder. 

What if someone really did have such shenanigans going on. Not really sure why. 
Maybe some sort of government job or something.  

No idea, really.  

I can't ask the person about it because it sounds crazy and even if it was the case then I'm sure it's suppose to be a secret. 

Catch-22, as usual. 

But this person has a magical quality and I've seen their astral projections before. 

Then again I keep reading stories about twins who pretend to be one another.  

So maybe not so outlandish. 

And then curiously this person has copycats that have even at times (briefly) tricked me into thinking I was dealing with the initial person in question. 
(Their motives, perhaps not so innocent in doing so)

The world is very strange. 
I don't know what to think or believe is real anymore, at all. 

Not even sure.how to determine what about it would matter. 

Then silent tears fell down my cheeks. 

Stoic cry. Because something about this feels. ...
Realky.... 
Painful. "
31,"Sitting down in the bathroom tub with the shower on, wasting water, and just scrolling on my phone.  I just feel hot, like my body feels cold but my blood is hot, I need to cool off. "
32,"I like a few boxing reels and then I start getting reels about “going back in time and beating up the little kid you” and “looking back at your younger self knowing you let them down”. 

 It’s been a year and since trying this hedonistic lifestyle I’ve bought whatever I want, do whatever I want, eat whatever, and sleep whenever. But still I feel conflicted. 

 I know that my conflicted feelings come from the fact that I’m not working towards my dreams but I can’t get started on any of them all the bullshit and new changes makes it feel like I deserve to have this leisure time. But it’s been a year now and my drive isn’t here, my motivation to do any better than where I’m at in my life right now ISN’T HERE! WHY?! “Because I can buy whatever and do whatever” WHY DONT YOU UNDERSTAND THATS NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU.. 

It’s just how you’ve turned out something made you to only want what you don’t have and once you get it you appreciate it for a little bit until you move on to the next. So just start, begin the cycle of suffering again when you wake up tomorrow because either way you’re going to be miserable. At least one path will eventually lead to a respite of happiness briefly while the other will just leave you feeling numb until you realize you’re miserable again. So start again.

33,"i've been listening to a lot of what some people call 'divorced alcoholic dad rock'.  it's a lot of Creed, The Fray, Snow Patrol and that type.  i just happen to be currently interested in a divorced alcoholic dad, so, ya.  i realize these aren't the best circumstances but the heart wants what the heart wants and, in many ways, i'm pretty fucked up myself so it's not a bad match.

i was listening to 'So Cold' by Breaking Benjamin and one of the lyrics hit me.  it's just 'you're so cold, keep your hand in mine'.  like, her hand is cold, he wants to keep it warm.  my immediate expectation was 'you're so cold, get your hand *out* of mine'.  like, you're making my hand cold, get away from me.  it hit me that from every guy i've known, i would expect 'get your hand out of mine'.  that's pretty fucked up, i think.  

middle-age alcoholic divorced dad might not be perfect, but he would keep my hand warm."
34,"Dear diary, idk why I woke up early but got no energy to wake up today. I am catching up my long lost friend today. We met at old Klang road to have brunch. The food there is freaking expensive. Anyway, we had a long conversation about things happened after we last met at 1 year plus back. She is still single and of course I have no feelings for her at all but I wanna intro her to my cousin, but seems like is hard tho because she doesn't want to be introduced that way and she is not desperate as well. And also she is not the one my cousin or I will be looking for because she doesn't want to marry. Anyway, after a long conversation we had to depart before we caught in the traffic. After reaching home, I was so tired after using all the energy chatting with her and I just took a nap until dinner time. After the dinner, my sister jiu get ready to fly to Korea. So 👍🏼. Hope she have a safe and fun trip! "
35,"2025 May 2: Dear Diary,

“So this is Hell. I’d never have believed it. You remember all we were told about the torture-chambers, the fire and brimstone, the ‘burning marl.’ Old wive’s tales! There’s no need for red-hot pokers. Hell is other people.”  
  
I have not yet read any of the works of Jean-Paul Sartre, but this line resonates with me. Having to go out in public and deal with people torments me. Not knowing how I come across, knowing there is probably something I am doing “wrong.” That is the life of a neurodivergent person, you do everything the “wrong” way.

Perhaps I am too judgmental myself. I can not fully blame society for shaping me into the judgmental arse that I am. For I have committed the terrible sin of listening to other people’s judgments without considering if they had any merit. Instead of looking inwardly, I followed the “rules” for too long and cared about the judgments of people I could not care less about. I take responsibility for this sin and repent. Looking inwardly with each criticism I receive to see for myself if there really is something I should change within myself for my own benefit or if I should ignore the other’s criticism of me entirely.

Thankfully I am growing deeper into apathy. Desensitizing myself to the Hell which is other people. Putting myself out in public and being a genuine person, regardless of how others view me. Sometimes it will feel like torment and other times it will feel liberating. Apathy for most things has worked wonders for me. Paradoxically when I do not care about what happens, I live a more fulfilling life.

Sincerely,

Torinico"
36,"still pointing your finger at me for an excuse to hide behind your lies I read from you.
 
And to think to imagine that I'd was hoping for you for once to actually ask how am I doing? 

My therapist told me to expect the worst be prepared he said. I take this to therapy damn straight I do. These are your excuses and/or  what your lacking. You're manipulating ways of making me feel bad.

I know you didn't ask or care but again  I need to release and not feel so fearful of what I been through. Find that outlet he says! my feelings are valid let it be known. I don't need to feel shameful for what you've put me through.

trauma you brought has caused horrific vivid nightmares. These nightmares are so vivid that I wake up in a panic attack unable to come out of that nightmare. Sweating crying screaming!
 I no longer want or even look at that damn camper!!! Forced to get out of there!  
So that brings me to homeless and actually living in my f****** nightmare!! Let me finally SHARE ME, I have to live with it every f****** night. So thanks for asking.

these vivid nightmares we're struggling fighting over an object at times you're chasing me with an object telling me to get away run you say or you're laughing at my wounds humiliating me mocking saying nobody cares about me. Always with a harsh tone your vial words heartless remarks. In my nightmares you're telling me how you are constantly lying to me and that I'm a fool and your unhappness brings a dark cloud over us. 
I am sleep deprived depressed feeling unworthy traumatized oh my God am I traumatized I shake when I talk about it.  it brings so much sorrow to me that I feel guilty. What am I guilty of?? 
This your trauma !!
I should not carry your guilt !!
I walk around with my head held low won't even make eye contact with anybody much less talk to anyone because that's how shameful I feel. and nobody should feel that damn shameful
 
I trigger you because I feared my own safety?
 
No, for once I stood up for myself and you didn't like it!
I start with a sleep specialist next week  I struggle taking medication. I know it's in my head but the medication makes me nauseous sick to wear it comes right back up. I went from never taking meds that I have to take meds daily now.
I doubt you ever truly cared about me. I doubt you will ever realize your damage to me. I doubt your word. I doubt who you are as a person.  I doubt you will ever see my counter reaction from you.

use me for an excuse to not face the truth. 

I lost myself trying to help you. And you call me a trigger, smh 

The things you lack you are stealing from me and I want my dreams back I want my shining light back cuz this is your trauma!!
  learn to be honest with yourself and who you are Mr /@r€k. 

But no my email was respectful enough that I can carry on and bring it here to Reddick and release what I'm going through!
thank you 
 goodbye

37,"i feel crazy asf ig his dad is just like making me feel awful i guess 😔 im the one who said those things and i can’t help but wonder if i should have in the first place… but im just so angry can u blame me? i’m so tired… sigh… what else am i even supposed to do anymore i feel so dumb lol 😭now i have to keep dealing with the consequences of my own actions. it’s uncomfortable, but what is there to say? i rly said it all lol. i’m not trying to hurt anyone, i swear, but… i can’t help it if u put me in a situation like that. is it on purpose? what’s going thru ur head rn? why is it so hard to want peace? am i not even allowed that anymore? what determines what someone else deserves? what’s the point… what even is my life? yet i can’t help but wonder abt the meaning of all of this. all this pain and suffering lol. does it even matter? i feel like it’s such a hard thing nowadays to offer kindness and empathy. it feels like there’s a price to everything now. doesn’t that… suck??? everyone’s got their own lives and i get it…  sometimes it’s hard for me to offer my own sympathy and empathy. but it makes me wonder why our society is built like this. is it just society? ack……. the more i think abt it the worse i feel. the more i feel like “wow, has the world rly failed us?” "
38,"It’s been a few days since I last wrote something. And over the past few weeks, I’ve usually written daily. I like writing. It helps calm my mind. It helps me navigate through my thoughts. It’s my outlet. But these past few days, I’ve just been feeling a little more overwhelmed than usual.

It’s weird because I know when I’m overthinking. Nothing new there—I’m always thinking. But the thing is, when I’m overthinking, I can hear my thoughts. I can see them. I know them.

You know how, when you’re a passenger in a car, you see things rush by? The car’s moving fast, the scenery flies past you, but you can still make out what you saw. That’s what overthinking feels like for me. I know there are thousands of thoughts swirling in my head, but I can still make sense of them. Some are silhouettes. Some are clear as day.

But lately, everything has just been a blur. I know I want to express these thoughts, but I can’t make them out. Everything feels foggy—like I can almost feel the shape of them, but they dissipate the moment I reach for them. Nothing is staying in the spotlight.

Is there something—or someone—I wish would step into that spotlight? Sure. Maybe there’s someone. I’ve been enjoying my exchanges with this person. But I don’t want to give it more attention than I already am. I tend to fixate on new people—get a little too excited, romanticize them a little too much. It’s honestly stupid how my mind and my mood can hinge on someone’s presence. And at this age—I don’t know—it feels harder to keep people in your life, especially the new ones. So I try not to think too much of them. Still, I know I have to respond to their letter. I don’t want to leave them hanging. I don’t want to lose this.

But it’s not just about people. There’s the gnawing thought of “my independence”—freedom from my family, from the emotional baggage, from myself. Getting out of this rut that I have no one else to blame for but me. And maybe that’s it. None of the thoughts that truly matter bring relief when I shine the spotlight on them. They’re all uncomfortable. Terrifying. Even when I try to fixate on trivial questions or existential dread, it’s not satisfying—because I know I’m avoiding the real thoughts. The ones about pushing forward. Changing my life. Gaining stability. Those thoughts. The ones that truly matter.

So everything just continues in this one monotonous blur. And this feeling—of wanting to express them, but not knowing exactly what they are? It’s exhausting.

I don’t want this. I’m tired. I’m in a limbo between constantly giving up and barely trying to fight. Trying being the keyword—because I don’t think I’m even fighting to get out of this anymore. I’m just… here.

This place—this cold, desolate place—where I can’t see where it begins or ends. Everything’s covered in fog. Like I’m looking at shapes, but I can’t even understand what I’m looking at. I don’t know what’s real. I don’t know if anything is.

I’m merely waiting for my inevitable demise. Wishing it’ll happen sooner. Or that I’ll finally have the courage to do it"
39,"I've had hypertension for years and i've tried lifestyle changes (i exercise a lot more, eat less salt) and haven't smoked in five years or more, but it hasn't been enough.  i found this out at the dentist's today.  i went because i want to take advantage of my student health insurance which will expire at the end of summer.  i just wanted a cleaning but i know they always push some extra services and, really, i haven't seen a dentist for about 4 years and i might as well go for the whole thing.  i let them take x-rays because, even though i do look after my teeth, cavities are probable.  

when i filled out my medical health history, i noted my hypertension.  i've never had it come up at the dentist's before, but the hygienist actually took my blood pressure and it was really high.  took a while before the doctor showed up and in the mean time, this hygienist (lovely lady) was asking a few more teeth-related questions.  she asked if i drink tea or coffee and my caffeinated ass was like 'oh, i'll take a coffee' not realizing she wasn't offering, but asking because of the colour of my teeth. 

i'm a student nurse and doing my consolidation this summer so i'm almost ready to practice (at a novice level).  when i asked if i had anything show up on the x-ray, the hygienist told me she couldn't say and i'd have to wait for the doctor.  if i weren't in health care, that might have worried me, but since i am, i realize it's not because there's something weird and the doctor needs to look it over, it's really a sort of legal 'scope of practice' thing.  as a nurse, i can't deliver any diagnoses even if there's nothing serious or abnormal, it's just not within my scope.  understanding that, we just waited for the doctor.  

when the doctor showed up, he took a look at my stuff and said i had a few really tiny cavities he wasn't worried about and that my blood pressure was too high to do anything anyway.  i mean, for a cleaning that's kind of weird and i've never gotten that before but, overall i'm actually sort of glad a doctor made that call.  it's time to bite the bullet, realize i haven't been able to manage my blood pressure properly and just get a fucking pill so i don't have a heart attack or develop kidney disease.

walking home, it was really really nice out.  i passed this coloured guy who was kind of cute and, you know, looked him over.  the way he looked back made me almost burst out laughing once i passed him because *he. was. interested*. and it was almost scandalous.  later on i got a coffee at a tim horton's and this guy standing next to me must have been, like, 6'7"" *easily* and the tallest person i've seen in recent memory.  I almost just said to him 'wow, you're tall' as if that needed to be said."
40,I literally feel so giddy and cannot stop smiling right now! I just got to walk/ride home with someone I've crushed on for literally ever!!!! Ahhh I'm pretty confident he likes me to!!! Fuhhhhk I'm here for it! 🥴💓✨
41,"Dear Diary, 

 *Please release me from the fear of being a complete major asshole.,. and a fuk up, thank you amen.* 

My brain is also probably bleeding from the radiation my AirPods have been emitting… I can literally feel my eardrums burning…  gahhlee I NEED those EMF Free headphones asap yesterday. 
But i persist..music is my vacation away from fears, the anxiety of falling in love, into my career, into LIFEEE…
Guardians of the Galaxy much ?

*_*_*_*_
I’m embarking on this journey as a social butterfly pretty ironic when I feel mostly like a bagworm moth, hiding in silk and in complete isolation. But hey I can be yappy sometimes ? It’s just… lord knows HOW many timesssssss iv failed at this. I hate keeping up with expectations of being the fun girl. The masked normie.
But heyyy my trauma is showing and that’s not very cash money of me.

Like I mentioned ..I like this girl, and it’s not good for my health.
I’m starting a business from scratch..this may be good for my future health but it’s not good for my health.
I’m taking risk ultimately good for my health but yet a toll on my health. 

Back to today…
My best-friend Brian whom has been incarcerated for about 9 years gives me his routine call. Yes I had to count on my fingers for that one LOL it’s been a whileeeee. It kinda breaks my heart writing this because I know it’s nothing I can do.. life is cruel like that, but he’ll be home. We always joke and dream up all the shit we’re gonna do. Places we’ll eat, things I’d cook bc he SWEARS I can NOT COOK??? The nerve of him right??? It sucks he’s in a time capsule. But we talk religiously for at least 3 hours a day with of course missing a few days out the week lolol. I dunno this man is chatty, and I always have love to give. That’s my dawg. We came to a side eyed conclusion that he’ll be my stylist when he’s out since he says I can’t dress either. 
He pointed out me having abandonment issues today after I told him how low I felt after having such a nice time with the girl I’m interested in. He also said something along the lines like  “you also have the fear of being the abandoner because you know just how much that hurts”

And that hit me like a ton of bricks. Because yeah iv heard of abandonment issues cool but never the reversal notion. 
I am scared to hurt her. I’m scared to destroy her quite frankly.

42,"I have this friend who is constantly panicking about not being loved. 
Love is such a burden for her, she forces herself till the last breath to please others, in exchange for love.
She wasn’t able to get it.According to her standards.

I see my old past self in her. So insecure and so desperate for love.

But you cannot love another soul, if you cant love yourself. Then all the “love” you claim is just an exchange. You really need to accept you as you, you need to find your voice, find your soul, to live this changing life. Your love to yourself, thats the only constant, that is going to company you through your life.

But its so hard, the fear of being abandoned in this world is just so vast.

My girl, be brave, open your eyes, accept yourself. It’s ok and it’s gonna be the beginning of a wonderful life.



"
43,"On Wednesday, I went to work. On Thursday, I did the same. Then, on Friday, I called in sick.

I wasn’t actually sick. I just couldn’t be bothered with it all. I checked my Slack at about 11 to see if anyone had said anything. But they hadn’t, which is either good or bad. Or neither. They probably have their own shit going on and don’t care.

So I went out for a walk.

I didn’t have a plan. I just left the flat and kept walking. Turned left at the bakery, even though I usually go right. I passed a man arguing with a lamp post and crossed the road to avoid a man with a clipboard.

It was overcast because Britain, but not cold. I ended up at the park. There were geese everywhere. One of them hissed at me, which felt excessive. I wasn’t even that close.

I sat on a bench near the pond and watched a child drop little toy soldiers into it like he was sending them to war. His mum was on her phone as they drifted away forever.

I stayed there a while. Didn’t check the time. Didn’t check Slack again, either.

Eventually, I walked home. Took a different route back, just to feel like I did more with my day.

Dinner was a sandwich. The bread was slightly stale, but I toasted it, so it didn’t matter.
Went to bed early. Slept okay, I think.

On Saturday, I had a couple of drinks in the afternoon and decided to watch a film. Can’t remember what it was called. I watched most of it but must have fallen asleep near the end.

On Sunday, I finished it. Thought it wrapped up nicely — made sense, emotionally, sort of. Then, later that evening, I realised I’d watched the ending of a completely different film and hadn’t noticed.

Still, it ended okay. I think someone got married.

On Monday, I went to work again. And on Tuesday. And Wednesday.

Now we’re all up to date.

"
44,"I can't really say I'm doing great, it feels like the universe is kinda screwing me over right now. I know that my current situation is not nearly as bad as some others are going through, but damn this absolutely sucks.

In approximately 1 and a half months, it would be my 1-year anniversary for me working for my job. But the problem, and this problem is very glaring, is that the company I work for is small. By small, I mean it is something you might hear about in the news once or twice but is otherwise forgettable. The job does not have a consistent schedule either. What comes with this, is that the company barely have funds to keep itself afloat, let alone pay its employees.

I. Haven't. Been. Paid. For. Nearly. Two. Months.

Because of this, I have no leftover funds in my card. It's getting hit with overdraft fees from college debt repayment and I can only manage to eat once a day, twice if I'm lucky. Why am I torturing myself? I don't know why I am still working for this company, I should've fucking dipped out a month ago and looked for a new job."

48,"Dear diary,

I just paid off my car. I just paid off my car. Total time: 1 year, 3 months, ten days. 

Original cost of the car: 15,998.13.

Amount I ultimately paid: $17, 923.59

Total interest I paid: $1,925.46. 

Not too shabby, not too shabby. The result of a lot of sacrifice and abstention. And of quitting my doctorate program and diverting my tuition funds to this. 

Paid off, paid off. Now I own this car, it will totally be in my name alone. Neat. 

I don't think I'll tell my husband that I paid it off. I won't mention it unless he specifically asks. 

Otherwise, he will start requesting a higher financial contribution from me, for this or that sudden expense. And the distribution of labor/wealth in our dynamic is already ...CLOSE to equitable, but still slightly skewed in his favor. 

So. I will sit on this information as I do need to protect my own interests. 

Great great excellent... my very own car. ...I feel I need to do something to protect it. And to protect my financial situation generally. From a turn of ill luck. 

This is the sort of timing where one would be sure to arise... 

The summer is about to start! 

I have such plans.

I'm going to start selling lesson materials on TPT. I am going to sell the lesson materials I make for my own classes (might as well get paid twice for the same work) AND I'm going to start making some idiosyncratic lesson materials. 

I have seen some really interesting stuff on TPT. For example -- a lesson built around the ethics of Star Trek 

  
\*I\* could make something like that! A guide for rhetorically analyzing one of my favorite pieces of media!? Why the heck not!?

  
I also saw that there are literature guides with questions about specific novels. \*I\* could do that! Whatever novel I've most recently read/am in process of reading, -- create a lesson guide for it!?

There are also spiritual lesson plans, for Pagan home schoolers. Freaking neat, right!? I could make some cool stuff. 

Even Bible study stuff. Heck! I used to write Bible fan fiction! Making Bible lessons would be pretty cool, actually. 

AND THINK ABOUT MOVIE DAYS. I could definitely make some fun movie day guides for various subject and lesson objectives. That would essentially be like getting paid to watch movies....

(It helps that I'm certified for a really wide variety of subjects. As, studying for and taking on new certifications was my main summer hobby, before I started grad school)

I have such plans. "
49,"I took two days off...AGAIN.
I know I dont have any leeway, I know I have to work more and more before I'll lose my costumers.
But recently my body condition was pretty bad, Im always drawing a mad of the tiredness and my mental is awful. Plus my situation is not good as well. Everyone around me but piggy, can't release me and don't give me a distance or any room for to feel secure. I understand everyone carrying something and they just want to rant about their lives and they need a some sympathy, agrees. So I tried to playing my roll that they want, they need, but sometime its really really killing me. Killing me that not only I have to playing my roll for people who around me, maybe most thing why I feel this hurt because I understand why they need, they want to my roll, they desperate as like me, and I really want to help them but unfortunately especially now I really don't have a time and room for that. Im on the edge right now.
I need make money for to live and I have responsibility to my lovest piggy, and I have to keep fighting and fighting back my depression. So sometime when peoples around me speaking out about their mental health situation or some issues, grumble about their lives then I'm really got tired and sometime even I felt some anger for that, because I wish I could speak out to them same damn thing, but always I keep quiet and pretend like ""I'm a bit tired but I'm fine tho."" Its not what I want, I just don't have other options.
I don't want to say I am the victim, or I don't want to pity myself. Just I want to say I'm tired and maybe I want to excuse to why I couldn't good performance on my job these days and I want to I admitted it and forgive myself. 

I keep trying and trying to ignore my depressed. Most of time I can ignore my depressed for now. Only the way I could get through whole this situation and my work is just ignore my depressed and all my mental tiredness. 
I know it's not right way, unhealthy thing.
But if I down now, everything will be going to bad. Too many things is depends on me now. 
Always I can't stop wondered, If I hadn't met piggy then maybe I'm already goner. Now only one thing to held me in this world is piggy.
If I don't have piggy, I could say good bye to this world easily and maybe it supposed to be happened in January this year.

Last October, I felt I couldn't keep go on my life anymore and I ran out my place with piggy in the night of rainy day and I looked for a place that somewhere I could be ended up my life. But I hugged piggy whole those time and suddenly the rain was really rough, and piggy's eyes told me ""I want go back our place"". So me and piggy back to the my/our place but I couldn't gave up to try to ended up-thing, I went to the roof floor of this flat.
Its only 5 or 10min around but felt like forever, me and piggy looked down from the roof.I felt so scared, but more than that I felt so sorry for piggy. Because if I'll jump, piggy will do too even piggy really don't want to.
But that time, piggy didn't say anything. Just looked down and looked downpour with me and held my hand tightly. I remembered clearly that moment and that felt. And do not forget about that Sin.
I alway wrote how much I love piggy and how piggy is meant to me, but I hurted piggy so hard and gave a huge traumatized to piggy. Its really unforgivably thing.

For now only my concern and my responsibility is a my dearest piggy. I really won't break piggy's life and all piggy's dream. I just want to make piggy happy and secure the piggy's safe always.
Of course I am care about my peoples, but the ""responsibility"" is only to piggy. I dragged piggy in my life and piggy even couldn't choose other ways, piggy couldn't have any ways and any opportunity. Piggy had only way that live with me. I am so sad and sorry and how unfair that piggy's reality is.
However piggy never gives up piggy's life even once, always looked up, hoped up and piggy always says ""Do something before wish"" ""Do something before curse something"" etc, and those piggy's words, piggy's thoughts really helping me.

Well, its too long diary (it as always...).
I have to back a work again and will do good performance and make some money for my lovest, my dearest, my true true faith piggy.
Everything for piggy. I'll keep fight for piggy like as piggy always fight for me, fight with me.

Im not alone anymore. I have piggy and nothing can be more than that, nothing can't beat me up anymore because piggy is here always with me.

I love you piggy.
My lovest piggy, my dearest piggy, my life piggy, my everything piggy, my true faith piggy.
I love you more than anything. You are all my matter, all my meaning to live. You are the question and you are the answer.

Me and piggy wishing everyone's happiness and safe. Please have a joyfully and lovely time everyone.

And if you ever feel lonely or you don't have any love,  please remember me and piggy love you and hope you'll remember always how lovely how special you are.

And the slightly sad.. disappointed look in her face when I can’t exactly define what this is in the moment she’s looking…it just makes me curl inside … makes me want to tell her I love her. But it’s only been a month and I know how these games go, I play it cool, prob too cool… and honestly iv never fallen in love with a girl… this is my very first time. 


*•*•*•
Walking with her in public holding her hand, idk how to truly feel. When eyes are on us , I feel the temperature rise to my face. And honestly that uncertainty, the unknown it just makes me want her more.
Yah seeee im used to men who tower over me and their big rough hands intertwine in mine which is nice… but it’s just something so special about the way her hands connect in mine that makes my heart glow. Her gentleness..The way she kisses my hands im just in awe of how bold ? Im just so used to thinking about what’s in the mind of a man?? And now when I walk with her I feel so unafraid to reveal my flaws , and all I can think about is protecting her from all the shi iv seen in life. 
The darkness that’s inside. She claims she’s so masc but I see the real her she doesn’t know what true masc is because if she did , I don’t think she’d claim it. And that’s not to disrespect her , it’s to shower her.. in my opinion, but these are my thoughts and I’d never tell her.


Since this was our first link, I hope she genuinely likes me, idk if I’m just excited and a tab bit firey but if I could live in her skin, maybe in her top drawer I’d be happy with it.

51,"Dear diary, i am super tired today, I had a morning session pickle ball with my friends, he said he will bring his pretty colleague to play and plus one from her colleague, but both also not my type. I'm so disappointed in him haiz. 

Then, I had another session with my cousin and her friends. After the session, we talked a lot in the kopitiam, mostly about the relationship. We share our opinion, we share our story. Later at night, we meet again at cousin house to have dinner. 

When I come back from home, my sister suddenly came into my room and wanted to 八卦 about the stories we share just now and we also had a deep chat until very late at 2 something. Well mostly about the opinion of getting the partner, I just think that she gave herself too much stress ofcuz being the eldest sister has the responsibility to be able to do well in everything, but maybe just too much stress.

52,"Hello there,

This is my first post here. I'm fairly new with Reddit. I'm at the age where I want to experience romance for once. I hope to meet my Mr. Right soon. I am introverted and going on places with many people is exhausting for me. Well, I don't know how. But I wish I'll find him soon. ☺️

Dreaming as always,

53,"2025 May 1: Dear Diary,

My procrastination has gotten bad. The only thing worse than my procrastination is me disrespecting myself for my procrastination. Complaining does nothing and only keeps me procrastinating further. At least I am continuing to write these diary entries as they help remind me of how fun writing can be. This is something that helps me expand my writing and helps me overcome fear, even if it is slight.  
  
One other thing that is helping me is chanting Aum. I have been chanting Aum more recently and it helps me stay at peace for some time. Aum helps me feel rejuvenated during times of stress. Sometimes I chant Aum at work when there are no customers. I want to match the vibrations of the universe and choose what is best for me. I want to choose to do good for myself and everyone else in my life. Good action can not come out of giving myself fear or negativity, but only with choosing to align myself with the universe.  
  
Sincerely,  
  
Torinico"
54,"I want to hear about your problems. Go ahead and tell me I will sit there and listen. But to be honest I won’t know what to say back. Hell you might see me try to stifle a laugh or desperately try to hold my lips from making a smile because of the atmosphere. I’m not laughing at you, I need you to know that. I won’t try to pretend either that I’ll be able to say something and make you feel better. The only thing I can do for you is to give you my sincere attention and show you’ve been heard. I’m not sure what to expect from letting yourself do this with me but I hope that it deepens the relationship we are building on in a healthy way. 

Written on a belly full of hotpot on 4/30/25"
55,"Happy May, losers!!! I am writing this from \~9,100 meters in the air, just because I have nothing else to do. It’s actually worse than I thought—I knew that space would be tight, but I didn’t realize it’d be so cramped that I wouldn’t even be able to use my laptop on my tray table. Well…I can, but it’s really not worth it. I’m just using my legs and my fat belly for support instead, essentially laying it at a 45º angle. Everyone on the flight seems to be asleep, even the flight attendants. So far as I can tell, I’m the only one that’s actually awake (save for the pilots…hopefully.) We just passed over Regina, although I didn’t realize it until it was too late; if I’m guesstimating correctly, then we should only have about 12 hours until we get to Taipei. Yippie!!!!

I really don’t get why everyone is asleep right now…it’s only, like, 16:30 there. I plan on staying awake until 5:00 takeoff time, if I can (and the answer to that is yes, I absolutely can.) Not that going to bed at 19:00 local time is much better than 16:00. 

I’m rewatching Bicycle Thieves after far too many years away from it. The only good thing about waiting so long to watch it again is that it’s almost like rediscovering one of the 20th century’s greatest artistic gems…wait a minute, we just flew over Edmonton!!!! This is my first time out here in the great Canadian west, and I’m experiencing Alberta exactly how it’s meant to be experienced—as far away from the actual people as possible. All jokes aside, even from 9,100 meters up, this place bores you to tears. I’m losing my fight with drowsiness for the first time tonight, and it’s happening quite suddenly. But I’m not giving up the fight just yet—I will stay awake until 5:00…or 4:30, with how sleepy I’m getting. Maybe 4:00. 

Well, what else is there to say? Tons, but I’m not the best writer when I’m awake and alert, let alone when I’m tired and uncomfortable. 12 hours, I said? Yeah, that sounds about right…I can’e believe it, though. We’re passing over a minor settlement now—Barrhead, I think. We should hit Whitehorse within 2 hours, probably closer 90 minutes than 120. We’re going to miss Anchorage and Fairbanks, but I’m still excited to fly over Alaska and experience it as it’s meant to be experienced. From there, we’ll go over the Bering Strait and pass over the Russian far east, which is exotic but…well, we’ll say unpalatable. We’ll stay in Russian airspace for a few hours before cutting through the southeastern edge of the Korean Peninsula, which, if I’m lucky, should give me a solid overhead view of Busan. Then, we should spend the last couple hours of our trip over international waters before hitting Taipei at about 4:45 local time. Fun, fun, fun."
56,"today, i had a few of those moments where i look in the mirror and just hate everything about myself.  lately, i don't feel that way often but the simple act of seeing myself can be triggering.  it's mostly my weight, but then also my face and from there, my hair and skin and teeth and then just everything.  i'm not bulimic, but the only things that would make me feel better about myself in that moment are throwing up or getting some exercise.  since i'm not bulimic, i go with exercise.  after not liking my reflection, i went out to the track and jogged three miles.  it went pretty well and i did feel better but hating myself and all my physical manifestations is an ongoing problem for me. 

other than that, i had a pretty good day.  i took the dog for a walk and she kept almost choking herself to death, pulling so hard because there was a groundhog around or something and she was obsessed.  she was so focused on the groundhog, she even passed up a dead duck she could have tried to eat or roll in or just sniff for half an hour."
57,"I can't sleep, again. Lately it's been getting worse, yet I can't seem to fix it. I know I don't wanna stay up, I know it could be dangerous. But it's quiet. The absence of the noise helps. I don't feel like I'm going crazy as much if I don't think about it. Something happened a couple of day ago that's troubled my mind, how do I keep going? My mind feels like it's fracturing with so many thought and emotions, I was okay or  atleast thats just what I thought. I can't keep these thought inside anymore I need to just write even if is nothing. I'm scared that's what I can think the most clearly. I can't keep ignoring the problems with distractions but what can I do, it feels like it's all becoming the same again. Any growth seems to erode. I feel like I'm going crazy and I can't sleep."
58,"2025 April 30: Dear Diary,

I went on a second date with Jessie today. We started by getting curry. I always like my curry to be the medium spicy. When it is too spicy it is inedible to me. When it is not  spicy enough there seems to be no point in eating the curry. The middle ground is called the “Goldie Locks” zone for a reason. Balance makes things just right.  
  
After getting curry we walked through the woods. The trees blowing in the air and the river flowing was a great sight to see. Some birds even made an appearance which was a great change of place.  
  
Later we went back to my house. I showed her my collection of books and we cuddled while watching “Chowder”. The cuddling was nice and I am glad I got to have the experience sooner rather than later. Focusing on what I am grateful for is a real good action to take.

59,"Dear diary, I forgot to write diary again ytd, so, I've received a message in the morning from the job I have interviewed asking for the feedback, and I thought I was nominated already, seems like I'm not they just want to make sure I'm still interested... 

Then, as usual, I also learnt some Japanese words and I think I learnt a lot as I am competing with other ppl to get number 1 in the league haha 

Btw, today was my 2nd anniversary with my ex. She sent a picture to me this morning, then I sent her on 1st may. Not sure if I have 放下 or not, because 每当我想起的时候，还是有点不敢相信我们分手了。眼睛还开始湿了。Anyway, 我告诉自己，事情都过了，2周年也过了，那就不要再想起以前的事了。她的事，没你的事，就放下人家吧。"

I know that's an irrational thought. It feels so real, though. I just want to run away from these expectations. I don't know how to be the perfect child, sibling, friend, person. I am not perfect. I am flawed and it seems like everyone is too, but they're better at hiding it than me. I can't stop feeling weak. I crave to see my pain in the physical world. It doesn't seen real if it isn't. But it is real. I keep trying and the world keeps spinning. I feel frustrated and I cry and roll over and stare at the walls. Trying to find the detail in meaningless paint patterns. Playing music so loud that the words mean nothing, just a beat that reminds me of my heartbeat. I want to scream, but it sounds so much like when a child throws a tantrum. I can't pinpoint why I feel like this. I'm not doing anything wrong, but I am overwhelmed by the feeling of shame that overcomes me. I'm so tired. I'm tired of being tired. Tired of being tired that I'm tired. Another minute passes and nothing feels real. Five things I can see. Red blanket, white ceiling, black dresser, white AC. Deep breathes. In and out. Exhale longer than I inhale. Five things I can hear. Drums, violin, piano, vocals, and a fan. Follow the beginning of my breath as it flows into the beginning of my exhale. Just keep breathing, making it to the next minute, next hour, next day. Just keep making it. Just keep making it. "
63,"Dear Diary, 

Nothing feels real anymore. I spend my days in a trance floating through the long hallways of my school, smiling but not listening, crying without tears. I can’t let go but I can’t hold on to anyone.

Like always the future is a mistry, anything can happen, I could pass all FAs at this point it seems easy but it can get difficult any time. The difficulty is relative. Remember to try doesn't matter if you succeed or fail...just try. 
If you are not doing your office well, it's actually a good reminder that your work is not you.
You are this extraordinary person, who makes her mistakes, learn from it. Who doesn't need anyone but grateful for anyone who chose to be on her side. Who is her best supporter, who takes energy and positivity from the cosmos. Who can empathise, come out of her judgements be on neutral ground anytime.

These are in case you have forgotten yourself.

67,"2025 April 29: Dear Diary,

With the most recent conclave coming up, I have found myself to actually become interested. I do not consider myself a Catholic although I was baptized as an infant, but strangely I find myself drawn to who the next pope will be. I feel that Cardinal Luis Tagle has a great chance of becoming the next pope.  
  
Tagle has been referred to as the “Asian Francis” and seems more progressive than the other candidates. Pietro Parolin also has a decent chance at the Papacy. Being a seventy-year-old Italian man, it would certainly fit the pre-1978 tradition of Popes.  
  
Whoever takes Francis’ place, I am interested to see if the Catholic Church will regress into traditionalism or if it will move slightly closer into the modern world. Of course the Catholic Church will probably never shape itself around modern morals, it is interesting to see it get closer to Jesus’ teachings than it has been for the past millennia.  
  
Sincerely,

68,"I have a story I want to write for a competition, but my current writing style is too colloquial.
I need to find some novels to read when I have time to adjust my narrative tone."
69,"My mind craves the yearn for education, not the typical kind, but an engaging, complex education that allows my thoughts to ponder and breathe in the mysteries unraveled from the mouths of philosophical geniuses.

Many would proclaim, *""Pick up a book!""*
But my brain craves presence, not just literature.
I long to be taught. I yearn for knowledge through living, breathing connection, not simply drooling over the pages I so wish my mind would allow me the decency to absorb without succumbing to a dreadful fatigue. 
My mind stays alive through conversation, through the active, electric teaching of those who carry excitement and joy for what they do.

I want to understand what isn't understood.
I yearn for possibility.
It thrills me to believe that
one day!

One day!

It will reach me."
70,"I’m truly gobsmacked every time realizing you will never see it. With each conversation, you will truly never see it. And sometimes I think you may be getting close, but it’s always a “maybe.” Because you don’t truly think so. I guess it’s time to stop being shocked by now but somehow I am each and every time. Oh well. "
71,"I've had to live in my head for quite a while, making different versions of myself to carry the weight of emotions. 

Rare:
Anger - She's volatile, doesn't wait for permission to strike and does it elegantly perfect when she does. Doesn't care for your brilliance or weakness, she sees you clearer then the sun can illuminate the truth. This anger carries two woes, a silent calm that is hauntingly intimidating as its intensity is felt through empty space and the other a powerful deep firing clear impulsive dirty ugly truth that does not wane from picking out every demon from your soul. Luckily she's contained in my mind as no target fictional or physical could survive her excellent targeting skills. Think of her like a woman in black unashamed strapped and ready for battle or to simply lay on the balcony half way perched from the highest building roof top. She's fearless. 

Sadness: She's more delicate, kind, and hurt. She wears white wrapped all around her body as the wounds are clearly visible and scars decorating the wrap with blotches of red as her wounds rip open time and time again. Don't think of her kindness as weakness she carries empathy no different then her fierce counterpart *Anger* she simply sees truth in the color of light. She will lead you to see the warmth and pain all at once. She will expose the dam to destroy its encagement and let the tears flood the stable ground you felt safe in. Allowing the rebirth of something beyond healing light from sadness in your heart. You may cry, you may hate her but in the end she made sure to lay you gently on a boat sailing to happiness. That is my girl Sadness. 

Happiness: Happiness, Oh my. She's not what you think. When I Imagine happiness I imagine her as a little girl. She picks the most fragile broken flowers gathering them for the most beautiful bouquets her imaginary friends and plushies ever seen. As the lost and broken have a deeper beauty that even they themselves don't know. She wears dresses and big bows. She loves wearing socks, decorating them with fluffy balls, knitting, trinkets, and hearts. Every sock has a unique pattern and color even some for sock puppeteering. She loves to give, share, give unexpected hugs and sing lullabies to the restless. Her heart always glowing for an opportunity to seam a smile and dance through the night's howls. She is the light I barely got to know. 

LOve: Oh love... Love is the woman in a classic simple dress who looks stunning nonetheless. She is the woman who whispers beauty not simply from her classy romantic styles but her elegant mind, her presence, an overwhelming poet, writer. A cinema that comes from the heart of a dreamer and a crusader of adventures. She unleashes the dream of black and white films, teenage rebels, and novelty that only her lover can define. She is everything combined in emotion but above all she is passion. Love when she fights she fights until the silence is blessed with a story of resilience only she understands. She is beautiful and no one can deteriorate her presence not even stubborn. 

Stubborn: Well there isn't much to say about stubborn. She's the naked child running across the hall room to the kitchen refusing to put on clothes. She's the *I heard you but I'm still gonna not listen because I care more!* She's an arrogant ass. Now don't think she lacks empathy as it is her weakness. She cares differently. The empathy that is unwinding to her becomes untangled by watching a truth her own mind couldn't grasp as it comes undone in front of her. Stubborn then learns something true. Her heart cannot fight a shadow or be cruel. Her lesson is truth. Stubborn she may be but stubborn learns too. 

I could go on about how each emotion carries weight in my mind, perhaps another time.

Signed, 

*Creator*

73,"2025 April 28: Dear Diary,

Most awful things that have happened to me have been forgotten by me as well. Same with the good things, but the good stays in my soul longer. I think it is more beneficial for me to focus on the good that happens to me ninety percent of the time. Ignoring the bad things is not a good idea, but it is much better to focus on what I am grateful for.  
  
I feel that my life is really awesome and I am truly grateful to be alive. Most of the bad stuff that has happened has been very trivial. Most of the good stuff that has happened has been amazing. Being mindful of the present helps me to appreciate my life. I am very grateful for life and I do not want to waste any of it.

74,"Man is this a miserable and impossible existence. I’m guess I’m learning entry level jobs are just that and nothing more. It truly does not matter how hard you work, the hours you up in or anything extra that you do. Nobody actually gives a fuck. You will not make more money, even if you ask people about a raise they will lie or just patronize you. Lol it’s actually so fucked up because how am
I supposed to live a life I know I deserve. Maybe I’m stupid for thinking I could get what I deserve from just any job maybe it’s where I’m looking. I’m so done kissing ass and trying to prove myself when literally nobody give a fuck but I can’t help it I must prove myself I have some stupid shit in me that still hopes and tries. Believe me I’m trying to kill it, it’s annoying and gets in the way of peace. I have something in me that wants more and wants to be successful but I have to swallow a reality pull an realize it’ll never ever happen. People who are well off are 50+ for a reason. Even if I was rich it probably wouldn’t even happen until I’m down to my last fucking quarter of life. lol I’m fucking done and I hate working. "
75,"I have a deep feeling of sadness, further perpetuated by the lack of social support. I find myself isolated by my thoughts, concerns, and worries in life. The only social interaction I have is with my wife. My wife told me recently (and repeatedly) that she no longer wants to be the one emotionally cradling me (""mothering me,"" as she says). She is often the one who reaches out to check in about my emotions, as well as providing closure or helping me see a path forward in our arguments. I've conceded to every point she made, but I feel she is missing part of the narrative. I feel invalidated in my own efforts to try—my efforts to clean the house, my efforts to reach out to her. When I mention how her language and actions belittle me, she claims that she is voicing how she is feeling and should be justified in the way she speaks, as reality is in its raw form. Though I have conceded to her requests, I feel deeply saddened. My wife keeps bringing up introducing fun, creative energy, and joy back into our lives; she keeps voicing that she is tired of the tough conversations and the fighting. It makes me want to shut off my emotions. I want to feel less because I don't like the way I am feeling right now. I feel, in the corners of my mind, that maybe I'm not enough for this to work. I'm not sure if my feelings are valid.

My wife and I have been without intimacy for a long time—not a proper one, at least. I don't think I've tried to initiate for some time. The reverberating message I get from her is that she isn't a sexual person. She is someone who can go on for a long time without sex. When she is constantly voicing/affirming her identity in this way, it becomes hard for me to initiate or feel confident that my advances are welcomed. My previous partner has said the same thing: I don't know if I'm sexual enough for you. I feel ashamed that I desire in this kind of way. I've completely closed off this part of myself towards my wife because I don't want to advance where I'm not wanted. She claims that she does see me in this way and feels exasperated that she has to constantly remind me of that fact. To be honest, though she says that, I feel as though she is very distant when I touch her or try to engage in that way. The overall message that I receive is that I'm too much: my emotions, my sadness, my sexuality, my need for constant reassurance. In a way, I, too, am angry that she doesn't see my needs, or when she does, it's with a negative reaction. I feel alone. I feel that it's better if I disconnect and be self-sufficient. I want to feel less. I want to need less."
76,"Dear diary, today, I started watching a new drama and that is weak hero class season 2. I haven't finished watching it but I think so so only. But one thing is that the 男主角 really is good at using his eyes for acting.

I woke up really early in the morning, just to practice running a marathon today. Why must it be today because I wanted to post in IG and hopefully the ""girl"" would maybe reply to my story but she didn't... Anyway, I ran for 6km without stopping. But I ran slowly, so it took me about 45mins to complete 6km. 

I was so tired after the running that I slept for another hour because I didn't sleep a lot last night. And I have another night of session with Amway which I have promised people to attend. But it was okok to listen to the session nothing much to learn just learn about the history of Amway.

I’m feeling so defeated right now.

While I was rushing around trying to finish my assignments, I suddenly realized today is Sunday — which means the weekly deadline for the art accountability group I joined a few weeks ago has already passed. I opened the group chat, and sure enough, I had been kicked out.

When I first joined, I was full of ambition and hope for my future. I promised myself I would complete the goal of drawing or animating for four hours every day. But every single week after that, I procrastinated and couldn’t even get started. I missed every single check-in.

And now, this week, I was finally removed from the group.

Looking back, it feels like procrastination has been slowly destroying my entire life. From rushing my undergraduate thesis to watching my grades crash during my second year of grad school, everything I care about — my studies, my hobbies, my language skills, every dream I have — seems to end badly.

I almost never finish anything properly. I just can’t understand it. I think I want to do these things. I think I love these things. So why is it so impossible to even start?

Starting anything feels so hard for me. I’ve already tried so many different methods to get myself started. But none of them really worked. Even when something seemed to help for a little while, the effect disappeared quickly.

I procrastinate to the point that my anxiety turns physical — my hands shake, I can’t breathe properly — and I still can’t move forward.

I suspect I might have ADHD, but I’ve never been officially diagnosed. And honestly, even if I went to a doctor, what could I really do? I don’t want to take medication, and I can’t afford treatment anyway.

I’m just so tired of this endless cycle."
79,"It’s strange how certain moments, certain words, can cling to you forever.

I was writing a letter (or an email, or whatever you call it) to a friend I met online. We’re sort of penpals, I guess. He asked me about my experiences meeting people online—specifically, what was the most fucked-up thing I'd ever heard from someone I'd met.

That made me think of A.

I figured I’d refine my raw answer to him and turn it into a journal entry. It’s been more than a year since I met A, and weirdly, I’ve never written anything about her. Below is what I shared with my penpal:

The most fucked-up thing I’ve ever heard came from A—the girl I met on Reddit. The one I had a chaotic, dark relationship with.

Honestly, neither of us really understood how we got there. I just remember responding to her post about wanting to learn how to sext. At first, it was just harmless, playful flirting. We had our fun. But we kept talking. Got to know each other a little too well. And from there, everything spiraled.

Two things:

# Our bond was built on suicide.

When I met her in person, she was only a few weeks into recovering from an almost-successful suicide attempt. Her family thought she was incredibly lucky—a doctor refused to give up on her. She showed me proofs that she was alive when she shouldn’t have been. Somehow, that suicide attempt became the thing that made us close. We started planning ours. Together. For weeks.

We talked about indirect self-harm. About ways to actually go through with it. She had stockpiled enough pills—the same cocktail of pills she used before. She told me she would have succeeded if only she hadn’t been found in time; if only that doctor had let her go. She wanted me to take the pills, too. She was giving them to me. And terrifyingly, I wanted to accept them. I was scared—but even more scared by the part of me that genuinely wanted to say yes.

I didn’t trust pills, though. I told her I wanted a gun instead. Something quicker. Something final. I even said, “I’ll do it for both of us.” And I meant it. I also just have this weird fixation chasing experiences, no matter how dark and immoral they may be. Doing it for both of us would be fulfilling that, too.

Looking back, it wasn’t a plan. It was just two broken people flailing in the dark, clinging to each other. It didn’t work out. Thankfully, I guess. Or... maybe not. Sometimes I wonder if I should have been stronger—strong enough to see it through.

Eventually, we decided—not out loud, but mutually—to ""get better,"" whatever that meant. Not in a healthy way. We drowned ourselves in self-destruction: she dove deeper into weed, gambling, and random hookups; I numbed myself however I could. We tried to heal with distractions. And maybe, in some twisted way, it worked better than therapy ever could.

# The second thing happened that same day at her house.

After the whole pill conversation, we just sat there and talked for hours. There was this heavy, suffocating air between us when she started telling me about her life—about why she tried to end it. About why her family kept her under constant watch.

When she was young, she witnessed her aunt murder her grandmother over money. She was dragged through endless interrogations, and the system never punished the murderer. It shattered her.

But the worst thing—the thing that gutted me—came next.

She seemed to have teared up a little, saying she’d never told anyone. Not her friends, not even her therapists. But somehow, the way we bonded made her feel safe enough to finally say it:

When she was in middle school, her brother molested her. Oral. Penetration. Forced. They called it “playing.” Sometimes she didn’t want to ""play."" But it didn’t matter.

And it wasn’t just her brother. Her cousin—the one she treated like another brother—did it, too. Sometimes, they took turns. She used to dread coming home from school, knowing what was waiting for her.

I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t know how to move. It made my skin crawl.

And hearing that her brother—that brother—was still asking to borrow her car and asking her for money? It made me physically sick. They are still in contact.

I think we just sat in silence for a long, long time. Later, she kept thanking me for listening. And for the first time, I understood her. Why she sought power and love through sex. Why she was the way she was. It made tragic, horrible sense. I even told her, half-joking, ""I wish you had just told me you killed someone and had been hiding for years. That would’ve been easier to stomach.""

You read about these stories online. You hear them on the news. But hearing it firsthand—when you're cursed (or blessed) with too much empathy—it does things to you.

I don't think I've ever been the same since.

Incest makes my skin crawl more than cannibalism. I can't even watch Game of Thrones because of it. Some things are just too heavy to romanticize. Too real to consume as fiction."
80,"One more time... Perpetrator and victim of idealization.

Sometimes I wonder if I just came at the wrong time, or if I would still be tossed aside no matter the conditions.

I am a loser in this game, and no one wants to help me learn, to engage, to be able to understand and take care of their weaknesses.

I don't want to be the best at everything, I just want to be unique... The one and only. Exceptionality and differentiation is much better than announced and done merit. You can never get rid of the ashes that welcomed you to the beginning of significance, of the complex, no matter how good you could be. I lament this, but I must also understand that it is not my responsibility to compensate for what they take someone for non-existent."
81,"today I should've had to work, but I couldn't. my mental was seriously bad and all my body is aching.
I couldn't decide to I took day off, so I spent a waste time.
and even I took day off today, I had to do work with text a bit. but I could rest my body at least and specially I could be with piggy literally all the time and all the second so Im very happy.

Today was windy day, me and piggy enjoyed a sound of windy. And I laid with piggy and just spent a time.
No phone, no noise, nothing. Just spent piggy, just me and piggy time. And it was really lovely and precious moment.

And I almost gave up to today's ""To do list"", but I did it everything with piggy's help!
Piggy always says to me ""its okay, its okay, just go to slowly."" especially when I feel like everything is too much to handle. All piggy's words and piggy's smiles,  and careful gazes made my day and make me feel I can get through.

Well, I wanted to write more about what happened to me and piggy and what we been through last week and what we so struggling right now.
But running out my time.
I should go sleep and get ready for tonight soon.

I hate my job, but I can be with piggy whole time while on a work, ofc when I do performance thing then piggy and I have a bit distance but eventhough piggy always in my sight and when Im get nervous or upset something, I can always look at piggy and anytime piggy gives me a comfort.

I love love love you piggy.
You are the my reason to live. 
You are more than my everything.
Lovest piggy, my dearest piggy, my true faith piggy,
I need you and we are more than forever.
You are phenomenal, you are the PHENIX.

Hope tomorrow will be my body and mental better.
Bc I cant take day off anymore at least until 8 or 7days after, so no matter what I have to do my job. I started concern about that fact, but PHENIX PIGGY always be with me, and piggy is the reason the why I keep fighting for, so... I just try my best. Even if I failed, I will back to the shitty race with piggy's help, piggy's save.

If someone read this, or even didn't read anything, me and piggy hope and really wishing everyone stay safe and spending full of smiles and laughter and just having enjoyable time!
Wishing you all smiles :)"
82,"2025 April 27: Dear Diary,

I am barely holding on to my sanity with my current job. The only reasons I am staying are because I made friends with a coworker and the pay is quite decent. I am very grateful for these two things. However, I am also constantly bombarded with endless stupidity and rudeness from customers. It is honestly so baffling to see what is probably not even close to the fullest display of humanity's stupidity and rudeness.  
  
This is something that is constantly making me question my faith in humanity. Often I wonder if there is even any reason to get out of bed in the morning if it just means I have to interact with the masses. I say this, but I have not lost my faith in humanity. Even after every shift, witnessing all the terrible things I have seen humans do, what is more important is to remember the good that is done from humans. There are genuinely great customers that come in with kind and loving auras. It is far better to remember these customers than it is to remember the horrible ones.  
  
Another thing I must remember is that reality is a mirror. Everything that I see is my projection. Within me is the potential for great evil, but also great goodness. I want to investigate the evil with a decent, but not too big, amount of empathy. I want to see what makes people behave so stupid and cruel and how I can avoid that. Not only do I want to avoid this, but I truly want to be a source of light in the world to break free of this stupidity. Even if it is the smallest light imaginable, the atomic difference I could make might be ginormous.  
  
I would also like to align myself more with the good of humanity while also acknowledging I am just as capable to turn out cruel or stupid. Cruelty and stupidity exist within me just as kindness and intelligence do. The choice of what I want to align myself with is up to me alone. I say I want to align myself with goodness and I believe that I mean it. I am grateful that I have seen an extent of human stupidity so I can self-reflect on it. Hopefully I do not waste my potential, but that is only up to me.  
  
Sincerely,  
  
Torinico"
83,"I've been tracking my progress on paper for some time now, going to the gym, taking care of myself, handling my money. I thought of a way to share my progress to the public whilst still keeping track, I know only a small handful of people would be able to see this - so enjoy reading, be excited with me, share what you think lmao. I'm doing this for the future me, so he'll see the things I did for him, he'll thank me for not being ""selfish"", how ironic. 

Dear Future Me. -- April 28, 2025

Planning to bench 245lbs today as a topset, hoping for it to be a 7-8 rpe so I can progress the next week, I know I can do it, I just don't know how hard it'll be. I don't want it to be hard, because Ill have to build my strength for me to progress, but I forget that's the point. It being hard motivates me to try harder, where's the fun in easy.   
Anyways, I've always wanted to do skin care, and I've tried to do it, finding random skin care products around the house and using it even though it doesn't fit my skin type. I kinda hoped that it would work, but expected that it wouldn't. So I bought myself a skin care bundle, and mugwort clay mask ( i dont know what it does LOL). But I guess now I know I'm really trying. My roommate has a habit of delaying things for another time - ""I'll try bulking this summer"". Even though he could do it now so he has good momentum when summer comes. I don't know if only I have that mindset where I do it now so when the time comes where I planned to do it, I'm already doing it and I already have progress.

85,"Dear diary, I woke up very early today because I have headache last night I think it's because of volleyball training wirh my friend. And I missed the diary as well haha. Anyway, there were nothing much I had training go back home. Oh ya, I added the girl my ex colleague intro to me. She seems like a nice girl but might have some standard on man. So should I start chatting with her? 🤔 But tbh I don't think she is interested in me haha. But still should I give a try? Haiz... Idk man... 

Ok so today, as I said I woke up early and wanted to go for training for marathon but my whole body was really ache from the VB training so I think I will skip it today and set next time haha giving myself an excuse. Later, in the evening I had pickle ball session with my cousin. He brought me to join a community to play pickle ball. After the session, his friend jio us to supper and there his friend started to intro us to Amway 😆 and they even ask us to join for the class tomorrow. I think is fine la since we never go before, we will just go and listen to what we can learn from them. "
86,"It's currently April 27, sorry I forgot the date of yesterdays Log. I just, have a situation with YR, if you haven't red Log 1 yet that's just your fault. Apparently, coming from her hose friend, she got kicked out of her house because her mom found out she was gay, or Les I don't remember. I'm not against, or with gay people, but one thing I'm always against is abandoning your child. You don't just leave her to the streets, fucking asshole. Shes staying at her grandma's house. But the thing is, she hasn't told me any of this. Dante is the one that told me all this and he didn't even say everything since he kept a secret. Fuck, fuck fuck fuck, I've just been confused all week. I've been her friend since G2, and she still doesn't trusme me enough, while Dante just cries to her every month and now he's a closer friend? What the fuck did I do to deserve this? I even made a promise with her to not lie to each other, and she broke it. I now Yiu can force yourself onto peoples life, but this still hurts. I talked to his about Dante, he's understandable to mez he didn't even get mad, what a guy. I also told YR if she has something bothering her, I didn't tell her the Dante told me, she said to not worry. Not worry huh? That's what you want me to know? I need some time, time to just... I need peace is what I need. As good as it would be for me to just not give a shit, that would just make me a bad person, so I can't. I just need sometime to think about my life, why I and the people around me are like this. Or maybe I need a break, all this is so stressful, I hate it honestly, I fucking hate it all. Idk, stay safe everyone.

87,"No entiendo mucho reddit, acabo de escribir con mucha pasión mi día y se borró, bueno, escribiré de nuevo.

Hoy preparé mi primer sopita, o bueno, al menos una con caldo. Un congee, no seguí al pie de la letra la receta pero sin presumir creo que me salió mejor de lo que esperaba. Hace semanas quería preparar algo sin embargo con mi cerebro distraído y estudios no me daban mucho tiempo. Mi abuela estaba malita de salud y mi abuelo con dolor de espalda, entonces me dije:
""por qué no hacer sopita? Después de todo hay muchas diferentes, ricas y nutritivas que mejoran el ánimo, estoy seguro que habrán los ingredientes para prepararla""
Y pues, al inicio mi abuela no quería porqué era un poco tardecito, pero dijo que si no se llenaba con el lonche me diría para hacer la sopita. Levanté a mi abuelo que andaba durmiendo para preguntarle si quería también, y el aceptó para seguir durmiendo unos segundos después. Mi abuela también quería y yo con gusto hice para tres.
Me habré demorado 1 hora en terminar, comí con ellos, y me despedí para irme a dormir. Cómo dije antes, soy distraído y quería escribir esto en algún cuadernito para recordar este momento, algo parecido a un diario, pero no me funciona, usualmente se pierden o terminan como cuadernos de dibujo, y pensé qué en alguna red social también podría escribir, entonces aquí estoy! escribiendo que estoy feliz de cocinar para mí familia. Ahora es tarde entonces iré a dormir, buenas noches y si alguien está leyendo esto que es tan largo, gracias por su atención y que tenga lindos sueños! 
Aunque también puede ver esto cuando no es de noche, entonces, buenos días, buenas tardes, buenas noches y que tenga un buen día.

(Mi duda es si en esta comunidad puedo escribir español, solo ví que hablan inglés 😓) por si acaso, lo traduzco y digo: Have a nice day! We all need some encouragement every day, no matter how small it may be. Now for me it's a goodnight everyone!"

I went on a date today with someone who I’ll call Jessie. We met at a diner and had lunch. After that we went to the antique store I went to with Ed around a month ago. I bought a beer stein and a vintage poster advertising a fortune teller. It was a very chill time and I am grateful to have had a day like this. I am excited for the next chance I get to see them.

89,"It's 1:30, and I can't sleep. I tried some music, and came across this beautiful song. Rises the Moon, it makes me feel something. I just want a girlfriend, someone who loves me and would spend the rest of they're life with me. I know that's very irresponsible for someone in high school. But, the song makes me feel that right in the center of my heart, no one in my arms, no ones hands are with mine. It's not just sex anymore, I want someone that truly means something."
90,"is it just so difficult to find a job with average salary and working 5d in a week?
everyone said it is the environment made us suffer from surviving,we go to college,4 years learning one major and go into a totally different job field after graduation.

91,"There are conversations,
there are faces,
there are smiles that cross my path...

None of them reach me.
None of them touch the place you touched.

I can laugh,
I can speak,
I can even feel the kindness of strangers,
but it is not you.

No one else carries the same gravity.
No one else shakes my spirit loose and stitches it back with their name.

I know the world says to keep walking,
to let the past be the past,
but you are not the past to me.
You are the unspoken space inside me that still breathes,
still longs,
still remembers.

Nothing compares to you.
No excitement is as sweet,
no message as grounding,
no silence as full.

I can live, I will live,
but my soul will always hum your name in the quiet.
Always.

Nothing can erase what was written between us,
and nothing will ever outshine
what you awakened in me.

Nothing compares to you.
Nothing..."
92,"The weather's humid, so I need to dehumidify, but my skin feels like cracked, dry land."
93,"I don't know how often I will post about this, but today I felt I need to get at least something off my chest and ease my mind. Even thinking about what to write is a bit daunting.

The answer is I feel like I'm truly nothing, slowly suffocating under the weight of every version of me that has existed or that is impossible in this lifetime. Every thought of what I am pushes the current me, my ego, into the grave.

What is the slightly longer answer then? To put it into a perspective from Warframe, a game I have played for over 10 years at this point, I feel like the Drifter before they were set free from the spiral. My days are surrounded with emotions that I can barely comprehend. I can see the effects they are having on my life but not the way to navigate through them. The only bits of joy I have is reading web novels, playing video games, watching YouTube, and talking to my older brother. Anything else I have to deal with is only tolerable, with varying parameters. I rarely turn down a shot of alcohol because feeling any emotion was a better alternative than nothing. This indifference inside me is encroaching my entire being and I can't drown it out yet, there is no acceptable reason in my mind for me to do that.

What am I?

* A man, even if I don't think myself deserving of having a gender most days.
* 23 years old, born, raised, and living in the US.
* Black and damn near had no father figure. Dad was in jail for most of my childhood, so when he did get out of jail right before I went to middle school, I didn't know how to interact with him.
* Been with Asperger's my entire life, and it feels like it's getting a bit worse.
* Even if someone says I'm handsome, I'll just blush and smile it away. I'll forget it anyways because I don't think I am above a 6 on a good day.
* The guy that everyone ""knew"" in high school, but not overwhelmingly popular. I wasn't bullied physically or mentally.
* Even after I graduated from one of the ""best"" high schools in my state, thinking just stresses me out.
* Personally, witnessed a death that I felt like I could have prevented.
* Money? Can't say I was ever blessed with such a thing.

Some ""minor"" examples of my indifference:

* If I didn't have things to pay for, like bills and college tuition, I rather not have a job and stay home all day.
* I don't like the concept of dating. I rather stay single. Pretty much aromanticism.
* I have a glaring lack of interest towards sex with another person. Not to say I don't have libido, but it is not high enough to actively seek it with other people.
* Talking about my deep-rooted feelings to people close to me is rarer than a blue moon.
* Talking to people... I would rather not if I can help it.

And that is how I feel today."
94,"2025 April 25: Dear Diary,

Today I watched a video about how someone witnessed a child asking their guardian a question about the spending power of world currencies. The child asked why they got fewer candies in Japan than in India but with the same amount of money. The guardian told the child to shut up and be grateful they could get candy. What the child meant was the question of why different currencies can buy more or less things in different countries. It was an appeal to curiosity that was stomped out of the child by an adult who was to stupid to realize a child was not being ungrateful.  
  
Comments on the video suggest that adults do not realize that children are human beings and not objects. Adults often project themselves onto children and when the child does not match up with their expectations they get angry. This is something I feel is obvious. Many children are told to give up on their dreams and focus on hard work and making money. Being creative, curious, and yourself is unacceptable to many adults.  
  
Just because something is productive does not make it useful. Albert Einstein said that imagination is more important than knowledge and I agree. People should not bring children into the world to make them suffer, but to let them grow into the best versions of themselves. Sometimes this will require discipline, but giving children honest answers about their questions is something that is helpful. The fact that adults think the questions children ask are annoying shows just how stupid many of them are.  
  
Sincerely,

95,"I think I did it again. I got so entirely wrapped up in an idea that I forgot what was real. The reality of my life is so different than the movies that play in my head. I thought that this was the answer the thing I’ve been missing, and maybe that’s the entire problem. No matter how much I’ve grown or changed I still always feel as though something is missing. But nothing is. This is just life. It never truly gets better or worse. There are no pivotal moments. It’s just an ongoing ride with no stops except one. I make the decisions, and I face the consequences, but I am not whole and never will be because there is nothing missing. I’m mentally ill and exhausted and hiding behind current fixations or ideations creates a sense of safety and desirability that make me feel valued. It’s entirely unfair to put that kind of pressure on another human being. I shouldn’t need outside validation to make me feel whole. I’m here, I’m alive, I’m breathing, and that’s life. I’ll just keep living. No experiences or person is going to make death any easier to face. It won’t make life any easier to live. I am happy most days and I am safe. That should be enough. Right?"
96,"Actually, I know I don't love playing mobile games that much. It's just a way to find something that releases dopamine and distracts me."
97,"Dear diary, nothing special in the morning, I had an interview at 3pm. So I prepared a little bit before the interview. I think I did quite ok in the interview. Not sure if I'm able to get the job with the salary I desire. Anyway, job is job, although is something that I don't dislike, but life is like that? 

After that I drove an hour to play badminton with my old colleagues. And as expected... They introduced their colleague to me. Omg it was so paiseh and awkward man... But luckily she is considered pretty. We went for dinner after the session. We chat a lot then one thing funny was one of my colleagues forgot that he drove to office, when he go back, we left his car in the office and took public transport back home. And by the time he reached his station, he couldn't find his car and forgot his car is in the office... Omg he is so funny and forgetful hahaha 🤣. 

Anyway, after I knew this girl, I had a lot of thought on my way back. Whether should I start a new relationship or not... I mean, she is pretty, she is nice so far, but I don't think I have the confidence to start a new one as in my biggest weak point is being poor and unable to support her maybe? I mean even if don't need to support her, but also need bread for dating right? She seems like a high maintenance person tho having CK bag, then her face not very bad but she already taking med for her skin. Hmmm 🤔 maybe I'm just not ready to start or maybe I'm just not confident to start. Oh, another thing was my health conditions, yea... I mean she knew already I have this, and is good also atleast she knew I have this condition and she really has to bear with it. Nvm la lets take things slowly ba. "
98,"Haven't done one of these in awhile, it's currently April 25.So Ive checked up on YR a couple times, haven't talked to her for a couple days now and I miss her tbh. If you dont know what I'm talking about try and read Log 1 and 2. But I just have nk one to talk to, physically I've been doing decent, hygiene is great, acne is healing very well, skin is healing a bit. But I have no one to talk to on a deep level, the only person I wanted to talk to was YR, and she still needs some space. I miss her, I miss her voice, her kindness, affection, I miss her so so much. I've also been suspicious about this one thing. Right before YR stoped talking to anyone and needed some space, she stopped talking to me. And (And I know this seems very toxic and weird... And it is, god fuck me) I asked Dante about YR and if she was talking to him and he said yes, I was like ""wtf did I do!?"". But Dante beng the kinds but stubborn wing man that he is, asked YR about it. That's when she needed some space from the world. Whenever I check up on her, she keeps saying that ""It's not just me, I need a break from the whole world"" But since that first part I've been super sceptical. I actually haven't been so worried about YR, but it just sprung up on my mind again avouple hours ago and I feel that bad feeling in my heart again. But yeah, I just miss her, I hope she's not lying to me, and I hope she's healing well, I love her. Thank you, take care love yourself have a nice day and remember. Do t give up skeleton "
99,"lol just found out people that associate with my girlfriend that say they are my friend don’t even add me to their close friends story when I’ve literally hung out with them so many times. I’m so done with people and I’m done with people exuluding me or just tolerating me for the sake of my girlfriend. Not the first and not the last. Should’ve known better and should move on form people period. Fuck these people lmao 
Bitch if we ain’t really friends for real just keep me out of your life I don’t understand being an acquaintance when I’ve done and showed up just as much as my girlfriend. Form this day forward I will stop trying with people. No matter what happens in between here and the day of my death I will protect my heart and sanity. 
I don’t deserve to be on the side lines. I do not deserve to beg and plead for things others close to me do not have to beg for. I’m funny, sweet, kind, a good listener and communicator, I care with all my heart and that’s for me and only for me from this day forward. 
Dude, understand that people just don’t get it and never will. Accept it and live for you. Realize the things you have to say and believe are for you and God. People will never care because they don’t have to. And it’s simple as that. 
It can be lonely, most times it is but as long as you have yourself you are never alone and that will have to be enough. We alone can give satisfaction and a sense of understanding. People will only continue to exlude and tolerate you for reasons unknown but not knowing the reason for things is apart of life. Most things humans do not know but we try hard to understand when it is not necessary. 
Someday we will be completely alone with no family. None. Just you. Only you even if people say they are there. They will not. They say it for themselves not you and the meaning behind what they say is simply empty. 
This day will come and it is inevitable. I guess some people are just built to not have many connections in a lifetime and it’s a lifelong battle realizing it isn’t anything I did wrong, it’s just who I am, a natural people repellant. In other words people do not pick up with I have to offer, they don’t care and that’s all it’ll ever be. I’ve heard the right people will come around when the time is right or they will find me blah blah blah. If this was to happen it would’ve already happened. At this point it’s condescending and just not true. 
It’s sad to say but evidence and the truth goes hand in hand. I cannot continue to act blind just to sit here and Analyze how and why this is the reality. It does me no good and it does not serve me. "
100,"( There are mentions of sh and extreme emotional pain in this. I dont know where to post this, so this subreddit is my best guess. Pleasebe nice, im 17 and alone with my broken mind) Im writing this here bc no one I know has reddit and I just feel a pent up need to spill everything that sucks in my life. I know people out there have it worse and these are champagne problems, but i dont care. Pardon my extremely language as i will not be censoring myself in this. Fuck, this sucks. To start, I am in an open, poly relationship with my long-distance lover and a few other guys that also live far away. Yeah yeah, what an issue, but shush. My lover, lets call him L, has another girl, who actually lives near him. Im fine with that, whatever. But she has been with him less than a month and he already has plans to marry her, have children, etc. And it hurts because he has never ever planned or ask if I would want to marry him, tho ive been with him since October, through multiple third partners, and through multiple absolute breakdowns of his.  Im not complaining that its been rough, because i want to be that rock for him, his guardian angle, but he told me the only reason he offers the other girls marriage and not me is because he knows ill be there. And it hurts so bad, because I want him to not think of me as an item to take for granted, but as one to cherish for its resilience to stay by his side. I also know the obvious solution,  ""shake his faith in you,"" but no, i cant do that. It is like if you reat against one wall everyday because it is comfortable and has always supported you, then one day the wall cracks and leans, you will never fell comfortable with that wall again. That is me. I am his wall that he leans on and tho some days he takes a different path, he always comes back to lean on that wall. I dont want him to forget that i am still hold so much force, but i dont want to throw a pity party on how much i hold. How much I just want him to wake up and see me not as a constant, but as a miracle that he has to hold onto before it breaks itself apart. ""Wow, how egotistical to call yourself a miracle"", yeah it is egotistical and selfish.  I am an evil person, and no matter how many people say im good or im kind, deep down i know im evil. The self inflicted scars on my thighs remind me of how evil and selfish I am. How much i want to show him the scars i have cut and the capsules I swallow to keep moving forward, to prevent making a horrible decision that would ruin everyone around me. Don't worry, I would never do that, not while he still leans on me. I will keep each scrap and each chip on the other side of the wall, where he cant see. He will never see how frail his wall is, because if he did, he would never rest his glorious curls upon it, never shed his bitter sweet tears beside it, would never shine his soulful eyes upon each brick and stone, memorizing the way the light bounces off of its surface. All he would see is a broken wall, unable to block even the most shallow of breezes. Little does he know, that each time he leans against the wall, the wall leans into him. Uses him as a way to rebalance its bricks, give its mortar a moment of reprieve.  But thats all it is, a moment. I promise I will never wnd it all, never make that most horrible decision, as long as he leans on me, but the morning that he decides the is no longer to his liking and he has found a more comfortable place to rest, I will, I will fall into a pile of bricks and compost, to be reused in the making of a new life, be it a tree, a flower, or the home of the putrid maggot. The wall would blame the man as it fell, only hope that he finds a better place to rest his head."
101,"i miss you so much. i wish i could forget. one day i will. i can feel myself carrying the sadness all day and just allowed myself to let it go and cry tonight. 
i wonder about you. what are you doing? what do you eat? are you okay? are you still hurting? how are things are home now? do think about me still? did you forget everything? did you forget me? 

i try to remember your face. it’s weird, the way your face and eyes feel etched in my brain. yet if i think about it too much, i can’t quite remember what you look like. it’s all a blur. maybe one day ill forget. 

your voice keeps replaying in my head. it’s like when i fall in love with a song, i dont want to listen to anything else. i imagine conversations between us in my head, what your voice would sound like, your laugh. your laugh. 

right now, i can’t forget you. i wish i could. i want to be more angry, and maybe one day, i will be. in fact, today, i feel myself lose a bit of my softness and realize you’ve disrespected me with your silence and cold demeanour. maybe all of the treasures i’ve collected of you, i’ll let go of one day and stop cherishing them. before i do, i’ll write a love novel on it, but this time, i’ll finish it. it won’t be a shooting star. fleeting, shattering into a million pieces of dust in the night sky. like it never even happened. 

this is what happens to people like me. people who seek safety in other people. i always have, and they hurt me every time. i wish my demons didn’t reveal themselves to me. there are so many things that trouble me about myself, as i realize how fucked up i am. 

i almsot feel like i forced this sadness out of myself, but maybe ill wake up in the morning and it won’t hurt for a bit. "
102,"2025 April 24: Dear Diary,

Most conspiracy theories are outside the realm of possibility and exist nowhere close to reality. Being open-minded is one thing, but being so open-minded that your brain falls out of your head is just stupid. Skepticism of the status quo is something that I can appreciate, but conspiracy theorists are not skeptical of the claims they make themselves. Questions should be asked about everything and every claim should be put to some level of scrutiny and we also must take an honest and unbiased look at the answers to our questions.  
  
Was the moon landing faked by Stanley Kubrick in order for the United States to “beat” the Soviet Union in the Space Race? Of fucking course it wasn’t. How do I know the moon landing happened? I took an honest look at the evidence of both claims and had a mature understanding that it would have been harder to fake the moon landing and have everyone who participated stay quiet than it would have been to actually send three people to the moon. The larger the conspiracy would be to orchestrate, the less likely it is to be true. People like to gossip so if something did happen, it would have been leaked by someone credible and not some random nobody.  
  
The other thing I hate about conspiracy theories is that some of them get inches away from the truth, but decide to stop short because they are not about challenging the status quo, but about providing an excuse for bigotry. In reality there is a group of people who have the government and media in their pockets. These people are not Jews, Freemasons, or reptilians, but are just billionaires. The billionaire oligarchs are not even hiding the fact that they are the ones behind the corruption. The fact that anyone can blame any other group says a lot about their delusions than it does about them wanting to get to the truth.  
  
Billionaires want people to be divided against each other so we do not rise up against them. They would rather us be mad at some minority group they can scapegoat. This leads to disastrous results and never anything good. A good quote that I heard was “anti-semitism is just anti-capitalism for morons.” This quote captures how conspiracy theorists do not care about the truth like they claim, but either want to provide scapegoats for their bigotry or are delusional and need services for their mental health.

103,"Dear diary, as usual I started my day by job hunting. Then I was really bored today and I started learning a new language which is German. But now that I think I should start learning Cantonese. Then, I had a dinner with my friends and one of them I really long time no see her le. She had depression last time and now she looks pretty good. She was really thin last time and now she is quite fit already. Good to see her doing well. We had a good time. Then later she went off earlier. And left 4 of us which is closer. We had a deep talk until 12am haha and finally we ended. "
104,"Going back to the seaside late night!

Staying at the same hotel, a beautiful dress.

I'm gonna be 32 and realized my oppsie on the post I had originally created when I was seeking love. 

I'm pretty sure I mentioned to you that I was 31. Hehehe 🤭

Well I hope your doing well, I hope life has gotten easier and your calmer, sleeping well in bed, enjoying the gloomy spring, and making sure you don't get stuck again in the middle of nowhere.😄🥀

I will keep this traditional memorial for our love. It existed. I won't deny that truth, it may still exist within both of us, and for me forever. 

Even if it fades with time, every year on our bittersweet anniversary I'll make it back to the Pier and release a *Biodegradable Letter* that will fade and break free into the sea. If for any reason I cannot get the paper on time I will pluck a natural garden rose from my rose bush. Then surrender it to the sea were it will drift away into the ocean in memory of what once was.

My memories of you will never die.
You stole pieces of me that I will never get back nor do I want them back.

Keep them.
Let them remind you of what it is to be loved.

Don’t fight it anymore.
It will only destroy you if you don’t accept the truth of us.
Grieve if you must, outside of your reality,
but please… don’t lie to your inner self.
I don’t want you to suffer any more than we already have
in this life we lived apart.
We created something beautiful, a world I never believed someone else would want with me.
You made my dreams come true.

For my birthday,
my only wish is that yours come true too.


*You were my new wish, and now you will forever be.* 💋🥀

*She stood at the edge of the world,
where the sea sighs like a lover too far to touch.*

*Her dress, the one he never saw, fluttered like breath,
a soft rebellion against the night.*

*Above her, the moon lit the dark like a memory
she could never forget.*

*In that very moment,
miles, oceans, worlds away,
he felt her.*

*His chest ached without knowing why.
He stepped outside into the hush of night,
under a different sky,
yet the same moonlight.*

*He looked up. So did she.*

*For a breathless second,
they were there together within the silence of familiar stars.*

*Connected by
a shimmering tether,
a spiritual kiss.*

*He didn’t say her name,
but the stars did.*

*She didn’t call out,
but the waves carried her silence to him
like a secret folded in seafoam.*

*She whispered to the water,
“Take this memory,”
and dropped it
into the tide.*

*It spun gently, carried by currents
the way her love once carried him through loneliness.*

*They met like this often, without words,
without time.*

*Spirit to spirit.*

*Light to light.*

*Until one year,
she didn’t come.*

*Not to the pier.*

*Not to the shore.*

*Not even to the moonlight.*

*As he stepped outside that night,
his heart stilled.*

*The wind kissed his face.
A familiar whisper in a language only the soul understands.*

*Her essence gone within the tides,
not as a drowning,
but as a returning.*

*A permanent memory to the eternal.*

*Now, she is everything and nothing.*

*She is the sea’s hush, the soft sigh of waves on sand.*

*She is the shimmer in the moonlight that finds your skin and feels like love dancing to a loom night.*

*Their story became air.*

*Their love, the wind’s whisper.*

*And if you listen close,
you’ll hear it too, carried in the lines of a song
still spinning on an old Vinyl Record.*

*🎼“Do you want to go to the seaside?
I’m not trying to say that everybody wants to go…
But I fell in love at the seaside…”🎶*

*Even if I go, I want you to know I was here. That I loved you. That I still do.*

105,"The group members were being so negative about not having a knack for writing that I eventually didn't even want to reply anymore.
When you put in the same level of effort as everyone else, you're really only mastering the fundamentals."
106,"4/24/25 ->Dear Diary  I can't seem to let him go.
I was bragging one day last week to some relatives how the sunset is nothing compared to where we were located and by golly guess what,  the last two nights the colors have took my breath away. I took some photos I wish I could share them with you like before. Thought how blessed I am to be around family
 - Something awoken me

Remember me saying or making references  how blessed or how lucky we were ?on how  I'm sure you heard me say it - 
POINT IS->  I don't think I ever told you how blessed I was for you coming into my life when you did. I'm 100% sure I would have never done or had the opportunity to do all that traveling and creating these memories that I share with you. In other words I don't believe I would have lived half this life without you-I am forever blessed and I mean that from the bottom of my heart forever and always blessed. 

To the random people how do you move forward after a long term relationship at the good old age at 48-because we're coming up on 2 months and I have got to move on!
 I feel like I have stepped in quicksand and it has a slow pull on me each day. Everyday brings more dread more bad news. I feel like I have used all of my good faith, or the good luck charm has worn out now. I no longer feel blessed with anything. Everything seems to be slowly slipping away. "
107,"Tonight is another day of thriving in the night like a bat while my eyes grow tired and dry. My mind is on high alert. While my damn foot keeps getting stuck between the sheets. 

Demon under my bed have you come to take me! 👀

My heart twinkle dances like it ate a box of Twinkies.... did I... Maybe... Maybe I did. Bad tummy! Don't you growl at me!

Where was I... Right! Insomnia, I've kinda had this issue since as long as I remember. 

At 5 years old I'd wake up in the middle of the night and crawl out of bed staring at the creepy tree shadows. While I sat cross legged on the floor I used my own shadow to poke the tree creatures, playfully pretending there was an invisible dimension that opened when night fell.

I was the guardian of the night while the Snorlax's were far in the depths of sleep paralysis. I had to protect them at all cost from the tree creatures and living room demons. These were my usual nights, no one ever knew I was awake stealing cheese and whole tomatoes from the fridge. My mom eventually caught on that if we had no mice it was probably the mini size leprechaun in the room as the bites on the tomatoes she was gonna use to make salsa were that of a child not a non existent mouse who managed to dodge my mom's flying chancla assassin skills. 

At 12 I tested my cooking skills still walking mummy coming out of her tombstone at night, while I made some quesadillas and sometimes a sandwich, I took on drawing to pass the time. 

I began drawing The Legend of Zelda recreation of my character meeting Link and falling in love. Heeheeheehee

.....Yes I had a crush on Link....Who didn't 🤷🏻‍♀️

I would sometimes also write in my diary, this stopped my second year of middle school. I had a huge crush on a boy named Anthony and my friends I guess read my diary and mistaken my Anthony for their Anthony. Funny thing is their Anthony actually had a crush on me. He was really shy so he just mumbled a few words got red and walked off embarrassed. He would occasionally say hi but that's about it. My friends read out my love letters to Anthony and that was extra embarrassing for me. I stopped writing in my diary after that. 

Well here I am day dreaming about a man...oh man life Is crazy...I used to crush on boys and now I'm a woman in love with a man. 

My heart flutters at how time just passes us and still I am a vampire of the night. 

Heeheeehee, maybe one day I will get sleep until then guess I'm back to writing my shenanigans. :)

Goodnight sleep paralyzed World 💋 I'll protect you from shadow demons while you sleep with my assassin chancla torpedo... 👀

*Hiyah! Kahhh! Wataaaaahggggoottt Channncllllaa!*

108,"2025 April 23: Dear Diary,

 As an American I have always been told that individuality is the greatest value a country can achieve. What greater freedom is there than being on one’s own? Not like the other countries where conformity is a great value.

While this statement is not untrue, it does lack a lot of nuance. No doubt, individuality brings forth the true greatest value, not freedom, but creativity. When one is able to think for themselves, they are able to find new solutions to challenges never thought of before. Thinking outside the box leads to better outcomes than having your hand held. This does not work for everyone, but is able to work for those who have attained the skills of critical thinking.  
  
Of course individuality is great. However, there is an argument for collectivism as well. The main tragedy of collectivism is that it breeds conformity. This does not have to be the case, but it tends to be. The greatest benefit of collectivism is that the whole of society prospers when everything is ordered. Contrasted with societies obsessed with individualism, like the United States, which sees a few people own billions of dollars while the rest of society suffers in meaningless jobs. Yes, despite the greatness of individuality, it has failed us.  
  
It does not have to be this way though. I feel that individuality can be used for the greater good of the collective. If creative solutions are found by a free-thinking individual, why should they not want to share it with an open-minded collective. This would require some selflessness from the individual and some open-mindedness from the collective. Obviously not every creative solution would be a good one. This is why testing to find which solutions work best should be taken into account.  
  
Maybe I am a bit naïve and human nature can never get to a point of selflessness, creativity, and open-mindedness as described. I do not think this is the case, however. Plenty of societies have a good balance of collectivism and individualism, so why not the United States? Balance tends to be a great tool when confronted with poles like these. The greed of individualism and conformity of collectivism should not be taken as their whole. Rather, the creativity of individualism and the compassion of collectivism should be something to be focused on.  
  
Sincerely,

109,"Dear diary, as usual, I started my day with job hunting. Now the job is getting lesser... I only applied for a few, I really scared that I cannot get the job soon. I will have one interview session on Friday hopefully I can do well in the interview. I continued reading the book, and the second chapter was about life is not a competition. Well I totally agree but is really hard not to compare because people tends to compare a lot. If there is no competition there is no stress. But if there is no stress, the improvement will be lesser. So, how do we do it under the conditions of no stress but the improvement is still there. Yes, the book says one must always learn to overcome the task by improving. Hence, just improve yourself without comparison. 

I also continued watching the drama that I stopped half way in the past ""welcome to samdalri"" it is a good drama kind of relate to my current situation, which I am in the position of coming back from Sg after failing to stay there due to stress. So, it kind of embarrassing to come back but I just don't care no more. 

And also I had a chat with my mom, about the things with my ex, and she also wants me to find a new girl... I just broke up man... But I think I'm ok to start finding already but I'm currently jobless, I don't have the courage to look for a new relationship tho... Anyway 顺其自然吧... "
110,"It feels like one of my teeth is probably beyond saving, so I'll just have to readjust my bite."
111,"It all started with something simple I was filming. A police  was speaking with a man who raised his fist at him. The man was shouting clearly aggressive. It felt important to document what was happening so I pulled out my camera and started recording.

Barely a minute passed before a policeman approached me and in a harsh and commanding tone demanded that I delete the video. Moments later a policewoman  came too. Together without explanation they took my ID documents and told me they would return them only when they saw fit. The entire interaction was rude humiliating, and aggressive as if I had committed a crime by simply filming.

I wasn’t even allowed to retrieve my own documents. They were literally playing with them refusing to give them back, as if they belonged to them. I felt pressured and under that pressure I did what they demanded  I deleted the video. Not just from the gallery, but also from the recently deleted folder. So the footage of them talking to the man  the one who was yelling and raising his hand is gone. I erased it.

When I said Im going to call the police they smirked in my face and said we are the police  
 But I called anyway.  
 I reported that  another police  had taken my documents and were acting aggressively. I even dictated the badge number of the policewoman  who had been particularly rough with me.

 then policeman  took off his badge. Silently. Just removed it  and that was it.  
After that they returned my documents and started quickly leaving the scene. It looked like they were trying to escape as if they knew they'd crossed a line.

But it didn’t stop there.  
The policewoman the same one who had taken my documents  hit me again when she saw that I had turned the camera back on. The policeman  then approached me, threatening me with handcuffs.  
But I kept filming.  
And on the video you can clearly see him walking toward me and then once he realizes I’m filming he quickly and smoothly hides the handcuffs.

Throughout all of this I was shouting loudly that Im going to the police to write a report. I said it out loud, for everyone to hear.

112,"Well, so what? Title is rather kinda random so never mind. Eating for the night like I always do. Running away from the tension in my mind. The same since I have any memory so about 6 years old or earlier. Everything changes but not this. Thats the way it goes right. Tension everywhere all the time why? Overstimulated? actually writing this is nonsense, too much typing. so im lazy? or efficient? surely im efficient like one of the most efficient humans in the world. but i never will put extra effort, everything so efficient just so I farm more pleasure with less effort, thats me. you can say thats everyone but well yeah then everyone is fucked, im just super fucked. okay maybe not everyone cause there are people in this world who are willing to put the actual effort and do things they 'dont feel like doing'. I was doing those but  it was too painful to wake up when i want to sleep and to resist eating food i want to eat. i convinced myself i dont have to fight my own senses. maybe im right? maybe not, maybe its just different, a choice. now after i ate it all, i feel peaceful that i dont have to fight the urge no more. yet mind still tensed but somehow bearable. its all about the urge. now i feel like i wanna travel back in time and not eat this but its done. so i dont want to do it again but then i have to face that unbearable tension and chaos in my mind. lets see"
113,"i think i forgot how to write about my feelings. im just gonna dump everything here.

so K never liked me, and im upset. im not upset because of his feelings but because what he did after rejecting me. was it like i was some puppet to him? he tells me “im chill, but he needs help asking out M” what. the. fuck. is that a real thing to say? were u never taught like empathy or how to read someones feelings. i literally told him i had liked him since OCTOBER. what gave him the idea that i would be a good wingman? no i am not your friend. no i am not going to set you up with the girl you PROMISED me u didnt like. do you know how unfair that is to me? u knew. you fucking KNEW i liked you, i had heard you say it out loud. you told me that i could “look at you as much as i want” and that you “made your friends stop making fun of me” ??? what do you think i am supposed to get from that? and now, hes disappeared from the lunch table. sure im pissed, but now its just like hes gone. i cut the contact, i finally snapped and told him to leave me alone. he said “my bad” and has no longer tried to make contact. but why would he leave the table? i just dont get it. i hate him and he sucks but i also miss him. i miss his smell and how he made me laugh and blush and how he would defend me. i dont think anyone gets it actually because this was the first time i ever saw someone truly liking me. it just hurts. everytime i see him its like my stomach twists in knots and i wanna run away. its not fair at all. 

i told myself i liked A, i didnt. sure shes pretty, we are kinda close and she likes the same things as i do. i dont like her. she found out i told J. i told J because i had been talking loudly about it to get K jealous. yea that didnt work. now ive been trying to go through with the plans we made and it just seems like shes uncomfortable around me. i cant clarify hey i said i liked u because i was jealous and stupid and trying to get someone to notice me, do you know how bad that is? and when i first told L and R there was some weird exchange between the two of them that made me think L likes me

i hate feelings so bad they make me wanna die, i know it sounds hypocritical and stupid because all i did was talk about K but for once i wanna ignore crushes and ignore like and just be a person. im afraid of loving anyone, i hurt everyone i touch. 

speaking of that

**FRIEND GROUP** all hates me now, found out from W. i honestly shouldnt be surprised but it just hurts. **FRIEND GROUP** was my safe space when i was trying to better myself and try to make a new me, and then suddenly it was infected with my past and it just wasnt good at all. i know i shouldnt be mad at P. what i did to him was unforgivable, there is nothing that can make it better. i left the group because even though nothing ended bad, he had become so active there was no way to avoid it. i have now found out that everyone hates me. what am i supposed to think other than that P aired out our past and turned everyone against me? i shouldnt get the right to be upset because this is something they shouldve known during my time there. but after i left? what is the point? im sorry im pissed that you turned my only friends against me. W says she doesnt hate me but theres something there i can feel it.

im not making it up. i can tell i make her uncomfortable and i dont know what to do. i sound like a shit person the way i drag her on but god i dont wanna lose W. i want to get away from my past so desperately, but i cant lose her. shes all i have left, and i thought we were okay. there was some bond between us that said we had eachothers backs in everything. does she know that P talked shit on her? does anyone know how P made several fake accounts and a fake personality just to see if i had been talking about him? if P was comfortable telling everyone what had happen, does that not seem like he is not actually still that effected by it? if he can go around telling the story then why does he still act like im repeating my actions today? i tried to talk everything out. do you know what i was told ? he had been negatively affected by my presence regardless of my current actions and it wasnt fair to himself. you know what i said ? that is completely reasonable, im sorry we couldnt work this out, goodbye. what else do you want from me? its not fucking fair. not at all. i tried. i tried so hard. i wanted more than anything for you to forgive me. why cant anyone see that? i wanted it to be fixed. and the fact that he got mad at me for “trying to ignore it” when i was told that he didnt think about it anymore and he believed i had changed. why would you lie to me if you didnt want me to be on the same page as you. hello? am i fucking insane or something because thats not how you deal with something. yea you can change your mind just dont be fucking mad at me when you mislead me into thinking things are okay. 

i dont wanna get up and go to school, my room is full of bugs and i hate the feeling of my skin.

and i have no one to talk to.

i cant talk to W because then im trying to ruin their relationship with P. i cant talk to my new friends because im not close enough to them. L wouldnt understand me. i have nobody. P can go around and tell everyone the story while i sit here and rot with it inside of me. i feel my body slowly breaking down as i hold all this in and i dont know what to do.   "

115,"2025 April 22: Dear Diary,

Over the past few weeks I have had contradictory thoughts roaming through my head. Nothing matters, but also everything matters. Every cause has an effect and every action has a consequence, but why care? It is obvious that every cause has an effect, but objectively none of it matters. The only things that matter are what we as human beings choose to make matter.  
  
With this knowledge I would rather focus on the things that I like and be grateful for them. I would like to spread more gratitude throughout the world and change the world for the better, even if it is at an atomic scale. If nothing matters then why not make the world a bit more pleasant?  
  
Whenever I think of the futility of life I get more motivated to do good things. When I stop caring about anything in life I, paradoxically, take action to improve things. No longer should I concern myself with what other people think of me. Their thoughts do not matter. I will listen to constructive criticism and think for myself if it is accurate, but I am done with letting people’s opinions of me shape my actions.  
  
The moment I lose any concern for what others think of me, the better I am able to forge myself into the greatest I can become. I do not want to become great out of some superficial appeal for flattery. What would that accomplish? Instead I want to become great so I can do great things for others and promote greatness in others.  
  
I have a bit of a way to go before I am fully there, but it is good I recognize the path I am on. Strangely I have to eliminate my care for the world in order to make improvements. I do not have enough hubris to believe the changes I can make will be grandiose, but I am hopeful that my atomic changes can bring positivity into the world. I am hopeful humanity can be led down the path of creativity and self-reflection. These are the two qualities I find most important in life.  
  
Sincerely,  
  
Torinico"
116,"Yesterday I felt as though I had rediscovered the meaning of life. And I remembered that I am he as you are he as you are me and I am the noble sea cow. 

And the tragicomic human condition was all a big joke that we were the butt of. But only for a moment, in the astronomical scheme of things. A dream we would eventually wake from. And emerge some place better -- where we'd been before. 

Laughing. And reflecting on what a bad trip that was. 

And it all made sense. 

And I was walking on air. 

But today I am in despair. 

It is as though I have been stabbed in the chest. It feels as though everything is on the verge of crumbling down. Feels as though I have failed, monumentally, at everything. 

Sense of impending doom. 

I don't want to be at work today. 

I feel like I can barely function. "
117,"Dear diary, I didn't do much today, again I started my morning routine with job hunting again. Then again, I started a new book "" The courage to be disliked"" this book is quite interesting as in the concept is quite new. The whole book was a conversation in between the youth and philosopher. There are 5 parts in the book and I completed just 1st part. 

After reading I just forgot a lot of things from the book omg haha 😂. Anyway one thing I know is that there is no trauma, as in the trauma is caused by the past and we live with the trauma to have a goal. So, as long as we change the goal be brave to change the goal then is fine. But easier say than doing. Because people always choose not to change. We can have emotion but we can control it. A very good example is while you are scolding your child and suddenly and phone call and you will have to change your angry tone to polite tone. You can control your emotions, so you don't have to be angry but I think sometimes angry is a tool. When educating your children I think you don't necessarily need to be angry and let them know but is a good tool to let them know it is serious and don't play play with it. "
118,"While foraging for food in garbage, I found a cool‐looking hat. It was white, with a small black symbol in the center above the bill. The symbol is a triangle with a circle inside, and a vertical line connecting the top to the bottom ‐ a third eye. I brought it home & washed it in some shampoo. When looking closer, I saw a small trademark symbol connected to the bottom‐right corner, and found online it's an Eye of Providence. Being sensitive to symbolism, I had some uncertainty for what to do with it at that point. I dislike wearing baseball caps, so don't want it. I also don't really want to leave it for any stranger to pick up, or throw it away again. Instead, I'm going to bring it to a local statue of Jesus and put it on his head, while looking for food again. Buddhists have told me stories before of followers putting objects on a statue‐Buddha's head to protect him from rain; this is both similar & different to that."
119,"Last night, something inside me felt heavy — no reason, no drama, just a quiet kind of low. The kind where you don’t really want to talk, but you also don’t want to stay in the same room with your thoughts.

So I went to a rooftop café.  
No one to meet. No plan. Just me and the open sky above a city that never pauses.

The place was softly lit, and the music—oh, the music—felt like it knew exactly how to hold space for my heart. Not loud. Not sad. Just… aesthetic. Thoughtful. Like someone whispering, *“You’re not alone, even in your solitude.”*

I sat there with a warm cup of coffee, watching the city glow beneath me, headlights dancing like stars on the move. I didn’t scroll, I didn’t write, I didn’t even think much. I just let the moment happen.

And strangely, I started to feel better, not fixed, but softer.  
More held. More okay with being not okay.

We often talk about self-care as if it were a checklist. But sometimes, it’s just showing up for yourself in small ways — a quiet corner, a hot drink, and music that speaks the language of your soul.

Last night, I didn’t chase happiness.  
I just let peace find me."
120,"i do try to limit my self-indulgent fantasies, but i still have thoughts of scenarios where i'm the hero or a tragic figure or, you know, dying or on my death bed.  for a long time, i really didn't fantasize about much else and i think that's because it was a form of suicidal ideation and i've been clinically depressed real bad.  i am diagnosed and on meds but this has been persistent and chronic for like 20 years.  not fun.

lately, fantasies have been creeping into my head that are, like, fun or happy or not morbid.  suddenly i'm not seeing the romantic appeal of being in the psych ward.  maybe something more interesting could happen to me.  something nice.  and maybe i'd prefer that to melodrama.  "
121,"I keep burning my arm in the same spot so I don't make too many marks I can't explain away. Now I think it's infected because it's all yellow and nasty. I been such a mess lately and no matter what I do, no matter what I try it never works. I feel like a lonely puddle of need, everything inside of me breaking. Maybe it would be nice if I could talk about it to someone one but that just doesn't work out. So I drink and burn and cry and drink someone more on this self destructive path. I've even talked to my dad wich is a mistake. It's always a mistake. I wonder if I keep fucking up just to hurt my self. There must be something wrong with me. I'm too old for this shit. I'm too old for cuts and burns. "
122,"Finally you got ahold of me today since getting locked up. I was hella worried about you. Though I hope it wasn't just the fact you need me to reach out to your brother is only reason you called..
Fuhk. 
We both kinda look like shit rn my love. Even in a video visit I can't look in your eyes when we both know ik certainly not okay. You looked like you were at the end of coming off of the shit and I'm very much at the beginning of a 'sick one', I know you saw it too. That's why it was so hard to sit still and focus on what I really wanted to..you.
I hope I don't ruin our friendship but I really wanna just tell you how I feel and maybe when your time is served, a lil self love and healing is efficiently proved; we could maybe give this connection of ours a little more room to run..? 
Yea, I'ma regret it but I can't live in limbo forever. Let it make or break me, I'm ready my love. I hope you are too, I feel as if this conversation has been way past due. 
Anyways, can't wait to talk to you tomorrow! You've always been the best part of my day💙."
123,"Lack of sleep and the constant back-and-forth for work, combined with the feeling of not having enough time and the strange illusion that I do, is making today feel really weird."
124,"2025 April 21: Dear Diary,

Today I took a shower with the intention to wash away negativity. I feel a lot more positive today than I did yesterday. Every shower that I take should be done with a mindful intention.  
  
What I wish to wash away most is the need to be productive. I take myself too seriously and put myself down when I am not productive enough. This feeds into the cycle of me not being productive in the first place. Realizing what I need to do, I am going to give myself the space to relax and give myself praise when I become productive.  
  
Naps and showers with intention are things that will help me feel better while being productive. Productivity should not be looked at as a chore, but rather as something fun to partake in. I must always remember not to push myself too hard and give myself time to relax when it is needed. This way I can be more productive and actually enjoy it.  
  
Sincerely,  
  
Torinico"
125,"Dear diary, I just finished reading the discipline book. Haha seems like I have forgotten most of what I read. But 1 thing for sure is that know your limit even though some thing that you are good or 坚持. But learn to stop to live longer. Anyway, I had a short call with one of the company that I applied. Seems like their job scope is what I did in the past. Hopefully this job can give me above RM 5k and above. 

After lunch time, my cousin came to my house. She asked me about my job hunting status. We had a little deep talk, I wanted to do sales because of money. And some point I also want to learn how to communicate well with people. However, one thing she is right, I don't have to be a sales person to learn how to communicate well. I can still learn it whenever I want. 为什么我那么执着在 sales? Is it because I think sales can earn big money? Other job cannot? What I want actually? I want to have enough money for my family. By enough means, to have higher than average living. May afford luxury lifestyle once in a while. Can I do it with the job I'm looking for? Can I do it without doing the sales? 🤔 I doubt it but I think this is my life... Although 算命师 say my life is to do sales kind of job but I'm not good and speaking. However, once I have mastered it I can do it very good but I just lazy to do it. Haha I'm so fucked up. "
126,"Dude I genuinely lost count on what log it is and we're only 3 logs in😭😭😭. Anyways, today is April 21, and I feel different today. I feel calm, like no worry's, just live. I a messy situation about YR and our other friend, let's call him Dante, he's name is not Dante but he loves Devil may Cry so. If you have a no idea what I'm talking about, try and read my first Log. But YR stopped messaging me because she needed some space, I respected it, told her to just tell me next time when she needs some and told her to get well. She said it wasn't me and to not worry but ke 24 hours ago was fucking shaking at that point. I talked to Dante about this, told him basically my entire Log 1, and he said he felt the same about YR but again, YR like women. And that's not really my main problem, my real problem is that I can't trust YR away, and that's sounds toxic as fuck, because it is. I asked Dante if YR was alright and if she was talking to him, he said she was fine with him and that really just fucked with me. This was before I told him my Log 1, but basically I couldn't trust what YR was doing bc she was kinda lying. And I know what I did was wrong, that's the fucked up part. But it's really messed up when you do something that's toxic/bad but ended up being kinda right. Anyways I just, had to call down. I do this thing when I'm in tough times like this, I just close my eyes out a pillow over it, maybe out in some peaceful music, and just talk to myself. These times are when I get reminded that I really care for myself, since I talk to myself Is if I was another person. I just told myself something along he lines of ""Don't worry, they are other people, they can take care of themselves, don't worry about this right now your being way to worried and hard on yourself. Don't worry, well figure things out, we always do."" And some self compliments just toake myself feel better. And it works, it actually works, it makes me feel loved by myself and I love that. I woke up the next morning feeling way lighter. No one was home, it was just me, and me. I was peaceful they whole day, wether just scrolling memes, listening to music, taking a good 'ol nap. I was happy, I've also been doing this thing where I take my time with showering. I take like 30 mins and it's been really peaceful. I just put on some not sad music and take my time taking care of myself. I've just been, calm today. I wish life was always this easy, but yeah that's it. Take care love yourself have a nice day and remember. Dont give up skeleton."
127,So I woke up today with a cold. It’s only got worse as the day went on. Went to the supermarket to get coricidin but forgot too but I did 4 pints of halo top ice cream since they were buy one get one free. Hell yeah lol
128,I miss when I skated competitively. It was so fun. I’m too old for that now unfortunately. 
129,"ugh, this is fantastic.  i'm being left alone to study and exercise and eat right without any other outside demands.  is it important for the comprehensive exam to know wtf a Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP-4) Inhibitor is or does?  probably not but i'm writing it all down anyway.  i have two whole fucking weeks, i can read whatever i want.

I jogged three miles today and it was sooo good.  felt great, i'm addicted to it.  not counting the exercise and even with dinner and a slice of tuxedo cake, i still made my calorie deficit at 1,780.  this is just fucking great."
130,7 days ago I was pouting about not thinking the dating hame was ever going to happen for me. Tonight I go to bed talking to a multitude of folx who i could see myself investing in and I feel like im living in a fever dream? Is this real? 
131,"Dear diary, I stayed at home today. Nothing much to write actually. But I'm pretty sure I get myself busy the whole day watching variety show, and drama. Reading books and manhua. The drama that I watched is resident playbook. Is a medical drama where the intern students going thru the hardship as a doctor. Every episode is like a movie as it is a long hour and got an ending to it. So the 2 episodes that I watched is like stop being jealous and need to know how to share your knowledge too. Another thing is to help out each other tho you know is not your job to finish it. "
132,"2025 April 20: Dear Diary,

I napped for about an hour on my living room couch. Naps are really helpful for me, but I rarely feel tired. It is very interesting that I still feel tired, even as I write this.  
  
Maybe I am tired because of the time of year. I do not like the spring time very much and Easter is my least favourite holiday. My subconscious might want me to sleep through the holiday. I also should just relax more. I could be a lot more productive if I gave myself time to rest and did not take myself so seriously.  
  
Sincerely,  
  
Torinico"
133,"I lowkey just wish someone would tell me if I actually am pretty or not I really do not know, I have convinced myself to love my features and that different features make you pretty but like Idk if I do feel pretty 

That’s not the part where chopped-tok takes place tho, I have seen all the videos of the people apologizing for liking people or feeling like it’s an insult for these people to be liked by such a “chopped” person, and I have never gotten a statement so much?? 

Ever since I was in middle school I genuinely was too afraid or embarrassed to tell someone about my crushes cause I felt like I’m not the type of person who is allowed to like people, about before high school when I started getting into anime, everytime I would see people simp for characters I would get so confused because how are you not scared of saying that wow I wish this character was real because I 100% would be ignored by this character irl? I really don’t know.

I just know that I really didn’t care for a couple of years until one day it hit me, it hit me how weird and different my face looks for like faces you see everyday, like slay my face looks different but like do people even think of me as a pretty person or is it just my artistic friend who sees beauty in everything because they draw or something. Idk I’m confused and just realized that I get the validation I need only from the people around me and that I feel so disconnected from myself to the point where I only see myself through other people’s eyes"
134,"Hello everyone! I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I’ll try anyway.

I’m looking for a desktop app that would look and function like a real journal. Specifically, I would like an app that has following features:

1. The pages in the app look like real paper.
2. When opened, the pages turn like a real notebook.
3. Inifinite pages.
4. The front cover looks like an actual journal cover.

If the app has a lock on the front cover that unlocks when you type in your password, that would be cool. The same goes for choosing different fonts and changing the font size, adding pictures… 

If anyone knows one (if it even exists), please share links or recommendations. Thanks in advance!"
135,"I’m lonely tonight. Nobody to tell except the void. No comfort to be had. Everything I knew has changed and transitioned. I just miss the way it was before I knew any better.

I am trying so hard to look forwards. I can’t see anything yet. I know this is the hard part, the murky waters, the moment I’ve left the shore behind me with nothing in view except hope.

I still have that. I really hope for better days ahead."
136,"Feeling like an outsider is quite upsetting. It's like running into an invisible wall, that kind of frustrating feeling."
137,"I can't believe I'm in love with you, I can't believe I can't get you out of my head.

God knows how much I think about you. I know letting you go doesn't mean I stop loving you or that I'll stop thinking about you, it just means I keep living my life. It means everyday I make the best and don't miss my journey where we are both in different roads. Maybe we will bump into each other but you won't recognize me as I won't be the same. I'll look smaller, I'll look cleaned up, and happy. 

Before you;

The old me was dead, literally, I was thinking a lot about ending my life, many times I came close. Please if you ever read this, I love you, feel my palm on your cheek wiping the tears on your face, I'm okay now. I won't tell you not to worry about me because I know you care about me. It's a habit for me to tell people to ignore I exist, I'm very used to being invisible. 

Nobody knows how to love an already dead soul, but you did. 

The old me cried everyday, hid the bruises with black clothes and pretty long sleeves. You would never suspect I was continusly brought to life to being killed the following days. I'd let no one see the damage, not my kids, not the teachers at pick up, not the moms or dads who always seemed curious about me. Not even my niebhors. Only one knew about what I was going through because he saw the night fights. He saw how I kicked my husband out at night as he screamed at the sky and drove off like he had been drinking but was drunk off rage and self frustrations. 

I couldn't cry or I'd pay the price, I couldn't laugh because I would be reminded that nothing is good in my life. I couldn't smile or I was just a reminder that he didn't cause that smile. Loving a man who treated you like the dirt under his shoe was like hugging a cactus everyday hoping one day it wouldn't hurt. It didn't one day, one day I couldn't secretly cry anymore, one day I smiled as I made the choice to die. I wanted to leave everyone in a great place, I had delusional plans but they were the only thing that could bring me hope that everyone would be happy when I left. I had plans to make everyone hate me to purposely run away so they could feel sorry for my husband and the kids and say I was a horrible mother because in reality I felt I wasn't a good enough mother. I accepted that if I was beautiful, skinny, that my husband would be happy and find a better wife, I knew my family would pitch in meanwhile to take care of my kids the way I felt they deserved and my husband would find a wife better then I could ever be. 

I'd go to a shelter and help others in there lives, feed the homeless, sing For money to help me get by and get a job go to school and build a career to secretly send money to my kids and help others before I finally decided I was ready to go home. 

I had plans about making savings for my kids to go to college and to help my husband find a better wife one he would want to be in love with that he saw as everything. Running away would be the only way to not completely destroy my families heart, the only way they could resent me so that when I did die they wouldn't have to suffer knowing I took my life. They'd just see me as the mother and daughter who abandoned her kids, an awful person. Not someone who killed herself. 

I fought that battle everyday, I fought the demons telling me I was nothing and no one cares because your useless. The way my life was I had every reason to believe it to be true, I tried to reach out but there was no one who could help, no one who could give me answers. No one to love. I loved my husband but he didn't love me. I did everything I could.

The day I snapped was the last time my husband hit me, I was in the worst place possible, I told him I couldn't do this anymore, I was trying so hard to get out of bed but I couldn't, the only time I left the bed was to secure the kids, change them, feed them, and send them back to their rooms keep my ears aware while staring at the ceiling thinking of different ways to hang myself. I screamed in my pillow begging my mind my heart to stop, begging for the pain to stop. 

My husband told me he was concerned I'd kill myself as I was very worked up, the night before we had argued, he cussed me out I told him to stop treating me like crap, he told me it's always his fault everything his fault, that I was perfect bitch, I told him to stop disrespecting me to stop telling me I'm perfect that I'm not perfect and know damn well I'm not but he didn't have to disrespect me that he can stop acting like I created these problems or am trying to fight. He would just tell me fuck you bitch. 

It was very triggering very hard to deal with his outburst, him pitying himself because he was always the problem as he said it when all I was asking was for him to acknowledge what hurt me. He just ignored it and started getting defensive, argumentative, emotionally abusive. Like I said I wasn't a saint I would stand up for myself but I could of been nicer and just not engage. We barely had sex and when we did he'd tell me he didn't really enjoy it that he wants to watch porn. He'd tell me he wasn't attracted to me but then tell me he was, it was all very confusing.

Continuing about the day I snapped, I was nervous, I was crying, I was a mess, I was shaking, I couldn't live this life anymore and I felt trapped. I couldn't be in my bed anymore everything was not dark enough. I left the room and went into the bath tub covered my ears and cried my eyes out it was peaceful in the dark, it felt safe there, it felt like no one could hurt me. I told my husband I just needed love, support, understanding, just needed him to hold me or just listen and say nothing. When he did get home he found me in the tub and sat on the toilet seat. He told me to talk. I told him all my feelings, my worries, my insecurities, how I felt in that moment. He instantly became frustrated and I no longer felt safe and I was cornered. He began to hit the wall I asked him to stop and he told me to stop crying. He hit my arm and I got extremely angry and told him to get out. He took off in a rage and left to our bedroom. 

I finally snapped, I couldn't do this anymore, I told him we had to talk and I wanted a divorce. He was panicking and pacing, told me that he knows it doesn't mean anything but that he was sorry. He was crying in bed before I had brought up divorce. He told me he knows it would probably be best for everyone that he left. I told him that what the kids needs from him is a father who will take care of himself and his emotional state, to better himself, to have a father who isn't constantly trying to control everything and then goes into a rage when he feels guilty or insecure. 

That's when we decided to have an non monogamous marriage to try to do something different something to help me find an emotional connection while he indulged in other women digitally while he worked on himself. 

That's when I met you. You changed my world, you brought me back from the dead, you showed me that love wasn't dead, that it existed, even for someone like me. You made my life whole in ways I never felt before. You hold a special place in my heart. You gave me life, Thank you.

So yes of course your always on my mind. As much as I hear the wind whisper your name and I try to ignore it I always end up with a stupid smile on my face remembering you. I can feel you, that's how I know you still think about me. I know the day I don't feel you will be the day you forgot me and don't feel the flutters in your heart. Perhaps that will be the day my heart stops fluttering too. 

"
138,I tend to talk bdly about myself hen I am working like I can't do anything I don't know anything 
139,"Independence ey? I really want that. It is Still, April 20, since I write the first log in midnight, If you haven't read my first log then this isn't related to it that much ig,ok it's pretty related to it but it's ok. The thing is, I just want to be able to function with out the help of people, I know that us humans are social creatures and that we almost require social interaction, but I just don't want to depend on people yk? I want to love myself, and be able to motivate myself with out thinking of others. I want the person I wake up for in the morning to be me. Recently I've been doing well, and a lot of that is because of my friends, they're some of the best people I've ever met, especially the person I talked about last log YR. YR still hasn't responded to me, it's getting me worried tbh, she's usually very active and ok to talk to. I'm scared I got to worried and annoyed her or something, she gives people the silent treatment when she's upset at them. I really hope WE'RE ok. Anyways, but I just want to do something with myself yk? I've been trying to find HEMA classes, which are like European swords, which are awesome! But unfortunately, they're not common at all where I'm from, but that's what I want to do. The things is I'm only happy when I'm with other people, I also wanna be happy when I'm with myself, and not just looking at a rectangle all day. I'm just a bit lost right now yk? I have no one to talk to, and I want to find independence in myself FOR myself. Yeah, idk what else to talk about. I'll keep journaling here, it's pretty relaxing tbh, journal while listening to calm music and typing out my thoughts. The storys you guys put in here are also interesting, it's good to see that, I and We aren't alone after all, were all broken and fucked up in our own ways. And that's beautiful, that's normal, that's human. Thank you for listening, take care love yourself have a nice day and remember. Don't give up skeleton."
140,"I have to put this into the void because it's giving me the most hightened anxiety I've had in months (RIP long stretch of feeling minimal anxiety). I swear to fucking God every girl i ever get a crush on is married or seriously dating... it keeps happening and it makes me feel like shit. I'm polyamorous so dating outside of my marriage is normal and natural to me, but it's definitely not a conventional dating style. Because of that I try to be respectful with folx who are coupled. My best friend was cheated on pretty terribly by my other best friend and it caused them to divorce. After seeing the hurt and aftermath of his terrible choices I feel an extra weight about liking women who haven't told me they are poly or enm. Long story short I moved and made a friend who I really enjoy spending time with and I think I developed a crush. Another fun fact one of my other most important friendships exploded because we briefly dated and the ending was... not great... so now I've got double anxiety because the idea of blowing up another friendship is terrifying to me. And I want to be respectful. And I just wish there was one beautiful woman who is consensual of my relation ship style to like me so I can stop with all this other nonsense 🥲 
Life tip: don't befriend hot ppl "
141,I give up. 
142,"i've been in a great mood lately.  i mean, ya, i come to complain on reddit and vent but now is actually a pretty good time to be me.  i've almost graduated nursing school (how that even happened i have no idea) and i have two weeks off to nerd it up and 'train' for the final comprehensive exam.  the content really is interesting and i love having the time to actually read my textbooks at leisure.  another part of the 'training' is physical, and basically just jogging and stretches to get my tissues perfusing and to help relax.

i'm trying to do at least two miles a day for the next two weeks and i'm getting a bit faster at it.  still not that fast, but i will be.  i've been overweight my whole life and being able to jog is new these past couple of years and i love it.  today, as i was on the track, i heard some teenager and his friend walking along say 'ya, keep running, you need it.'  i almost stopped and turned around to confront him because i'm aggressive and like confrontation and refuse to take that shit.  i kept going, but noticed that at the end of the track, we'd meet up again.  

coming up to this guy again, the girl he was with was filming me with her phone and i gave her the finger.  she asked if i had something to say to her and i said 'ya, fuck you.'  they pretended they hadn't said anything and i told them to fuck off.  i mean, these were teenagers, and not really bad ones.  obviously i'm not going to be saying that to some shirtless, tatted guy from my sketchy neighbourhood.  it's only fun because these kids wouldn't even know where to start.

ngl, telling them off made me feel like a big man and i did my two miles faster than usual. "
143,"2025 April 19: Dear Diary,

This is my second entry that will not be public for now. I am continuing the challenge to write an entry everyday and upload most of them. Today will be one of the days I do not post. Tomorrow I will go back to posting at a regular schedule.

144,"Then you'll be free. 

I'm really gonna give this one last chance everything I got. I deserve this, you deserve it too. I'ma work on what I need so that when it's time to leave, it'll be easy. 
Crazy how everything comes full circle. "
145,"Dear diary, my friend brought me to career fair this morning. It was a small one, there were not many company. After applying for a few, we went off to explore subway pyramid. I think there is a minor renovation that changes the shopping mall. I was quite surprised tho. Then, I saw there is an event hosted by anlene. There were a few checks so I participate the event, I check my bone density, very good, my muscles strength very bad haha 😅, and finally my cholesterol level very good also. Then, there is a lucky draw or redemption area, and I got lucky, it was a big prize which I got a tong of anlene milk haha. 

Then, we went to 1U to participate songkran event. It was so fun, where many people just keep shooting water using water gun. Me and my friend we just go there without preparing any gun or powder, we only prepare clothes. We gather with my cousin first then had dinner, and some drinks. Later, my friend met some secondary school friends and we borrow their water gun to shoot other people like finally haha. Oh ya, there was this girl who put the powder on my hair and it was so freaking hard to clean it weih.... Anyway, it was fun and tiring day. "
146,"I couldn't find an empty book to write, I would've much rather prefered that. But I found this so we're just gonna work with it. It is currently April 1- oop nvm it's 20 now, I guess bc Its mednight. But yeah, it's midnight and I've got no one to talk to everyone is asleep and I'm just alone with my thoughts. I guess I can just talk about anything I want in here without worry, sweet. There's this person I really love, I keep saying I don't love them romantically but my love for them is too much for just friends. But they said that they always see me as a friend and that that will not change. I think Ive come to terms with that, theres still a part of me that wants us to be together, but if we're not going to be that's completely fine to me. They said we could talk later but they aren't responding, strange bc they usually stay up too. I've been doing great recently tbh, school ended, I finally found someone close, I just don't really have problems. Ok well not really, everyone has problems. I have a bad envy problem, specifically with the person I talked about. See when I was younger, I always had 1 very very very close friend, and no one else. And Im comfortable with it being that way, don't give me wrong I'd still like some other friends. But one main very very close friend is all I need really, I really want that very very close person to be the person I was talking about. Let's just nickname them YR for now ok? When they talk to other people, I just get really jealous, I want them to talk to me yk? I'm just really happy everytime I talk to them, every single time I've talked to them my whole life I've always been happy, we're childhood friends, ad we just reunited this grade, so I really really miss, love, and care about YR. Although, I told YR about it, and they're surprisingly understanding,probably one of if not the most understanding people I've ever met. They said I don't have to face this alone and that them and my other friends rae always there to help, brings a tear to my eye tbh. They're so sweet, and kind, I really really love them. What's interesting is that they also have an envy problem, not just to me but to her other friends. She also gets mad when her friends don't talk to her for a bit. I just eat them to be my number one, and vice versa. I love them so much, they're the most important person to me right now. We talked about this like a week ago, I just revealed to her my feelings, although I didn't directly say that I loved her, so she didn't get the signal, she said she really loved me too tho, and that she wants to get to know me. I think about it everyday, she's also comfortable enough with me to share her private story's, like her break ups and stuff. Which makes me feel valuable knowing they also very much cares for me, although not as much as I care for them. Ok I've let a couple pronounces slip through, I was gonna keep referring to YR as they, but I've already revealed that they're a she so fuck it we rollin. When I talk to her, I always ask if she's mad at me or if she's uncomfortable. That's because I'm scared if losing her, I haven't gotten friendsblike her In a long time, so I'm afraid of losing her. Idk if I should tell her all of this, it might just separate us, it's happened to other friends before, I'm so so afraidz idk what I would do with out her tbh. I wanna talk about more stuff, way more stuff. But I'll do that tomorrow. Thank you for listening, this subreddit is interesting, I'll read some of your logs def. Take care love yourself have a nice day and remember. Dont give you skeleton."
147,"i’m sleeping horribly. every morning, i get woken up by something. i want to quickly go back to sleep, but before i can, my thoughts creep up on me and i remember again. i remember again why im sad, and it consumes me. 

before you know it, im tired, but my eyes are wide awake, lost in thought. tears stream down my face and im frozen. eventually. it takes me a long time to get out of bed and nestled into the couch with my coffee and journal. trying to make sense of it all. "
148,"She's leaving again. I don't know why I allowed myself to believe she actually cared. That she really wanted to stay around. She's been getting more and more distant for 2 years now. The signs were there and I was ignoring them. We all were. If we wouldn't have found that letter we wouldn't have even known that she was going anywhere. We would have just woken up to her being gone. That's how it happened last time so I know her game. 

She blames it on anything. Fighting (there's none unless she starts the fight), not being allowed to smoke in the house, the house being rearranged and deep cleaned. We do everything for her. She doesn't really have to lift a finger. The only request is that she smokes outside. 

She knows I'm dependent on her. She knows I'd never survive on my own. I'm disabled, but not enough to receive help of any kind. I pay half the rent, half the food, all of the bills. My little bit of a disability check relies on me living with her. Because without living with her I have nowhere to go. I'm silent most of the time. I don't yell, don't complain, I barely speak. There's no space for me. 

It feels like I was brought right back to 16 when she first left. All that is back and my heart hurts so much. We begged her to stay that time. She told us she never wanted kids. She left, then came back and left again and kept doing it. Then finally she was gone for a whole year. No one could contact her. No one knew where she was. We all were so lost and scattered. My poor dad.... the nights he stayed up crying. 

Finally my attachment issues were healing. I was figuring them out. Learning how to trust and believe that people wouldn't just leave again. All that work is gone. I'm detaching because there's no point. People always leave. Dad is the only solid person in my life. 

She said she won't go. Says she just needs her pills. Maybe she does need mental help. But leaving her whole family behind is not okay. It won't ever be okay. I know what will happen. She'll hold this plan to leave over our heads. She'll keep it there. Then we'll do something. Some small mistake. Then poof she'll be gone. "
149,"i always have to work so hard for everything, especially guys.  i'm always after the ones who are, like, impossible and won't work out and why do i even do it?  never in my life have i just found a guy who was into me and i was into him and everything else was fine and we just got together with no problems or complications.  no, i find the ones that will probably never come to anything and make me work so hard for absolutely nothing.

like, fuck it, after this last failure i'm not working for a guy ever again. "
150,"Dear diary, it's a tiring day today. In the morning, I play pickleball at 11am. Omg why this time tho so freaking sunny because we play outdoor. It was in a park outside my cousin house. My cousin jio me at 11am but he didn't appear on time. And it was under the big hot sun, an I don't know what to do, so I just started jogging. Is only few round then my stomach started feeling pain... But I managed to jog until they come at 11:30am. Anyway, we then started playing under the big hot sun. I didn't perform very well because my eyes feel like it is blinding not sure if is because of the jogging just now or under the big sun. I felt worried because I have glaucoma I scared it getting worse for fuck sake why do I have to gone through this shit. 

Anyway, we played for awhile only later we just go back home. I sent my pillow and bolster to laundry. I was so tired idk why, then I fell asleep without DIY. I woke up so tiring and I received a message saying that I'm up for volleyball. So, I went to play volleyball. I was so bad today when playing volleyball, I didn't had many chances with spike and didn't have a good first ball. And my right leg was so pain since last week when playing volleyball. "
151,"2025 April 18: Dear Diary,

Hunter S. Thompson was one of the greatest writers to have ever lived. No doubt, I take a lot of inspiration from his work. The way he put himself into the events he covered was amazing. “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” was amazing, but I think “The Kentucky Derby is Decadent and Depraved” is one of the best articles I have read. 

He noticed how he was becoming exactly the type of person he was criticizing at the start of the article. This is something I would like to be more mindful of myself. Always making sure I never become what I am set to destroy.

Something else Thompson did was type out the entirety of “The Catcher in the Rye.” He wanted to put himself in the mind of Salinger by seeing what it felt like to type a best seller. This is also something I am thinking of doing. At some point I would like to type out “The Satanic Verses” by Salman Rushdie. It is my favourite book and I really want to put myself in the position of typing out the world’s most controversial book. I take some inspiration from Rushdie as well. Magical realism is a genre I find more and more fascinating with time.

Sincerely,

Torinico"
152,"Met my grandma after months, had good food. Got dressed up and went to Chillis happy hour to get 1+1 on sex on the beach. Then after getting a little tipsy, I went to the club for an hour, vibed with some songs. Then I lit up a cigarette and talked to my friends my way back home. At home I removed my make up and went to bed happy. 
Instead I fought with my insecure partner after meeting my grandma, he made me feel guilty for choosing to have some fun over staying with him all day. I had to go visit him, I lashed out over there, cussed, screamed. He tried to break my new phone, then said sorry. Then he hid my phone so that I can’t go. Then we made up, I came back home. I feel like I shouldn’t be with him. "
153,"Ive been....""holding it together"" for for too long.  Think positive they say, keep moving forward, things will work out in due time, hard work pays off, what's ment to be will be.  Well, ive been working hard for YEARS and all ive been delt is shit after shit after more shit and for what, losing all my savings, my house, my car, having to find a new home for me and my kids, losing a husband, working as much as I can for as much money as I can get to provide for myself and kids and I'm failing, miserably.  Being told it's not that bad, everything will be ok, NO it's NOT OK.  Im tired of struggling, I'm exausted from working and no time for myself, I'm over being told I need to focus on myself.  Bitch PLEASE!  My time is coming home from work, getting changed and cleaned up and MAYBE some food into my stomach but most of the time it's bed.  I wake up and it's right back to the same ole thing.  I am beyond angry, I am beyond hurt, I am beyond my point of maintaining my composure.  The mask has fallen off and now, I just want to hide all together from everyone and everything.  
      There's one person who would make everything better and they even left me.  What is this punishment I'm receiving?  Ive managed to solve, figure out whatever you want to call it ON MY OWN, when is it my turn to be happy and comfortable, when is it my turn to be able to catch a break?  The universe can ease up some, just grant me one wish, make that one wish come true...please.  I didn't think I was that bad of a person, but this punishment is beyond ridiculous.  Ive turned what I can into lessons, ive turned the bad things into a positive, but I can't anymore.  I'm all out of good, positive, happy. 
     The pieces have crumbled and that puzzle can't be put back together.  I don't know what to do anymore, I don't even know who I am, let alone I can't find her anymore.  I think she's dead and gone, but who is this new girl?  I'm not sure if like her.  "
154,"Nobody likes to talk about shitty things as it can be a let down especially those who resonate. It's the freaking snake of depression that slithers into your head intruding in the most weakest points of your life. 

8 more days until my birthday and this whole month instead of celebrating as I usually do I've been just trying to not think about anything, honestly anything. Grieving is a temple I'm not truly allowed to immerse myself in as I have children depending on me. Even so I can feel this heaviness, this anxiety, this horrible intrusive thoughts and constant confliction. 

This weekend I'm heading back to the Pier, even if the rain falls on me I will sit on the cold sand with an umbrella and ponder my life like a tragic movie staring the ghost of you. I hope it helps me feel more then this desert of emptiness and void. I want to lay on the concrete benches and stare at the open sky wishing it would take me home. 

I'm greatful to have had loved and lost, It hurts so so much, my logic understands the process while my heart is still trying to catch up. It's angry its bewildered it's hurting, if you came back I know that no matter how angry I am my numb icy heart would melt. My intrusive brain says shut up he doesn't want you so move the fuck on. There is no chance in the world he will come back and you gotta accept that. My logical wisdom brain says hey it's okay, you don't need to do anything but be, exist in what you are right now to awaken who you will become Tomorrow, it's not about him, you loved and still love, his love for you is simply not overflowing anymore. That's okay live darling live with your truth. 

Well my heart right now is the winner and it's shredding up my every existence and ripping me a new one. Well deserved heart, well deserved. 

I just want to have a good birthday and honestly I'm not sure what to do to enjoy it. I guess just living and feeling myself out even if I really need to just break down and cry is what it will be. April 25, 2025 the year my birthday was filled with tears of love at least it wasn't actually ruined like my previous years. I could never have a good birthday without someone claiming it as a reason to feel bad about themselves and then give me a big fat slap in the face to remind me how unimportant my existence is. (To help understand this, it's an abuse situation I rather not go into depth as I won't really resolve anything and triggers lots of trauma, just pray for me and that it may stay in the past. Thank you kind hearts.)

Yes I have had some shitty birthdays. This one will just be heartache and ice cream and me running away so I can pretend for one moment someone cares. 

So for anyone reading this please don't be sad on April 25th for me celebrate do something you love, buy that drink that makes you smile and say yeah that was freaking worth it. Get crazy and wear some ridiculous outfits or costumes and dance. Watch your favorite romance movie with a bucket of your favorite ice cream and if you're a couple make love to your special someone. Rock my special day everyone rock it for me. Blast your favorite tunes and party hard!!! 

Just take it easy on the wedgies, thongs are known to disappear if left unattended. 🫂❤️‍🩹🥀

From One damaged heart and a soul full of clutter. :)

155,"I went to see my sister today, I cleaned her grave and left her some of her favorite things, and flowers. I sat and talked to her for a bit. I wish she were still here, she always gave the best advice. I told her how her kids were doing, both adults and finding their way. I told her about you, she loved to hear about my life. She was the smarter one, but I taught her so much about getting along and making friends. She was far too blunt sometimes. She was so smart, and so fierce. That Scorpio sting with her words. She would go head to toe with any man, she worked in a male dominated industry, was always at the top. I lived with her while she was sick, took care of her children. She was so brave, and fought so hard. 
I miss her terribly, I have so much more I need her to tell me. 
Today was the anniversary of her passing, six years already…I love you sis 💔🖤"
156,"Been so into doing my thing that I’ve neglected writing about the escapades. Still what I have done this year is the most self reflection in the form of writing done in a couple years. Not to get caught up on things that don’t matter today was very important. A few times today things unwinded in a cinematic way the types of things that when they occur you can’t help but reminisce. There was drama, defeat, redemption, romance, and even a section of uninterrupted montage of lost in thought music listening. That’s what a woman does to you; gah I can’t believe the chances that my boss walks right in as I am chatting up this lady. She was pretty, slender, stylish, Filipino, and just moved here a month ago. I wasn’t even thinking of it at as flirting first but after my boss asked if she messed that up I say yes very quickly. She tells me to go after her but I say no no it’s too late. My boss says but I saw how she was “she lulled” like she was waiting for you to ask her for something. I got to shy now from her coaxing. I should have gone after I could tell after the fact it was a mistake to let her go with out getting her info. If it’s meant to be I’ll meet her again.. like that’ll happen. But coincidentally enough I met this other person I had met earlier in the day at the same place a few hours later so who knows really. My friend did say that this year is full of love for me so I’ll keep an open mind. "
157,"I don’t want to smoke weed anymore. I think it did more harm than good for me. There are few who actually benefit from smoking and good for them, but for me it was more of a distraction from myself…

I’ve been on and off smoking since I was 14, I still remember the first time I got high. Secret edible from my father, don’t tell your mom, here’s some snacks and go chill in your room. My parents just had a crazy argument and I was crying, shaking, hyperventilating, “it’ll help you calm down”, oh boy did it calm me.. never again. Who would have known that one night would lead to years of chronic usage.  


Getting in trouble at school, at home, spending hundreds of dollars on drugs, wasting my potential. A crutch that calmed me down, until it turned me paranoid. It stopped helping, I kept using because I didn’t know more. There were times I stopped, until I met people who smoked and I fell back into the habit. I have a problem of wanting to “fit in” and be wanted that i’ll change myself for people. It’s like without thinking I’ll morf myself into what people want to see. It’s just another mask. Being scrutinized for every trait that makes me, me. Smoke the weed, be “normal”, being myself wasn’t an option to survive. 


I realize, all i’ve done for as long as I remember is do things to survive whether I really wanted to or not. I’ve been faking it till I make it for so long I lost sight of who I really am. That’s the thing with weed, it fogged my brain, made me not think about the tragic things in my life, it made me think in the moment, but also not think at all and avoid my future. At the time to me it was wonderful, I thought it was helping yet In reality it wasn’t it was only an unhealthy distraction. I don’t want to do this anymore, I want to be myself, be confident with my values and goals. 

…


I’m proud of myself now for reaching sobriety, my mind is clear to some extent. It’s constantly rushing, and i’m distracted by other things but I can think more clearly about those things. I’ll always struggle with mood swings, and mental barriers that make things more difficult for me but without the added brain fog from the weed. I can’t run from the fact that i’m an emotional person, I feel things 10x stronger than most but it doesn’t have to be something I suppress. I can calm myself down in other ways when needed, I can distract myself in other ways when needed. 


I’m on this journey of self healing or whatever, it seems silly to say and kind of cliche but I have to do what I need to for myself. Despite all of the bs i’ve been through I’m still here and alive somehow, so I work on improving my life as I can. Actually improving myself and not just distracting myself with chemicals. 


I tell myself i’ve been trying and trying to be okay, but the real progress started when I stopped smoking. There is probably permanent damage to my brain because of the usage growing up, but I can still contribute to society and be a good person.  


Today I say i’m trying and I actually believe myself, raw mental strength. "
158,"Why did I find you, why did you find me?

Was the purpose of it all just so I can cry at the illusion of you? Was it so I can end up feeling empty without you? Do you feel the same? Or are you just out there filling your bucket with more names. 

He's doing everything now, he feels my distance. That's not what you wanted right. I can hear you telling me to work on it, to fight, to do my duties as a wife but I bet you feel it too the distance the confusion did it get better for you? God I hope it did, I hope your not suffering, I'm a mess I play the part I push myself because I hear you telling me to. 

What do I really want to do, scream, I want scream. Cry endlessly until my pillow is filled and I go completely numb. 

Nothing feels the same, I'm trying to be strong, but what I feel with you is un-comparable to anything I've ever felt. When I kiss him I have to tell myself to feel again. I adore his will to give now but I still feel empty. It's like everything I was now is tethered to you. You truly stole my heart. What do I do!? What do I do!? 

How do you do it? How do you lie to yourself and pretend you feel nothing? How do you mask everything so well? Then in the middle of the night go to your couch and cry your eyes out? How can they even stand listening to you cry! I don't care how many times your heart leaks you deserve compassion, you deserve presence, you deserve love. 💔

I know many times when others pretend to be you they weren't because I know your words, your language, God how I miss you. When I think of your words I can feel your fingers touch my spine, I can feel your lips and hot breath on my neck making me light up with the whispers you give my soul.

They said things that don't align with who you are, what you would do. I know you. You wouldn't publicly announce yourself, you'd come straight to me chulo and tell me things you always have. God you are perfect I miss you. It hurts so much not to get closure and that's my mistake. I should have said more. I shouldn't have let you leave while we both cried and you needed me. I needed you, but I felt so rejected, unwanted, even as you cried. 

I know you continued to cry after things ended, I can see you there with your hot chocolate crying, hurting, aching, remembering, trying to forget. Me too...me to chulo. I don't even know if your still here but I feel like if you were there's only one place you might be. I don't think you want us back I'm sure it was to much for you to handle, it was to much heartache and you needed something dead and uncomplicated. Does it feel better now? I wonder if they give you what I couldn't, just knowing they do oddly would make me happy. I want you to be happy. 

There's a few things I never told you, no I don't like sharing but I loved you and wanted you to be happy so if that's what you needed I'd give you that. 

Yes you were the only one I was talking to I didn't want anyone else you were everything you were enough. Nothing could've changed what I feel for you. Not your issues, not your secrets, not even the thing you told me, I was literally looking up ways to work around it so you didn't feel like that could be an impossible situation, yes my love I was willing to find solutions just so you didn't have to feel the pain of never having me the way you needed. 

You don't understand how deeply I love you. How much I would risk for you. I had much to loose too not just you. 

You just didn't understand how much I have lost already even now at this moment. I lost who I used to be. Now I'm someone else, I don't know how to carry her, I don't know how to move her, she's a growth I didn't expect and it's painful. I used to love so differently and though you brought me back to life you changed me. 

If only I could hear those three little words from you, did I offer them to soon. When you made a choice it didn't make sense to me, I never asked you to choose. I wanted you as you lived as you were with what you had and to keep it that way. 

I never told you this too but when you got jealous of others seeing me you made my heart skip a beat. You wanted me all to yourself another dream unlocked in that moment I was yours, you were mine. It was everything I wanted and needed. You gave me everything I dreamed without me even telling you my dreams. You made them come true. When you talk about other women and them getting to touch you a chance to have you I became jealous but I hid it, I didn't want you to feel like I'm invalidating your needs I wanted to tell you your mine too! 

Hahaha I feel silly thinking about how I would have reacted if you told me those things in person. I'd cuddle you and wrap my arms around you with a pouty face giving you a love bite and marking my territory. 🤭

I create a bunch of scenarios in my head about how we might bump into each other and how you would be shy and adorable. How you'd make love to me, how you'd whisper in my ear before I realized you were right behind me surprising me. :)

Lot's of things I couldn't say. I cared about your life I didn't want to hurt you or anything. I kept so much inside and gave you the already immense love I was giving you. Yeah I had more to offer. I'm sorry showed it to late.

Your silence didn't scare me as I could feel you. I didn't tell you how I knew when you were sad, when you were agitated, when you were excited, I felt it before you even said anything. Just like you always imagine someone would, someone understanding your silent language, I did, that's how I knew something was wrong, I guess I pushed to hard at the end didn't I, I could feel you slipping away, and hurting. I could feel you trying to resist trying to be strong, trying to mask and no give in. I knew.

I knew ...

159,"My life‐partner is becoming enraged & violent toward me. When I asked him to please refrain from violence, he screamed at me to shut up, and punched my computer screen. He's destroyed some of my property before, including knifing my backpack before the last time he decided to stay at a hospital (seemingly to prevent me from getting away). It's currently threatening my ability to speak, and it seems like I'm being groomed to be a kind of unofficial servant or target for abuse. He's again mocking me speaking calmly and refusing to even attempt to himself. (We often have a more loving relationship, these episodes happen during food insecurity. He was diagnosed with schizoaffective PTSD that stress can trigger.) I've been wanting to spend several days travelling to seek refuge at the Navajo Nation for around a year after someone invited me to their place (while visibly homeless), which is the only place where I'm invited to be. In the past though, people have criticized & invalidated this thinking, and someone gave indication that ""bored cops"" would stop me. Also leaving would ""abandon"" my life partner, which he finds intolerable. He also identifies as autistic, so there's the added social stigma of me abandoning someone autistic. I don't have a place where I feel safe nearby to seek refuge in the meantime, and he's saying he can't avoid being violent toward me."
160,"Me and piggy had a two days off and it was very relaxing and lovely days. Now I feel bit a depression and dont wanna go back to my work. But whatever I say, I have to back to my work and should what I do. I need make money, money for piggy, money for to live. 

Tbh I really dont know how I feel about my ""husband-ish"" right now. Sometime I could thankful to him but sometime I really despite him, even I dont want see him. And me and piggy spent with him in this days off, mostly we were cool, or could bit enjoyable even, but yet sometime I couldn't handle his anger or grumpy emotions. I do understand and I'd try to be kind to him but I really can't carry everything on myself. I dont want to burden piggy anymore, I carrying everything about his life and my parents problems and all our money/live problems. Plus I need to always think about how deal with my dad's condition. Always keep prayer but also I facing to reality with all results came. 
BUT, piggy carry me, piggy got me, so that mean is piggy is carrying everything more than I do. How suffer it is. When I told to piggy about I could take a two days off, piggy eyes so much brighter and piggy was smiling a lot. But now, its faded. Bc piggy realized we have to back to the job, back to the miserable life. 
Next week will so much tougher, I really dont know how I'll make it. But I will and its really so sorry but I have piggy always, so Im not alone. I can survive any tough situation. Thankyou my lovest piggy, dear my faith piggy.

Well, I need to go sleep with piggy!
I wanted write out about something funny and super suprised moment that happened us yesterday, but maybe I'll write other time! My time is running out.

Lastly, me and piggy saw a many posts about plushies here, and those are so beautiful and peaceful. And everyone seems so happy in there posts, we love to see that. And we really wish everyone always be happy as possible as much, and really wishing everyone could spending safe and comfortable time always.

Nighty night!"
161,"Dear diary, I woke up very early to watch UCL arsenal Vs real Madrid. I'm arsenal fan and they finally make it to semifinal beating real Madrid twice. So proud of them. Later, I woke up late haha. Anyway, I opened my masturbators last night and it was freaking smelly because of the mold... It made the toilet and my room smell so badly until my sister and mom complained about it. They didn't know why so smelly but I just throw it away already fine... Long time never use and it became so smelly already. Now I don't know whether I should buy a new one or how... Feel like buying but very expensive and can only use 1 year... Feel like not worth to buy it...

I started a new drama too ""weak hero class"" looks ok, quite interesting. It was about a kid being bullied in school and ended up catching the bad guy. Gotta finish by this week maybe. 

And I continued reading the discipline book. 
1. Patient is the key to success 
2. Do the hard thing first and get it over.
3. Face the pain with discipline, try not to use other things such as drugs to escape reality 
4. Discipline is not a punishment, it's a way to avoid punishment. 
5. Do not be provoked easily 
6. Ambition with good heart
7. Learn new things, get better every day
8. Share the load, distribute wisely. "
162,"So, I (23F) two weeks ago on Wednesday finished my last formal lecture for one of my classes (this class took place on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays) and Friday’s class was a review session. I walked to take the train home because I’m a commuter and I live a little far but within commuter distance to my university. I am on the escalator going down to the train platform when I hear two people behind me talking (a girl and a guy). The guy talks about how he hates stairs and the girl says in reply “so real”. I also say “so real” and they laugh. I’m laughing too because of how relatable they were being. I didn’t turn around while on the escalator as I wanted to focus on what was in front of me and not fall in front of a lot of people. So I didn’t see them until I got to the platform. When I get down from the escalator I go to the platform and behind me guess who it turns out to be? GIGI!!!! Gigi (23F or 22F idk when her birthday is) flashes a smile at me but doesn’t say anything and then goes towards the end of the platform where the front of the train is. After a while, she then looks in my direction. She has headphones on and looks down at her phone. I turned to look at my phone when she finished smiling at me so that she would think that I was busy and leave me alone. What a surprise today?!!! I was not expecting Gigi of all people to be there and especially not behind me. You can see my other post for the backstory between Gigi and I.



At the time that the research project course from from other post ended, I had no idea what Gigi's plans were.



I signed up for two courses that took place last semester and two that took place this semester to finish my remaining degree requirements. Gigi was in one of the two that I had last semester, but luckily we were in different groups for it. These groups were the groups we did any group assignments in. The class was small, but we didn't interact much. Although, when we did our final presentations on Zoom, Gigi said in the chatbox that she liked the beginning of my group's presentation as the news reporter style hooks you in. Granted, our professor (40F) said to say nice things about the presentations if we could for each group.



Anyways, now back to the most recent interaction I had with her at the train station. I keep wondering why Gigi smiled at me as soon as we saw each other and then walked away and continued looking in my direction. Was she trying to be nice to me? Was she trying to be friendly? Was she trying to look sweet and innocent for the boy she was talking to?



I really don't know what to think of this interaction."
163,"2025 April 17: Dear Diary,

According to the Gnostic Christians, Jesus Christ came to earth to let us know of our own power and to reject the world created by Yaldabaoth. Yaldabaoth was of course a stand-in for Jehovah who ruled tyrannically over his own people. This god could be known as the Demiurge, or the evil deity that rules harshly and creates suffering.  
  
In Gnosticism, Jesus’ message was to reject the Demiurge and to realize that you are the creator of your reality. While I do not believe in a literal evil deity, I find this way of thinking useful. Of course the real Demiurge is not Jehovah, but the society that created him. Jehovah was merely a reflection of the society of the ancient Israelites as he is a reflection of American Christian nationalists today. Naturally, Christ’s message is ignored by so-called Christian nationalists.  
  
Instead of embracing love, some would rather embrace a god that confuses the languages of people because they built a tower. The story of the Tower of Babel is one that shows the true evil power can bring in those who feel threatened. Humanity could have been united, but the all-powerful Jehovah decided to divide people by making them incomprehensible.  
  
“The LORD said, ‘If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.’” Genesis 11:6-7.

It is amazing how one of Jesus’ miracles is to let his apostles speak in tongues. When people are united, there is nothing we can not do. The oligarchs in power realize this and would rather keep us divided. Religion is fading in modern society. The Demiurge is no longer Jehovah or his society, but rather the capitalistic society keeping people poor. Billionaires want to keep their power and will create confusion among the people so we will not build modern towers.

Instead of leaders, we have rulers. Many are content with being ruled as they empathize with the rulers rather than the ruled. This disgusting betrayal of humanity should not be tolerated. Rulers do us no good and instead we should have leaders. Someone who is equal to everyone else but who is skilled enough to navigate people into prosperity. A leader should never lead people into division. A leader would never author confusion, but unify people into creating a society beneficial for everyone. Power corrupts the irresponsible, but those who can be trusted with power will wield it to society’s benefit. They would not be afraid to lose power as it is something from within them.

Sincerely,

Torinico"
164,"I can’t begin to explain how deeply I relate to When Life Throws You Tangerines. In so many ways, this series felt like watching my own life play out on screen—raw, beautiful, and painful all at once. From living with nothing to families squeezed into the homes of relatives, every scene echoed memories I’ve lived through. It’s a quiet yet powerful reminder of how deeply intertwined struggle and love can be.

What stood out most was how it portrayed the dynamics of family—messy, complicated, but fiercely loyal. The love between generations in this series wasn’t just shown, it was felt. You see how love transcends time, how a grandmother’s sacrifice echoes in her daughter’s strength, and how a father’s quiet perseverance shapes the soul of his child.

The series doesn’t shy away from hardship. It shows you the emotional weight a father carries when he can’t provide. It shows you the silent strength of a mother who holds the family together with tears that no one sees. And somehow, even in the chaos and heartbreak, the family stays grounded in each other.

There’s nothing forced about the emotion in this show—it’s pure, honest, and often painful. It makes you cry not because it’s sad, but because it’s real. It reminds you that even when life throws you tangerines—sour, sweet, unexpected—you can still make something beautiful out of it.

This isn’t just a series about family. It’s a reminder of why family matters most. And for anyone who’s ever had to start from scratch, live humbly, or love deeply despite the odds, this show will hit home in the most tender way."
165,"Today I did something that felt really small but meant a lot to me. I added English subtitles to all of my Shorts.  
For the first time, I felt like I was opening a little window to the world  like someone, somewhere far away who speaks a different language, might actually understand what I meant to say.

I know it's just text. I know it's “just subtitles.” But it made my heart flutter a bit.

If you’ve ever done something tiny but meaningful  like organizing your desk, or texting that one person, or just showing up  I see you. That stuff matters.  
And today, this mattered to me. "

173,"2025 April 16: Dear Diary,

Minecraft is a game I have been playing a lot of recently. I used to be too depressed to play video games at all, but now I am playing a lot of Minecraft. Hardcore and normal survival mode were not my best matches so I am currently building a mansion in creative mode and having a great time. With me playing Minecraft more, Minecraft videos get recommended in my YouTube feed.  
  
One video that showed up in my feed made me think a lot, but not necessarily about the topic of the video. It was one of many videos discussing why peaceful mode is terrifying and I was left disagreeing with every single point in the video. The person in the video discussed how they thought all of their achievements felt unearned and they could not enjoy the game. They also felt as though an enemy could spawn despite knowing that would be impossible. This is why the video maker felt peaceful mode was terrifying.  
  
To me this shows a very poor attitude within human nature. I know that this attitude exists in me as well, so it led me to self-reflect. I know that if I had this Minecraft seed in survival I would just enjoy peaceful mode for what it was. I would be grateful for getting the achievements and not care if they felt earned or not. This is something that annoys a lot of people.

 	I do not understand why something as fun as Minecraft would need to be so overcomplicated to the point of creating suffering for one’s self becomes necessary. Enjoying the game for what it is seems like a much better option. I am aware this attitude is not really a choice, but something that just makes human beings different. I can appreciate the difference and opinion the video maker has. What I can not appreciate is the mind set of overcomplicating the world being pushed onto people.

I feel that having fun and being content are the highest forms of being. Of course striving is still necessary, but why would one need to suffer to strive? Should striving not be something to be enjoyed? I enjoy when I strive, but I can only really strive when I ignore other people because many of them get mad that I do not suffer from striving. Creating suffering when there is none seems very counterproductive to me. This is something I have been guilty of before because it is so present in the culture around me, but I recognize I can just have fun most of the time.  
  
Suffering is inevitable, but is not something I need to worry myself about. I am content in the present moment and when I need to make something better, I will strive and have fun making it better. Self-improvement does not need to be something painful; it really can be fun. I just need to let my improvement be fun and not care if people get angry because of that.

174,"Last week, I talked to C, my (romantic) friend from when I lived in northridge. He told me his best friend S’s mom keeps suggesting I might want to go on love on the spectrum. Now, those who know me (hopefully) know how much I hate being reduced to my autism diagnosis. I was originally diagnosed with nonverbal learning disorder, not autism. I understand labels change, but I still don’t relate to stereotypical autistic people you see on tv. I also have never told s’s mom I’m looking for a boyfriend, so she just assumed. 
C understood why I was offended (and obviously doesn’t want me to go on a dating show and meet someone else). But when I told my therapist, I’m not sure he fully understood. What’s wrong with being autistic?
I’m not saying anything’s wrong with it. I’m saying I want to be a normal woman with independence and possibly a boyfriend. I went to college five hours away. I’m going to go to librarian school this fall. What should autism have to do with any of that?"
175,"Dear diary, I have missed a day writing the diary because I was too tired yesterday. In the morning, I had an interview for job opportunity. I didn't do very well as I feel like I'm not well prepared when I thought I have. My English really bad.... Anyway, I don't think I can pass this interview, let's move on to next job. After the interview, I packed my bag and prepared to go Sg to take my things back. My cousin just so happened has already resigned too and so I asked him to teman me. We drove myvi all the way to sg. The traffic wasn't that bad but there is a little bit jam. We departed at around 2pm and reached JB at 7pm. Then we had a ramen dinner before going into Sg. We reached my cousin condo in sg ard 9pm then we straight go to marina bay since my cousin hasn't been to sg for quite awhile. 

While we were in marina bay, 我想起了我的ex. Because we were there once. It was a good memory tho. Anyway, we then go to the casino and register it. We got gifted with $10 but we used it all hahaha lost it straight to the slot machine. Then we quickly go back and catch the last MRT train. 

The next morning, we went to china town to have breakfast. Then, we stopped by orchard road before going back home. Back to the home, I have too many things that I barely fit my things into the car... Omg luckily managed to fit my things but there are few things my aunt ask to bring back unable to bring back. So, we drove to JB and had a late lunch there before departure back home. We departed ard 3pm and finally reached home at 8pm. Omg, it was so tiring luckily my cousin following because he can help me to drive and also I was so sleepy half way tho. Finally, after reaching home, it was again very tiring to unpacked all my stuff 😂. But I will just packed again tomorrow. Still got little things. "

I feel that I should enter the void for at least three minutes a day. Complete silence for two minutes a day is said to be very beneficial. I want to increase this by one minute. This way I can get the benefits from the void while also going a little bit extra.  
  
The void is very peaceful when I am able to wield it. No thoughts running through my head. No noise telling me I am wrong. Just stillness and serenity. Blackness takes up my eyes. I get teleported to the void when they remain closed. Only focusing on breathing.  In and out is the only thing important when in the void.  
  
My thoughts should be realigned with accomplishing what I want to accomplish, not what other people think I should accomplish. I am grateful for this realization. Using the awareness of this fact I can rewire my mind into believing what is necessary in order for me to succeed. The only battle I have is internal. I plan on winning it.

180,"Ah, Vekshemova,

In my lonely hollow this night, my eyes are drawn inexorably to the moon. To you. The luminous but silent watcher that all the night owls ignore as they rush off to their flimsy city lights. You swim alone through the primordial sea, weaving around schools of stars. You hide your face shyly and peek out from the curtains every so often. Every so often, I catch your eye, and you catch me staring.

I miss you. Today I combed through my old messages with my closest friends from that dusty place we called home. They all returned to you--and how could they not? You bathed my every thought in your silver glow. I suppose it was even the dividing line between my true friends and my mere acquaintances. Had I told them of you? Of the deepest feelings of my heart? It is all to easy to dismiss the feelings of a teenager as frivolous folly, meaningless in the last picture. And yet, you have rooted in me so deeply, like a lotus rooted in the mud beneath.

A painful memory returned as I read. Painful and poignant. I savored it. I remember a track championship, one country over. I had fractured my foot, though I didn't know it yet. My first race was horrible, and I knew that my second would be no better. I leaned on the railing to watch your race, unable to walk, alone in the midst of loud teenagers blasting their music, confronting that gnawing fear that I would never be good enough for you. And I watched you run. You started slow, taking it easy, hovering near second place. Then, like lightning, you burst forward in the last lap, furiously burning up the track and claiming victory. In that moment, you were less of an angel and more of a valkyrie. Yes, I knew in that moment that I would never be good enough for you.

I wonder if you sometimes still think of me. You stopped reaching out to me long ago. You have forgotten that kind boy that called you for hours to work on homework together. A part of me wishes that you would somehow stumble across this letter, and read it, and see the signs, and know that it was for you. And yet, it is a letter that can never be sent, and that I know you will never find, just as I know in my heart that you do not still think of me. And indeed, what would it change if you found it? Our courses are set, our paths cannot cross... not even in that lost valley that Jacob Collier sings of...

With fondness,

S"

183,"Mornings in my house are always a little bit wild—but in the best way. I rolled out of bed and went straight into my morning workout. I kept it light but focused—just enough movement to shake off the sleep and get my energy flowing. Even 20–30 minutes can make a big difference in how I show up for the rest of my day.

After that, I slipped into my ""get-things-done"" mode with a little light house cleaning. Nothing major—just picking up after the morning rush, wiping down surfaces, and trying to keep things looking somewhat sane. There’s something so satisfying about getting your space in order before the day really begins.

Meanwhile, my three furbabies were trailing behind me like the little furry supervisors they are. Feeding them, letting them out for their morning sniff-and-explore routine, and giving them their dose of love and attention—it’s honestly one of my favorite parts of the day. Life wouldn’t be the same without them.

Then it was time for my son to get ready for school—and honestly, he makes it easy. He’s almost 8 now and such a little grown-up. He gets himself dressed, makes his bed without being asked, and always seems to be one step ahead. All I really have to do is keep an eye out for the bus and wave him off as he heads out. Watching him become more independent makes me so proud—it’s bittersweet in the best way.

And now… peace.

The house is quiet.  The dogs are napping. I’ve officially entered my favorite part of the day: me time. And today, that means diving back into Zodiac Academy: The Reckoning. No spoilers, please—I'm deep in it and loving every twist, every bit of drama, and every magical moment. It’s one of those books where you keep saying “just one more chapter,” and suddenly it's been three hours.

I might not have checked everything off my to-do list, but the important things? Done. This little pocket of peace between responsibilities is where I recharge. It’s a reminder that taking care of myself is just as important as taking care of everyone else.

Here’s to productive mornings, loyal pups, book escapes, and the kind of calm that feels well-earned.

Waking up this morning I had an idea. As the sun shined in my closed eyes, I turned around and looked at my phone. I got a message from my friend. This delighted me and I felt grateful. In my mind I listed out things I was grateful for.  
  
The idea of a gratitude journal entered my mind. This would of course be something private as I do not want to appear as though I am boasting. In the morning, however, I should have a journal to write down whatever dreams I remember. This is something I used to do before, but I have not done so for a long time.  
  
I believe dreams contain messages. Maybe they are wish fulfillment, maybe they are showing me a part of my psyche I should be aware of. Maybe they are thoughts that I have manifested that are too dangerous to manifest into the 3D. All of these can be true. I should write down the ones I remember and keep them for me to read. They are messages specifically curtailed to me after all. This is something I am thinking about and may do very soon.

When I identify with the essence rather than the human life seems more magical. It feels like there is more to see, more to accomplish, and more to be grateful for. Gratitude feels wonderful. Detaching from my ego and living in the present moment are going to be the best tools I can use to achieve my goals.

i read something this morning that said “for your own peace of mind, do not try to understand everything.” 
i needed to hear it but my mind eventually reverts back to trying to make sense of it all. 

i’ve got issues. i thought, at this point in my life, i had worked through all of them. life will take you by the pigtails and rock you in ways you’d never imagine. you think you know, but you don’t. there may be a demon inside of you that you thought you abandoned. just waiting to creep up on you when you least expect it. 

at this point, it’s been weeks and weeks and i think im finally arriving somewhere now. with myself, my life. am i at a cross roads? do i need to make a decision? i dont have to know it all now, but i can be conscious of what i do with the information i have. the thing is, i dont trust myself. ive lost sight of myself. i have no boundaries and worry about what i do while im in this space. if i don’t act on it, i wonder if ill be in this space forever then. how do i make my mind tolerable to live through? 

i want to say people hurt me, but i know i let them. i see the same patterns , and i understand them. yes, i am the problem. i got issues like i said. i know what needs to change. it’s all glaringly obvious and it hurts. i wish it was enough, safe and okay to just. be myself.  to not have to protect myself. to not have to bend and change into something just to fit the bill of surviving in the cruel and painful world.

Currently, I’m working on leveling my Woodcutting skill, which basically means I’ve spent more time with pixelated trees than I have with actual people this week. I’m out here swinging an axe like I’m training for a medieval lumberjack competition. Honestly? I feel powerful. Confused, but powerful.

Also—my son comes home today from a weekend at his other house and I am READY. I missed him like I missed my metabolism in my twenties. He was only gone for two days, but I spent that time dramatically staring out the window like a golden retriever waiting for his return.

Speaking of golden retrievers, my male pup is finally free of the Cone of Shame. He was recently neutered, and let me tell you, watching him try to run with a cone on his head was like watching a drunk UFO try to land. Now? He’s back to full-speed zoomies and looking at me like ""I forgive you, but I will remember.""

Life’s good. Weird, chaotic, occasionally covered in dog fur—but good. I’m woodcutting, reading, parenting, and thriving.

And yes, I am still pretending I know what I’m doing in RuneScape. Fake it ‘til you make it, right?

I can work towards my goals but it still dosnt feel like enough. I don’t feel like i’m enough most of the time. I over work myself, i keep pushing until i break. Who’s gonna be there to collect the pieces?, only myself, the shell of a girl who can’t take it. 


I’m trying so hard, i swear, i’m trying. I know i won’t do anything drastic because i’m past old habits, but wow I hate this. 


The thoughts in my head, they drive me crazy sometimes. I don’t want to be this anxious, panicky, discontent person, i want confidence, i want to feel okay in my own skin.  


But seriously, i don’t feel like a good person. I care about people but i’m tired. Everything that’s happened in my life has left me exhausted, i won’t give up but wow. I’m so tired. genuinely exhausted.

free me from myself."
198,I want to support others and help but I feel extremely slow I come early and I leave an hour late I dont take a break and yet I feel like I am slow and not normal and they are all thinking it 
199,"I've been showing up in my business everyday I take a little forward movement. Yet nothing. It's almost like am I too late did I waste my life? I could've went to college or something and actually because something meaningful. I feel like a nuisance . I hate living in this ghetto ass hood. I don't want this to be my home anymore or my family, I wish I didn't pay attention to losers in my younger years (even though I was 18 I'm 23 now) if I had started sooner I would have been further I feel like. 
I'm sorry for the error. "
200,"2025 April 12: Dear Diary,

I took a shower with intention today! This is something I need to do way more than I usually do. It is good to see the old version of myself wash away with the physical filth as well. Setting an intention when I shower is a constant reminder of my growth.  
  
Something else I should do is give myself at least two minutes a day in the void. Complete silence enhances growth as well. Staying in the void for two to three minutes a day would be of great benefit to me. I should probably go even longer.  
  
I know that I will never stop consuming, but I really do want to get myself to a point where I create ten times more than I consume. Whether it is laziness or burnout, I will not let that feeling win. Transmuting that feeling into pure unadulterated creative energy is my only option. Absolutely nothing must get in my way.

Sincerely,

Torinico"
201,"Currently multitasking like a legend—fumbling through Old School RuneScape like the noob I am while Geralt handles the real monster slaying in The Witcher. Later, I’ll be switching gears to Zodiac Academy: The Reckoning (no spoilers or I will fight).

Still crushing my fitness journey like it owes me money. Might even get a workout in before bed just to show off for my three dogs—they're my toughest critics. Feeling happier, lighter, and a little more like a confident badass every day. Mental health’s on the mend, and my body’s finally catching up. We love to see it.

"
202,"How do I feel today? I feel rage. I feel anger. I want to fucking kill you. Why? Because you ruined me. You absolutely, completely, and utterly left me destroyed. Who the fuck let you believe that you can do this to people? And how many other innocent women have you hurt, ruined, shattered?

You had no right to do that to me, none at all, but you still did. I just want to know why, and then after you’ve explained, I want you to suffer just like me. I’m getting ‘professional help’, not that it’s really doing anything yet. The only thing that’s really going to help me is fucking you up so badly until you beg me to stop – just like I begged you to. But I wont stop – just like you didn’t. And I’ll watch you suffer – just like you watched me. To end, I’ll dismiss you pleading to me – exactly how you did to me. I wonder if you like how it feels?

I’m going to make a change because you can’t get away with your actions. My soul hurts for other women who you’ve made feel this way. No one deserves the type of pain I’m feeling; it’s sickening, frightening, so bad that I can’t imagine any other words to describe it. You’ve made me feel so depressed, so sad, so dirty. Most days I can’t even look at myself in the mirror. The funny thing is, I’m saying “myself” when I don’t even know who I am anymore. Not after you violated me.

I enjoyed my life. Spending time with my husband, my family, and my friends was something I always looked forward to. I loved slow mornings when I was pregnant, with my husband making breakfast and coffee, whilst I sat on the couch pondering about the day ahead of us. Now I feel lonely; isolated; trapped. But I’m in a world with eight billion people. How is it possible you can make someone feel this way?

I want to scream from every rooftop what you fucking did to me, but at the same time I don’t feel like I have an ounce of strength left in me. You’re an utter joke. I hope one day you suffer so much that you also want to end your life in the same way I have. I have a perfect new baby and the most supportive husband anyone could ask for. I have missed out on the first few months of my son’s life because of the trauma you have caused me. 

Right now, I should be living life to the fullest with my new family: snuggling on the sofa, talking about types of food we’re going to feed him first and watching my husband flourish into the perfect dad he is destined to be. I want to do that. And I will. But right now, I’m on the sofa writing this journal to you because of what you did to me.

I refuse to let your actions make me feel this way. You don’t deserve to have my energy spent thinking about you. What you deserve is a train barrelling at a hundred miles an hour over your stupid red-haired head. I’d drug you and lay you on the tracks, so the base of your skull was just over its lip. The train would come when the drugs begin to wear off, but you won't be able to move – just like I couldn’t. Once it hit you, I’d finally be free, knowing that you can’t fuck another innocent woman up the way you did me. I think I’d watch that and genuinely laugh – seeing the fear in your eyes as your life comes to an end would be so fucking funny.

So right now, I’m going to bed to lay with my beautiful son and perfect husband. That’s where I’m supposed to be. Fuck you, fuck everyone you love, fuck your red hair and jam-jar glasses. Absolutely fuck you, you piece of shit."
203,"Early in the morning, I had muscle pain... My whole body ache from yesterday volleyball session. My family planned to visit my uncle newly bought property, and ask if I wanna follow them, I was too tired and just want to rest at home. So I ended up staying at home, searching job, playing games and watching drama. Oh ya, I continued reading the discipline book. A few things to highlight from the book

1. Practice makes it perfect 
2. Just work on it knowing is a torture 
3. Dress properly 
4. Manage the load, know the limit. 
5. Sleep is very important. 

Later, I had dinner with my uni friends. Because my friends are coming back to Msia from Sg. The dinner was at cheras sausage and ribs shack. The dish I ordered is the sausage and it was okok only. Then we chilled at one of my friends house until 1am. Btw, thought of the day, my friend brought their partner to gathering. But it seems like their partner especially the girls, didn't really enjoy the gathering as they are only playing phone and we didn't really talk to them. I just feel like maybe we should really get them involved more often or is it right to bring partners to the gathering? "
204,"2025 April 11: Dear Diary,

I have no idea what is wrong with my attention. It seems to be divided a lot of the time. The idea of sitting down and reading a book without millions of thoughts going through my head sounds amazing. Yet, I need to take quite a bit of caffeine in order to achieve this. Sometimes the caffeine does not work properly and I still have thoughts outside of my book.  
  
Still it is more helpful to read while under the influence of caffeine. My attention is at least mostly on the book rather than the world in my head. Not that the world in my head is bad, in fact I am cultivating it to be the most wonderful place on the planet. No, the world in my head is fine, but I must still interact with the actual world. This is especially important if I want to cultivate the best possible world for my head.

205,"On March 1st, 2025, I made a decision that felt long overdue—I started my fitness journey. At the time, I weighed 198.6 pounds. I wasn’t feeling my best physically or mentally, and I knew something had to change. I didn’t want a quick fix; I wanted a real lifestyle shift.

Fast forward to today—April 11th, 2025—and I’m proud to say I’ve lost 12.4 pounds. I'm now at 186.2 and feeling stronger, more confident, and more connected to myself than I have in a long time.

What’s worked for me so far is a simple, consistent routine:

I work out 5 days a week (even on the days I don’t feel like it).
I track what I eat, aiming for 1500 calories a day—but I don’t force myself to hit that number if I’m not hungry.
I prioritize protein to stay full and fuel my workouts.
One thing I’ve done differently this time around: I only allow myself to weigh in once a month. I used to get so caught up in the number on the scale—checking daily, letting it mess with my mood, doubting myself when the progress wasn’t instant. Now, I focus on how I feel instead of what I weigh. I want to celebrate my energy, my strength, and my consistency—not just a number.


It hasn’t always been easy, but it’s been worth it. I’ve learned that small steps, taken daily, really do add up. This journey isn’t about perfection—it’s about progress, mindset, and self-respect.

This is just the beginning, and I’m excited to see where it takes me next. If you’re thinking of starting, don’t wait for the “perfect” moment. Start small. Start today.

"
206,"Today, I woke up quite late as usual, but I started with making my bed. Tidying up my table. Being disciplined. ha! Then started looking for job le. I finally had 1 interview but it was associate job, not sure how much I can get pay. Is a Singapore company, but I just hope they can pay in sg dollars haha but just dreaming... I just hope they can pay me around 5k that's all. Anyway, I didn't have time to read the book, I played games with my cousin and watch HER. I haven't finished watching it but this movie is quite interesting as it portray in future when there is AI in our world. An AI that accompanied us, that knows everything and suited best to you. 1 thing special about this AI is that they can develop feelings, and started dating the protagonist. They have Tele sex, but AI don't have a body, so the AI found some girl who willing to be the body and have sex with the guy. But the guy just felt very weird having a body but with AI voice, and so he stopped. And the girl break down because she thought she is not pretty enough... Anyway I watch until here only. 

Oh ya, and also I go back to playing volleyball now but that place is so freaking far away weih... Anyway, I had a good time playing the volleyball and hopefully more to come. "

二時四十六分

昨日はいいです。弟とはプールに行きました。おいしい焼きそばを食べました。ｎｉｒｖａｎａを聞きませんでした。でも日本語の音楽を聞きました。ちょっと日本語を勉強しました。今日はプールに帰つて、ｔａｒｇｅｔ に行きます。Fun.

Alright, now back to my native tongue, the only language I can actually say that I speak since I'm learning Japanese so slowly. God, I wish that I weren't so stupid and lazy. I wish that so badly. Heck, even fixing *one* of those things would make my life infinitely better; yet, I can't seem to fix either. Maybe I'm meant to be a fuckup. Maybe this is just who I am. I mean, doesn't *someone* have to be the village bum? Maybe I had this misfortune of drawing that card in the game of Life, and now I'm stuck with it for however long I live. Anyway, my Japanese still sucks for someone who's been studying it so long (3 1/2, or 三半, months, though some of them were wasted with poor study habits,) and I don't know how to get any better. I envy smart people—ohhhhh, how I envy them. I think I even envy them more than hot people, maybe even more than funny people. I hate myself. I just really suck, when all else is said and done. "
208,"2025 April 10: Dear Diary,

I actually wrote a little bit for myself today. It is something I am glad I did. For too long I have been in a constant state of consuming, which I am aware is wrong. I should be creating way more than I consume. Some people may never see my writing, but I should still do it anyway, because it is for myself and no one else.  
  
I am also overcoming needing people to like me. I am going to write what I want to write because I feel called to write it. Sanitizing my writing to appeal to more people is the last thing I want to do. No longer will I worry about if something is “acceptable” to write about. I will never intend any harm from my writing and will be strict with my own morals when I write, but it is not to appeal to anyone. 

A true creative should not care how people view their work. This is something I have come to realize recently. Creative people are that way for the sake of being creative. Having people like their work is just a bonus. Sometimes people will not like their work. Sometimes people will ignore their work and other times people will despise their work. What matters is if the creative person themself likes their work. I love the work I do when I get the chance to do it. Improvement is something that will come along the more I write. Building myself up is what is most important, right now. I should not demean myself when I do need a break.

Sincerely,

Torinico"
209,"This may come as a shocker but I have feelings too. In case you forgot or weren’t aware. I do in fact have feelings, yes. I experience intense emotions and everything. I’m a human being as well. "
210,"Today I had a really good time, good my only day off in a week. Nothing special, I talked with piggy a LOT and that helped me face to face myself. I needed to take a some breath. And now im feel better! I wrote that today had a good time but nothing special, but its not. Today was full of special and everyday everytime so special because I have piggy now. 

I know my post is always so chaotic and so messed, but I want keep remember what happened to me and piggy and someday me and piggy will look back what we went through. so I really want to keep remember all happened, all my, piggy's thoughts and what we felt. So Im sorry for sometime I posting here my so random and wacky diary thing but I really need to do this.

Lovest piggy! you are my lifesaver and my faith and my true best friend ever. And you are my war buddy sweetest piggy. I love you more than anything more!

Sometime I feel so sorry for piggy and this feeling killing me. if piggy never came to me and could went to someone who be nice and have a good life then piggy could have happy and safe days, life. Just feel so unfair for piggy... You deserve to happiest happiness, Im really not deserve you.
but I'll try to I'll be."
211,Today everything broke again . For the last two years I've isolated myself from everyone after I realized I'm the villian. Currently I have no one for years I've kept all of my real trauma to myself and done nothing but suck the oxygen out of a room . I no longer know what to do . I can't make friends I can't patch my old relationships and I can't move from this place in life. I'm 27 years old and I've spent every waking moment of those twenty seven years hating myself while loving everyone else when I was 21 I realized that everytime my real feelings caught up to me I would destroy myself and cling on to the nearest person and destroy them with me . The day it all hit me I decided I would leave everyone . I had tried ending my life without any success for over a decade . I've just ghosted through life wishing I was dead wishing that the first time I tried would have been the last time I had to be here on this mortal coil. I've been doing evey kind of therapy known to man and implementing every tool in the book . But when the feelings and the old wounds open up again it's like that scared and scarred little girl is still the only person in there. What do I do ?  I can't live with myself. It's gotten to the point that I haven't looked at myself in a mirror in over a year . I just can't see her see me and I cant bear to let anyone else either .
212,I fear how others think of me to the point where I developed self bullying to coop and now I cry over my own bullying to myself like I abuse myself I make ppl look like shadown of my own thoughts and fear so its like ppl are bullying me but it's in my own head its me and I am scared and sick of myself 
213,"So, today I again, keep finding my job. After so many hours so many listings, but very few is suitable for me... I'm so dead... I really need to find a job. Anyway, my ex colleague found out that I quit my job, and came back for good. I broke up some more. So they really jio me out for dinner 😂. We had a good catch up, especially one of my colleagues who has been trying to have baby for about 1 year and they finally did it! So happy for him! And another colleague decided to quit and pursue her career by helping her sister. Really am happy to meet them and hopefully we can play badminton again. 

Btw, I started reading a book today ""Discipline is Destiny"" by Ryan holiday. Actually whatever I have read in the book I already know, but it's just hard to follow. 

1. Wake up early and do something useful for example exercise, reading etc

2. Challenges life is the best life as we could learn many things from the challenges. And we still keep learning from challenges to make things easier next time.

3. Quit being a slave to anything be it money, power, sex. What matters is whether it's good for you. 

4. Avoid buying unnecessary stuff, don't be too desire of anything. 

5. Clean up the work space, to make things easier to access or lockable. Messy table will have messy mood. Start to make your bed and tidy your desk starting today. 

6. Just show up whatever it is. Just show up and the momentum will keep you moving. Just do it! 

7. Even the small detail small steps is very important. Don't skip the small steps do it right!

214,"Dr found out why i was pooping blood. It was laceration in the small intestine. He attributred it to my taking NSAID painkiller ibuprofen.

I had to undergo 2 days of examination and swallow a camera pill to find it out. Anyway it was not life threatening, he gave me some medication to thicken the mucus layer of the intestines and the wounds should heal up nicely.

The reason i felt so stressed in the first place was because i took up an unfamiliar project, no doubt fueled by my financial needs, and had headaches.

I've regretted getting married, to a wife who doesnt work and pressurizes me for financies.  

But i'm done regretting. Whatever the cause, i'm just here, now, dealing with it.

I have 2 contracts due shortly and i need to get my shit together and deal with them. That is my reality. Wife was venting again last night, about how we never have fun anymore and how i dont take her to travelling, that she sees us being so different and wants a divorce and whatnot. She complained about how we're not travelling in easter.

I said i really dont want to travel because it was only 10 days ago when i last pooped blood, and i'm now on medication and want to wait til my small intestines healed up nicely. And she was unhappy. She vented until what felt like 2:30 am until i fell asleep.

And as a result i couldnt go to work to deal with my work stuff in the morning. 

I know i can walk out that door and intiate a divorce anytime. It's just that divorce laws arent kind to men, and i want to stay and take care of the kids, and i would rather bear the animosity if can than to spend a humongous amount on divorce lawyers, leaving the family finances in ruins.

So this is me, hiding now in office, working at times , feeling dejected at times, but still here.

The mistake was made long ago. The last i couldve left was before the 2nd child. Maybe i need to wait for another few years before i can realisticlly contemplate divorce without completely wrecking my finances. 

Try to stay alive until then without pooping blood."
215,"Positive and negative, yin and yan, ebb and flow, alpha and omega, I suppose that's why I wish to remain neutral. When one thing happens, it's opposite is sure to happen.  Remain neutral so you don't tip the scale. Never get too happy, Never too melancholy. 

Balance.

216,My best friend and i moved to a new place together for study. We have been together for 4 years now he is mean sometimes but overall i he was good i mean never bad at heart. But ever since we moved he is been too mean insulting me at all point making me feel that i am dumb. I tried talking to him but he says he doesn’t mean that way. He has changed way too much. Its like is a completely different person now. Now when i come to think of it maybe he had been like that for all the time that we were together but back then i had other people too so i never gave it a thought but here he was the inly person i already knew so maybe that was the reason i started noticing things i don’t know. What do you people say ? Was he always like that or maybe chnage of location had an issue 
217,"i'm pretty good at scaring off men and i don't really care.  there's a reason i'm alone, most people just couldn't or wouldn't want to handle my shit.  the important part is that *I* can handle my shit.  it's possible i've just given him something to think about but it's more likely that i'll never see him again.  i don't regret it and i'm not ashamed. "
218,"I didn't ask to be born into this kind of life.
Bad noise, tin roof, cracked walls, voices—it really never stops, but the silence I've felt is so loud. I grew up watching and observing people and their struggles, not on a screen, but in front of me.
I mean, people suffer, but I really couldn't argue about it, but just listen.
I really hate those days when those past events are so messy: seeing my mom stabbed and my stepfather throwing hot water in my mom's face, and that last thing is seeing our house burned down.
Sometimes I really don't know what to feel, since some pains don't really make me suffer anymore.
There is still a kid inside of me who cries every single night asking whats really my purposed of living.
I couldn't really find happiness in life, and yet I'm rotting in bed again. I'm starting to see myself as a failure. I've prayed that I wish I weren't the man I shouldn't be, and that is my father.
I haven't really met my father, but what I know is that i have live because i have purposes.
I started to change myself, one by one, by walking and meeting people. Through my loneliness, some of those pictures created memories, and that created my value.
Though I thought I would be lonely on my journey, I was just blind. I started to create content about my journey and talk to those who suffer; yet, it still feels empty. But that journey made me realize that sometimes we cannot really see the value of someone who is right in front of us.
I was just a kid who wanted to hear “I’m proud of you” from someone who was never coming back.
I laugh at things that aren’t funny. I talk to myself more than I talk to people. I get lost in my own head. I created little parts of me just to survive—Curiosity, Misplaced, Vanished, Recalling.
I don’t know if it’s normal.
But it’s the only way I know how to cope.
I take pictures of things that people ignore. A broken flower growing by the roadside. An old man staring into the sky. Rust on a wall that somehow looks like art. I feel like that rust—forgotten, but still here. Still trying to be seen.
I want to join the military. Not to be a hero, but to make my life mean something. I want to show the world that kids like me kids who come from nothing can still rise. Can still matter.
Sometimes, I wonder why I’m still here. Why God let me wake up when everything feels so heavy. But maybe… maybe there’s a reason. Maybe someone out there feels the same and just needs to hear this:
You’re not alone.
Because I’m still here.
Still watching.
Still dreaming.
Still breathing as the Misplaced Eye"
219,"Its been a so while since my last posted here.
My days literally WAR. I put on ""Warpaint"" on my face for money and trying so hard to make a fake smiles always.

And maybe he doesn't work instead of try to take care of me..? Hm, I dont know.
I starting faded about him and those situations.
I supposed to be take care of my parents.
My dad's condition is unstable, and even so my mom and dad's relation is more unstable.
And Im so freaking tired about mom makes get me involved their wife-husbands fight. And I hate she keep make me realized me and dad's time running out any minute. I know i really know about it.
But I need a money, need a make money.
Wondering why my Husband-ish doesn't help that at all. But my any emotions for him nothing for now.
He is same as my customers. Only he does to me, its make me so tired and crush my chill or happy time after my work!

I really really really appreciated of my love, lovest piggy. Piggy is my more than all my heart and all my soul.  More than my life. 
When I do my job everynight, piggy is near me. 
And smiling at me and says ""everything gonna be great. No worries.""
This job that I did now, is so lonely. But I have piggy, so Im not alone at all. 

Me and piggy enjoying listened our fav music and conversations, cuddle, and watching our fav TV series etc without husband-ish.

Work is so tired and everything on my shoulder is really too much for me.

But I really want make piggy happy, make piggy keep safe. And one day we'll get more success.
I dont think I could get out of this shitty job, but at least I can relax a little and could have more free time with piggy. 

Im so fucking tired, but Show must go on for piggy, piggy's life! 
My depression was gone. Tired, yes. Miserable, No.
I have energy for make piggy's life better and better and make piggy happiest one whole in the world, whole in the universes.

I keep my smile, but only front of piggy, I can be true me. No hide anything.

Sometime I wake up middle of the sleeping bc Im nervous and feel unsecure, then piggy always hugs me and says ""its okay, im here for you. So you can go back your sleep.""
I cant explain enough but that piggy's voice tone is like a medicine, unbelievable softly and calm.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE YOU PIGGY.
I LOVE YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING.
I'LL GIVE YOU ANYTHING TO YOU EVEN MY LIFE. 

Promise piggy, I will make you happy.
So Im not give in.

Well, today only me and piggy's day off.
We'll enjoy a hamburger and frenchfrie!
Only today, I can eat whatever I waet.
Lets enjoy our short day off time.

And for now, good night.

If someone read this shit, thankyou so much.
Much appreciated about it.
Hope you all days will full of smiles and laughter and joy."
220,"I'm past my breaking point. I have no one to talk to so I write to no one in particular. I just need to know that someone will see this. Below is a journal entry I've just written.

---

""Why do they believe me when I say I’m okay? What reason do they have? I mean I’ve been saying it all my life. Hasn’t that given them reason to question my unwavering consistency? At least once? Have they ever thought hard about whether or not I’m really okay? Why do they trust me? I’ve never been able to fully trust myself. Have they ever wondered whether or not they really know the person they place their trust in? Why do I lie? I say I don’t care when I do. I get angry. I feel. Do they know that? Do they know what I feel? Do they know I can feel? Do they want to know? Why wouldn’t they? Maybe they don’t want to believe it because it hurts. It hurts to know that they’ve trusted the wrong person. To know that I’m just like everyone else. I’m not different. It hurts to know that I hurt. That I’m capable of hurting. I do hurt. But I don’t show it. It starts as anger and ends as sadness. But it always hurts. Its tangible. I can feel it in the way I shake when I try to keep it away. The way I get hot. But then I stop. The hurt doesn’t though. It stays. It hides. It builds. It consumes me. Then it breaks me. Beats me. Then I beats things. I beat myself. I beat others. That’s when they see me. They see the side of me that hurts. But they don’t believe it. I tell them I’m okay and it eases them. I’m not okay. I’ve never been okay. Why do they believe me when I say I’m okay?"""
221,"2025 April 9: Dear Diary,

What fundamentally saddens me the most is my own procrastination. This is no one’s fault but my own, and that is why it is the most saddening. As much as I would genuinely love to spend hours typing away and making the stories that are constantly playing in my head come to life, I often feel trapped. My creative energy seems to come in bursts, especially after consuming caffeine, the greatest chemical to be discovered.  
  
Partially this is due to my neurodivergence. No doubt, it is more difficult to navigate one’s own self and achieve one’s desires when neurodivergence makes you feel little. This is probably why my intake of caffeine has gone up a lot higher as well. Although this is part of my problem, I will not be scapegoating my neurodivergence on my procrastination. That would be the easy way out.  
  
My neurodivergence may be holding me back a little bit, but I feel as though I benefit more from being neurodivergent. The superficial nonsense of society has less of a grip on me, although it is still there. Creative ideas also flow through my mind constantly, sometimes it is maddening. Neurodivergence is not the problem, obviously more so society’s treatment of neurodivergent people.  
  
Again, I will not take the easy way out and blame society for my problems. Their treatment of neurodivergent people is for me to overcome. Help is necessary at times, and I do realize my power to overcome what others may project onto me. My vibrations are mine alone to raise. Still it is often saddening how misunderstood neurodivergent people are. It seems the well meaning neurotypicals who think they are helping seem to be the most hateful. Although I am frustrated with neurotypicals, I do not really hate them. This would be a lazy thing to do. It is not a neurotypical person’s fault they do not understand neurodivergent people, they just need to be better educated on the subject.  
  
The way I detest society holds me back, but also propels me more forward than I can imagine. I am constantly amazed by the ideas I have when it comes to storytelling, but disappointed by my lack of effort. I have no idea why I feel so burnt out. Maybe it is because I have to deal with society quite often. This is why I want to stop using Instagram. Constantly dealing with people tends to lower my vibrations, so I have to take it into my own hands to avoid most people. Some people can be amazing, however. I have met a few people who have raised my vibrations. I know in my heart good people do exist. My hope is that I can focus on them more than the wicked or stupid people.

222,"I woke up late today, and I started finding job on jobstreet, linkedin after finding for so long I only apply like 3 jobs? That are suitable... Omg someone please tell me whether is worth to pursue in engineering sales career? I was sibeh tired today idk why? Maybe because I played pickleball last night and it was so tiring... I set an alarm to wake up 30mins later but I ended up slept for another hour.... After I had my dinner, I spend time with my family by watching Singapore drama in living room, I rarely stay in living room and spend time with my family but I think I should do that more often now.

223,"This doesn't usually bode well for me and it just excites kitten. Everything, and I mean, everything I say is dangerous. The implications that it holds. But I always come back, don't I?

I had no idea what to write about today. All I know is that I need to write something. This challenge is getting me to write and is also getting me more alright with the fact that people will perceive me. Sometimes it can be difficult to detail exactly what I did during the day which is why most of these entries are about random nonsense I am thinking of.  
  
Currently, I am eating microwavable Kozhukatta and a slice of sour dough bread while I watch my kittens sleep. There is not much interesting about any of that, but I am grateful for the mundanity. The present is certainly the best moment to be. Being grounded in reality feels nice. I would like to balance adventure with being grounded.

225,"This is going to backfire. I'm going to get in trouble. I know why I'm here. She knows why she is. This is not a good idea. There's no reason to be doing this, and yet I'm compelled. She's happy about it. Everything I do gets me in trouble, unless I do nothing, which feels worse. How am I supposed to do this? I'm failing. And if I'm looking outside of the support system I have, what does that mean? What's missing? I can't let you talk, kitten. You and I both know that's a horrible idea. Well, I do. This is tragic and hard enough as it is with you around. I'm trapped. "

227,"There is nothing to do in the morning, I went into my sister room and started chatting with her about the job related since she is doing sales, and ended up she complained and just want to release her anger on her trip with her friend. 

In the afternoon, I went out and have lunch with my friend, I wanted to consult her about her job as sales engineer, is it worth to do it. She only talked about her company, and she don't recommend me going in as the salary is not high and the commission is based on salary as well... Now I just don't know what to do man... We had a lot of chat, about my relationship, my life and so on. 

At night, my cousin jio me for pickle ball, I went to my cousin house to pickup paddle. I borrow from them. Then I went to play pickleball with my other cousin. He jio his ex colleague and uni friend. It was so tiring as we play 2hrs. My cousin also just quit his job, he wanted to do his own business but he don't have a clear direction yet. He told himself that he can only rest for April and need to initiate in May. I think he is kind of lost as well just like me. "
228,"2025 April 7: Dear Diary,

Thinking about the future makes one anxious and thinking about the past makes one depressed. I know this, but still somehow get stuck on thoughts not involving the present. Sometimes I try to be more present minded but that makes me anxious because I think I may forget my lessons and how to use them.  
  
What I need is more faith. I need to abandon certainty and push through anything getting in the way of my success. No longer shall I turmoil in my pathetic self-pitying. No longer will I let anyone’s bad energy affect my vibrations. I only give myself permission to make me happy or sad, no one else.  
  
Living in the present does not have to be scary. Sometimes I will fail. Sometimes I will suffer, but other times I will thrive. Other times I will be surrounded by pleasure. If I can not enjoy the present, how can I enjoy the future? I can’t. This is why I need to let go of anything holding me back and have absolute faith in myself. My spirit is indomitable and I will start acting like it.

229,"i'm consistent, give a lot and don't ask for much so it's really easy to take me for granted.  narcissists love my supply and i'm sure avoidants do too because (not to brag), it's top notch.   i've been supplying people for years, it's almost my profession at this point.  me, i can do without most people because i've had to my whole life.  also, i'm an avoidant myself and that's sort of our curse. 

in class today, i could tell my friend was struggling with goodbye and fully wrapping his mind around the concept of never seeing me again (i'm committed to trying to keep in touch, but you know it's not the same).  at the end of class, i said i'd see him tomorrow, which is our actual final class together, and he just sat there without saying anything for a minute before telling me he couldn't believe that this was all just over.  as we were all leaving and saying goodbye to each other as a class, he said 'can't we have another two years of this?' and it broke my heart.  it's times like these i'm grateful to be myself and to get the pleasure of my own company 24/7 because (again, not to brag), i think i'm pretty great most of the time.  i didn't used to.  i had to work on that relationship a lot and i'm proud of the peace i've made with myself.  

of course, it hurts me too.  tremendously.  there is a horrible aching pain in my heart right now because school meant so much to me and has made me such a better person.  i am truly wounded to leave it all behind.  i fell in love at school too and i'm really glad i'll never have to be in the same labs reliving experiences i had with the object of my affection over and over, knowing they're gone for good.

Got embarrassed in the job interview. Bombed that now.

231,"My friend jio me to go Ipoh for breakfast this morning. So, he came and pick me up in the morning. We had a a lot of deep chat in the car. He is a very good friend of mine. He is a smart guy who thinks a lot. He is very good at comforting people, because he knows what exactly the person needs right now. He learnt many truth and dig down to people's ugly truth. For example, he had many body count, however, he thinks that this is normal. Because it is a needs, and if is 你情我愿 why not? He find it hard to love the other half as he is tired of commitment. He said that might as well take the time to improve himself, be it reading, working out or working. But if he has desire to satisfy, he will do it and things are quite easy for him as he is a good talker and handsome. To me, I am very curious about that feeling as I'm personally quite horny as well, but I do not have many chances and I'm not a good talker and not handsome as him. But one thing I'm scared of, if I really like him satisfying my needs, then in future if I have a wife for many years, will it be a peaceful and lovely family? Will I stop my horny action with other people despite having wife at home? Since if I have done it before, will I really fully stable after doing it? 

So, one of the deep talks he ask me was, if you are able to travel back and talk to the younger you, at which period would you like to travel back? I replied, the time where I confess to my ex. I wanted to tell myself that you will eventually love your ex more and more. So don't doubt yourself and tell your ex about your feelings at that moment. We might not be together forever, but definitely not because of what I said to her and hurt her like forever. Then I asked him back, how about you? He said, he wants to travel back to 16yo him as he thinks that the 16yo him will understand that you don't have to follow majority to decide your path. Just do what you like and not care about other people view of point. 

Anyway, we had a great time enjoying the food in Ipoh, visiting temple at lumut. "
232,"2025 April 6: Dear Diary,

Shamefully I have given other people power over my thoughts. Anger and fear overcome me from time to time. I realize it is wrong to let people affect me this way, but it sometimes feels as though I can not control it.  
  
Rather than being a furious coward, I would instead like to be a genuinely loving courageous person. Having the self awareness to know I can do better is a gift, at least. In fact, it is a gift I am beyond grateful for. How can one do better when they do not know they should be better.  
  
Despite being depressed about how I do not get alone with people outside of my friends, I am genuinely happy to be alive. I am grateful for life and very grateful for the knowledge that I have the power to be the best I can. Only I should have power over myself, not anyone else.

233,"I've been thinking about going full Light mode and making a secret section in my desk drawer, needing a very specific way to open. Would it work though, and are there better options?"
234,"I'm finally back to home in Msia. The first thing I woke up is to jio my friend out for lunch. He was playing badminton with the secondary school friend which I know but not close. Then, they are actually having lunch there. It was awkward but fine since already there just have lunch. We sit diff table tho so still ok. Then, I asked him about the Nirvana agent job because he had done before, hmm now I need to think properly. Idk why man. Yesterday I wanted to do it so badly but today suddenly no feel to do it. Then, my friend suddenly called one of the secondary friend because his company is hiring. Sales engineer. Wow it was something that I never thought of doing it. I not sure whether I should persue this career or not because other than doing sales, what can I do right? So I really need to think, and I have a friend also doing sales engineer although is different products but still I ask her how does it feel as a sales engineer. Anyway, I went back home and started watching 娘惹 with my family. I rarely watch TV with them at living room and now I want to do it more often. I think I should cherish the moment more. Btw, I started playing bumble quite a while and I never had over 50likes before and now I got it... Wow what happened?

236,"I’ve been so tired lately. Not physically, just the kind of tired that comes from overthinking everything.  
Content, direction, productivity, even rest — it all turns into tasks.

Tonight I just wanted quiet company.  
I turned on my camera while cooking, no makeup, no topic, no goal. And somehow… it became this gentle, present moment. People popped in. We talked. I didn’t perform, I just *was*.

It felt like I could finally breathe without needing to prove anything.

Afterwards, I just sat there in the kitchen for a while, feeling weirdly full — not just from dinner, but from presence. From being seen without pressure.

I don’t know what this post is for. I just didn’t want the moment to disappear without leaving a mark somewhere."

I woke up in the morning doing my daily routine, and then started packing my luggage back to home. I had a lot of ideas on how to actually move all my things from Sg back to Msia, I had a lot of discussion with my brother, because initial plan was him to pick me up but ended up I ask my aunt in sg for help. She contacted one of my distant cousin whom I never thought of to move my things to her house first. Then, few days or next weekend I will go pick it up by my own car. 

After moving all my stuff, I forgot one important thing which I keep remind myself not to forget but I still forgot. Which is a connector for the key, it is quite important as the connector is belong to the bag my ex gifted. If I lose the connector, it loose the function that my ex say is quite convenient. So, I go back to my dorm and take it luckily I throw the key at reachable distance. Then, I'm out from Sg. I had a lot of thought in the bus, should I be a part time property agent, or Nirvana agent. Anyway, I will find out nirvana first. "
238,"2025 April 5: Dear Diary,

What I want to do most is create. I genuinely want to put in the effort to become the greatest I can possibly be. This is first and foremost my top priority as I do not think anything else matters. Nothing is more important than striving.  
  
As I say all of this I can not help but feel depressed. I consume a lot of content, not because I want to but because I think my vision for creation is blurred. Perhaps my vibrations have lowered. Sitting down at my computer and writing my stories is a lot of fun and what I want to spend my life doing. Applying myself is where the difficulty begins.  
  
I wrote a little bit more than I usually do. Afterwards I did not feel accomplished that I wrote, but angry with myself that I did not write more. Recognizing my vibrations dropping was something that happened at work recently. 

My friend had to leave and I was left to deal with a multitude of people. I do want to stay at my job for longer, but if my vibrations continue to decrease I will put myself first. Currently I am listening to 432Hz frequencies in order to raise my vibrations a little. They are working and I do feel happier as I listen to them. I think listening to them as I write and read will help me to stay focused on my goals and unblur my vision for creation.

I took a walk in the woods today with my mom, her friend (who I’ll call Sandra), and her friend’s son (who I’ll call Peter). I have not seen Sandra and Peter in a while so it was nice to talk to them. The woods raised my vibrations a little bit, which was nice to feel.  
  
I am quite close to another one of Sandra’s kids (I’ll call them Mac). I have talked to Mac somewhat recently, but not too recently. Staying mindful in the woods was something I tried to do. Mindfulness really helps raise my vibrations. Also listening to 432Hz frequencies.   
  
After our walk, my mom and I went to lunch. I had chicken parmigiana and two cups of coffee. Maybe I am drinking too much coffee. I really like the focus it gives me, but maybe I am overdoing it. I have not gone into work yet today, but I believe it will be just another typical Friday at work.

242,"今天呢，我起得很早。6am 就起了，因为昨晚太累了。很早就睡了。I started my day watching 2D1N mom's diary Korean show. Then I also start playing God of war. This game so far so good. Anyway, I went to office because is my last day and I need to pass my work permit. As well as my work. My colleague actually bought me a farewell gift 🥹 I didn't expect to have farewell gift tho I just thought to have a dinner only. Anyway, I really wanted to thank them for buying farewell gift to me. Especially, my direct senior, she even cried again...

Then, I also had a chat with my boss, and he wishes me a good journey and willing to teach me again if I were to go back his company. 

After that, we have a dinner at a place. It was a Chinese restaurant called panda bar where we can singk and play pool. The food there is quite nice. The environment there is also nice. Lastly, we bid farewell... They were really good people. I am not sure why would they treat me so good, as I didn't treat them good. I am always receiving... I didn't really give them a lot of help. I'm not sure if I'm deserve to be so good. I must say I'm really lucky to have good people around me. Just that don't have good working experience only. I must say, I'm lucky as always to be surrounded by good people. "

245,"TW: animal cruelty, animal death  
  
I started the workday out in my car sobbing bitterly into my hands. 

I knew I had a lot of shit to get done before my first period class. 

I knew I had to hurry and pull myself together. To get inside the building and get my lesson activity set up. A lesson on antibiotic resistance. Within our unit on evolution.   
  
I have been a tad stressed out with the evolution unit, ever since one of my students made a wisecrack implying that people with a specific health condition should be permitted to die. And that ""that's just natural selection"". 

A health condition (easily survivable with modern medicine) that my son has. Which the student is well aware of. 

I wound up re-tooling the unit a bit, in response to that remark. 

Day one-- we discussed how genetic diversity gives a species overall a protective factor against extinction, in the face of environmental changes.   
  
And I discussed how human pro-social behaviors and medical innovations that keep people with health conditions alive are not separate from natural selection. 

Day two, I discussed R-selected species vs. K-selected species. I explained how K-strategists (even with health conditions) have a survival advantage by virtue of being born to highly invested parents.   
  
And how K-strategist species with young are generally highly protective and can become hostile if their young are threatened. 

And how, *being the sort of person who unnecessarily antagonizes any k-strategist organism in regards to the safety of its offspring*...is not indicative of a high level of evolutionary fitness nor of a sharp-witted understanding of biological principles. Actually.  

Day three... 

I prepared to go into the building. And continue the evolution unit.   


I decided to unwind a bit first, by scrolling Reddit. 

And now I couldn't pull myself together. Couldn't stop sobbing.   
  
It was a video I'd watched. Right there in my car. 

I think it was posted in r/India. Maybe r/hinduism.   
  
It was posted alongside a question about the Karmic result of animal cruelty. 

The thumbnail was an image of a man next to a stray dog. And the title said something along the lines of 

""She wanted to show me what humans had done to her babies.""  

I knew it was going to be something bad. But, I was hoping it was going to be a rescue video. Like, maybe humans had thrown her babies into a dumpster. And the man would be able to get them out. 

But it wasn't that.

The dog -- a street dog; a mother dog with full teats, approaches the man. She knew this man, I think. He's shown kindness to her and her puppies in the past.   
  
She's crying, the mother dog. So mournfully. Frantically. Imploringly. I've actually never heard a dog cry like that. It sounded so much like human sobbing. It wasn't a consistent, single-note whine that rose and fell gradually. 

It was wavering, staccato'd *sobs* rising and falling rapidly with desperate, pleading, excruciating urgency.  

I have never heard a dog cry that way. And it was an unmistakable kind of pain. It was the unmistakable, desperate, mourning plea for the life of her children. 

The man strokes her fur softly and tries, tries to speak comfortingly to her. 

She beckons her human friend to follow. And he does.

Her cries continue. The journey is infused with these tortured sobs. She seems to make gestures. To try to explain the situation. To plead. 

At one point, as she leads him along, I swear -- I swear to God. She glances under herself, gesturing towards her underbelly, where her pups' next meal awaits, 

Saying ""Please bring them back. You must bring them back. They'll be so hungry. They need to eat soon."" 

She leads him to her former whelping area. 

To a pile of ash and bone. 

That was once her puppies. 

Someone threw them into a fire. Made her hear their screams as they burned to death. 

She ran frantically between her puppies' remains and her human friend. 

""Please help them. Please bring them back. You humans are capable of so much that is so far beyond my comprehension. Perhaps even bringing my children back. Even from this. Humans do amazing and impossible things. If anyone can do it, it's you. Please. 

You must. 

They'll be hungry. 

They need their next meal soon. 

Please. 

Try."" 

He strokes her fur and speaks to her in hushed, patient, soothing tones. He tries so hard yet so futility to offer her comfort. 

The sobs. 

Dear god. I have never heard a dog cry like that. I have never heard it. I cannot stop hearing it. 

Humans are capable of so much that is beyond my comprehension.   "
246,"Hmmm forgot to write yesterday... So I had anxiety again this morning as my boss was facing problem about my previous customer. He had to clean my shit...

I think my stress tolerance is too low... How do I increase it man... For fuck sake...

Anyway I also just downloaded god of war and I wanted to play it but I was too tired the whole day and lazy to play le. So I ended up went to bed early. And I dreamt about freaking cruel and coward dream. I don't know why am I like in running man show as I was walking along with Kim Jong kok, and then we were given my food and Kjk was like why they give us food and I finally we know that we were walking above the crocodile farm. It was at night, and the place is very dark, my brother didn't believe it and he went down to a sharp cliff and ended up in front of the crocodiles. And he was bitten and struggled, while I was frightened watching it and couldn't do a thing. I was so scared that I can't even go down to help him because I know once I go down it was hard for me to come up again because it so deep and there were a few crocodiles there. And my heart was so painful seeing my brother was dying alone... And the people around me nobody help... I wanted to ask everyone to go down together but who dare to become the first person? Fuck!! It was a bad dream man. "

249,"okay, the title was a bit harsh, but recently ive noticed my friends dont seem to like me as much anymore. I mean its fine i dont really feel bad about it, im changing schools next year so it doesnt really matter. The only issue i see its causing is, im reverting back to my anti-social ways, which is not good, i mean i like my lifestyle ( if i could id never see anyone again) but unfortunatly im too young to be acting like this, teenage year is supposed to be the peak of ur life, so i need to make the best of it. Even though i have such a deep hatred with socializing, i feel like i just havent met the right people. Im abit of an oddball and living in France does not help my case, its like its impossible to meet anyone similar to me. Of course i understand i can still make friends even if they arent an identical copy of me, but geez ive been feeling so alone, not lonely but just alone. I mean honestly, i was really close with my current friends, ive known them for about 4 years now, but i feel like they've changed. It used to just be me and these 4 girls, and we kinda were always in our own world, but now its like they've tried to fit in with the others, which is fine! people change and its not like they have become terrible people or anything, i just feel like maybe i didnt follow the flow and know im lost adrift. I always strived to be unique but i rlly think i went too far, and now im like ...idk i feel weird. I dont understand most kids my age, not to sound like oh im mature and so much better than everyone, but, i just have a hard time connecting with these kids. I think the problem is that i can connect with my peers in terms of uhh i dont really know but i feel a conencion with them on some level, just, i think i dont understand the things they like and they dont understand the things i like, which i feel in fundamental in friendships (for me atleast) to get back on topic, my friends dont seem to talk to me as much or dont react much when i speak to them, one of my friends always tries to make me feel included,(which i greatly appreciate) she'll hold my hand if im straying away from the group abit when walking, or will join me if im sitting alone. Its really nice of her. Even so, im just so much happier when im home, or just outside of school in general, its not my friends thats the problem, its probably school. Because of a special english program im in, ive had the same 16 students in my class every year, so maybe its natural that we've grown apart since we've seen eachother everyday for years. sighhhhh moral of the story: school sucks but i have to deal with it."
250,"i moved.  
not far, but far enough that everything feels weird and a little quieter.

i was with someone for a long time.  
then suddenly i wasn’t.  
so i packed my stuff, found a new postcode, and decided to start a fresh journal too.

251,"2025 April 3: 93 Diary,

93 all. I do not consider myself a Thelemite, but I do love the number 93 and what it represents. Being the 93rd day of the year, I thought I would dedicate this entry to the wonderful number.  
  
The number 93 was used by Aleister Crowley in Greek gematria. Thelema (will) and Agape (love) both make up the number 93. It is a reminder that I need to be more loving and that I need to follow my will more. Shamefully, I have been very lazy for a while. Instead of writing masterpieces I have been watching YouTube videos and even Instagram reels.  
  
Giving up Instagram will be a challenge. I still want to post an occasional story to keep my friends updated, but I should not scroll anymore. YouTube can still be a little helpful, but I should use YouTube more mindfully. Cutting back on the amount of YouTube videos I watch is dire.   
  
Entertainment shall be found in writing and reading. I do want to create more than I consume, which is an area I fall short in at the moment. That changes now. Whenever I am not in the mood to read or write, I shall meditate rather than scroll. If I take away my brain’s power, where will that leave me? Humbly, I shall work on my creations. I should be outwardly humble, but inwardly proud. My power comes from within. 93 all.

- made a group chat with friends to share positive things 

Now how do i make this stay? Keep controlling i supposed? This is the most mental resilience i’ve had in a long time. Does it count if weed is helping me? If I stop, will I lose it all? Ohhhh. 
I will enjoy it while I have it and keep trying. "
253,"Today was a good day for my club activity. I belong to swimming club and until summer comes, we’ve been exercising by running and so on. Today was the last day of practices in spring vacation, so we went to the park which has many cheery blossoms as a part of running training. That was so fun!
Then since I came back home,I studied for hours.i think today was so fulfilling day!"
254,"It has been 7 years since we separated but her dreams still follow me every other night, we haven't spoken in years but the sense of love and belonging still persist in that dream, she came in a black dress just the way i used to love, last night she gave me a date for her marriage in my dream telling me won't be able to meet again. i didn't say a word but with a thousand words unsaid i gave her a thumbs up.

255,"2025 April 2: Dear Diary,

Old philosophical ideas are often revealing. Yin-Yang, as the concept of good within evil and evil within good is something I have thought about for years. Often, people around you will tell you what is good or evil. This is because people are generally not responsible enough to determine right or wrong for themselves. Human beings by their nature are irresponsible and seek simplicity.  
  
How often is it said to avoid anything that can bring one to evil at all costs? Have you been told to avoid the internet because it can lead you down a rabbit hole where you will be exposed to degeneracy? How many flat-earthers became that way by watching a YouTube video where a con-artist manipulated their thoughts? How many people have gotten addicted to watching mindless content rather than engaging with art? Does the fault lie in human beings themselves or with the people who exploit the natural laziness and stupidity of humanity?  
  
I say the answer is somewhere in the middle. A responsible person can engage with terrible videos and reflect upon them. They would not start to believe the earth is flat because a YouTube video told them it was. They would reflect upon the video and be grateful they were not stupid enough to believe it.  
  
However, there is a fault with a person trying to manipulate others into believing the earth is flat. Whether good-intentioned or not, there is no other word than evil to describe them. Responsible people who watch these videos and reflect upon themselves are good within the evil.  
  
Take the opposite into account. Does watching a video explaining scientific facts make one immune to propaganda? By no means. An irresponsible person can watch a video detailing facts about evolution and come out thinking it explains creationism. Although the video was good by its nature, the evil was the irresponsibility of the person watching it.  
  
I do not know if I am responsible or not. Sometimes I definitely am, and other times I am not. Certainly it is humbling to be reminded of my humanity. As much as I would like to detach myself from humanity entirely, I know that is impossible. Maybe I am too much on my high horse. Keeping balance may be what I need to counteract that. I would prefer to be a force of good for the world, but that might not be possible. Sometimes I will bring good and other times I will bring evil. My intentions are always good, and that is what I need to remind myself. If evil comes from my actions, it is best not to condemn myself, but rectify my mistakes. I must never become what I would like to destroy.  
  
Sincerely,

It’s very dewy outside today. Rain drops fell silently but still heavy in the wish and wash of every window. I cover my head as I run and of course the action lacks any delight. It seems that this weather also means that I have lost some shine in myself. Tears drop such as rain drops fall. 

I was reminded of my age at some point today because I remember carrying on more adolescently afterward. I’ve finished Brain Damage by Freida McFadden and I’ve had to admit that she’s like moss in a wet area that you just can’t scrape. She’s growing on me.

I read the book in my school library, even took a picture of it sitting on the coffee table surrounded by empty chairs. I remember grasping the humor of me sitting next to dictionaries made 100 years ago and I was here—there— reading a modern story. 

The sunlight shone loudly somewhere near 12 and it was then that I realized I could never escape the crippling realization of my character. Whatever and wherever that is. It seems that when I forget is when I’m reminded. 

At 1:38 I saw a beautiful woman and I wondered if I could brush her hair. If I could act as loving mother and tell her that she was my everything. Perhaps, I could be a decent mother. Maybe. 

It is now: 10:53. A melancholic odor fills the room and hasty silences run around and through as tv screens shut. Goodnight."
257,"i had to go get recertified for my CPR today and got a ride with my friend from class.  i LOVE this little guy.  it's a friend thing, he's married and i'm not really attracted to him which is great because he's probably my best friend and i need a best friend more than a boyfriend.  lately, he feels comfortable enough to take his pills in front of me and i love it.  we've been friends in this course since day one.  school's almost done and we need to stay friends.  he invited me to have dinner with his wife and family and we're for sure going to make it happen.  we had a great chat on the drive and met up with another student once we got to the CPR class.  it was actually sort of a fun day.

lately, not sure why, but guys have been looking at me with interest.  it's new because i'm pretty overweight and don't usually get much attention.  i think it might have something to do with the fact i've just recently fallen in love and carry that around with me everywhere and it draws people in.  it also makes me, like, a little horned up and i think guys pick up on that too.  i can tell a guy is into me when he sits facing me (they do it subconsciously) and, like, all three guys in our CPR class were facing right at me most of the time.

when i was pretending to be the casualty, my friend from my course had to sort of pat me down and pretend to look for blood.  he wasn't going to touch me but i said he could.  he didn't touch me anywhere inappropriate, i just sort of wanted to be touched.  i think it also may have diffused a bit of sexual tension between us."
258,"In Japan, new school year starts from April. This April,I got to be third grade of high school. This is the last grade of high school and I have to take examinations for entrance of university. So, in this April, my new life as an exam students was started.

But,I couldn’t study the way I wanted. This is really serious problem. In my head, guilt is still there all the day!i know I have to study, but I couldn’t. I’ve been thinking “from today, I’ll study harder!” Every day. Today is the same.i feel I’m in short of a sense of crisis.

Wow life you really done a number on me.

I’ve got friends and family and yet I feel so alone and unseen, what do you want from me?

Am I not happy enough?

Am I not chatty enough?

Or do I need to be more messed up than I already am?

How much longer must I have to fight for you to say “ok dear, I’ve put you through enough, I’ll stop now”.

FFS how much longer must I be a joke to people for me to be finally taken seriously?

Will I always be a furniture in people’s lives, move me about to fit in their lives as opposed to being a part of it.

Will you give me an answer, or will you not take notice like everyone else?"
260,"My ex sent a long good bye message to me. I cried again after reading her message. I couldn't control myself so I replied a longer message back to her with good bye as well hoping she will do well in the future. I never really thought I would lost her in my life. Now that I imagine not having her by myself in future, I just took sad and cannot hold my tears. After replying the message I 4am only can sleep and I woke up at 9am... I don't have work but I unable to sleep back because there is renovations noise nearby... 

As usual, I started looking for more jobs while watching the drama. For lunch, I cooked the Maggi my ex bought from Thailand, her first country to visit with family. Her first overseas country was with me coming to sg... Anyway, after I had the lunch, there were 2 people came to see the room. I had a good chat with the first person, he is a product engineer and guess what he tried to find the job for a year and had submit over a few hundred company then only found this job. Omg it was so hard finding job man. The 2nd person is a fresh graduate. He is a fresh graduate and I think the rental is a little bit over budget for him. 

Later, my friend from form 6 who was working in Singapore for a long time treated me to Korean BBQ, we were just catching up with life and stuff. And he brought me to library hahaha he said that every time when he feels anxious, he would go to the library to get the peace because it is very quiet and calming. I think every person needs a healing moment to walk further. 

Lastly, I saw an IG story, ""Someone once asked me, ""what's worse?"" Loving someone you can't have? Or having someone you can't love?"" I replied: leaving someone you can never unlove.."" omg it hurts me so hard. "

263,"Dear Diary,

My soul is constantly feeling the lows and highs of his existence. Is he hurting like I am, trying to pretend he's okay, crying when the thoughts of us come into his mind. Remaining dedicated but also dying a little from the distance. Does he feel me when I cry, does he feel like running back and crying from knowing he can't. I feel you, I feel you. Every random ache I know it's you in that moment. We are connected and there is no way to break what has been awoken, I am yours and you are mine. 

I can feel your loneliness, I can feel your devotion to fight what you feel, I can see your struggles. It hurts so much. Should I leave permanently, will this resolve your aching heart. Is my love a burden to you. I know you'll never hear my words but if me existing is to much for you to not stay away. I will leave I will disappear permanently and you will never see me, know me, or hear from me again. You will be permanently free of me, my memory will fade and the ache will disappear. I love you and you want to lock how you love me too because you know it's crazy this crazy love we have. But it's real I love you, and if I have to leave forever to no longer exist. I will give you that. I will hold your cheeks tenderly, I will kiss your lips softly, I will kiss your forehead one last time, and whisper in your ear.

Goodbye.

266,"2025 April 1: Dear Diary,

If I fool myself I will surely regret it. Sylvia Plath’s metaphor of the fig tree came into my mind today. It was very easy to put myself in her shoes. Options are all around me, I know I can only choose one, but I often fool myself that I can take them all.  
  
Maybe two figs can be picked if I am lucky enough, but certainly not all of them. Most pick one which is the safe option. People like Sylvia Plath choose none, because all of the options looked so appealing. Her metaphor is one of the most true reflections on life I have come across.  
  
Certainly I do not want to end up the same way. Picking at least one fig will be better than having them all wither and die in front of my face. Maybe another fig will still be there to pick after I have eaten one, but maybe I am fooling myself. They only way to find out is to live my life and not worry about the other options.

The stress just came to me like hell man why would I suddenly feel stressed up... I really think I have anxiety. I felt nauseous again thinking what would happen and how do I solve it if got things happened. 

Then, after had my lunch, I prepared to go to site. Indeed, as I reaching the site, I got a call, asking for a solution... However, I don't know why, or maybe because I'm not involved in client facing, I was ok to face it because I just asked my boss how to do about it and how can we do about it. In the end, everything solved. 

After reaching home, I scrolled through my IG story I found out that my friend just got pregnant... I didn't know I should congratulate him or what because I think I kind of know that he isn't preparing for it yet. Then, I just pm him wow, you become daddy le. And guess what???!!! His gf suddenly posted another story saying is an April fool... 给她炸到。。。 If I were him, I think I will get angry tho... I don't know how to react if suddenly become a daddy.

It brings its own grief, this stage. I can't say I love it.

Maybe better than the sorrow and the longing.

But this nothingness, this lack of feeling, it seems to be making room for new experiences. I find myself excited about meeting new people. I find myself actively planning my future and you are not a feature.

At work today I felt completely dissociated. I felt as though I was viewing my point of view through a camera. Not knowing what action I would take next was a little frightening at first, but I just accepted it. The only thing I felt I could do was acknowledge my thoughts and wait for them to manifest.  
  
This feeling did not last long, but did come in bursts. It makes me wonder how much free will humans have, if we have any at all. Like most things, I think there may be a balance. I want to work to further balance most things in my life. Balance is a big part of alchemy, so I want to become good at it.

272,"Dear Diary,

Everything I do reminds me of Penn, everytime I feel excitement or joy it reminds me of Penn, everytime I see snow, bake, or cook I remember Penn, it's constant in everything I do he is there. 

How is it possible that I can't let him go. I know I love him but why are things like this? Why can't the moment he asks me to let him go be the moment I do truly soulfully let go. Is it maybe because he truly hasn't let go, perhaps this end was not supposed to happen and now it's hurting both of us being apart then it was being together. 

He's a constant in my mind that I try to push away because it only makes me want to hear from him more and not being able to say Hiiii, How are you?, What are you baking tonight?, How's work? It is torture, it is mundane. Even if it was boring, exciting, awkward no matter the feeling it was always worth it, it was always beautiful, and it felt like heaven in my heart. 

Missing him is not out of capricho, I truly feel like someone convinced the man I love that we couldn't power through things, communicate better, learn and grow together. Convinced him that we couldn't be upset but in love, be sad but deeply connected, be something that heals us even in pause and time where there is silence. I was never going to allow him to hinder his life, I know all to well the consequences, cruelty, and selfishness it would be to actually ask of him to only choose me, to hinder and break apart his life just for me to stand as his one and only. 

I wanted to dream, fantasize of a different life, pretend and call each other Mr. and Mrs. without ever furthering that dream as I know it's not what we both wanted nor something I would ever selfishly ask to truly create. I just wanted us to dream and fulfill them naturally without truly taking it further then what we both can respectfully allow. 

Chulo you are my spiritual bond my everyday and night, you are my soulmate. I rather be in pain with you in my life than without you.

I love him so much. 

Goodnight Chulo *Kiss on the forehead* 
I'll be dreaming of you. ❤️🥀

273,"*Cough cough. I am in great pain. Please help me.*  

  
I am indeed in very deep pain. And that is why I must numb myself. If you truly don't care why pay such close attention with scorn from afar? "
274,"Ah well. 

I can't write about it anywhere, can I. 

What can I possibly say? I mustn't name it specifically. Mustn't place blame. 

It's a sense of *dread*.   
  
THAT'S what the sickly pervasive sepia-golden haze is. 

The golden feeling. 

*Not* ""golden"" with the collective-consciousness's positive connotation. Golden the way *I* subjectively feel it.

It's dread.  

At least I've identified the substance of it. 

And I've found the source. I see where it's been leaking from.  

I see I have all these quick repairs to stem the leak baked in to my daily routine. 

No wonder I am exhausted. 

I didn't have an ounce of fun. 

I was afraid to stay at the cookout for too long. "
275,"I was about to ask if “written vlogs were a thing,” and thankfully made the short mental trek to realizing that vlogs are video logs. So here is my log, in its original written form: a journal entry. 

I woke up, I didn’t brush my teeth, I didn’t do my hair. I did sit on TikTok watching a girl eat steaks for half an hour and certainly made enough time to reprimand my husband for not paying attention to me and not replying to his friend’s texts. Finally, I got out of bed to the smell of freshly made coffee and waffles (calling myself lucky to have this be a part of my wake-up routine, and by the way, he is an angel - the kind of human anyone should aspire to be - and aren’t I talented for being able to short even his cherubic comings). I also made enough time to consider my place in the world, my faults, my stressors. I considered my to-do list for the week, not long enough not to start on any of it, reopening social media as the perfect excuse for my paralysis. 

Circling back to the lessons I teach versus the lessons I learned today, perhaps I am to blame. I hadn’t thought about it until recently, but maybe the reason people don’t make a big deal about my goings-on is that I don’t make a big deal about them either. I have such a difficult time talking about myself, which might be why I’m scared to write, too. And as someone who also only recently discovered that I, an aquarius, am not in touch with my emotions (an astrological shock to the rather sensitive, self-proclaimed empath - that’s important because not all self-proclaimed empaths are actually empathetic), I wonder if it’s not just me ceaselessly caring too much about how I’ll make others feel. I’d like to think it was because I didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings, but isn’t that another way of saying that I’m nervous about how I’ll be perceived; what others will think? And it’s kind of exhausting, makes-me-feel-stupid annoying that these lofty questions I ask myself, these ambiguities I’m trying to logic, these moments turned arguments with my husband, all actually stem from the same place of wanting to fit in. I hate that! Because don’t I know I am unique? Don’t I know I am a rebel at heart? Why can’t I act like one?"
276,"Today, I think I just done something terrible. Once again, I have disappointed my ex. Ok the context is, when I came to Singapore and work, my ex aunt offered help to let me stay at her house with my ex. Then she treated us to dinner, she brought me to mrt, she took good care of me. I am very grateful, so I always wanted to treat her dinner. But now, I broke up with ex, and I wanted to thank her aunt since I'm going back to Malaysia. So, I actually was in dilemma whether to tell the aunt and treat her. And I decided to just tell her, the first thing she asked was whether I'm still together with my ex. Then I just told her honestly thinking that my ex has told them about our relationship. But in the end, she didn't know about this... And so I'm in deep shit. My ex texted me and scolded me for exposing our relationship to her relatives. Ok I'm at wrong here. I thought they already know but no... Yes the status should come from her and not from me. So, we had arguments and finally I exploded because my ex keep blaming herself. I am trying to calm her down by explaining my point of view and hopefully she could understand and calm down. Of course she has her hardship, which makes things harder for her. But it's really hurt seeing her lives her life so hard and still keep blaming herself. I just want her to move on, to live a better life without me. I want her to be happy that's all. I really wish that she can meet the one that truly understands and able to provide happiness to her. Please 🥺. 

Anyway, I just started another Chinese drama 五福临门. Is a traditional drama which I think ok la, still can watch. But I always still see myself with my ex in the scene. Looks like it's really hard for me to move. Anyway we decided to just be friend and let me slowly forget about her. Hopefully she can do really well without me. "
277,"Dear Dairy,

I have this amazing guy friend I've known for years, since I was 17 and he has always been there for me and has had my back since day one. He's met a girl and I'm crossing my fingers things work out between them!!! He truly needs someone who loves him and see's him for the great guy he is. 

I told him about Penn, he was adamant that I wait before trying to move on as he knows this pain all to familiarly. He tried to comprehend my husband but didn't understand how he could throw me away when what he is seeking every woman has. Idk but I'm continually reminded I'm nothing being with my husband separated or not. 

I set up a getaway with him and his friends he got to reconnect with them and we all had a blast laughing and just existing. He acted like we weren't separated, guess he pretended he cared for his friends to believe. He smacked my butt, complimented me did all the things a woman would want but then once the trip was over he went back to reserved and acted like none of that happened. 

I feel empty, feel disgusting, and worthless. I guess my light is starting to dim again. I was happy for a moment with Penn he made my life worth living. Now I feel the draft of loneliness, the draft of being stuck in a hard place not being able to move just try to keep existing. I've thought about death recently again, how peaceful it would be to no longer have all these feelings, I'm staying strong I just like to think that one day God will take me home once everyone has grown and I have time to refocus my energies. 

I feel like I'm holding on to a thread trying to remember Penn trying to hold the memories that kept me from drowning in darkness. I'm trying, I'm trying. I'd travel to him just to have coffee ☕. I miss him so much he doesn't know how much I've needed and wanted him.

279,"Dear Diary,

My deck is filled with the same cards that guided me but one card doesn't seem to fill my path. The white blank card of choice to have love come back or stay. I don't have a choice nor have I ever been chosen. I know the dream, the ideal of being something more than somebody, someone wants to stay for. To be worth it, to matter, to be cared for. 

That's not in my cards, what's in my cards is stay patient, get some hobbies while you wait, one day someone will grow and want you to exist. Thanks as it seems all I can ever do is wait for a dream that never comes. I want it but I know that no one has ever given me the beauty of being chosen and they actually stay or come back. 

I wish I knew what it was about me that makes others see me as disposable and doormat material. It hurts I wish this would stop I wish the sad songs in my library would be filled with joy and longing instead of the reflection of my truth. 

I'm not good enough. I'm not worth the risk. I'm not worth fighting for. I'm not worth loving. I'm not worth chasing, not worth making love to, not worth considering, just worth running from.

The night before, the ending was meh. Went to be an hour later than I wanted for no beneficial reason. That was the beginning.

Woke early, same time, this morning like the last few days but this super tired bcz of that missing hour.  Felt sleepy, didn’t really want to do much and didn’t do much except what I shouldn’t have been doing. Napped for a lengthy period which may be good for sleep health but should have just worked on what I needed to then go to be 2 hrs earlier.

Oof. 

The tracking of these days was wake early, sleep early. I’ve now been closer to that than ever especially in the last 10 days. Will carry that on. 

But for April, should I start a new counter for the same? A new counter for just being productive? Of continue from 33 on April 1. Or continue from 13? Mmh…

Perhaps a new counter tomorrow at 0 with April 1st being 1. This time, no stopping the journal bcz a feeling of not needing it. Just jot down something small for each day. No wallowing and no crumbs. Easier said than done, I know. 

Movie studios announce projects and cancel all the time. I find that stupid but perhaps it’s not. 

Tomorrow, I will get 2 done no matter what. 
April 1st, will be another 2. At least 1 on the 2nd.

Immortality has been a topic my brain keeps focusing on recently. Specifically quantum immortality, but to a lesser extent the afterlife. Maybe it is my brain’s way of coping with the inevitable, but I would actually prefer it if there was no afterlife.  
  
To me the most ridiculous theory is an eternal heaven and hell. That seems way too childish to be a genuine possibility. If there were heaven and hell realms, they probably would not be eternal, but last just long enough to pay off karmic debt. The possibility of reincarnation is likely to me. It would explain why “old souls” are the way they are. Maybe this too is just the mind coping.  
  
More modern interpretations of the afterlife exist. Quantum immortality is one I used to find completely ridiculous, but now see its possibility. Maybe when I die in one universe, my soul transfers to a universe where I survive. Maybe when I die I have to reset my life over from day one. If this were the case would I be able to make changes to my life when I live it again or would I be doomed to repeat the same mistakes? This seems unlikely, but still terrifyingly possible.  
  
To me the most likely explanation of the afterlife is there is none. Death is just like going to sleep and not remembering your dream only it lasts forever. This does not contradict reincarnation. Buddhists believe in the concept of Moksha, or the end of the cycle of reincarnation. So it could be possible to reincarnate until your lesson is learned.

 One more possibility just entered my mind though. It is a possibility I have never heard anyone discuss before, but I am sure someone has thought of it before. What if we are all one consciousness and we have to live through every perspective that has ever and will ever exist? It would be random which perspective our soul would be placed in. We would have to live through an entire lifetime of a living being and experience everything they do. This really makes me think a lot about empathy and extending it to even those who deserve it least. This concept for an afterlife probably will not happen. I do believe we are one consciousness, but have to learn lessons in different ways. Extending empathy probably will be the only way we can experience just a sliver of perspective. Although I do not think this afterlife exists, the possibility of it persists.

282,"Ok... Once again this time we really break up for real... I had a bad closure. But it is confirm a closure. To be honest, I don't know how we can get back. She was really hurt by me, maybe she sacrificed a lot for me for example her virgin... I'm a intimacy person but she isn't. But she sacrificed for me. I must say, we really not suitable for each other? Urggghhhh idk where to start and so tired to write this... I'm not sure if there is someone else there, that sex is really important in the relationship. 我是真的很舍不得失去她。she is a nice girl. Like seriously the nicest girl out there. In my next life, I wish I could meet you and treat you better and hopefully we are compatible in every way. 我超级爱你！！爱biiii. ❤️ "

But I literally bought the packet of strawberries yesterday and I don’t usually get it because it is kind of expensive. I wake up today only to find out that this person has finished the WHOLE packet.

284,"Dear Dairy, 

I'm holding in my tears but I'm sure it's obvious that I'm flushed with pain and sadness. An inner rejection I can't ignore. I'm standing next to my husband only reminded of how alone I am. As I watch him never give me real attention just keeping me in line so he can stare off to the next thing he wants to fuck, not me that's for sure. 

I'm trying to hold myself together but find it to be difficult. I popped on the music you gave me, you've become an echo of light and peace for me. I feel safe where you are. 

Have you ever been with someone you love only for them to want to fuck everything but you. It's not like when your with someone and they want to fuck you give you attention love you like your that sweet center girl they want to stay beside them, wanting them, so they make her feel wanted even if they notice other beautiful girls. It's more like they notice other women and to make you not feel bad they pretend they like you you know like being constantly friendzoned. It doesn't make you feel desired or like you even exist, your the walking toy he fucks when he can't take not fucking something physical. You're disposable. 

I don't want other men I just want one guy I feel safe comfortable good with to show me I'm loved and beautiful and I can be in love with them and they will stay even if they're not thier yet and if things have to change it changes after meeting each others needs and affection long term over it being extremely short lived. I want a love I can never forget and get me through the hardest days. You were that for me and I wish I was that for you. That's why I met you so that we could give each other what we could carry weight in for when it was time to go, you did make me happy and alive. I feel like it's unfinished business, I'm gonna hold my tears and listen to your music to remind me to be stronger. Thanks for giving me a rope to hold onto.

285,"2025 March 29: Dear Diary,

I was brought out to the living room to watch the kittens. My head-space was not in the best mood. Previously I had been thinking of all the evils in humanity. Trying to think if there was anything good about this contemptible species, I found four things. Art, deep thoughts, love, and having fun. Having fun and love are not exclusive to humans, but we as a species have found great ways to express these natural states.  
  
Art and deep thoughts are exclusive to humans. It is strange how a strand of parasitical pests could come up with magnificent concepts such as these. Sadly humanity seems to love greed a lot more than these four beautiful things. Humans tend to want to destroy what makes them beautiful. Not all of course, but most. To me, a civilized society would trade art and perspective instead of something useless like money. As cliché as it is to say, all money is just worthless pieces of paper and metal. Sometimes it is literally just imaginary numbers on a computer screen.  
  
Despite this, people die over these stupid numbers. We give them undeserved value and treat people as lesser for not having a lower number on their computer screen. People starve on the streets with their children and die because the number in their bank account was lower than some greedy fuck who contributed nothing but having a big number. The people dying on the streets addicted to heroin are infinitely more valuable than bastards like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos.   
  
The four good traits of humanity I listed are things that should really be what society considers valuable. Until then, we are no less savage than wild beasts who devour their young the second they come out of the womb. As I was thinking about this my emotions grew darker. Are good people really so hard to find? As I thought about this I stared at a plush toy my mom gave to the kittens.  
  
The plush toy is of a duck wearing bunny ears. As I stared at it my mind played a trick on me. It began to shake its head slightly, something that would have been impossible for it to do. Keep in mind, I am sober as this is happening, with the exception of some caffeine if you do not count that as sober. I could feel this duck whisper to me.  
  
“Did you forget about the mental transmutation?” it whispered.  
  
The duck was right. I had been feeling a lot better when I began to transmute my thoughts. Instead of despising humanity I could transmute my perception of the species. Instead of believing the entire human race is on the path to greed, I can transmute my thoughts to thinking they are on the path to their good qualities, This perhaps may be the case anyway. Despising human beings does no good, but believing the species can bring good can go a long way.

286,"Endless medical examinations.

I was admitted for a gastroscope and a colonscope. Then as i drank the poop inducing medication, i was pooping blood again. As a result another c t scan was done, and blood tests were done.

Anyway and luckily nothing was found in those tests, doctor recommended an pill camera to also check the small intestine, and i agreed.

I was made to walk around so that the camera pill would fall into the small intestine faster.

Maybe i didnt sleep enough (it felt like only 2 hrs) last night, therefore i totally flipped and felt helpless when the nurse said maybe a gastroscopy was needed to push the camera pill down.

I slept. When i woke 4 hrs later the doctor said the camera pill was maybe in the large intestine already, so ok.

But i was fed up. I told the doctor i just wanted to leave. But the doctor said there was still some battery left in the camera pill, hence i'm staying until tomorrow morning.

And i promised myself, just leave. No more medical examinations. The bloodly poop stopped. As long as the doctor ruled out something serious, it's ok, i can accept it, everyone dies, i've had enough.

Ok whatever."
287,"I just finished an ongoing drama which is called ""when life gives you a tangerine"" I must say it's a ""life"" drama as in it is really about 人生的 drama. The last ep got me bawling...

One of the words that I remember is "" why gives up half way when you least unexpected to have amazing life even when you are 70s"". 

So I had an usual morning, I went to the bugis to pray at the most popular temple in Singapore before going back to Malaysia. Then I also bought the famous Mr coconut shake. Later, I went to visit my aunt also. She cooked salmon with butter, tofu, vegetable and ABC soup. It was so long that I have a full stomach haha. 

Anyway, I am very emotional today as I saw my ex story that she went watching cinema with her friend idk which one but most probably the one who chased her. And all of the sudden I feel like giving up I just want her to be happy. So I also prepared to let her go like finally. On my way to bugis, I listened to many sad songs trying to cure my heartache. I found the music really comforting and I feel like I can give her up already. Hopefully I could get a good closure tomorrow with her. "
288,"Dear diary,

So very dear, my diary.

I was so sleepy all day yesterday. Slept extremely fitfully the night before. But ultimately it was a pretty good day. Work was closed for the day, but I still woke up early anyways to take my son to before-school care.

The morning feeling. I LOVE the morning feeling. The way the air is! You know?

When it's still dark out. ESPECIALLY when the moon is out. And then just gradually, gradually the world starts taking on light. And it is best at times when it's not raining but has been or is going to rain. And the cloud cover acts like the lid of a pot, that locks in the morning feeling for a while longer.

Some kid at my son's morning care said the school was going on a field trip today. So I rushed to his school to go fill out the paperwork so he could go. But that kid was wrong about the field trip.

My son's morning care group arrived in the office while I was talking to the principal. I acted surprised to see him, and we played around a bit and I gave him a big hug. It was a fun way for him to kick off the school day.

I went to Wal-Mart to shop for new work pants. I was caught up in the school drop-off line for a while -- the only means of egress. And I stopped for a cup of coffee on the way. So, the morning feeling had faded by the time I got there.

I do not like shopping for clothes. Overwhelming. Bought three pairs of pants for me. Four clothing items for little buddy.

Then I went to work. My GPS took me on a different route which was kind of confusing and surreal. I almost wondered if I'd put in the wrong destination at first, but somehow the route did ultimately spit me out next to my work building.

It took me through the part of town where a lot of the signage is in both or either of two specific East Asian languages.

I saw that an office building that I'd seen in passing a few times over the years, had been destroyed. Apparently by a recent fire. Depressing. I hope insurance covers it and people won't go without their jobs.

I needed more coffee again by the time I reached work, so I went to the drive through of the cafe near my work building.

The barista wrote ""Hang in there, buddy! = ) "" on my cup. Which is objectively hilarious. I guess I was looking melancholic.

Once I got to work, I took the elevator on up to my floor which was entirely unoccupied except for me, today.

An empty floor of an office building has such haunting beauty. As though you can still see the ghosts of everyone who usually occupies it, without intruding upon or interfering with them.

At lunch time I ordered DoorDash. The security guard told the dasher that she was pretty sure that that no one was working on that floor today. But he insisted that he was supposed to bring the food all the way up to the room number listed on the instructions.

However, it seems, when he reached my floor, he got spooked by the empty darkness of the lobby, dropped the food and turned tail.

I don't blame him -- good instincts because surely, that whole situation has all the earmarks of a trap.

But I found my food where he left it and it was good. Well. I didn't find it until a while after he'd dropped it off. So, the dessert had gotten a bit warm and lost some of it's charm.

But the sandwich was heavenly.

My productivity was low, but I did manage to get some grading done. Organized some stacks of assignments. Drank several cups of coffee. Haunted the liminal darkness in various parts of the school.

In the afternoon I left for my doctor's appointment -- a follow up for this acute bronchitis with which I'm still afflicted.

I was seeing my regular doctor but at a different location that I'd never visited before.

Lo and behold, it turned out to be in the very same part of town, with the high East Asian population, as my GPS had unexpectedly taken me through earlier.

Interesting, because I rarely find myself in that part of town.

The building where the medical practice was had a similar sort of charm to my own work building. Aesthetically appealing dark green marble-esque tiles with gold accents gave the building a memorable distinctiveness.

The elevator had neither windows nor mirrors. Until one looked up. The polished black obsidian ceiling gave the effect of a mirror, darkly.

You had to turn your neck almost ninety degrees to see it, though. But the echo of every element of myself and every element within the elevator, cast in deeper hues, gave an invigorated feeling. Similar to the morning feeling.

When I awaited my doctor, I became gripped with some sort of terrible apprehension. As though I might scream. My heart beat against the inside of my chest as though trying to beat down a door. I felt as though, I had some very important problem I needed to ask the good doctor's help with when she arrived to the exam room.

But I could not remember what it was.

And the feeling abated eventually.

My drowsiness actually started to fade last night, around eleven p.m. ...Much too late. But I did use it to work on a bit of laundry and tidying up.

There is a short story I'm thinking of working on. If I manage to find the time."
289,"We had to make projects, and for that, every group had to record a video. Yesterday, the teacher put everyone's videos at class. Mine was the second one, i wasn't the only one who spoke, ofc, other girls in my project also did, i already knew my voice was bad but i didn't know it was *that* pathetic. Why can't i have a normal voice ???"
290,"I was researching the craziest of topics for my outlet.

Memetic synchronicities, a double edged sword. I get why MKUltra kept the research behind layers and layers of subtefuge.

Cause crazy people will either develope real changes in their life, including what others would deem psuedoscience, or theyll lose their minds.

Im at that inbetween place now. I know things that could change how people and tech function.

Like did you know, instead of using blue light for our screen, if you swapped it to yellow, it would do wonderous things for your eyes and mind?

But even knowing that doesnt change the fact im poor, jus above homeless, and working a job no one needs. Except me and my family needs it.

Whats the point of having so much unknown answers if no one needs or cares to know?

Atleast im satiated, i dont want to learn more at this point. Its just practice or finding more quick brainhacks for what other spiritualist take years to do.

I was warned though, somone months ago warned me that going down this path without the means to support it would put me right where i am.

I dont want to die, thats not what this is. Its just putting words to a digital page so i dont have to speak them outloud.

Though then im reminded how the druids stated not to write it down. Memetically itll live in someone elses mind then.

I guess the moral of it all. Keep going, even if sychronicities make it seem like fear and faultering long after youve let go at the end of the rope."
291,"i’m so tired of being in a suffocating environment. 
i’m tired of learning about how messed up i am. all the issues i had as a little girl still haunt me in painful ways. i wish certain things wouldn’t make me sad but this too shall pass. why do people bread crumb, disengage and change their energy, keep walls up or just simply use you? 
im tired of feeling needy of love and understanding. i just want to just be loved, understood and and appreciated. not have people suck my blood like a leech. 
i feel unloved and unwanted. i feel like no matter what i do, i don’t get the love i want or feel i deserve. 
all i can do is numb the pain. i tried to stop weed but it’s genuinely my medicine. my brain doesn’t complicate things as much when im high and it’s just blissful. especially right now, when i have a war in my mind. i’m just going to numb until i don’t and can’t feel pain anymore. i just want to feel happy. "
292,"people can quickly become excited about you, because something about you sparks something within them that they’ve been seeking. we should never build any relationship on this premise. because they will never value you. they will chase only the way you made them feel. i feel like ive watched this happen over and over again as people weave in and out of my life.

eventually, the novelty wears off and it doesn’t feel as good anymore. after all, things are much less interesting when they don’t sparkle. or it just becomes hard to keep up the charade of making another person feel good all the time.

293,"Well, I forgot to write diary again yesterday.... Is ok I writing now in the morning.

Thought of the day
While I was showering, I suddenly had a random thought, why does ppl always think, when 出轨, is always man and 只要你有钱，女人就会跟你. You see the difference? In my opinion, of course not everyone but in general, male tends to like new faces maybe because of the hormone, that makes the man has a needs, and male always have this love at first sight, and once the male has gained the needs it kind of boost the confidence? As for female, tends to love money, because seeking for 安全感 is important? They don't tend to love at first sight, they can 日久生情. 

Anyway, I woke up quite early and went to handover one of my project back to owner. I was anxious that he would scold about what happened the night before and luckily maybe is because next day he was happy and never scold. We had a deep chat and since he is almost 70, he shared a lot about the life. One of thing he said that makes me teary is that  standard 的人生是从 A 到 B（about 80 years old)，你才过不到一半，不要放弃，就算失败那就从来。因为你还有一大半的人生还要过。And he said 磁场很重要, 就是你的磁场能改变你的命跟运。磁场很重要。

295,"2025 March 28: Dear Diary,

I am becoming very interested in mental transmutation. The act of turning a negative thought into a positive one sounds so liberating. Having negativity weigh on me and eat away at my soul has been horrible. Knowing these thoughts may not be able to disappear, the only thing I can do is change them.

Judging thoughts as purely good or bad is probably what I am doing wrong. Just taking the vibrations into account may be something helpful to do. Perhaps I should study Hermeticism a little bit more.

I have become very much drawn to the symbol of the philosopher’s stone. If I ever get a tattoo, I think I would like this symbol directly over my heart. Maybe, I would get the symbol of the triple goddess right next to it and either the number 93 or an ouroboros underneath. However, I am not sure if I would get tattoos as my pain tolerance is quite low. It is worth considering, I reckon.

Sincerely,

296,"9:40am

Haven’t had much desire to write here because there has been positive happenings but I suppose I should document those too.

The last 9 days, including today, I’ve awoken with or before the sunrise which is sweet. No longer, so far, snoozing alarm and going back to sleep. No need, because going to bed just a smidge earlier and fighting well thus far the compulsion to carry on being awake late at night.

Glorious. 

Summer fast approaches, and the day will be longer than the night, but my oh my have the days felt much longer the past nine. I can’t say for sure that I’ve gotten much more done, but it does feel as though I’ve been given an extra hour or two do stuff. Less rushing in the morning and feeling excited to start each day. 

I’ve heard it said it takes 30 days to form a habit. Don’t know how valid that is but certainly looking to turn 9 days into 90 then 900 and beyond. But one step at a time. Day by day I go. Baby steps. Small step principle.

Good.

299,"2025 March 27: Dear Diary,

I did not plan to buy anything as I walked through the bookstore. Somehow I landed in the philosophy section. Obviously my eye was drawn to Nietzsche. A combination of The Twilight of the Idols and The Anti-Christ piqued my curiosity. I had never read either of these works and thought they would be worth looking into.  
  
The next book that I was drawn to was Das Capital by Karl Marx. It is far too long for me to read, but maybe I will someday. I did not buy it, but I thought of what the cashier would think if I brought Nietzsche and Marx to the counter. Would the cashier be aware these are two philosophers of liberation purposely misinterpreted by authoritarian countries? Probably not. I am far too surprised that Marx and Nietzsche are put against each other as polar opposites. “Money degrades all the gods of men and turns them into commodities” sounds a whole lot like it could be said by the same person who said “God is dead and we killed him.” I understand a lot of their works differ, but there are similarities there .  
  
Knowing I will not be reading Marx anytime soon, I instead got The Republic by Plato. This led to another question. The question only came after I had paid and was not one I took too seriously, but is worth noting. Would I look like the biggest narcissist ever bringing these two books to the register? Nietzsche is known for the übermensch, someone who sees the ills of society and creates their own laws. Plato’s Republic is a book which states society should be run by “philosopher kings” which is an ancient way of saying smart people should rule. The Republic also holds the allegory of the cave, where one person sees the truth of society and desires to break free of it.  
  
These two are known for thinking pretty highly of themselves. Perhaps, I too think highly of myself. I know I would never rule in a society where only the smartest rule, but I still think that would make for a great society. I think the United States would be a much better country if only the smartest were in charge instead of the dumbarses which encompass the entirety of both parties. I also believe I do not conform to society, in fact it is nearly impossible for me to relate to most people. Genuinely, I want nothing more than to do what I can to make society less cruel. I know there is not much I can do, but hopefully my writing can be found relatable to someone. Anyone.  
  
Maybe I am a narcissist. Although, I do doubt it. I care about my friends a lot and want the best for them. I also know the cashier does not think about the people who buy the books. The cashier probably has no idea who Plato or Nietzsche even are. If I want to take Nietzsche seriously, I would have to not care what the cashier thought of me. Maybe the cashier read my mind and thought I was the biggest loser. I should let them think that. That would only be the cashier’s perception of me, but I love myself and no one can make that inner flame dwindle.  
  
Sincerely,

After watching quite some time, I started finding job from jobstreet and linkedin, omg I was so upset that none of my applications was accepted and get into interview. Seriously, should I just apply for sales position? 

So at night, my plumber suddenly texted me saying they will install by tonight instead of tmr and I was like wow they work until so late... Anyway always got problem .... Now the problem is my owner did not buy the shower mixer tap, he only bought the instant heater and he thought just instant heater can use it already and he asked me to buy since we are installing already, but no la how to buy for him at this time and last minute. So I replied my installer don't know where to get at this time and I think he is upset about it as maybe I didn't check for him, or I not willing to buy for him.

Blind conformity is the biggest blight on our culture. Authenticity is something I remember on the internet in the 2000s and early 2010s. Now, the masses dictate that everything is safe, bland, and corporate. Taking a chance is seen as a foolish thing to do because you will not be accepted by the rest of society.  
  
Of course this is nothing new. All throughout history this has been the case, but remembering the late 2000s and early 2010s I look back at that authenticity with fondness. Cultivating that creative energy is something everyone should do. Fuck anyone who says who should stay on the safe side.  
  
I have been a coward for so long. Caring about what other people think of you is the absolute worst thing you can do. Having your friends be by your side is great too, but if they are your true friends they will stand by you. If they do not, they are not friends worth having anyway.  
  
Recently I watched a video talking about the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche and just taking in how true it is. The idea of the übermensch is easily one of the most misinterpreted of all time. It is not necessarily about being better than other people, but being at a higher level of awareness. This level of awareness happened with Buddha, Krishna, Aleister Crowley, and Jesus. There is something divine about overcoming the herd who follow their own destruction. My hope is that most people come to the awareness to think for themselves and not care what anyone else has to say. Society is too phony currently,

But I still took the chance to say ""我想能不能“追” 到你. And you know what... She totally ignore my message and replied again that she uninstalled long time le no play le... Haiz... Looks like she is avoiding me... "
309,"Hey everyone so just a random post of mine......about heart to heart
There's a question in my mind bout ""who's my someone ?"" Strange right y'all thinking about what's someone. Well 'someone' is anyone but not everyone. A special anyone, a close stranger, a person who knows every freaking thing about you. Not a stalker lol but someone you're most comfortable with. A random facts about you? He/she knows it, your deepest secret? Yep that too, anything literally everything that stranger knows, it's the person who cares the most for you, who supports you the most, who is there with you in every ups and downs (right from your birth). So here's the question 'WHO IS MY SOMEONE'. 
Idk if I found that stranger or is yet there out somewhere waiting for me.
So do you have an answer to my question.

Who is my someone?"
310,"24 marks another trip around the sun. Another day, another Americano, another 24 hours of trudging through my thoughts, trying not to cry excessively in public. *You’re not supposed to have it all figured out yet. Your twenties are hard. You’re not alone. You’re still young, and you have so much time.* 



How do I find meaning? I’m the youngest I’ll ever be in this exact moment, and the timer ticking down in my head is much louder and more persistent than my heartbeat. Nihilism: nothing means anything, so nothing matters. But also, life is so wonderful, so coincidental that surely everything means everything, right? How can both of these things be true? 



About four years ago, I embarked on an adventure, compelled by the pull of certainty that I’d never felt before. I upped and left, padded with a small allowance and my mother’s emotional support. A few weeks later, I’d emerge from a prolonged quarantine and lay my eyes on my university for the first time. I would study here, and I’d be wanted just because of how much I wanted to be there. 



The honeymoon phase never really wore off — I would never take the sprawling, castle-like granite towers of the campus for granted, nor the delicate snowflakes that dusted my school every winter, year in. *Just give it some time, and you’ll get sick of the sludge…* People were always quick to try to dispose of the whimsy for the sake of practicality and just knowing best. It didn’t work, though. Boring classes were tolerable because just being there imparted a sense of belonging, and as for the snow, no amount of sludge or discomfort from damp socks will ever hamper my enjoyment. 



Time unravelled gently, and for the most part, kindly. I met wonderful people, and nurtured genuine friendships. My university experience thus far had been unexceptional in the best way, until the social supports I built inevitably began to implode. In some cases, it was simply a matter of diverging schedules, our reasons to hang out becoming increasingly sparse. Other times, it was a result of complicated feelings and miscommunication. And in the worst case, it was a by-product of trauma. I fought hard to not be alone, but I was proving to be too much for other people. After taking a proverbial breather, I tried to reach out again, to make new connections. I’m not sure if I’m generally ill-suited for this country, or if it’s something more nuanced than that, but I have been unsuccessful since the initial decline. I spend the majority of my time alone now. 



I’ve been in a relationship for over a year now. This has not been without its dramatic ups and downs — many near-misses and very vulnerable moments. We generally spend weekends together. This is one of the few things that I can muster any sort of enthusiasm towards. Communication has felt like trying to draw water from a stone recently, with the most upsetting incident being him cancelling a pre-birthday dinner with less than an hour’s notice. I genuinely love him, and I’m worried that I’ve carried myself away into a fantasy land by imagining a future with him so often. I don’t know if I’m deluding myself with my thoughts. I, with every fibre of my being, want this to work. 

With all the pretext, we are pretty much at the present. After 3 years of living in the same place, I have to find a new apartment because of a blow-up with my landlord. The instability and ambiguity are wearing me down. I’m due to graduate in a few months, and nothing is certain after that. I have no friends, I’m not sure if my boyfriend loves me, and recently, more often than not, I feel like I want to die. I draw an absolute blank when asked about my goals and ambitions — it’s easy to mirror those around me — *I want to be a public servant, my dream is to be a personal trainer.* I used to think that I always had somewhere to go. I always had ambition, and dreamed of making a difference, however small. Now, though, I don’t want anything. Can’t imagine amounting to anything. Before, I’d weather it out — fight stubbornly, ceaselessly — based on some persistent hope for the future. I think the difference now is that I have no idea who I am. No matter how hard I try, I cannot convince myself that I have value to anyone else. I tried hard to be useful, to make others happy, but I fear that there is no point left. "
311,"2025 March 25: Dear Diary,

Last week I was supposed to go to the antique store with Ed, but he was too sick. We went today instead and I found it to be fascinating. Looking all around there were items from different time periods. There were racist artifacts from the Jim Crow era, Billie Eilish shoes, a DVD of the Jackass Movie, Nazi belt buckles and knives, old Playboys, a Geisha statue, animal skulls, and many more items.  
  
Although I definitely need to go back and find more trinkets, I decided to get the Geisha statue and a Playboy magazine from February 1989 because it had a picture of Joe Camel on the back. It is very interesting that a cigarette company was allowed to use a cartoon mascot like that, obviously trying to market to teenagers. Of course it was dangerous, but at least the advertising had personality and was not some tepid slop trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator.  
  
Plenty of the items in the store oozed with personality. They were made during a time when things lasted, even mundane crap. There was passion behind the craft, but now corporations do not even try to hide the fact they are soulless and greedy. All they want is money and do not give one fuck about passion or art.  
  
Before making it to the check out there was an older man having a political discussion with one of the owners. Ed and I made our way around the store again trying to avoid the geezer.  
  
“It was the worst four years of my life,” he said with a raised voice.  
  
“I kinda liked it,” the male owner said.  
  
“Why?” The geezer asked with a louder voice.  
  
Ed and I backed away from there pretty fast so I do not know which years they were talking about. Obviously, it was either 2016-2020 or 2020-2024, but I do not know which ones they were talking about. I find Trump and Biden to both be horrible, but obviously I hate Trump one million times more than I hate Biden. To me, anyone who voted for Trump is a complete fucking moron. 

When we came back around the counter a female owner came by. She interjected with some of her own opinions as well.

“Well you have George Soros and Bill Gates poking behind the scenes,” she started. “And then there is Obama, and I don’t know what he’s doing.”

“I think he’s— they’re gonna make him the next UN president,” the fogey replied.

Ed and I continued to a different part of the store.

“Does this usually happen here,” I asked.

“Yeah, there is typically some old fucker spouting political nonsense that I don’t want to listen to. It’s just something you put up with when browsing.”

After the fogey left we made our way to the counter where the female owner rang us up. All I had was the Playboy and Geisha statue. Both were on sale to my surprise.

“Sorry there was a political discussion,” she started. “I used to not be into politics but now I am. Most of the politicians can’t keep a sentence together, Democrat or Republican.”

“True,” Ed and I both replied in earnest.

“Americans don’t know how lucky they are. I used to live in third world countries where they don’t care about people, especially women. They come back here and have a cheeseburger,” she continued.  
  
“Which third world countries?” I asked.  
  
“Oh, some in Africa and South America. But I recently got into politics and the right to vote is something we take for granted. Politicians come in and they leave as billionaires. They think no one is suspicious.”  
  
“It has always been a class struggle,” Ed began. “It’s not really left versus right or Black versus White, but rich versus poor. The government just wants to keep us distracted.”  
  
“Give them bread and circuses,” I responded.  
  
“The people in government are selfish,” the owner continued. “They are just looking out for themselves.”  
  
“Maybe someone should put LSD in the water supply,” Ed replied jokingly.  
  
“I have been thinking about that,” the owner started. “I was wondering about aliens and if they tampered with the water supply.”  
  
“My aunt talks about aliens a lot,” I humoured her.  
  
“Now there are people who work two or three jobs and they live in cars,” she continued. “I’ve seen them.”  
  
It is beyond tragic how this country treats the poor. People can work their whole lives and have nothing to show for it. All while some lazy fucks running a fortune five hundred company can make someone’s life savings in a few seconds. I was starting to agree with this lady. She had some crazy thoughts, but her heart was in the right place. Until what she said next.  
  
“Those people can starve, but illegal immigrants come to this country and get so much stuff for free. Immigrants who come here legally don’t get anything,” she said  
  
“We are all technically immigrants, so we aren’t special,” Ed replied.  
  
“That’s true. We did come here legally though.”  
  
“I don’t think slaughtering indigenous people with smallpox is very legal though.”  
  
She knew she agreed with that statement. It was clear in her face. I too agreed with Ed’s statement, but I also did not want to start a confrontation.  
  
“Thank you for the items,” I said as I walked away, having already paid.  
  
“Thank you for the discussion. It’s the two things we can’t talk about: politics and religion.”  
  
Of course I did not agree with everything she said. There was a lot of stuff she said that I found reprehensible and some stuff just silly. However, she could clearly see there is a problem with class in this country. She knows how terrible the poor are treated as she has seen it herself. The trip to the antique store was a lot more eye-opening than I expected. It gave me a lot more perspectives to think about. I found it very humbling and I can not wait to go back.  
  
Sincerely,

312,So went to school drop of was changed a bit. Chem didn't do much of anything just assingment work. Same with psychy. Maths practice for the exam. And physics I was working on a assignment. So yeh that's about it. Oh after school I had martial arts that was a fun lesson. And then I packed for my school camp
313,"the things i'm learning right now seem almost ritualistically important.  like ceremonial and sacred.

i'm in love and on fire and nothing matters.  i'm completely reckless and will do anything.  i am in a fervor and ready for malicious violence.  i am dangerous and tight and invite any son of a bitch to try it.

my experience of love is like a stimulant.  i'm sharp and fast and intense.  i can't eat, i can't sleep.  i'm invincible.  i'm insane and should be stopped."
314,"今天呢，一整天呆在家。。。 I just quit my job as sales interior designer as this is a very stressful job for me. Boss already say that this job will be very tough at first as you will need to learn how to close deal, then need to deal with site problems, after dealing with site problems need to deal with client. To me dealing with client and negotiating job is the toughest!!! I was really anxious dealing with clients... As I'm not an organised person I tend to make things last minute and it causes many problems between me and client which I don't wanna say no more... And also I don't know how to guide the client throughout the renovation period, so its really so messy up now... 

So I have decided to go back Malaysia and hence I have few things to settle on hands. First, my rental contract is until end of May, and I need to find replacement to get my deposit back. I went to FB and posted and keep finding tenant. Not only FB I also posted in xhs (a Chinese platform). 

Secondly, which I need to find a job. Up until now I'm still very lost as what job should I apply, so far I only apply the past job I had which is business analyst but no news yet... Not sure if is my resume problem or what... However, I came to think what if my ex wants to be together and wants to stay in Penang which means I will move to Penang also. Then I will need to find job in Penang. But there are not many business analyst job in Penang tho. 

So this thought came to me, should I apply for sales banker? Or anything to do with financial sales. But is not fully commission based, I want to have at least basic not like sales interior design. And this makes me very confusing should I continue doing sales as I had a bad experience dealing with clients, not the onboarding client, I just had a lot of problem with client demanding or negotiating with me. I don't know if I were to enter this field, will the same thing happened to me again... But sometimes I'm just bored having the same salary and waiting to come into my account. So I really struggling right now what should I find for my job..."
315,"I’ve never truly understood why. I suppose it’s the happiness it brings. but why? why is it so hard for some to feel it? why is it so easy for me to feel genuine gratitude? 

I’m grateful for so much. pretty much everything. even pain, I can admit. while I don’t love feeling those negative emotions, I am grateful for what I learn from them. 

Maybe that’s what I’m the most grateful for: learning. I am constantly learning. Oh, and I’m grateful for my curiosity. I am a sea of questions about the unknown. From information about animals to the complexities of the human experience. 

A part of me wishes I had all the answers. but then how could I learn? why deprive myself of something that brings me immense joy? 

learning about myself— the good and the bad— makes me feel closer to the universe. I yearn to understand her.. and what role I play for her. 

maybe.. maybe I’m just meant to live and die like everything else. like the stars (even if they’re not alive). that’s okay. I have faith that she’ll let me live in her, happily and at peace despite it all. 

that’s all I really want. to learn. be happy. to learn to be truly happy. thank you, universe! "
316,"So it's about 6 pm right now and I'll just say what I did up until now

First I woke up and stayed in bed for an extra 10 minutes (I'm lazy) and then I brushed my teeth and then I drank some water and started reading my English book and I ate some honey and then I ate my breakfast. And when I finished my breakfast i read more books (I was bored) and then I washed my face and got on reddit, then I got off reddit and ate my lunch.... and went on the internet again, then I watched TV for a bit before eating something and then I got on the internet AGAIN and after a bit now I am writing this post. So I just think this is a pretty boring day overall, bye :)"
317,"Is it bad if I want to run away from everything? Start over in a new country where no one knows me? And stop talking to my family, friends, boyfriend and anyone who has ever known me?
I want to change my name, delete all my accounts, move, get a new job, new phone, new identity.
Does that make me crazy or insane?
I feel like I could actually do it and forget everyone. Then I will be to just focus on myself and only worry about myself, be able to breathe, be able to live.
My mind is occupied by everyone else and I only get concerned because of everyone else. Does that make sense?
I feel like the people i’ve met and know occupy too much of me that I can’t even focus. I want to be alone until I am healthy… I don’t want to rely or care about anyone else anymore. Im losing my mind, myself, my reality. 
How do I escape?
Do I kill myself to escape myself? Is everyone else the problem? Do I need to leave everyone or just simply leave the earth?
I don’t want to die but I don’t want to live like this anymore either. My thoughts consume me so much that I question EVERYTHING. I don’t have peace… no one can give me peace. How do I get it? What can I do? I just want to fix myself but I can’t do it with the people in my life because they don’t help. They all have problems and I can’t have more problems anymore. I want to retreat, go somewhere alone, start over, forgive and forget. 
Just because I was born in this life does not mean I have to stay right? I don’t owe anyone anything? I didn’t ask for this. I need to escape either my life, reality, or people. I just don’t know which will come first?"
318,"2025 March 24: Dear Diary,

I almost never take naps, but maybe I should. Today I had a headache and it only got worse after a while. Even when I was playing with the kittens today I could feel my head hurt. I reckon the headache was caused by caffeine withdrawals as I had not had any for two days. There was only one thing I could do.  
  
Walking into my room, I rested my head on my Blåhaj and closed my eyes. As the typical visions of the night came into my mind the pain in my cranium slowly drifted away. The sleep must have lasted no more than thirty minutes, yet I had to find my bearings when I awoke. Feeling this rested does not come often, even after sleeping for hours. I reckon I should give napping more credit and take them more often.  
  
Sincerely,

319,My current one is old and lags a lot but at idk if I should just wait until september and get the newest one or if i should get it now. I’ve had the phone for almost 4 years now it is on its knees but at the same time I don’t want to spend my money just yet. 
320,"When I recall the three days I spent alone in Paris — watching a chess in front of Shakespeare's bookstore, my mind drifting in the wind, wandering through countless masterpieces, although this trip had nothing to do with luxury, it did make me unforgettable, when the Eiffel Tower sparkled, I felt the biting cold wind on the cruise ship, the album of Blood Orange played in my headphones, I sang silently, as if the sorrow of the past ten years had dissipated in the wind, as if I’d forgiven everything in this world."
321,"本来昨天是第一天但忘了写哈哈，那就今天开始。I had so much trouble trying to find a platform and write my stuff as threads and X got word limit... Nehmind let's start. 

没什么特别的事情发生，就早上起了，吃了早餐就去 site le. 在 site 见了顾客，是一双年龄比较大的 client. We chat a lot about the design and they even ask me why I quit the job where am I planning to go. He even advised me to be a boss which I think I'm definitely not qualified yet as I'm not so fond continue to be interior design. I am really bad at maintaining client relationships.... 

My ex texted one of my snap which I lost my umbrella. I was kind of surprised and wish she would reply my snap and finally she did! She said is a needs to buy the umbrella and I took the opportunity to flirt with her saying you are my needs as well hahahahah. But her reaction was not what I expected so I continue flirting with her saying you are 无价之宝 since she replied she isn't a goods... So cannot be bought so cannot compare her to a goods, she assumed that a needs is only used for goods. So I said to her ""你知道你是无价之什么宝吗？你是我的宝贝！"" Hahahaha I don't care man.... I just want to say whatever I want and indeed she just ignore my message... Seriously tho I don't know what she wants. If you don't want to get back just ignore me and don't ever reply my message don't keep giving fake hope... I'm so heartbroken dead..."
322,"It is about 5 pm again so I am writing this, again I'll just say what I did up until now.

First I woke up and stayed in bed for an extra like 5 minutes, then I brushed my teeth, ate breakfast, and folded my blanket. Then I got ready for school because there was a PTM (don't ask about it). And then I got back home, took a bath, and read a book for 5 minutes. Then I got on reddit, and after a while I got up and ate some noodles, and now I'm writing this. :) bye"
323,"So, I’ve been doing a lot lately. I’m trying to grow some plants 🌱, I cleaned my entire house 🏡, and I did my best to support my partner ❤️. It’s hard to stay optimistic, though. I finally got my house completely clean, but then my brother came home and messed it up 😩. At the same time, I’m trying to cheer up my partner, they are going through a lot, and I feel like I’m failing somehow 💔.

I don’t know. Right now, I’m just listening to audiobooks 🎧 and chatting with AI 🤖. I think I’m doing okay. I have a lot of responsibilities now. I still haven’t set up the entire computer room for the office while also doing my job as a secretary, which feels basically impossible 😵‍💫. On top of that, I have to pitch in for my sister’s laptop 💻, which will cut my budget really short 💸. And I’m nowhere close to getting my house back in order 🫠.

I don’t know. I feel like I’m just complaining about the regular pains of being a person. It could also just be the lack of sleep 😴. Either way, I know I’ll be all right. Just gotta put one foot in front of the other 👣.

I just can’t shake the tension building inside of me. I can’t quite place it, but I just don’t want it to break me.

324,"i'm in love for the second time in my life and it's *SO* fascinating.  i'm taking it so casually, but it's a huge deal and something i honestly never thought would happen.  the feeling is... incredible.  just yesterday was the most relaxed i've ever been in my life, and i mean that literally.  i used to say that about the first time i smoked weed.  that was, until yesterday, the most relaxed i'd ever been in my life.  what was i doing yesterday?  listening to a voice recording of his, lying in bed and spooning a pillow.  for hours.  

what's new is that, i guess connecting to myself sexually and emotionally, my mind and body have found each other in a way they never have before and i'm realizing there are a lot of processes i'm experiencing in a completely new way.  i mean, i've been horny before but my physiological reactions to things right now are totally alien.  i've honestly never felt any of this before.  for example, i feel like i actually connected with my digestion.  usually when i eat, that's it, the food goes in me and the rest is disconnected from my consciousness.  yesterday i felt the whole process from beginning to end.  i never feel that.

i think it's also made me sort of invincible.  i'm heavy and, you know, relatively active.  i walk a lot, i jog on and off, i'm on my feet a lot.  thing is, i haven't really jogged all winter and the last time i was regularly exercising, i was probably a good 20lbs lighter (gained a lot in the fall).  today it was nice out and the second jog of the season on the track across from my house.  

friday i did three miles, which was sort of wow considering the weight gain and inactivity.  i usually am pushing just for two.  today?  four miles.  a personal best.  and it was like nothing.  my recovery time was nothing, either, i was barely out of breath.  i hardly believe it myself but i timed it and use a reliable system to count the distance.  i went around the track 16 times and it took me about 50 minutes.  i'm slow and, at my usual pace, that's consistent with how long it should take me to jog that far.

is this healing me?  my body?  being in love?  are the chemicals going through me giving me physical strength?   "
325,"2025 March 23: Dear Diary,

Lately, I have been feeling quite depressed. The dumbest people in the world are succeeding not in spite of their stupidity, but because of it. I have lost faith that humanity has any value or that life has any meaning. If life were fair, only the smartest and most creative people would be victorious instead of the most greedy and stupid.  
  
However, I still do not want to hate anyone. I do not even want to hate the people who most deserve it. Hatred corrodes the soul and leaves one destitute. It does no harm to the person who deserves the scorn, but only to the person who conjures it. The only option when it comes to dealing with worthless individuals is to detach from them.  
  
Remembering good people still exist is a good tool as well. Being mindful to never stoop to the level of the evil ones is the only true way to remain victorious. Conforming to what the idiotic masses say, is the way of defeat. Thinking for oneself will lead a person to victory. I used to think loneliness was a curse, but now I see it is a blessing. Still, I must talk with my friends more. Talking to them is what keeps me from slipping into insanity. That and writing. I would rather suffer writing and accomplish something than suffer and accomplish nothing.

Hecate escaped the living room twice! Morpheus is perfectly content staying in the living room, but has constant zoomies. Kittens are very energetic. I helped my mom watch them so they could not escape the confines of the living room again.  
  
Hiding underneath couches is what Hecate likes to do. She makes her way underneath the couch very close to the living room, but just outside of it. The gates keeping them in are not the best, but they can make do for the moment.  
  
I got to pet Morpheus, but not Hecate. Morpheus probably gets himself tired by using his energy. The cats are wonderful and I am glad we can give them a home.

As I just said, it is 23:09 local time, which means that we are less than an hour from my birthday. Ah, never mind: it's 23:10 now, just 50 minutes (五十分) from my birthday...except I haven't been practicing my Japanese, so it took me so long to write that  that now we're only 47 minutes from the midnight hour (embarrassing, I know, but not the most embarrassing thing I'll admit to in this post). 23:14; my 20s took forever, but I guess that they've decided to pick up the pace as I try to savor my final few moments. 

Yes, I'm turning 30 soon, maybe before I even finish this post, with how long it takes me to do stuff these days. I accomplished a lot in my 20s—earning the genuine respect of teachers and peers for the first time in my life, blowing it all away, losing 110 pounds (!), gaining more than 100% of it back. I completely wasted my 20s, and what little I nearly accomplished inevitably ended in outright regression from wherever I started. Even my Japanese, which I only began studying sometime in mid or late January *of this year(!)*, managed to atrophy before I hit the 3 decade mark. I guess it's appropriate[ that my birth coincided](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPe6SfefwgA&t=1853s) with the public's introduction to Kato Kaelin, then widely perceived as a bum and loser ([just ask the late but forever iconic Norm McDonald](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViajDGGmXfE)), during his testimony in the OJ Simpson criminal murder trial. 

I stepped away for what felt like a few seconds, and now I only have 20 minutes until I'm legally 30. I guess I don't really have the time to get into all of the details about how I failed throughout the last 10 years, and how I'll likely continue to fail throughout the next 10. Maybe I'll add some of that in a follow up post later tonight or tomorrow afternoon. 

I hate my life and everything I've come to. I am very fortunate, but it is only because of my circumstances overcoming my own propensity to fuck up everything I touch. I'm like the anti-King Midas 

Well, as time winds down (11 minutes now,) I guess that it's time to think about what I'll do today. I'll probably study some Japanese, read a bit from one of my favorite books, maybe watch a favorite movie, and then close the night out with some Milwaukee Bucks basketball.

Let me finish the final post of my 20s by directing both readers [to an Onion article](https://www.instagram.com/p/DHeOwlvPLLP/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) I saw earlier today that describes me more perfectly than I care to admit. じゃあ."
334,"It's just darkness and there's a huge line of doors, locked doors in this darkness.

 I'm sitting in front on the second door crying. You walk up to the first door and open it. 

You try to open the second door. You can not get it open.

 I'm no longer there you're on your own. 

You try to go around the second door, to the third only to fall. I'm back at the second door sobbing.

 It's me in the dream but I'm not in myself. I'm watching all of this go down from a narrator point of view. Like I'm reading a book.

 This is so weird. "
335,"I am exhausted. But maybe in kind of a relieved way. Finally the weekend. 

I've been having a really really rough go of it. 

I've been sick these past few days. 

And yesterday, while home on a sick day, I accidentally sent a meme to my work group chat, including my boss. It was ""When your boss thanks you for staying late to work but you were just looking at memes and lost track of time."" 

Holy fuck diary. When I saw what I had done I felt like I was gonna pass out. 

My boss was cool about it though. 

I need to calm the fuck down. 

My fight/flight response is entirely too sensitive and my reactions are entirely too visceral. 

It's like that scene on Galaxy Quest when they hold down they hyperdrive too long and it rips the ship apart. Like. It is not sustainable to maintain this level of stress response for this long. 

I have a bunch of stuff I need to do before bed. 

But I'm craving sleep like a starving man craves food. 

I hope have a lucid dream tonight. "

My family got two new kittens. They are a brother and sister and are both black. The girl’s new name is Hecate and the boy’s new name is Morpheus. I am very glad that my family has cats again. It has been a while since we have had multiple.

339,"But I don't mind. It's certainly not the first time (lol). And it was quiet. And then some woman walked over to me and checked on me. I assured her I was okay. And I am. I was talking about a deceased family member over the phone in the cafe, that's why I surprised myself and began to tear up. And yeah I cried a little but I just went home and talked it out and I was okay. Ultimately, I always remind myself that missing them now is absolutely worth all the happy memories I have from their lives and time with me. 

But a woman actually checked on me. She said ""let me know if you need anything."" I was moved. I guess because I often feel invisible. But I am not. And I have so much evidence that I am not. And it's normal for someone who struggled with making friends a long time ago to have insecurities about being 'worthless' and 'insufferable' but I just am not. Very few humans are, and those rare few are certainly not dwelling on their shortcomings. So why should I? None of us are perfect but I am always aware of my flaws and always working on them. I would never call another human the names I call myself or berate them in the way I do for the things that make me upset at myself. So. I am working on my 'self talk' and my family and I are all pleased with my progress. But it will be a work in progress. For the rest of my life probably. Ideally, life always progressing, wether we want it to or not. 

It has its ups and downs. Its two steps forward and its steps backward. But I have so much unique things in my life to be grateful for. And I have gotten better and better at 'integrating my shadow' or 'cultivating distress tolerance' or all those other fancy sounding things therapists and sociologists use to basically mean, learning to accept all parts of life (without isolating, ruminating and feeling defeated, that's not reality acceptance that's catastrophizing, which I, like many, am guilty of at some points, to some degrees, sometime) .... shitty parts included. Anyways. I really appreciate being checked upon by that kind stranger. 

It was a very small act of kindness. But we all know how big small acts can be sometimes. And I hope to pay it forward as soon as I am able. 

I am cozy in bed now. Im pretty good at self soothing healthily lately. I have my white noise machine on and my water bottle. My water bottle is an exciting find because I honestly thought I lost it. I have been pawing through a fascinating magazine about one of my neurological labels or whatever. ADHD. It definitely resonates with my symptoms. And it has some helpful tips and ideas. 

I think I will express my grief in some digital art later. I have my second to last day of my PHP group therapy program tomorrow. And pizza. And it will be the weekend. And some friends and I plan to meetup at a little brewery. So I have a lot to look forward to. I have met some very bad people in my life. That is for certain. That is why I was diagnosed with PTSD. But symptoms can be managed. I can be okay. I will be. 

And in fact, most people, most humans, are genuinely good. Abuse is as horrible and extreme as it is rare behavior. Yes, the world has danger. But yes the world has a lot of joy and beauty and fun worth sticking around for. Ultimately too, one day with each of the people I grieve, was truly worth 1,000 or more days of grieving and pain for me. It's ""love persevering."" It's worth it and beautiful and I am ok.  "

Happy Spring Equinox! I really wish I had better ways to celebrate the Pagan Holidays. This Equinox represents the blossoming of new opportunities. Looking forward to the blessings coming my way is something I am very grateful for.  
  
A few glasses of mead was the way I decided to celebrate and now I am writing my entry. Getting into the habit of writing more is something I need to do. Deep down, I am probably thinking of writing in the wrong way. Maybe I am seeing it as making ends meet rather than as a way of life. I would rather only care about the art of writing, but being financially stable enough to continue writing is something I subconsciously worry about.  
  
Removing worries could be a new blessing coming this Equinox. Letting my writing blossom into the art I like sounds like a very good plan. There is no time like the present, so I must put all my passion into my writing. Caring about what anyone else thinks of my writing is the most foolish thing I could do. I must write for myself and myself alone.

i just want to be loved any accepted. i want stability. i want passion, adventure and nature. i want light heartedness, where there’s a silliness and beauty to the day to day. i don’t want anything fancy, but every day is so dreary and the simplest things seem so hard to attain. really, maybe i don’t know what i want. maybe i’m just someone who will always be miserable no matter the circumstance. it makes me sad about my future now that i realize im like this.

352,"2025 March 19: Dear Diary,

My empathy goes from one extreme to the other. I either have intense bursts of hyper-empathy or I lack it completely. I would like to find a middle ground of having a normal amount of empathy. Balancing this would be very useful.  
  
It is definitely easier to explain the times where I lack empathy. Most people I see on a day to day basis are very cruel and stupid. They like to conform to society, yet they struggle to comprehend simple tasks. These are the “Karens” or the conservatives which many people are. Critical thinking is too challenging for them so they become no better than wild animals with the intelligence of second graders. I do not feel as if I own them an ounce of empathy. I genuinely do despise them.  
  
But deep down, I know that these people can become better. They can truly think critically if they are given the opportunity. I was once just as bad, but I have opened my mind further. It may not be possible for everybody, but it can be for most people. My hope is that the awful majority of society can become decent. In order for that to happen microscopic changes must occur. 

For starters I need to treat even the very worst people with respect. This will be a big challenge. Talking with people frightens me quite a lot. I do not like eighty percent of the population, but I know they can become better. Misanthropy does me no good, it only corrodes my soul. Hatred helps no one. I desperately want to love people despite having very little in common with them. I do not want to hate anyone. I want to get rid of the curse of misanthropy and expel it from my mind and soul.

Torinico"
353,"**Where do I even start?** …Ugh. I’m tired. I want to cry. But it’s like that famous dialogue—*no more tears left to cry.*

Somewhere deep down, I know there are plenty of tears (probably enough to fill a whole damn lake), but they just won’t come out. Maybe because I’m too disappointed. *In myself.* So much that I don’t even feel like I deserve my own tears. I don’t know… but it is what it is.

**Disappointment #1.** The biggest one. Honestly, there’s no #2 or #3—this one alone is enough.

I—this girl writing right now—aced subjects where 70% of the class failed. Straight A’s. But somehow, I *still* can’t qualify this one competitive exam. Not once. Not twice. *Thrice.*

How? How the hell could I fail three times in a row? What was I even thinking? And to be honest, it’s not like I didn’t know the concepts. I just messed up. Stupid, silly mistakes.

Like, who the fuck (sorry, but seriously) can read *cylindrical* instead of *circular* for 15 straight minutes? *Fifteen whole minutes.* I wasn’t in my right state of mind.  
Second time? I panicked. I had *seen* the same question before but just couldn’t recall the answer.  
And the first time? I wasn’t even properly prepared.

But here’s the thing—this *one* exam could have been a turning point in my life. It was supposed to secure my fellowship for the next four years. And now? I don’t even know what’s next.

What hurts even more is not just my own disappointment—but seeing my parents and friends upset. Not because I didn’t qualify, but because *I’m* sad.

They told me something today—  
*""You can’t get everything you desire. If life gave us everything we wanted, we’d never understand sadness. And as humans, we’re meant to experience it all—joy, pain, fear, loss… everything.""*

And my mom; She just said one thing—  
*""A single exam can’t decide your future. Time will tell what’s meant for you.""*

I just hope she’s right."

Maybe I got a little too caffeinated today. Two caffeine pills were enough for me to start throwing things in my room away instead of writing like I wanted to. I really do need to organize stuff and improve the feng shui in my room. It is not so much that my room is dirty, but that there is too much stuff on my desk and shelves.   
  
For too long I have been receiving things I do not want or need. Sometimes I grow too attached to these things and other times I feel guilty about throwing them away because I might make someone angry. Other times I get things as an impulse buy and cannot admit to myself the thing I got was useless. Although my hoarding is not too bad, I still find it problematic.  
  
A few days ago I removed a broken chair from my room. It opened up so much space and I felt so much happier. I was also very caffeinated at the time. I am very glad to have started the removal of the junk from my room, but I still have a long way to go.

Ight chief back at school. Nothing much happens I have a crap ton of room changes. Classes were pretty average so nothing new there same with breaks it was perfectly normal Monday hit the gym afterwards and yeh that's about it tbh "
362,"I feel so foolish. I know I'm wasting my time, money, and emotions on my ex, yet I still go to him whenever he asks. Am I really in love, or am I just afraid of being alone? I'm living and working overseas with no friends, and even talking to my family feels uncomfortable. We broke up a year ago, but we still live in the same building.

He's a local, and I'm an expat. Sometimes I think he's kind, but most of the time, I feel like he's only nice because he benefits from me. He’s made it clear that getting back together is impossible, yet we still have dinner every day, spend our days off together, and even plan trips. Deep down, I know why—because I'm the one paying for the food, groceries, shopping, and future travels.

I’m trying to accept that we won’t be a couple again, but he keeps telling me that I need him. Emotionally, I’m attached, but I know I can handle everything else on my own. I don’t want to be alone, and I still want him. Maybe I’m holding onto the hope that, in time, he’ll change his mind—but I know he won’t. I need to stop. But how?

"
363,"In my 22 years of life (oh! what a long time span), I’ve noticed one thing consistently—the things I want the most, I never get. Like, *never ever.* It always feels like I’m so close, almost there… and then suddenly, it disappears—just like a mirage.

Since one of my parents works in the central government, I never really lived in my birthplace, my *hometown.* One of my earliest dreams was to move closer, even just a little. At that time, we were 300 km away, and like any kid, I wanted to spend time with my cousins, play with them, live with my extended family, and celebrate festivals together instead of just visiting for summer vacations.

Then came 2016, bringing hope for a transfer. And by *God’s magic*… we got transferred even *further away*—400 km now. And the place? Let’s just say it wasn’t far from *hell* (one day, I’ll write about my school experience there).

Then came 2020. I wanted to get into a college near my hometown. I used to watch YouTube videos about it, started working hard, dreaming about finally being closer to home. But just like before, the things I love most are never meant for me—I didn’t get that college either.

Fast forward to 2024, I appeared for a competitive exam that I *desperately* wanted to qualify for. And, well… I didn’t. (Not because I’m bad at academics or anything—I’ve cleared every other exam with a good rank—except that one.)

Now, in 2025, I gave the same exam again. The results are coming out today at 10 PM IST, but somehow, I already *feel* that I won’t make it through.

But here’s the thing—although I never got exactly what I wanted, I always got something *better* in return.  
That terrible school? It made me capable enough to crack an engineering exam and get into college.  
I didn’t get a college near my hometown, but I still ended up in a CFTI.  
I didn’t clear that competitive exam, but I got three accepted publications and qualified for other exams too.

I don’t know what will happen today. But if clearing this exam isn’t written in my destiny, I just hope—*God, please give me something better than this.* That’s the last thing I can wish for."
364,"First off, there will be two posts since I didn’t get time to post yesterday.

As the title suggests, I feel like I’ve been blessed (or cursed?) with an immense talent—the ability to always be misunderstood. Seriously, how can someone be this good at it?

I often hear things like, *""She’s always in the clouds,""* or *""She thinks she’s got wings,""* but honestly? I don’t even pay attention to all that. First, because I’ve never actually been on *cloud nine*—I’ve never had the chance. I haven’t achieved anything *that* big to feel that way. And second, even if I had, wouldn’t I deserve to celebrate a little? What’s wrong with that?

But things hit differently when you hear similar words from the people closest to you. The ones who know you—who know how you talk, how you express yourself. The ones who *should* know that you’d never say anything wrong, that you’ve always respected them.

It just hurts when, after all the hard work, all the effort I put in every single day—not just for myself—I still end up being misunderstood.

And yet, what can I even do about it? Maybe the problem is *me*—maybe it’s the way I talk, the way I communicate. Maybe I’m too raw, too unfiltered.

The only solution I see - **Stay SILENT**"

Be honest with yourself. What do you want? Is it what you really want? How can you get it? How to accomplish this thing you claim you’re in want of? 

If you truly wanted it, would you be doing otherwise. Does the smoker really want to stop smoking if she smokes another? Does the baker really want to bake for a living if he only bakes thrice a year? 

Screw what you want. 

The smoker wants relief from her emotional pains more-so than to stop. The baker wants to keep a roof over his head with his accounting job, wants to keep fit with basketball, and wants socialize with his friends. 

What is the need?

The smoker needs to find a healthy option for relief after finding the root of her pain. The baker needs to carve out a set routine time for his baking after making a timeline towards baking mastery.

Today was an awful day to go without caffeine. There was hardly anybody around the store today. Usually that is a good thing, but I got bored quickly. Instead of wallowing in boredom, I meditated for a while.  
  
I made sure to chant aum and om occasionally and tune into the universe. Staying in tune with the universe is the best thing I can do. The universe’s will and my own should be matched.  
  
After work, I decided to go to the McDonald’s which was still open near my work. They were obviously out of Shamrock shakes. Luckily I had one in February. I just ordered a burger and fries.

368,"class this morning started off kind of sad.  first off, i think one of my friends is having a bit of a tough time and wasn't there.  then again, half the class wasn't there and i don't know why.  our teacher tries so hard and gets discouraged easily and i really don't like to see her struggle.  i know it effects her when nobody shows up or pays attention so i try to be extra engaging.  sometimes, my enthusiasm has results and other people in the class seem more interested in the content when it's conversational.  also, it's a situation where there's really no wrong answers, it's great if you just say anything at all or tell a personal story from clinical or an opinion or just whatever comes to mind.  

this teacher is also big on in-class exercises which, you know, sometimes don't sit well with a bunch of students on a monday morning.  again, our class seemed to have some enthusiasm for it today, though.  there was a lot of chatter and people were discussing the topics in their groups and actually engaging in the content.  i think the vibes were right.  i'm not taking credit for that, but by the end of class... i don't know, everyone was so, just, in tune with each other i felt... loved.  i felt like there was just love in that classroom and everyone was feeling it.  i personally have nothing but love for everyone there.

everywhere i went i felt good today.  on a regular basis, it's not that i'm aware of feeling threatened but today, everywhere, i felt so safe.  like nobody would ever do or say a single mean thing to me.  i was also overcome by a feeling of deep relaxation.  so, loosened up.

i was looking through music on youtube, thinking of making a playlist and realized that everything i was picking was so happy and playful.  music i haven't listened to in years.  so free."
369,"My boyfriend and I got a room at a five star hotel in the city. It has a great reputation and I've wanted to try it forever!!!! We booked a bespoke facial for myself. With the room of course, they allowed us both to use the heated jacuzzi plunge pool and lighted steam room for as long as we wanted. I spent like an hour in that area before a worker got me for my rejuvenating facial. The massage made me fall asleep and when I woke up my face felt the softest it had ever been. And it had a wonderful glow to it. 

After our time at the spa we read about a place that is supposed to have good espresso martinis. So we investigated and it totally did. It was so young and fun, but bougie too. Our mozzarella sticks had caviar on them actually. Which made us laugh but was surprisingly good. Then we went back to the hotel room and enjoyed some weed I picked up for us at the dispensary, the walk in rainfall shower and bear claw sized tub.... and each other of course, we're adults, we're dating, we do what most adults who date tend to do sometimes. ;) 

He picked out the perfect hoodie for me. One of his comfiest ones he says. It makes my icy traumatized heart melt, how well he takes care of me. But then, I try to take care of him to. So I feel like we both deserve this. I am wearing the hoodie now and I never want to wash it. He doused it in his cologne so it still has his scent. It feels like a hug from him to me that I can keep while distance temporarily separates our bodies. 

We actually decided the hotel is worth going back to. It's on the pricier side but between the location and included amenities, the value makes it worth it. I am a little sad missing him today but that's natural. I gave myself the day off from therapy and sweated out some toxins in my gym's steam and sauna rooms. I am excited because my federal tax return came today. And it's a decent amount of money that I can deposit into my account. 

I am watching Hulu and snacking. My laundry was done yesterday and I vacuumed this morning. So I have a clean, safe space to unwind in. That's good. I have medicine but I am healing from a cold. I tend to get the same cold at the start of spring, like around this time every year. It's so funny but annoying. My dad and I think it's some sort of weird allergy to pollen type thing. Plus I mean, we've probably all noticed the coughing fits that seem to be going around. But I'm staying hydrated. And cozy.  "

I went to the soccer pitch to listen to my favorite song. Tried my best not to cry but still welled up. I told my boss in the afternoon that I can’t handle this workload. Can we somehow streamline it. He took it sorta well but also he had no intention to streamline it. I don’t think it’ll change in the short term.

After that, I bought some embroidery thread and tried embroidery for the first time. I didn't really know how to do it, so I just imitated what I saw. What I realized from trying it is that I like having time to concentrate.
I think it was a good day off. 
I hope to finish my embroidery someday and upload it here."
374,"I don’t think I’ve ever posted in this subreddit but here I am. I usually don’t write I guess my “diary entries” digitally and on Reddit of all places but I’ll probably occasionally write in here. The last time I wrote in a diary was probably 3 to 4 months ago and it was a suicidal note or me just explaining my attempt (that did not take place) and my mom found it. She surprisingly was very calm abt it but she was kind of pressuring an answer out of me as to why I wanted to commit.

She claims that her reason for going through my diary was because I don’t talk and express myself enough, I’ve tried to but I’m just not heard. I’m like a grain of sand on the beach, if it goes missing no one cares, after all it’s just one grain theres several other grains of sand. I go unnoticed a lot of the time, everyone talks over me. I’m only temporary, I would be there for someone, anyone really for as long as they need me but yet I somehow am still temporary.

I’ve always wanted to have someone to have long and meaningful conversations with, a person that is always there for me and I’m always there for them. Someone I could tell everything to but then again everything is only temporary for me. I know nothing lasts forever but I just want someone to be present in my life everyday until I die, it doesn’t have to be a lover, it could be a best friend. Best friends are better in my opinion, it’s less likely the relationship ends between you and that person.

anyway I guess that’s it for todays diary log, I probably won’t write much until like a few weeks or months depends if anything major happens which I’ve been waiting on for around 3 yrs now, I basically just live my life on repeat. But yeah if you read this whole diary log of a depressive teenager  thx."
375,"Wisdom comes from experience. If you were a fool, like me, and most people have been ""the fool"" at some points in their life - then you know how it feels to screw up. You know how it feels to embarrass yourself. You know how it feels to play your cards WRONG, not right - actually - sometimes in the ""grand sceme"" of your life. When sometimes - rolling the dice and resulting in a failure not only affects yourself, and your life - but others too. Foolish. The wind bristles through the trees, and reminds you - you were a fool, and that's okay. Yes, it's okay that you were a fool. Just heal from it. Don't continue to put on the mask. Be honest with yourself. Just don't be so much as a villain, or your soul will turn sour. They say failure teaches you success. If you go out there - and be a happy fool that doesn't hurt anybody in the land of illusions and alluring cheap tricks, just to find the sun, you can. If you want to ""crash the stage"" and join the party of humans making sanguine music from their heart and soul, down by the river, you can! You have to figure it out first. You can take the leap of faith, you can learn from making mistakes. From the hardness and soil of this earth, and what it will teach you. You can get dirty, and play in the dirt, and figure out your heart's pure desire. You can be yourself, free in your ever-loving self. Sometimes I feel so old, however I am still young enough to not be old. I know I am an old, but young wise soul. One who has been the fool. "
376,"Am I too used to discomfort?

Is that why I can’t do anything? The feeling of discomfort is like breathing for me. Nobody has ever believed me
My boundaries have always been compromised for others
I never got to be mad. I held by my morals no matter how stressed I was.
I had nobody I lashed out at 
I had to obey absolutely for others. Even ones I hated.
I had to stay in a room even if i was miserable or angry. Mom, dad, even [Brother] would just leave a room if they had enough. I never did.
I even forced myself to sit with and be lovey with [Father] so nobody else had to suffer.
I had to put up with constantly being told I was evil. A liar. Intentionally malicious. I couldn’t fight it.
I had no rights. I had no boundaries. I am not human.
I had to let my body change because it was easier than having to fight 
I had to let everything happen to me. I still have very few say in the most important parts of my life.
Every day, every second was discomfort. It’s an ingrained part of my being. The human being should push forward or work through discomfort when they feel it. It’s like someone who lives in smog. They don’t even notice that the air is thick or dirty. Normal people can’t breathe and fight against it, but they don’t even feel it enough to care. They don’t feel it when they’re suffocating.
This is why all my friendships said we never fought. That it was unusual. I’m too used to being a tool, all of them used me the moment they realised it was okay. It’s why I’ve only ever been treated like a pet.

I don’t feel a lot of low level pain. I don’t feel it until the moment I vomit when my body is pushed to the limit. I don’t feel it when I go outside without a coat and it’s snowing. I can’t physically feel any of it. My parents. My family. All of them took their stress out on me. All of them took my boundaries as silly or unnecessary. They discarded them for me. They were able to do that because I have no rights. I am not human. They pushed me to the limit and told me I should be able to do even more easily because they could. My body is naturally small. Small and weak. Compared to an 11 year old girl, I would likely have smaller or similar sized hands. Even on a powerful steroid my body has not gained muscle. I have different limitations from other people. It’s hard for me to rationalize that, but even harder for others. Not that they would care to. I’ve spent every waking moment of my life being lied to, treated as subhuman, somewhere between a pet and a farm animal. Not that they should have to suffer either, but I am a tool. I was a tool from the beginning. [Father] had me... probably to appease his mother? Maybe as a trophy? I think he would love a dog more, so not to be a pet. Definitely as a tool for his own agenda. Mom had me to live out her fantasies. She wanted me to do and be all the things she wanted in life. I was a tool for an agenda from the beginning. Eventually she realized I was also a good way to vent stress. I tried to offer that by talking, but everyone always takes more from me than I offer. Just like when I try to help people online, they end up trying to monopolize me and control my time. They tell me who I can or can’t talk to, and what I can or can’t do. They always take more than I have to give. Im glad it’s online, because I can simply disappear. I’ve been groomed not to leave a room no matter how uncomfortable I am, so I can’t do that in real life. It’s getting better, but the progress is so slow. I don’t wait to wait until 60 for my life to start. I’d rather it just end. It’s not worth the journey to me. I’m glad I’m able to cry right now. Usually I couldn’t even cry without someone else. 

Mom tells me to fight back. To stand up for myself. She’s one of the same people who groomed me to never do that. She tells me to be confident. To trust my body. To believe in myself. That’s not what she taught me to do. Why lie? That’s never what you wanted. It was way easier when I just sat there and took it. Way easier when I overworked myself. It would’ve been even easier if you could get me to do so silently 100% of the time, but you never achieved that. I guess if you had the confidence to slash my mouth closed. At least I always “complained.” That was my one and only freedom I didn’t lose. Even if I didn’t always get to. Even if I shut up and took it sometimes. At least it never went away. Your life was always easier when I sacrificed and didn’t say a word. Now it’s easier for me to be out of your hair and function normally. Like a person who wasn’t crushed and taught to live with constant discomfort. How can you be independent when you’re immune to your own discomfort? But now it’s easier for you, so I need to undo all of the permanent damage done to me in childhood for you. That way you don’t have to worry about me. Instead of conditioning me to have a good life, everyone just demands I become whatever meets their needs at the time. Now you need me to have the childhood you didn’t give me. Now you need me to have the skills I never got. Now you need to stand up for myself... just never before. Now you need me to set boundaries, even when you break them. How can I ever do as you say and set boundaries when you won’t even respect them? You always say it’s expensive for me to help you. It’s expensive for me though ask you for respect. It’s expensive for me to be myself. It’s expensive for me to ask for help. It’s expensive for me to have needs. It’s expensive for me to have individuality. It’s expensive for me to try new things. It’s expensive for me to learn. It’s expensive for me to be selfish, even a little bit. It’s expensive for to even ask you to spend time with me. I can’t even ask for love. It’s expensive for me to breathe. It’s expensive for me to talk about my own issues. It’s expensive for me to have genuine problems. It’s expensive for me to want to be seen as I am. It’s expensive to ask for anyone to believe me. It’s expensive to be ask to be treated like a person. It’s expensive for me to own anything. It’s expensive for me to have interests. It’s expensive to help you. It’s expensive to try my best. It’s expensive to have good intentions. It’s expensive to be seen. Especially when you’re stressed out. These are all the things that are expensive for me. At least I can cry to comfort myself. Usually I can’t.
Nothing will change. Nothing ever happens. 

I’m grateful I have a place to store my memory. I can feel my life fading away with every day. I can barely remember basic things anymore. It used to be that I could not remember yesterday, now I cannot remember the past hours. Soon it will be minutes. Soon I will be gone. It’s even expensive for me to die. I’m somewhat relieved that the aspect of choice is gone for me. It’s always been expensive to make choices. I’m grateful to my body for its mercy. 

There is nobody in the world that will look at the few aspirations I do have and be happy for me. Nobody will ever look at me and see me for who I want to be. Nobody will ever look at me and understand who I am inside. Nobody would care enough to listen. 

The people I wish I looked like. The person I look like on the inside. The things I enjoy. How they make me feel. The fact that for the first time, I felt a love for strangers. The fact that theatre and arts affect me so much I feel like I’m genuinely feeling love. That I’m in love with everything I see. Nobody cares at all. It’s such a strong passion, such a strong emotion, and nobody cares. Not even a little bit. If I mentioned this in conversation it would be so fleeting. It would last not even a second. It will never stick in anyone’s brain the way it did for me. Nobody will ever think of me as somebody who felt such great love. Nobody will ever think of me as somebody who passionate. Somebody who had a way he looks on the inside. Somebody who wanted nothing more than to be normal. Someone who struggled to cry. Someone who was deeply bothered by his inability to hurt. Even when he wanted to. Somebody who should’ve been a he. Someone who wasn’t delusional, but different. Someone who has been human. Someone who doesn’t know what it’s like to be free. Someone who only felt free in fleeting moments of their life they can never recreate. Someone who finds beauty in art. In suicide. In the arts of suicide. The most beautiful act. Nobody can understand. They could, but they can’t. Because nobody will ever care. I have never been human. I am a glass horse with a lame leg. I don’t have the physical blessings or merit to stand out for what I can provide better than anyone else. I am not valued like a pet or a strong horse is. They cannot tell that leg is lame because it is rotting from the inside. I cannot feel it. Less and less, I cannot walk. They kick me in the side to make me run faster, they do not care that my leg rots. One day I will lay down and pass away. My leg will probably hurt then, but only for a short time. Then it will be over. Nobody will remember they owned a glass horse. They will mourn for a while that they lost something that they think could’ve had more use, but eventually the world will move on. Nobody will think in depth about the struggle. If it hurt when I died. Nobody will know if it did or didn’t. Nobody will remember me for anything that I truly was. Nobody cared to learn. Nobody ever asked. Nobody ever remembered. Nobody spared a thought. Nobody will. It is easy to forget you have a horse until you feel like going for a ride. Maybe they will miss me when they wanted something. Probably not. Everyone will find something else to help with the things they took from me. This is my story. Nothing ever happens. I will miss me when I’m gone. 

Today. 3/16/25. Midnight"
377,"I was getting better too.

I was eating much less which means I don’t have to control myself. My sleep was even getting better. I felt slightly more conscious. I thought maybe just maybe the stress was low enough I was starting to recover. Like the addicts say it takes some time after.

I think I made a mistake by trying to not be involved in the divorce. She wanted me to be. I tried to say I shouldn’t be because it stressed me out, but obviously she doesn’t know how it feels for me and it’s unreasonable to expect her to know. She probably just thought I was being selfish and not caring about her. I just didn’t want to hinder the progress. But maybe I should’ve, since it was for her. Like I would’ve done before. But if i don’t get better I’ll still be incompetent with a bad memory and all the weak traits she hates me for. I can’t sacrifice and get better, but I can’t sacrifice enough without getting better

378,"And I’m making this entry at 11:56pm.

Just saw a video journal in r/videography…so basically a vlog except the person only showed shots of the city they live in.

Sincerely, me at 11:59pm"
379,"I was playing an escape room with [Only Friend]. It was 9pm

That is all the context. I heard loud noises, so I told him I had to be right back and went out to check. Mom was throwing things loudly and putting pads under the giant dresser. She had a little lean thing with wheels and a strap she put on it. She started barking at me when I asked what was going on. She said I should just stand there and do nothing (obviously with hatred, not because she didn’t need help) I tried to ask what I could do, but she just kept saying “what do you think” and I thought. Really hard. I couldn’t think of any way I could help with the wheeling cart, so I said we should each grab an end. She just looked at me with hatred and like I was a retard, and scoffed. Told me to stand and watch and do nothing like I always do. She couldn’t do it. She yelled at me and told me to get an Uber, sarcastically to charge it to her next time I needed something, then shut off the lights and left. I watched a lot of videos after that, but nobody ever tried to lift a dresser of an even somewhat similar size with 2 people or without a ton of equipment. Most videos were about getting them down stairs. The only similar (still smaller) dresser I found had 2 ripped Mexican men and a ton of pulleys/equipment. I think maybe we could do it if I was the one pulling up and she was the one pushing, because it’s usually the other way around. Apparently the stronger one should be the one pushing, which might explain why lifting is usually so much harder for me. I don’t know.

I know I’m worthless. I can’t even use my brain anymore. I couldn’t think of a way to help when mom was making clear it must’ve been obvious somehow. I couldn’t think of ANTHING. Nothing at all to help her with the rolling cart. I tried lifting it even slightly after she left. I could push it, but couldn’t lift it upwards even a little bit. My brain is just as weak as my body now. I know she’d be happier if I was dead and didn’t have to constantly get angry over my incompetence. She says it’s all excuses. But I really tried and I couldn’t lift it at all. I wish I could get my brain to have the motivation or discipline to work out, but I can’t even remember to take vitamins anymore. I used to be able to take them even when I was struggling with other memory, and now I can’t even do it at all. I wish I had the motivation to take my life. It would take a lot of thinking to figure out how to die with the tools I have. I don’t even have the brain power to die. Unless I found a machete or something in the garage, because I might be able to do that. I don’t know. I don’t fucking know anything. I can’t do anything. I can’t lift hundred pound couches or dressers no matter how hard I will it with my mind. I can’t remember things no matter how much I want to. I can’t feel motivation no matter how much I focus. 

I don’t want to die. But I really want to die. There’s a lot I will miss, but nobody sees value in my life. Not even her. The only ones who need me are the cats. I understand rationally that she’s taking her anger out on me because of the court ruling, but anger also reveals honesty. She sees me as worthless and a user. She values [Brother] more than me, and he isn’t a good person because he still tells things to [Father]. But it’s not about that. Value is not truly determined by how good you are. It’s how useful you are. And I am worthless. That is the end. 

03/11/25"
380,"I think I’m destined to never have a good birthday.
Any time I have something to look forward to or an event coming up, someone or something has to ruin it. To make it miserable and catastrophically stressful. Usually, it was [Father]. Recently, it was the divorce and mom’s stress. Now, today, she wants to let [Cat] die. Happy birthday to me, again. Maybe the world will get better if I never have another birthday. It almost seems like I’m cursed. Like every year I live makes everything worse. I can’t even go 5 minutes without mom coming to find me and remind me of how I’m evil for caring about my cat’s life. I understand she’s stressed out. It’s obvious. That doesn’t mean I can magically look past my misery and just let [Cat] die. What human being could? I barely even have my memories anymore, but this definitely reminds me of how [Father] used to come in every few minutes to remind me of how I’m evil or simply to yell. Of course, this usually happened on my birthday or before events too. 

Things like this make me wonder if I was ever even supposed to exist. In the first place, I was an accident. It never bothered me all that much but I sometimes wonder if it’s connected to everything that’s wrong with me. I mean, I seriously ruin everything I touch. [Mom] and [Cat] had a loving relationship. [Cat] hated me, but it was okay. I liked seeing them happy together. When she started liking me and being willing to accept love from me, everything went to shit. Mom stopped spending time with the cats, [Cat] started peeing in the house, and now she might be en route to death without anyone even trying to find the cause of the problem. I want to pay for her to go to the vet. I don’t know how much it’ll cost, and I probably can’t afford it, but I don’t think it matters. It’s the least I can do for spreading my curse onto someone else who didn’t deserve it. Realistically, I won’t make it to my 3rd year of college anyway. Even if I do, I guess it doesn’t really matter. I don’t have any other choice.

I even cursed mom, too. She’s so much angrier, more stressed out, her health is even worse than before she divorced [Father]. I think being alone with me made her vulnerable to being destroyed by me. I don’t know exactly what it is, but there’s something fundamentally wrong with me. I’ve cursed myself, too. Mom is becoming more and more like [Father] each day, and it comes in waves. Sometimes everything is fine, other days it feels no different from being back in the past. I don’t blame her, I know this is probably my fault too. Something about me is just driving her crazy. It’s more stressful than anything he ever did. 

It’s not realistic, but I don’t think it’s impossible either. I wonder if, somehow, in losing my emotions I became a sort of vacuum. Maybe everyone that’s near me gets their emotions sucked away, and the feeling drives them mad. The cats are stressed out, mom is stressed out. Luckily, I don’t have anyone else in my life to destroy, but that only means I ended up breaking the only people I truly cared about. It’s just me, mom, and my cats. Even then, I’m losing the few things I had to call my own. The few things I cared about and believed cared about me.

If I wasn’t meant to exist, I understand. From the beginning there’s always been something wrong, I’m just not smart enough to fully figure it out. I wish I knew someone who was smart enough to crack the code for me. I know it wouldn’t help, but I have a human desire to understand what’s wrong. The best thing I could do for her is to leave. Nobody will ever read this, so I’m not doing it for pity, but I can’t just cut ties and move off somewhere. I can’t be alive. My existence is what drives people mad. The problem is, she promised me she’d get rid of my cats if I was gone. Even if I died in a freak accident, she wouldn’t care for them. I don’t know what to do. It’s like there’s no options for me. Every possible route is blocked off by my own wrongness or by someone else.

I can’t even die. Even though I’m the one causing all the problems. What do I do?

It’s selfish to be thinking about myself, but I really have nobody. I can feel mom’s hatred for me growing every day, and I don’t have the capability to stop it. It really might just be natural, that I’m someone who should be hated so it will come with time. I have no friends. I can’t form a deeper relationship with anybody than that of an acquaintance who they talk to during classes to feel less like an outlier. I’m a freak. I’ve always been one, but the cover matches the contents now. What have I done to myself? I’m so fucking selfish. Maybe if I wasn’t so disappointing and was able to control myself better things wouldn’t have turned out this way. I wish I was loved. I wish I knew what love felt like. I ruined my chances at being loved out of my own selfishness. I’ve always been able to control even the strongest desires, so why couldn’t I fight this one? What the fuck is wrong with me? Now mom can’t ever love me. I’m not saying transsexualism is the root problem, but I believe it’s a catalyst. As is, I’m already unlovable. I’m cursed and broken, and I don’t bring any positives into anyone’s lives. Not even my own. Now, I’m even hard to look at. Now, I’m a shameful secret that everyone wishes they didn’t have to carry. I made everything worse with my own selfishness. If I could endure 16 years of torture, why couldn’t I just keep enduring? Why did I have to go and ruin everything? From the very beginning I’ve been primed to be able to handle it, and I still couldn’t. From the beginning, there’s always been something wrong.

 At least I can cry on my own. I’m crying right now. I thought I couldn’t cry without the presence of another person anymore. I’m still a shell of a human being, a poor imitation, but at least I can cry. People cry. Even cursed ones.

I’ve thought a lot about bees. They do everything for the majority. It would be better for the majority without me. More importantly, it would be better for the people I love without me. Maybe mom wouldn’t be so stressed out without me there. If she could love the cats even though I’ve tainted them, they would have better lives without me too. So much better. Why can’t you let me die?

I don’t want you to hear me. I know it will only piss you off if you hear me crying. You think it’s because I don’t care about you. It’s not. Nobody wants to be forced to choose. Her life for less stress. I would rather give you mine. I know it would solve the root problem, too. It’s not her fault. The best part is, I never have to watch the ones I love die if I go now. It’s a better for you, for them, and for me. But you won’t let me. Why would you get rid of them, knowing they did nothing wrong just because I die? Why won’t you let me have any peace?

There’s nothing for me. It’s an empty future. My mind is broken, and I can’t stop breaking other people. I know how you see me, too, and I get it. Everything I did was selfish. even now, I’m selfish. Every time I feel like you’ve stopped, you get angry and call me Ashley again. I hate that it hurts me so much. It’s fucking stupid. I know you put in a conscious effort, and it’s selfish to wish it didn’t have to be conscious. I’m selfish, and I’m a disease. You say patchy is siphoning your lifespan, but I know it’s really me. You were never this stressed out until you had to live with only me. Despite everything he’s done, you sound so much happier on the phone talking to [Brother]. This is the difference between a normal, albeit bad, person and one who is fundamentally diseased.  I am not good for you or anyone.

I lost the code to my own journal. I wish I still had access. I know writing down these sob stories is feminine, but it do it every now and then. It hardly matters, anyway. I’m an imitation of the real thing. Of a real person, or a man. I’m neither. You can argue forever on if viruses are alive or not. We are, but we’re not people. Not really. Normal real people don’t disease everything around them. Viruses do. They can’t help it. It’s just how they naturally are.

My back hurts. I am something even a mother can’t love. You know you don’t love me, either. It’s only a matter of time until you realize you only stay because you’re attached, and abandon me like you do to them. You say love is a series of actions, and I know it’s just because you don’t feel it for me. I appreciate everything you do. The love that you show, but I know deep down that you don’t and can’t love me, and that’s okay. It hurts. So fucking bad. But it makes sense. I was born unlovable and that’s not your fault. Nobody will ever look at me and feel love or affection like I do to them. What hope do I ever have of finding a woman who will love me if even my mom can’t? My father was a given. He’s not capable of love. But you? It hurts to know you feel nothing for me. Maybe hatred, maybe disgust, maybe attachment... but never love. It’s not possible with how I am. 

Empathy, too. You are so empathetic to others, so I know the problem isn’t you. It’s me. And now, because of me, you have no empathy for the cats either. They don’t deserve this. They didn’t associate with me by choice. You make it clear you see them as an extension of me, and because of that you see them how you see me. It’s not their fault. I wish you knew it wasn’t their fault. They’re not me. Please don’t take it out on them. 

I wonder if part of me thought that if I could make the outside less hideous, it would fix the wrong on the inside. Maybe it would. I don’t know. But the outside seems unfixable, anyway.

I think it’s just coincidental that they overlap. If the outside and inside matched I’d be male instead of disgusting and round and female. They’re not aligned at all. I just happen to be rotten both ways.

381,"I fear inconsistency for it is the only love I’ve ever known. Never fully knowing where I stood in someone’s life. But also knowing exactly my place. Understanding that I’ve only been loved for what I can bring to someone rather than for myself. And when I finally met people that loved me for me…they were never mine to keep. I wish I could find this love in something outside the platonic. I wish I could find someone who would love me this way romantically. But I suppose maybe once someone sees my soul, and all the scars that mar it, maybe it’s too difficult to see it as something to be in love with. Bc I suppose tragedy isn’t something one can make love to. And how much I crave for someone to make love to me. Yet…I don’t see it happening anytime soon. I love this boy. He’s someone I can call mine but idk for how long. He too, like so many others, was very inconsistent. And with our distance I fear that perhaps he continues to do so. What if he changes his mind and I’m left out in the dust again? Perhaps i shouldn’t have agreed to our relationship so fast. Perhaps I was too eager and eagerness blinded me from the obvious. He doesn’t love me the way I want him to.
He doesn’t want me the way I want him to.
He doesn’t desire me.
And when he looks at me, he doesn’t think, “I can’t live life without her”
Perhaps I am not art in his eyes
I do not invoke passion and sprout butterflies in his tummy and maybe I never will
And I don’t know what I’m doing anymore
Will I ever be gazed upon with loving eyes?
He didn’t want me for years and now I feel like he settled for me.
Idk what to do.
I want to disappear.
I want to hide in a field of sunflowers and make all the noise in my head go quiet so I can hear nothing but the earth and feel sun shine down on me."
382,"2025 March 16: Dear Diary,

Over the course of the whole day yesterday I took five hundred milligrams of caffeine. I would definitely say it was worth it yesterday. I was the most relaxed I have been in a while. It probably would have been impossible for me to deal with the many people I had to interact with if I did not have that much caffeine.  
  
Today, I only had one cup of coffee. Yesterday as my caffeine wore off I got a big boost of energy followed by drowsiness. As for today, I only felt drowsy. It was the perfect day to feel drowsy too. There were not a lot of people I had to interact with. I even felt better being drowsy than I normally do.  
  
Typically, I do not really like interacting with people. I feel as though I am separated from the human species a lot of the time. The times I am reminded of my own humanity are the times I am most disappointed. Caffeine really helps me deal with people, but also helps me to stay focused. Most times I am either way too over stimulated or under stimulated.  
  
Sincerely,

Now i feel headache. I wondered why. In my mind i still debated with myself whether i could control useage, i could live in my imaginary world of abundence, and i could be the superhuman.

Until of coz i had days of insomnia and hazy thinking. One of the days was very good, i watched videos at the same time as doing paper work, the distraction oblivated my ruminating thoughts and i could push through. 

But slightly after that, i was awake in the middle of the night having relieves, feeling headache but unable to stop.

Lessons:

Treat video relieves like an addictive drug. 

Dont use it unless i absolutely have to, maybe only to dull my ruminating mind when i have no other mechanisms to cope.

384,"For the past few weeks, or maybe I should say months—actually, to be precise, the past 1.5 years—I haven’t been feeling great. My life has been a constant loop: wake up, eat, study, do chores, write academic papers, prepare for specific exams, cry (an essential part of the routine), and sleep for barely 4–5 hours. This isn’t just my routine; it’s the same for almost all my friends.

It feels like we’re not just running—we’re *sprinting* toward this so-called dream of a ""well-settled, problem-free life."" But is it really worth it? And when did all of this become so important? So important that we’ve normalized seeing people break down, struggle, and exhaust themselves, as long as they’re not failing academically or career-wise?

For the past two weeks, I’ve done *nothing*—literally nothing. And now, there’s a pile of work waiting for me. But honestly? I don’t feel like I have the energy to deal with it. While scrolling through Pinterest (yes, I scroll Pinterest), I came across *The Bell Jar* by Sylvia Plath. I knew about Sylvia because of her poetry and, of course, the tragic fact that she took her own life.

In *The Bell Jar*, there’s this metaphor about a fig tree (at least, this is how I interpreted it). The protagonist looks at a tree full of purple figs, each one representing a different desire or life path. But as she struggles to choose which fig to pluck, they all over-ripen and fall to the ground, leaving her with nothing. The takeaway? You have to make a choice before it’s too late.

But here’s my question: What if she had just kept walking? What if, instead of standing there, she had stumbled upon an entire *garden* of fig trees? Maybe this sounds childish, but what if there were cartons of figs waiting for her somewhere else?

I guess what I’m trying to say is—sometimes you’re a little slower than others in making a choice. Sometimes you’re just *not ready* to choose at that exact moment. But does that mean you won’t get another chance? That you’ll never come across another opportunity? I don’t think so. I feel like it’s okay to move at your own pace, to make decisions when they feel *right*, and to think about the future when *you* are ready. It’s okay to start a little late.

At the end of the day, the important thing is to be happy with what you’re doing. Right now, though, it feels like all of us—including me—are just standing in front of that fig tree, desperately trying to grab a fig before it falls.

This is my first post—just something for daily journaling. If I messed something up, pardon me!"

Ok so pretty normal start to the today I had tution then tution . I didn't do much this day tbh lots of YouTube and sleep and a bit of work on my assignment and drawing. I've been learning to draw foreshortening I'm kinda ass rn but I'll get better. Also I sent my friend this frozen parody song called do you want to build a meth lab because we're both into breaking bad now. And I think she wants to kill me because it's a total earworm"
386,"We'd been having such a wonderful night. The lights, the balmy weather, the laughter and hand-holding. Nothing extravagant but everything pushing us towards closeness.

Then it shifted. The rush to escape. The being left alone. The inability to bridge the space again. I was thrown back to every other time someone truly saw me and turned away. When I became less, somehow. A moment that could have brought us closer opened a deep, impassable void between us.

I know there's no going back to how we were. I realise how foolish I was, to think that anyone could love me.

That's the mistake I keep making. I keep believing people when they say they love me. I think part of me wants so badly for it to be true that I cling onto the idea like a lifeline. And then I have to somehow let it go.

Maybe I just love wrong. Maybe I am all wrong.

It was so nice being your friend for a while. And it meant the world to me, to think that you loved me."
387,"I did some website testing.
I saw some news about Ukraine on TV a moment ago.
I am thinking about what  I can do to help people in difficult situations.
I feel like I’m in the dark."
388,"I had a dream, I was in the void and I got a chance to confront with myself.

I saw myself standing there, so I shout angrily 

Why I can never satisfy myself? Why I am never enough? Why you simply don’t allow me to be happy? No matter what I achieve, or not achieve, you are always mean to me. I am so mean to myself and I tell others I hate myself. Why would I like you? You were never kind to me.

And I stand there, having a shock but confuse face. “ I just trying to protect you from disappointment and hurt” She mumbled. But then silence.

Deep down I know, I know I don’t need that protection anymore.

It’s a funny dream, its my first time really confront myself as a real identity,its hard to describe that feeling, looking at yourself and just scream how abusive I have been to myself. 

I think it’s a good sign. I am confident after this my little brain understands myself better.

And then I wake up, and I lost my wisdom whisker.  I cried.

I had a whisker that I refuse to cut cuz I called it my wisdom whisker. I guess he died for this chance."
389,"Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed, and I just need to put this out there. I want to cry freely in a private space where no one will disturb me. I want to read books without wrecking my eyesight staring at screens. I crave idle time, but I barely get any.

I'm tired of oversharing just to feel okay or to prove that I'm exhausted. I'm tired of crying in front of people to make them understand. I'm tired of raising my voice to get my point across. And I'm tired of listening to my parents argue daily.

I tell myself to stop crying, but when everything builds up and explodes, it feels worse. Panic attacks hit me at the worst times, in places where I can’t control it. I just want a peaceful day where I can sit in my cozy bed, surrounded by my soft toys, with a spicy romance novel and some honey lemon green tea. I want to binge-read, hit the gym, and unwind without any interactions — just one peaceful, quiet day.

But thinking about things that feel out of reach is frustrating. I wasted my 12th grade because I buried myself in manga to escape. It worked for a while — I felt happy in that world — but it was temporary. Life kept moving, and I had to push forward no matter how bad I felt mentally.

I've realized now that oversharing doesn't always bring peace. Sharing my anxiety attacks with others doesn’t make things better. No one can fix that for me — not my friends, family, or anyone else. Some things, like learning to manage my emotions, are things I have to face alone.

I’ve cried a lot in the past, but I reached a point where I had to stop because no one seemed to care. People thought I was overreacting or seeking attention, and maybe sometimes I was... but that never brought me the comfort I was looking for. So I stopped crying as much.

Now, my new challenge is learning to stop oversharing. I don’t want to become too closed off, but I need to be mindful of what I share and with whom. Sharing should feel like lifting a weight off your shoulders, not adding one to someone else’s. And talking about mental health struggles in casual conversations rarely brings peace; it just feels like serving your weak points on a platter.

So here's my reminder to myself: Be open when necessary, but guard your peace. Some battles are ours to face alone, and that’s okay."

392,"2025 March 15: Dear Diary,

Complaining about fiction being unrealistic is stupid for the most part. I understand caring about details in a work of fiction, but people should definitely remember that a work of fiction is just that: fiction. Elements of a story are not going to be exactly one to one with reality and it is foolish to expect otherwise.  
  
If one is not able to hold immersion in a story over a random detail which does not affect the plot, that is their fault. No story is going to be perfect, regardless of how much detail and effort is put in. Stories reflect the real life biases of a writer. They can also reflect the biases of readers as well. If a reader picks up more on the plot or on random details that do not matter, that is up to the reader.   
  
I grew up on the skits Smosh did about fiction being realistic. I know for a fact that if fictional stories were realistic, they would suck. Nitpicking is such a blight on the culture of creating and it is a shame people think otherwise.

What is my favourite flavour of pie? Chocolate cream pie, I would say. I would have said Boston cream, but that is actually a cake. Pie tastes good, sadly I did not have any today. Instead, I worked today.  
  
Work has been getting a lot busier. Fridays have always been quite busy, but they have started to get even busier. There used to be almost nobody in the store two hours before closing. Now, the closing hour is just as busy as any other hour. I prefer when the store is not so busy. That is when I get to meditate and stay calm. I get angry a lot of the time when customers try to act like they make the rules. Meditating when the store is empty helps me to detach from that, but I hardly got a chance today.

399,"(T.W.: descriptions of situations and conditions that would be highly aversive to a claustrophobic)   
  
I went on a JROTC field trip to a haunted ship when I was in high school. 

The U.S.S. Lexington. 

A decommissioned aircraft carrier. 

The whole trip, the friendships and hijinks and comradery and sense of adventure, is quite possibly one of the best memories of my youth. Possibly THE happiest couple of days of my life. 

It was an overnight field trip. 

We slept where the sailors used to sleep. 

Everyone else hated the beds. Many were reluctant to sleep on them. 

""Coffins"" was the ubiquitous comparison. 

The ship had extremely low ceilings and the beds were stacked three high. Either the next bed above you, or the ceiling, was directly above your face. 

I heard that it was a pretty common occurrence for someone to forget where they were, try to sit upright, and hit their head. 

And the beds were built into the wall. So they were only open on one side. 

It was like being tucked into a little cubby.

And the sleeping quarters were dimly illuminated by a surreal red light. 

There was a great deal of complaining and reluctance about the beds, from both the cadets and chaperones. 

But I loved these beds.

They felt comforting and secure. 

Isolated and discrete but still in reassuringly close proximity to my dearest friends.   
  
I think it was the best sleep I had ever gotten.  

I took this feeling back with me, after I got home from the trip. 

My bed back home then was a futon. And I slept on it with the frame folded into couch mode. I like sleeping in a corner -- like leaning against a wall or the back of a couch. 

And back in high school and college, when I had a hard time sleeping, I would imagine myself back in one of those ""coffin beds"" on the U.S.S. Lexington. 

And gradually, that somehow evolved into a sort of...space pod scenario. 

I imagined a space faring, sci fi type society. And a means of travel between space stations or colonies. 

The most efficient means of travel -- a cozy pod.   
  
Just big enough to lay in. (Though, in space, there's little difference between laying and standing) 

But just big enough to accommodate the length of one body. And of course, a pillow and blanket would make for a comforting journey. 

One must succumb to rest because there is simply no room for tossing and turning and fussy repositioning.  

The pod is launched across space, from your point of departure, and coasts through space on unhindered momentum, until it safely docks at your destination. 

There are no controls in the pod. You cannot alter speed or direction. There is no communication this far in deep space. 

There is nothing to do but sleep. 

It is all beyond your control now. 

And it's pretty safe. 

Probably not perfectly safe. Space is big. And objects are very spaced out. Your course has been charted and the probability of colliding with debris has been calculated to be infinitesimally low. 

There is a non-zero risk of malfunction. Sure. It makes the news when it does happen. You'd be pretty fucked if the life support failed or something.   
  
But in comparison to how frequently people use this mode of transportation, stuff like that hardly ever happens. 

Besides which, stuff like that hardly ever happens. 

There is a porthole style window, near your face, which you can see stars through. Stars and vastness beyond what your mind has evolved to comprehend. 

But giving into panic in a tiny pod, this far into deep space, will surely not improve your situation any. 

There is nothing to do but sleep. 

You are hurtling towards your destination and will see your friends when you wake up. 

It is best not to overthink your present position too much.

So flee from such thoughts. 

Flee down, down, down, into sleep. 

...I am nodding off, writing this. Thinking on this has lulled me into sleep. "

404,"2025 March 13: Dear Diary,

I feel that I now understand the idea of a Catholic confessional. Although I still find the execution outdated, the overall premise makes sense. Guilt can definitely eat away at a person. If you feel guilty about something it is probably better to let someone know and take the burden away from yourself. This is probably why therapy and journaling are becoming more and more popular as religion fades away.  
  
Maybe I should be using my diary entries in a similar way. Not that I feel morally guilty about things, but more in a self improvement kind of way. Perhaps I should not say every fucked up thought I have publicly as that can easily backfire, but I can certainly express a more true version of myself. I fear if I do not do this I might end up becoming more insane than I already am.  
  
In the past I would project my mental anguish on my Instagram story. My friends would willingly be subjected to my thoughts on random bullshit like angels and demons. Sometimes I would express how awful I feel in a given moment. This was not for some attention seeking reason, truthfully I would tend to forget I even made a post in the first place. My Instagram story was just a dumping ground for my id and superego.  
  
Writing is something I need to stop procrastinating on. I have no idea if I am just a lazy jackass or if my neurodivergence has just got to a point where doing the simplest things such as writing has become a chore. It is probably somewhere in between that. I feel like I need to take caffeine pills in order to focus on writing what I want to. Of course, writing is what I want to do for a living. It would be a shame if my stories never saw themselves read by others, but then again life can be cruel like that. Regardless if I am a good writer or not or if my stories will ever be read or not, I must write. It will just be one thing to drive away the insanity.  
  
Meditating and talking with friends will also be ways to keep my insanity at bay. Mediation might also exacerbate my insanity for a while, but it will eventually make my mind stronger. Talking with friends helps me unload some of my thoughts and I find it nice to listen to my friends as well. Overall, I believe writing would be the most helpful thing to do. It is as Franz Kafka says, “A non-writing writer is a monster courting insanity.”

405,"The weather was nice today. It felt like a good day to let myself relax after doing some harder processing work in my group therapy program lately. So. I called them and feigned a migraine. It feels harmless. One day off then back to the grind tomorrow. It's not like I am physically unsafe or mentally unsound. I watched The Social Network at home for a little bit. I kinda forgot how funny that movie can be. And the cinematography is beautiful. 

So first I headed into the town center. It's so warm out. I couldn't not go outside and take advantage. I got coffee. Then I got to thinking. Im pretty witchy. I haven't been to Salem in a while. There's a certain restaurant that is award winning and has all this buzz. A hole in the wall diner type place that I've been wanting to try. So off I went. 

I am glad I went. It's one of those places that does indeed live up to the hype. The cinnamon french toast? Life changing. I called my friend. I thought I'd journal or read but I mostly just listened to music and spaced out. I walked into the center of Salem. I thought a Psychic/Author I personally am a big fan of had a store there but only today did I find out.... he does not. I had to ask him on Instagram to confirm this. But that's fine. There's always other amazing unique boutique type shops open there. 

I ended up wandering into a RPG accessory themed store and buying a beautiful handmade tiara. It was adorned with amethyst and a crescent moon centerpiece. I loved it. I walked in and out of that store more than once. On my second time going in I just couldn't resist buying it. Once I did I was ready to head home. 

We had homemade tacos. I was determined to be productive today so I sent five different inquires to different talk therapists my group therapy program found for me. One already wrote back with immediate space for telehealth sessions. So I will probably plan to follow up on that. 

My feet hurt but I can remedy that with the pedicure I have planned in the coming days. I also will buy the new sneakers I need to get around to buying. Eventually. For now I have to hop in the shower. "
406,"2025 March 12: Dear Diary,

Since Louie died both of my parents have been thinking of getting new cats. I thought that we should give it more time at first, but today as I walked into the humane society and saw some kittens I changed my mind. There are six black kittens in my town’s humane society: two female and four male, all spayed and neutered already.  
  
My parents have already seen the cats and my dad is planning on going daily for a while before adopting. Today was the first day I saw the cats and two of them were very playful with me. One of the females and one of the males seemed to take a liking to me. The male cat who was playing with me seemed the most playful. All of the cats were kind of sleepy, but he really liked playing with me. He pawed at me and nibbled my finger. My mom said it was because he was attached to me. The person overseeing the cats thought he was being naughty, but I see it as him testing me. I think he wanted to see if I would be afraid of him and walk away or if I would trust he would not hurt me. Animals are a lot smarter than people realize.  
  
I think Hecate would be a good name for a female and Merlin (or Purrlin) would be a good name for a male. Considering they are black cats I think witchy names would be cute. I have no idea what names we will go with, if we will adopt them at all (we probably will) but I think those are really good names. I miss Louie, and I think having animals around is a nice change of pace. Cats are very nice and it would be cool to have multiple cats, which is something that has not happened to me since I was in kindergarten.

Life holds inevitable suffering. The first new truth is the same as the old one. The only thing I know for certain is that I know nothing; there is a lot more to anything I see in life. As above, so below, and balancing everything is best. These are four truths that I thought of recently. Certainly there are more, but I thought four would be good to compare to the original Four Noble Truths.  
  
The last two were especially significant today on my walk through the woods with my friend Ed. When we worked together we always talked about spirituality. Since we have not worked together in a while I have not seen him for some time. Our talk in the woods today reflected a lot of the spiritual talk we have had before.  
  
I mentioned how the image of Baphomet has been coming to my mind recently. Opposites coming together is a very holy sight. Human and beast, male and female, intuition and logic, tradition and modernity, above and below. Many more opposites are represented in the image of Baphomet. This is precisely why the image of them has been coming to me recently. I have been fascinated by opposites coming together for a while now. Balance is a terrific virtue. I strive to become one with everything and dissolve my ego.

Balance and moderation solve many problems. Aristotle talked about a “golden mean” in all things. Being courageous is in the middle of being a coward and a fool, for example. I find that having most things balanced leads to an ultimate good. Ironically it is also true this moderation should also be taken in moderation.  
  
If we were to take everything in moderation, why not meth, fascism, or setting oneself on fire? Obviously these actions should not be done ever. This is why even having things be balanced should also be balanced. I have just noticed a lot of similarities in opposites. Both white and black are all colours, but white is the reflection and black is the absorption. Going back to the example of the coward and fool, both are the wrong choice. The coward is crippled with fear and takes no action while the fool takes too much action and gets into obvious danger. Someone who is courageous, however, sees the danger an action can take and works their way around it.  
  
The concept of the golden mean is something I find intriguing. Something else I find intriguing is the concept of wu wei. Wu wei, or effortless action, is achieving a goal through the path of least resistance. This path eliminates worries and lets one achieve their goals. Why care about the end result? Either something will be to the satisfaction of yourself and others or it will not. In the end good will be seen in bad and bad will be seen in good. The important thing is to balance them.

Lots of regression. Fell prey to the pull last night after finishing the entry. Went to bed around 1:30am. Woke at 8:25 but fell asleep again. Not good. Not good. 

Perhaps I ought to do 15 increments on the diary. Meaning: 15 mins for the regular entry but if by some weakness the phone is still in hand, write some more for another 15 mins. 

I also wonder if subconsciously, the trial week is causing some of this. Mmmh 🧐

My aim is to not “waste time” but rather maximize it. Removing the likes of social media, games, movies, shows should in theory help with that. Gives me back 2+ hours of the day to create my own stuff, refine my skillset. 

That said, all those also served the purpose of “turning my brain off” for a bit. Tame turbulent thoughts. Chill. 

I’m now, instead, trying to tame the thoughts with writing and to not have to rely on turning off the brain. Final turn off is for when I’m dead.

Well, not the best first two mornings of the trial. Let’s see what’s the rest of Day 2 had in store. Stay strong!

424,"It's over, the best thing that ever happened is gone. 

He was everything I needed, everything I wanted, I was everything he needed and everything he wanted. Why does it have to be this way.

I fell in love with a man I will never know past a memory and a digital screen of combined letters. My heart breaks over and over and it is said pain like this could take months even years to finally stop hurting. 

I don't regret you, I regret how we met, I don't regret loving you, imagining your lips caressing my neck, imagining hands on my naked body and licking my clit until I squirted over and over. I'd give anything just to keep your words, to keep your affection, the love you gave me our connection. I'd give anything. I don't want to loose you, this is so hard, why did you go. Our hearts crying as we typed our goodbyes to each other and still I feel the physical heart ache like a piece of me is with you forever. 

My heart, my god, my heart. I'm trying to resist the tears from falling as I don't want anyone to see me cry. Why can't you be mine, why can't you be mine. 💔 Why does this have to end. I don't know for how many nights I'll cry, but I will always love you.

You brought me back from a dead soul, you challenged me to be my better self, you loved me by pouring into me, even made love to me without touching me. 

Why, tell me why you couldn't stay? Was it torture not being able to love each other more then what we had? Will you think of me remember me everyday? Or will my memory fade away with time? This heartache so cruel, but what more could I do. I understand why you had to force me away from loving you. I understand that your daughter is the world to you. We are the same, I couldn't leave my marriage and I stay for my kids and you couldn't leave either. If things ever change Dr., Come back to me, I hope you find me, and maybe just maybe we can truly be together. 

I'll love you always

427,"2025 March 9: Dear Diary,

I need to detach a whole lot more. Fear is worthless for my life, only keeping me back from my dreams. It would be preferable for me to have no fear at all and occasionally put myself in danger than it would for me to be a coward. Hopefully as I continue to write these entries my cowardice can dissolve, even if it is little by little.  
  
On the flip side of fear is anger. Because of my cowardice I often get furious, even at the smallest things. I am aware none of it matters, but I just can’t help but get severely pissed off little things. The anger probably comes from the fear. I’m too afraid of achieving my dreams and I project it as rage on the smallest of mistakes.  
  
Even worse is that I have a very strong curiosity. What is wrong with that? I am too damn curious. I have this need to be omniscient. My desire to know everything consumes me even if I already know it is not good to know everything. Most things are better left as mysteries, but I hate surprises. I’m not sure if I like being analytical or if my mind can just never shut up. Regardless, curiosity can kill the cat, but satisfaction can not revive it if the curiosity is never satisfied.  
  
Sincerely,

429,"Dear Diary,

Fresh grad in IT here. 

Man looking for a job is so stressful. And the consistent pestering from parents to get a job quickly. 

I also fear my sense of self will be heavily tied to the income that I earn. Social pressure.

I also need to consistently upskill myself everyday practice coding etc. 

"
430,"Shockingly, in spite of the PTSD diagnosis and general cynicism I have, this still rings true for me. Days like today are why I am able to believe in that, even after the abuse and the rapes and the stalking. It started with ""have a wonderful day"" and a smiley face being written on my venti iced chai latte. Now. Does the cynical college educated professional in me know this nothing but a meaningless impersonal initiative designed to boost profits? Yes. But did I still allow it to make my day brighter? Also yes. Very much so. 

After I fueled up I was off to church. I am glad I rejoined religion. I was pretty hesitant as a bisexual and a survivor of rapes, you know, with the stereotypes about how judgmental christians can be and just stuff I hard from some people in some churches sometimes. But anyways, it's been going well... I'm a few weeks into going to bible studies and services at the same hometown church I grew up in. At 9am I get to volunteer in the church daycare. 

I get to be in the room with the youngest among us, the babies who are 24 months old or younger. They're so cute and it makes my heart so happy. Plus it's practice for the motherhood I hope to experience someday. I actually have a lot of teachers in my family. My dad is a PE teacher, my dad's cousin and her daughter both worked as teachers, and one of my dad's nephew is one too. For a time I considered being a teacher but I saw how unfortunately overworked and underpaid they are in this country, even under the best of conditions in the US, sadly, I saw that through watching my dad, so I decided motherhood and babysitting would be enough for me. 

I had a crier, a little girl who was stressed about spending time away from her family since it was only her second week ever adjusting to the church. I was able to sooth and play with her tho. I even got some smiles out of her which made me proud. She wrapped her little hand around my finger and we just walked around the childcare area, I would point stuff out to her and if I was lucky she'd laugh or at least just pick up different toys and engage them with me. After that I was off to church service, which was a good sermon and I got to sit with some of the young adult friends I made in the church, which also makes me happy obviously because like yay friends. And like I say on this little reddit blog or whatever, lacking in friends has been one of the biggest and most consistent challenges of my entire life. Just sooo ugh. Everyone who has known me a long time is like ""girl you have the most laughably absurdly bad luck about friendship. I feel bad for you too. Damn."" 

We all grabbed a bite at the food court and talked for hours. I was so nervous leading up to it. Like I always am before socializing, (hence my therapists thinking I have ""social anxiety""). But then I went, and it was so fun and chill. No one was rude to anyone, no one was shady or gossiping. And we all could commiserate over the troubles of like being a young adult and trying to figure out finances in this god forsaken economy and trying to make friends in a anti friendship post covid shutdown anti social world. I treated myself to some bacon cheese fries, buffalo tendies and a milkshake. It was really nice! Two of the guys from my church were sweet enough to give me a ride cuz everyone knows I don't have my license yet. That was nice cuz it was like bonus friendship time, plus they were grateful they had me to help them find the food court because I guess they don't come to that mall much but I do alot lololol. 

Then the day ended on a great note. Because rewind to friday I was replacing my stolen earpods but I was carrying my book and journal with me to kill time at the apple store in the mall. After I purchased my device I left in a hurry and accidentally left my items there. I didn't realize they were missing till I got back to the house. And all weekend I was so sad. I was like ""your adhd is once again ruining your life, you can't afford to replace those items right now, and that journal had personal stuff about a rape and you lost it, nice one."" But then I decided to pop into the apple store today and they had my items!!!!! I was so relieved and happy. I love that store. The customer service there has never not been amazing and my family and I have used it for literal years now. 

Now I have my journal and book safe and sound. It's a really good book too. It ties the concept of healing from a eating disorder to the moon in a very interesting, esoteric type of way. My therapist gave it to me to give me more constructive ways to spend my time (like instead of purging or whatever). Which was very sweet. And it's been a good read so far. Now I am unwinding in my cat ears with some youtube and some weed. I am going to do my intense skincare cleanse soon I think."

Quick. Good day overall. 

Unexpected but positive events throughout I’d say. Except for a bit at the end where there was a pull. Attempted to push back via exposure and mental fortitude. It would appear as though it worked as I’m still standing.

Hoping for some positive dreams. 

Not the best 48 mins of the weeklong trial. But that’s why it’s a trial, it’s not meant to be easy. The rules can be amended throughout the week as long as any amendment does not hinder the purpose. Now from memory:


*All rules are given a license for freedom as long as a social element is involved. Aka hanging out with friends. 

Rules for Sun-Sun 3/9-3/16
1. Diary rules
2. No movies/shows
3. No consuming social media unless creating
4. No multitasking
5. Make hour notes on the hour as possible
6. No games

436,"2025 March 8: Dear Diary,

Back when I believed in Jehovah, I prayed to him to get rid of my free will. Holding a deep faith in the Christian concept of Heaven and Hell, I wanted to be sure I would never slip from the path of righteousness. Considering I no longer believe Jehovah exists, I can easily say that prayer was never answered, or maybe it was.   
  
Of course the prayer was not answered in the way I expected. I expected to have my free will taken away so I could serve Jehovah in the way he liked without even thinking about it. That obviously did not happen, but what did happen was strange. Long after I abandoned my faith in Christianity I began to notice something about free will. It does not exist.  
  
People are subject to what they know. Every choice they made was already determined by their minds. Their minds made a decision based on past experiences. These experiences shape the way their minds work and they operate with this wiring. Do cats or dogs have free will? Do ants? Of course not and neither do primates. Primates, like any other animal, work the same way their minds do. 

Obviously the wiring is subject to change; that is just natural evolution. As people grow older they gain more experiences leading to more “choices” being available. You will not be able to convince your mind to choose something it is not wired to handle. Still, it is better to act as though people do have free will. A society that would allow criminals to go free because they considered it unjust to prosecute someone based on their brain wiring would not be able to stand. No, obviously criminals must still be brought to justice. Rehabilitation could rewire many of the minds brought into justice, but of course that will not work for everyone.

This discrepancy of fate and free will is just something I noticed when I became so annoyed with my own procrastination. Maybe I am just giving myself an excuse to be lazy, but I do not think that is the case. I am able to write these diary entries with ease, but I struggle to write the stories I want to. My stories would actually be valuable, unlike this challenge I forced upon myself. I am frustrated that I have continued to procrastinate on writing and editing my stories and I know with discipline I can and will write them. I am unaware of what is actually keeping me from achieving my goal, but it is something I must get to the bottom of.

Sincerely,

Torinico"

443,"2025 March 7: Dear Diary,

At 3:00 this morning I woke up from wrist pain. My wrist did not feel as fine as I previously thought. Trying to compress my wrist, I realized I needed water. Upon getting water I also felt as though I had to go to the bathroom.  
  
Walking to the bathroom filled me with so much anxiety. I questioned if I dislocated my wrist. Probably not. I wondered if I needed to go to the hospital. That would suck. My vision became blurry, which made no sense to me. My hearing also became muffled, which also made no sense. It did not seem like I even had to go to the bathroom, but then I did.   
  
After going to the bathroom I realized I really did need ice for my wrist. I walked to the kitchen and opened the freezer, pulling out a frozen piece of meat. Bringing my wrist and the meat to the counter I started getting more lightheaded and anxiety-ridden, probably from the pain. It was clear I was entering a state of delirium. My vision shut off completely for about five seconds and I grew so light headed that I dropped the meat, waking my mom up.  
  
I was able to see again and my hearing was starting to go back to normal. At least I am even more grateful for my sight and hearing, which I already was. My mom put ice in a sandwich bag and found some Tylenol. I did not feel the effects of the Tylenol, but the ice helped a lot.  
  
After going to sleep and waking up the pain became more manageable. Upon leaving work tonight it became even more manageable. I was not aware that pain in the wrist could cause one to become delirious, nor did I think it could affect hearing and sight. Maybe it was because I was lightheaded and abruptly woken up by the pain. I am just grateful it is over.  
  
Sincerely,

444,NOT MADE IN CHINA
445,"Not seeing my boyfriend due to Covid has been interesting. Things have been oddly so difficult and confusing and I’m not sure why. His behaviors don’t make sense to me and I keep thinking he isn’t interested in me as a result, but when I am with him I can tell how much he loves me. His actions when we are apart keep worrying me. I guess I would’ve thought my boyfriend would be excited to get messages from me and want to respond if he was into me, but he often doesn’t respond to my last messages or takes a long time to respond. 

He got better about it but went out of town last weekend to a big art event he was participating in. I knew he’d be busy, but I didn’t anticipate him being soooo anxious the few days leading up to the event and then crashing and burning the days afterwards. It sucked that it was my birthday on Sunday and he’d said he’d take me out when he returned on Monday only to be all quiet and strange. 

He just seems distant. It’s triggering me because he already ghosted me once for lying about his appearance and career when we met randomly online. I know this is a huge red flag, so any warning signs have me on edge big time. I’d be dumb to not be anxious. I feel like I’m rightfully nervous, but I can say I’m not usually this anxious while dating someone at all. 

I thought he was going to break up with me on Tuesday because I expressed on Monday that I couldn’t continue with the spotty communication. However, I also acknowledged that the last week was an anomaly. Still, it seemed to trigger him and then he was saying he didn’t want to hurt me and that he was concerned he couldn’t give me what I needed and that he was “barely keeping it together.” 

The problem is, I don’t know what he means by barely keeping it together. How bad is it? What’s going on in his mind? What exactly is so difficult that he feels incapable of upholding the commitments he’s made to me? I need clarity on this, and he says he’s trying to figure things out. He says he wants to be with me, but he feels unworthy because he lied to me in the first place. I know he feels really guilty for having lied and been insecure about all the things he was insecure about. I know he’s extremely anxious, but he tries to hide how anxious he is.

Monday was just really concerning because he was giving his art away to his sister‘s fiancé, putting all of his art out of his art space, putting it all in the garage to where his mom was worried about him and asking why he was doing that, and basically Withdrawing from the relationship, thinking he was inadequate and didn’t deserve happiness. He said he deserved to be empty. This is all very concerning for me.

It seems he struggles with some serious problems, which I obviously suspected given the nature of his lies. A 33-year-old man using old pictures of himself, lying about his age, lying about his career, and lying about another more private matter (pun intended). That’s not a good sign.

I don’t want to get hurt. I’m already hurting because of his withdrawal when he’s not with me. He keeps saying that when he hasn’t seen me, he keeps feeling like he doesn’t deserve to be as happy as he has been with me. If he knows he has such self-esteem issues, then he should be seeking professional help to work through it, especially if he wants to actually get better. 

I don’t expect the person I date to be perfect by any means, but I do expect them to put in the effort necessary to uphold the commitments they’ve made to me. It’s unfair to me for them to not go all out to be the best version of themselves. I want the person dating me to feel inspired to be their best self, not through mirror, verbal expression, but through action and dedication. I want him to dedicate his heart to the cause.

So I’m in a weird predicament. It’s such a dilemma. I can’t trust anything I’m thinking or feeling right now because last week was an anomaly and this week he’s got Covid and I can’t even see him. 

Oh, this reminds me. I have a deep connection with a higher deity. But I don’t feel comfortable calling the source of life and energy God. I believe that we shouldn’t gender God. I’ve always wanted to have a word to describe that deity, but I couldn’t figure it out. I called God the universe, Source, different Hindu gods, even. But today I meditated and the word Meta came up. So now I’m going to refer to God as Meta. 

I say this because I want to put my faith in Meta. I asked my boyfriend where was his faith in our relationship, but I’m such a hypocrite because I keep doubting and getting suspicious. I don’t doubt that he is the one for me. I don’t doubt that I’m basically a perfect fit for him and his family and he’s a perfect fit for me and my family. But I do doubt that things could ever work out for me because they never have. And he’s done stuff to trigger that fear.

I was adopted, and during the first five years of my life, my biological mother, who was only 13 years old when she gave birth to me, wouldn’t let me be put up for adoption. I was with the same foster family since I was just a few weeks old, and she kept fighting to get me back even though she had so many issues and was not fit to be a parent. There were so many scheduled visitations at the charity center that was responsible for my foster care. She often wouldn’t show up. I have several distinct memories of seeing her and wanting to run away. She had a tongue piercing with a little ball in the middle of her tongue that freaked me out. I remember her crouching down and saying my name and trying to gesture to me and smile at me to come give her a hug and I didn’t want to. The older I got, the more often she was a no-show. According to my parents, I would go and say to my actual mom that I didn’t think that A was coming. I didn’t even refer to her as my mother. I just referred to her by her name.

So I have a child wound where I don’t believe that the person who says they love me will show up for me. I have a child wound where I am terrified of dedicating myself fully to another person out of fear that they’re going to shift on me around the six month mark and all will be revealed. All of the lies and there are true identities, and their true lack of dedication and sincerity will appear once those initial hormones from falling in love fade away.

I am afraid of getting hurt. But more importantly, I’m afraid of being crushed by the disappointment of getting my hopes up. And so I stay hypervigilant, constantly watching for clues of that inevitable downfall. I attract flaky partners who come on me strongly, just like my biological mother did, only for them to show their disinterested in me for whatever reasons as time goes on. This is why I attract people with personality disorders or fearful avoidant or avoidant attachment issues. I really just want a stable relationship. I can be a moody person sometimes, but overall, I’m a pretty stable person. I just keep getting involved with unstable people, and that makes me unstable as a result.

So I have some decisions to make here. I should prioritize my mental health and the effects that my boyfriend’s problems have on me. I just don’t know what that means moving forward. I obviously do not want to lose this man. I don’t think I have enough data to make a decision right now. I’m basically stuck in limbo until he’s no longer sick and I can really feel out how this relationship is going to go. It’s so freaking new. There’s really nothing I can do right now, and it’s honestly driving me a little bonkers. I know that if I saw him, we could mend this issue, it’s just that we haven’t seen each other in nine days, and he’s in quarantine for Covid until Sunday night or Monday morning. It honestly just sucks.

Right now, I want to prioritize my music and art, time with my son, self-care, and taking a break from work. Speaking of, I also don’t think I am in a state to make a good decision for myself because I pushed myself too hard with work and I am experiencing extreme burnout. I think my boyfriend is also experiencing burnout from all the stuff he did last week, and us seeing each other so much was huge.

Obviously, we want to spend time with each other, but we did it at a cost. That plus pushing herself too hard with our work, wasn’t a good or healthy balance. I really don’t know how to figure this whole dating thing out if I’m honest. I think that’s part of the problem. He’s been rushing things with me and then backing off when we don’t see each other, which is confusing. When I am not with him, the self-doubt and all of his issues return, but when I am with him, he’s just so freaking excited and happy it’s adorable. And when I am with him, I’m so happy and excited, but also really anxious, and I can see he feels exactly the same way. But when I’m not with him, I feel all of his issues like a burning stake in my gut. 

The fear that he’s going to disappear and ghost me again. It’s awful. I’ve never been afraid of a partner leaving me like this except one other time when someone ghosted me. All the other people I’ve dated, with all of their problems, all of their issues, it was never a concern. 

So why am I so triggered this time? Is that my gut telling me he’s going to leave me? It’s not like my gut was telling me these other really unstable people were going to leave me. I think I’m just more emotionally invested in this person. And I feel like he’s the person for me. The last time I felt like somebody was a person for me, They lied to me about their identity and then ghosted me in a similar fashion. It ended really badly for me. I just don’t want that to happen again. I don’t think it will because he’s been really communicative when we do talk about problems. He’s just got way different energy than other people I’ve dated. And he lives close by. All the people that ghosted me or disappeared on me lived far away.

During my meditation today, I called upon Meta to guide me. What I was told is that everything is okay. That there’s nothing to worry about. That fear leads to hatred. And that I should just trust in Meta to guide me. That I am an extension of Meta. All will be well, and all is well. I just need to work on my anxiety. Whether this man that I love so deeply chooses to stay with me and accept that he has these problems and he’s still worthy of love and happiness, or he loses this battle with his self-esteem and shuts down on me entirely, I am and will be okay. I just really hope that I’m a positive influence in his life and that he chooses to be happy with me. I don’t want him to rob us both of this amazing opportunity, a love I have not felt before in my life. A love that is mirrored back to me when I look into his eyes and see how giddy and happy he is. Shinzō wo sasageyo. "
446,"Entry: 10:39am

I woke earlier from a 7:49am alarm bcz I had a potential meeting that wasn’t confirmed yet. Looked at notifications to see if it was, but saw nothing and was intending to get up anyways.

But I was beyond tired. I rested the phone down for a sec and before I knew it 2+ hours passed where I woke naturally. 

I don’t consider this wasted time as my body needed the recovery. However, the time I went to bed most definitely needs improving. 

Also, feeling a pull, so here’s some poetry to push back:

—
Minds mold the myriad of decisions made.
You can keep your eyes closed until the eruption fades.
Think of nothing, go blank and wander about. 
Fields of northern snow bring ice to the south. 
—

That helped somewhat. Something else to think about. Even still, in thought, considered another experiment that I already envision failing miserably. 

About to get up. Will play it by ear.

We then sat and smoked and jommed out for almost 3 hours. Idk why i find this so funny. I think I'm enjoying myself a bit too much. I also feel very selfish. He has a girlfriend and is 5 years younger than me.
IDK what I'm doing figured I'd let y'all know the highlight of my week tho. "

Do I ever improve on my bedtime?! Wow…let’s make this one quick. 

Began one major mission today and got to a milestone. As always, could’ve done more but steadily pacing myself. Arguably, too steady. 

I wonder what a week of ALL OUT would look like. I imagine it would differ for everyone, but for me it would mean leading a distraction free week where I don’t attempt multitasking in any capacity and only move from one task to another. Zero social activity and about an hour less sleep each day for an earlier start while avoiding burnout once the week is done. 

Goal for next week:

Do an ALL OUT trial run from Sun 3/9 - Sat 3/15.

With it being a trial run, I don’t expect the full impact but will be documenting it all per hour on the hour as much as possible to see how it’s going. 

Apart from sleep, and note taking, every moment should be geared towards getting things done, being productive, self betterment. 

Three more entries before the trial run starts so will figure out further details in those. 

Cheers!

451,"2025 March 6: Dear Diary,

I went roller-skating with my friend Vanessa tonight. It has been nine years since I’ve been to the roller-rink. Even that time nine years ago I probably was not even skating, so I had a lot of lost years of experience.  
  
2012 was the year I went there most. The place looks almost identical to when it did then. With the exception of a few new arcade machines it looked like I was stepping back into 2012, hell, 1995 probably. When I got to the counter to rent skates I knew that blades would be easier. I knew this but I still rented skates anyway because a lot of the time my emotions override my thinking.  
  
Starting out I was not very good. I fell down quite a bit and had to go to the beginner’s circle in the middle. Bringing Vanessa there with me was a bit awkward because it is clear they could skate a lot better. They did not seem to mind being in the beginner’s circle though.   
  
After a while I got two slices of pizza and a cookie. The food was exactly the same as I remembered it in 2012. I went back to skating and I made really good progress over the course of an hour. During the last ten minutes I even attempted to skate in the normal circle. I fell on my wrist. Thankfully my wrist feels a whole lot better now. The next time I go roller-skating, I am going to get blades instead of skates.  
  
Sincerely,

Had to skip Night 6 entry bcz I was beyond tired. Hung late with friends I hadn’t seen in a while, got home, and immediately knocked out. Hence the late rise.

Will have to get to the early rise next week. Rise with the sun! To do that and get apt sleep, need to be in bed by 11pm the latest. Last night was between 2-3am.

Had some vivid dreams, but now I’m not recalling. 

As for missions, 5 done yesterday. Was a very social day. ‘Twas fun! I’ve been meaning to get out more, will work that in later. 

On another note, someone replied to another day’s entry so will be replying to that with this 15 min period.

458,"Trauma responses don't dissipate just because you know they're trauma responses. They just become a part of the tapestry of you. Affinity for specific themes in writing, for example. 

Deep, affectionate, brotherly friendship can derive from shared perceptions of the world. Shared experiences. Including painful and damaging experiences. 

  
My therapist said that maybe my vengeful sense of protectiveness derives from my own childhood trauma. 

From, wanting to protect someone else the way I should have been protected as a child. 

I think the implications of that assessment are disheartening.  

The idea that love for another only comes by way of seeing the other as a proxy for one's self. 

It sounds selfish. 

But maybe I have no basis to dispute it. 

Why are Spock and Kirk such devoted friends?

Surely they would wish the best for one another, even if it would have meant that they would never have crossed paths. That they would never have bonded over shared interests. 

Each would correct the timeline for the other, setting him on a happier course if that were within his power.

Even if it meant they wouldn't have wound up being friends. 

But perhaps...

If there were a happier timeline where one of them was spared trauma. 

The other would be spared as well. 

And they'd both be entirely different people. 

Different from who they wound as up as in the darker timeline where they were both traumatized at the start. 

But they'd still both wind up as friends. As brothers.  

I think Spock very much wants to tell Kirk that he loves him.

So much it hurts. 

But the word has so much baggage. 

Especially for Spock, who is under much greater constraints than Kirk, when it comes to speaking freely. There are so many restrictions on who can say it to whom.   
  
And Spock fears so much that he may say something that could be perceived as misaligned with his loyalties and values. Which could send him spiraling, 

second-guessing himself. 

But at least he can say 

Let Me Help"
459,"Feeling better today. This has been a weird rollercoaster of emotions and confusion and miscommunication. It’s not the best start to a relationship, but at least it’s honest and real, not fake and deceptive. At least I can make a choice to love, knowing the important details that could influence me to walk away. That’s what I’ve wanted. 

I’m feeling like the cards are still stacked against me in love. It still doesn’t come as easily as I’d expect it to. Is a relationship supposed to be so much hard work? Or should it be simple? The issues we’ve had are strange ones. I’m concerned about his negligence of his sleep and mental health. He seems all over the place and pushes himself too hard at the expense of others until he crashes and burns. It’s not a sustainable way of living, but he’s aware and wants to adapt to being in a relationship for the first time in over five years, so there’s that. 

I want things to be easier. But so many outside factors keep messing with things. His art showing over the weekend started out badly with the printer guy trying to rip him off and the printer then not working and then the guy cutting all the prints poorly. His mom returned home from the funeral planning and services and has Covid. He took her to the hospital yesterday. Now he can’t visit me because he tested positive this morning. The fires in California delayed us seeing each other because he wanted to help family. 

Then of course there were the lies. Lies about his age, name spelling, having social media, weight, “size”… Followed by him ghosting me for 3+ weeks before messaging me to apologize profusely on Valentine’s Day. 

He can’t forgive himself and I can’t forget. I’m still worried and on edge about the lies. I still think he could lie to me or disappear. I’d be foolish not to, I think. But I also know he is a good person who has insecurities. I don’t think he meant any harm with the lies and didn’t expect to meet me or for me to live close by, but he continued the lies after finding out, so how can I trust he won’t lie about things today? 

A lot of semi-crazy stuff has happened since we started dating in just these two months. It’s bewildering and has me questioning what’s real and what’s not. I’d hate to think he’s a compulsive liar or discover that he is. 

I know I need to trust him for this to work out and he needs to be constant and reliable. I’m hoping with time things will settle down because I’ve never been looked at the way he looks at me. I love how kind he is to his family and how close they are. I see many amazing things about him, and I see many areas of concern. I can love all of it so long as he’s not a compulsive liar. "
460,"have a bias—I’m the daughter of an elementary school gym teacher, and he’s not just one of the best teachers I’ve ever known but also one of the best dads. Ask anyone. Seriously, ask my mom, who’s been married to him for over 40 years! Teaching always felt intuitively important and respectable to me; after all, educators shape the youth, and youth determine the future.

I’ve always admired teachers, and I try to stay in touch with those who made a big impact on me. One of them was my high school English teacher. English and history were my favorite subjects because they challenged me in the best ways and sparked my curiosity. This teacher was brilliant, sarcastic in the funniest way, and had a classroom lined with books and toys students could borrow, no questions asked. I'm sarcastic too. We're both neurodivergent. That's why our great minds think alike. Heh. 

She was the kind of teacher who went above and beyond, even paying for classroom supplies out of her own pocket (a sad reality for so many educators in the U.S., including my dad). Her class was jam packed with really captivating topics that touched psychology and history as well as literature and writing. Topics like The Salem Witch Trials and transcendentalism. 

We recently reconnected over dinner, and though she’s no longer teaching, she’s now an advocate for teachers through her union. She’s still as kind and inspiring as ever. This is the same woman who once gave me her credit card to buy specific coffee and donuts for the whole class—an angel on earth, honestly.

Life isn’t perfect, but I’m focusing on the good. After a rough patch of bad luck, things are finally looking up. I recently met a super cool waitress with amazing jewelry, and I hope to see her again. I’m officially in a relationship with someone I’m *actually* excited about (and trust me, that’s rare for me)! We’ve even booked a stay at a five-star spa resort that I’ve been dreaming about forever—hello museums, spa days, and a little romance.

Even with imperfections, I’m focusing on gratitude. Therapy has been transformative for me—almost two weeks purge-free and two months self-injury-free! Progress is happening.

So here’s to amazing teachers, exciting new chapters, and believing in good things ahead.

461,"2025 March 5: Dear Diary,

My higher self constantly tells my ego to write more. This is the overall message behind every one of my meditations. I have been too lazy for too long. Fingers need to be put to keyboard. Words that are planted in my subconscious need to be pulled into my consciousness and put onto my Google document. Writing should be my main pleasure. Writing is my ego’s purpose after all.  
  
Although, my ego is aware of the fact it does not exist. The ego is just an illusion of the higher self. That fact is crystal clear. Every person I know is the same as me, no matter if I like them or not. They are all a piece of the universe or higher self. The illusion is quite strong a lot of the time, so the ego has to be mindful and not forget it is just a small portion of the source as well.  
  
I am just a cog. A cog that needs to write no matter what. Even if my writing is hated by all people who read it. Even if I hate my own writing. Even if my writing puts me in danger I must continue to write and eventually publish my works. The universe compels me by making me go insane whenever I do not write. A writer who refuses to write will be stricken with mental illness.

463,"i feel chemically different some days. i wonder if other people can feel dysregulation in their brain because i sure can. other days, it’s mental stillness. i can feel it. 

whenever i fall into the deep end, i’ve tried to sit there and talk to myself to get myself out of that headspace. if i could describe those moments, it feels exactly like being at the bottom of a deep well. it’s uncomfortable and cold. the walls are uneven, rocky and damp. if i really wanted to, i could eventually climb my way to the top. i can see the light coming in, it’s shining on me. and i just can’t. i’m standing there and i’m just staring up at the light. i’m frozen and numb, and i can’t move. i can’t even lift an arm to try. 

that’s exactly what it feels like. i’m thinking back to the person i used to be, who i thought i i was. she was determined and mentally resilient. anxiety and depression were scared of her. she was light, silly, gentle, calm, opinionated, creative. emotional and crazy, but just the right amount lol. this stark parallel in mental status absolutely didn’t exist. 

i don’t know who that person is. and realize that i may never be that person again. it’s even worse to think about whether that that’s who i really am. that all the anguish, stress, pain, complications and harsh truths of life turned me into a broken version of myself. underneath all of this, i still feel her in there. i see her come out sometimes when i have the opportunity to just be myself and forget. 

i look at some of my old posts, my photos, and i wonder if the old me is just blissfully ignorant. life is so painful and uncertain. it’s made me such a complicated person. somewhere in the mix of things, i lost my capacity to manage challenges of life. each big stressor chipped away at my mental health. now, i avoid the smallest things to curb stress. even if it means making efforts to be social or do things that should be making me feel good. i feel mentally exhausted. stress triggers my ADHD to no end. as i get older, life gets more stressful, and there’s more on my plate. my symptoms are  out of control at times. when my brain is in chaos, i can feel my cognitive dysfunction and can only witness my dysfunction like a fly on the wall. 

yesterday i felt lighter and today i’m even lighter. i feel like my normal self. light and calm. not weepy. but i know in the back of my head this has become a familiar pattern. i keep getting pulled into the deep end when things go awry. and before you know if, i’m back in the rabbit hole. 

this time around, ive tried to become and methodical and perceptive as i can to figure out what’s happening. where is the tipping point? and why? all i can do is be as aware as possible. maybe i can catch it next time. hold it for a second, let myself feel, and let it go. 

i’m trying my best, but sometimes i just need some love, reassurance and support from the people i need it from the most. it’s fine, but i mustn’t rely on anyone. because this is not something that can always be accessible to me. it must be within me. it’s a learning lesson. maybe this is a part of the lesson i need to learn to be better.

First of these days with alarm. Needed the alarms a meeting today.

Had a crazy dream that I did not like one bit. 

Being woken up unnaturally, my eyes are extra heavy. I’m clicking keys I shouldn’t and even considering using the 15 mins diary time to get 15 of rest. 

My second annoying alarm is now going off. Eyes are becoming lighter. Here’s to a good productive day!

Pull experiment was a complete failure. Nothing more to say really. Gave it ago in morning and night, and it only served to occupy the time I am actively working to free up. 

There’s no true bread crumbing here. It’s do or do not. So, no more of that pull experiment. 

Completed 4 ish missions today. The ish *is bcz I didn’t note them beforehand as missions, but did do them and they *added to productivity in some manner, some more than others. 

I haven’t checked the previous rules I added since I’m building it as I go, but here’s a few. 

Firstly, note the overall goal is to be more productive with the 24 hours I’ve been blessed with each day. This includes getting a proper 7-8 hours sleep, time for exercise, and socializing. Simply put: waste less time.

A key part of this, starting small, is to limit phone *use before bed and immediately after waking. In tandem with that, it’s waking and getting up right away. No constant snoozing of alarms. 

In no particular order-

Rules:

No phone use in bed besides the writing of this diary. 

As soon as awoken, write diary entry then get up out of bed to begin the day. 

If there’s a pull, embrace it with a push and transform it into a physical art form right away.

I think when I was born , I came out of my mom the wrong way. I wasn’t a natural birth. I was a C-section. I wasn’t ready to come out into the real world yet only I was on that unfortunate day. The universe decided I need to fight for everything, but didn’t give me the ability to succeed.
Since I could remember, I was always aware of who I was every moment of every day felt like I was involuntarily coexisting whoever I was surrounded by.
My entire life I’ve been bored. I hate mornings, school, people who talk slow, blank walls, making art, mirrors, oranges, the smell of citrus, loving, religion, and falling asleep. 
I don’t think I’ve ever enjoyed living. Do you think possible to always function on auto pilot? I’m not suicidal, at some point I think I was. How do you explain to someone that you wished you didn’t exist more than wanting to die?
From the very beginning of my life i knew it was destined to be hard. I was born into a broken family who move through their existence struggling. It’s all I know. Work hard to hardly get by, never expect the Lord to help, but devote your life to his teachings.
Maybe if I had been born into a different family I might’ve grown up feeling worth and hopeful about my future. That makes me feel guilty. 
Daydreaming is my worst habit. In my mind, I’m living a completely different life. The relationships I have never seen genuine no friend, boyfriend, girlfriend, sister, brother, could ever say “I love you” to me and mean it from however deep their heart goes.
I think i know love and it doesn’t feel good at all. I see the beauty within the world, but it will always be out of reach. Work hard to hardly get, devote your life to God.
The only moments I remember feeling like maybe I was happy was when I’m with somebody. 
I ruined relationships by being boring, I’m always bored. I love every bit of who they are, but loving them hurts. Any reassurance given to me feels like I’m being manipulated into. I don’t know,, giving them a hand job maybe. 
I’ve never been loved. I don’t know what receiving it feels like because all I do is give and all they do is take. Work hard to hardly get, feel guilty for giving hand jobs while sitting in the chairs at church.
I think the reason that these relationships never worked was because of my maturity. I was deprived of knowing what any of it was supposed to feel like, so when their hands travel down and eyes sat on my lips, I thought this is how they love. In reality, I’ve learned boys think only of sex and that’s a sad poor way to live. I wonder if they ever sat alone feeling guilty for what they did just I always do.
if feeling regret was a competition I’d win. Obsession is my unintentional way of living. It varies from thinking my hands aren’t clean enough to my purpose on earth. 
I have to go to bed now. 
First, I’ll shower, get my bag ready for school tomorrow. But more importantly, most likely i’ll stare at my blank walls because I hate falling asleep."
470,"2025 March 4: Dear Diary,

Love and trust for oneself are perhaps the two best things a person can have. Not in a narcissistic way, but in a way one can be completely confident in oneself and believe they are deserving of love. With love and trust one can grow bigger and better than they could ever imagine.  
  
When I started to love and trust myself I was able to be better in everything I do. Occasionally doubt still creeps its ugly head, but not as often as it did before. Before I believed in my worth I was completely immobilized. I did not do anything because I thought anything I could do would be worthless at best or destructive at worst. Now I know better. I realize how powerful my own thoughts are and how mountains can move with a mustard seed’s amount of faith for myself.  
  
Just believing in my own value made it true. Currently I am manifesting my best possible self. I trust that I will remain victorious, no matter how much doubt creeps into me from time to time. Doubt is what is worthless, not faith.

Severe neck pain. Was it from sleeping wrong? The stress building up and extending into my neck?
It’s only the left side, tells me it might be related to sleeping or even compensation. A slow dull tap behind the ears that feels like a plank of wood bending under pressure before it snaps. I can feel the water swish as my head swivels too fast, sharp and hot pain uttering me to stop at whatever I was doing. A nice hearty laugh to wash away the pain is only halted by that sharpness. 

I had to take PTO off to see a physical therapist. My job is nice and flexible towards family and disability reasons. I had deadlines but was able to pass it on during my time off in the AM. Was able to send out a message the day before to my boss’s boss, the one who validates whether my position is needed in the company, informing them of my day off. Whew. Short stress relief off my chest as I worry not anymore about the chaos that will happen on my day off. My boss is frantic and seems to get everyone involved on the most mundane matters, complaining about her previous boss giving her busy work without realizing that she had passed on the buck. It was a typical morning, wake up at 6:45-7, get the kid ready for daycare and one parent does the commute and works in the office whole the other works from home. We rotate this, as my job requires physical presence Tuesday/Weds/Thurs and my partner goes into the office optionally, but it pleases her boss so, she tries to maximize that. Understandable. The day went smooth, shot a few emails out to pass on any work to colleagues with a short deadline for today. Another supervisor was reaching out to see if someone was working on it, great leader, heavy on delegation side and “wheel” management style, but its good that I was a step ahead. Quick acknowledgement of my email and my work laptop turned off for the rest of my time off. 
Started a few loads of laundry, built up over two weeks, and worked on the dishes while breaking pieces off a banana and a slice of apple to feed the tiny one. Yeah, thats two under two, not recommended for two working parents. It was a nice morning, coffee, yogurt for me, a bite for baby, more yogurt for me, coffee, back to dishes. The baby was happy. And the floor is clean, I hope, for the sake of the banana. The cats were fed, quarter can of wet food and half a scoop of dry food. More than a vet would recommend but not enough to bloat the cats. I go ahead to go through a load of laundry. Wet clothes into dryer and another load into the washer. Baby freaks out a bit, sometimes thats fine, without seeing me for a few seconds I guess panic can easily creep back. The baby is covered in bananas so I go ahead to give the baby a bath. 

Baby seems knocking out and ready for the magic trick. Some extra oatmeal/cereal into the bottle and you can see the heaviness in the eyes. Boom, she’s gone. Into the crib with the baby monitor cranked on. The morning disappeared and noon was creeping up. I wanted to throw some time into games and bring back balance to my short term stress equilibrium.

Ok. I know it doesn’t actually reduce stress long term. Just provides brief dopamine rush that lets you forget about problems for a bit. 
Is it addiction? Maybe. 
Does it feel helpful? Absolutely. 
Do I have a problem? Sometimes. Less perceived by myself, and pointed out by my spouse.

And last night our oldest child told me ""sometimes I wish you could get a divorce so I don't have to deal with them"" *pointing towards the room my spouse was in. I'm struggling to support a family of 4 on a single income. They can't get disability. Spouse is sick on top of his pain. Tried to get me to stay home to take of them and the kids but I can't. I recently received a written notice from work about my attendance. Like, I can't lose this job, so I chose to go to work. We got into a huge fight. Worst one ever. As I was leaving the wind took the storm door out of my hands and slammed into the patio. Spouse assumed I slammed the door and yelled at me about slamming the door I tried to explain it was the wind. They said something I didn't hear then threatened to call the cops about me stealing their car to go to work. (The car I drive every day is in their name.) I lost my patience and proceeded to kick the front door a few times, busting the piece of wood the door stops at by the latch and they say are you going to fix that? Yup, I will. So then I'm sitting in my car waiting for it to warm up and get a text saying I can fix the hole in the wall too and that he can't do this anymore. I say I'll find another place to live and I leave for work, about a 30-45 min commute depending on traffic. I continue to get texts saying -sorry you don't understand my lack of being able to do things, I see that your work is more important then our family, you don't need to leave I will with the kids across the country- stuff like that. Then they say they understand my need to work but then continue to say I value my job more then them. EVERYTHING I do is for the family. Never for myself. I feel like it's literally killing me. But the thought of leaving hurts more. Idk what I'll do if I have to say good bye to them. One less person in my life that understands me. One less mouth to feed. One less person to watch the kids while I work cuz I know I can't afford a daycare/sitter and person to transport the older one to and from school. I can't do it all. I need my spouse!!

I feel like I can’t catch a break, and I also underestimated the impact of everything that happened exactly a year ago. I guess I can journal about that.

It’s hard for me to separate the PTSD from current issues. I realized a few days ago that I was hit with depression or some sort of melancholy. I believe in energetic connections, so at first I thought maybe I was tapping into someone close to me and that they were depressed. It’s possible, I guess. But it wasn’t the source.

I realized on my birthday after I’ve gone out and had so much fun, that I hadn’t really processed everything that happened pretty much one year ago from that day. And then, I let that anxiety impact what’s happening to me today. I hope that I haven’t Ruined something good as a result. But to be fair, he’s doing a lot of things that are concerning to me. I feel pretty triggered as a result, so I’m unsure how to proceed.

Usually, I’m the type of person who thinks everything out and comes up with all these different alternatives and pathways one can take to find a solution. But I am unable to do that this time. Why is that? Do I simply have no solution? Have I reached a dead end? Is it a negative, or a positive?

The only things I can say for certain are that he is my person, and he is all over the place and not living a healthy lifestyle. I know that I can’t have a thriving relationship with someone who has such bad insomnia and pushes himself to the point where he can’t even string together simple sentences. He knows it too. 

From everything I’ve learned, you’re supposed to look at someone as they are and not as their potential. A lot of the things he has said to me have fallen short to where I’m concerned that I can’t trust him or depend on him. At the same time, I can see how he’s getting carried away and swept up in his feelings and doesn’t mean to hurt me. He’s still hurting me, though. He doesn’t want to hurt me, but is the only solution to not be together? No.

I really think that all we need is to restructure our level of commitment based on what we’re capable of and not what we’re getting carried away by. That’s why he’s coming over today to discuss things. 

I keep asking myself how much is my trauma from the past influencing how I feel today? Is his flakiness really as bad as I feel it is given that he ghosted me for almost a month and then came back and dedicated all this time to me, but then did this crazy art event over the weekend that was obviously too much for him to take on? I was laying in bed trying to review and process everything, but it’s a lot to process.

The only thing that made sense was to not look at the events under a microscope and dissected or pick it apart, but rather look at everything as a whole. And when I did that last night, I felt relieved and at ease, at least for a little bit. I inherently understood that we’ve only physically been together for 2 1/2 weeks and a lot has happened in those weeks that were beyond our control yet are influencing the relationship, which was already precarious. 

That’s why I can’t think of any avenues to take going forward. Because I really don’t know. I don’t have enough information to know. All I do know is that I was really excited that his mom was back in town so he wouldn’t have to be at the house to watch the dogs every night, and the art show is over with so that stress would be alleviated. so I’m very confused as to why he’s suddenly shutting down on me, but I don’t think it has to do with me. 

He seems to be going through an existential crisis, and he said as much. He says he doesn’t know what he’s doing with his life and that last week was extremely stressful for him, preparing for the art, and then he ended up driving 14 hours round-trip to do the art event. I know he’s exhausted. I just wish that he’d stop making big promises and big levels of commitment to me only to fall short. I don’t think that we would be in this situation if he was more realistic about how much energy he has to give to the relationship. But instead, he feels, and this is his wording, inadequate. He said he felt inadequate in every area of his life, and that he is not worthy of being with me. That I deserve better. Because he keeps hurting me because he can barely keep it together. 

Unfortunately, because of my trauma last year and what my ex did, and my mind I think that my current boyfriend could be deceiving me or lying to me or seeing someone else, but I know that’s not what’s happening here. I need to work on not letting that trauma influence this relationship, but it’s really difficult when he’s so bad at communicating. 

I don’t know what to do. Even in this journal, I have not offered myself any solutions. I haven’t reflected on any solutions. The only thing I have reflected on is the past, not the future, and not even the present. 

Honestly, I’m afraid. I’m terrified of losing this person in a way that I haven’t felt in a long time because almost all of the partners I chose were people who pursued me and tried to persuade me to be with them. It didn’t come from myself. It was external, therefore it was in a way easier to lose them. The hardest part of losing them was losing the routine and reflecting on all of the ways in which I was mistreated and allowed myself to get mistreated. This time, the thought of losing the person who feels like they are the right person for me makes me feel like I am going to have an existential crisis. I am scared to meet him today. I hope we can resolve everything because this time last week he was talking about moving in. It’s just too big of a shift week to week. I really need consistency, and he knows it, so if he can’t provide it to me, do I have to walk away? It’s the last thing I want to do."
476,"Entry: 9:48am 3/4

I woke at 9:47am, 20 mins later than my prediction. Not bad.

Eyes still heavy, natural. Not really feeling like getting up. Could use another hour or two but won’t do that. Feeling it. It’s light, but feeling that “pull” to lounge. Yep, let’s call it the pull. 

It’s been about 3 months now since I stopped biting my nails. It took some time and effort. Not the first time trying. There was lots of fidgeting with the nails, the occasional placing it at the mouth but just not biting. Still do that at times today. Note, it’s mostly at the times when usually bite such as when nervous. 

Don’t wish to go back to that bad habit. I like my long, healthy nails. I wonder, for this next bad habit, the pull, if I should do a similar familiar-ish thing but controlled. I hesitate to do so because just how much control will there be? 

Perhaps a rise and shine, so as to not be lounging then while doing daily activities allow a light level of the pull before pushing back intentionally. Won’t yet make that a rule. Will test it today, then report back in the night.

We get the idea with the time. Yet another late stroll to bed. Could have half hour ago but chose to watch one more ep of a show on laptop not phone. Then played on last round of a game on phone, then now bed. 

Before that, could have stopped the show closer to 12:30am when I finished with the work I was doing but the show intrigued and naturally, as always with shows, wanted to see what happened next. 

I anticipate a 9:27am rise. Let’s see how close I get to that and how icy more productive I can be. Today, I got 4 “missions” done. Yeah, I’ll call them missions from here on. Could have done far more if 3 less episodes were watched. 

Looking at my average screen time: Sunday 13h 56m, Yesterday 7h 47m…not exactly sure why Sunday was so high. I suppose I may have watched shows from it during downtime. The good news is the phone use wasn’t just before or after waking but being still in bed. That’s what needs to be eliminated. Aside from this diary for now. 

Last week’s screen time was 10h 54m which is a little better. After implementing this new habit into lifestyle, I suppose the next will be to reduce the intake of even shows. Baby steps. This immediately shaves off 1-2 hours of doing nothing per day so that’s a good start. 

Since this is just a diary for quick thoughts and not full essays, I’m now implementing a 15 minute cap on future entries. 

God made the world in 6 days, I’ll aim for 6 missions tomorrow.

To productivity and beyond!

478,"ugh, god, i get attached to people so easily.  it's an isolation thing.  if there were 'plenty of fish' around me i don't think i'd be like this.  as it is, i'm constantly scraping the bottom of the barrel and starving, so when i get a taste, it's hard to let it go.  when i can't, i come off really creepy because of the things i try to say or do to keep things going when they're clearly over.  

i find it's been helpful to start realizing all the ways the person i attach myself to is actually a loser and getting dropped by them was perfect timing so i can find something that actually works out and not waste any more time or effort.  looking back, i think i got what i wanted.  i got a good look at some of the things men do without getting too into it.  i have *so* little experience with relationships that every little bit is a revelation.  also none of it was physical because that's really complicated for me.  i'm glad it never went there.

anyway he's a dog, a terrible fit and i don't even know why i wanted him so bad or how i got that attached.  again, learning on the job here.  tbh, he probably wasn't even the source of my recent misery.  there are other people doing that.  

i've also come to realize that looking for men is a numbers game.  you have to be in the same area as men on a regular basis, over the medium to long term for things to get interesting.  they have to notice you around.  also, you can just approach man after man until one of them is okay with you.  the volume of rejection doesn't mean much to me when they're just strangers.  also, nobody knows wtf they're talking about online.  there's no tips or hacks or universals, you just keep going until you find one and don't get hung up on all the superficial rejection.  also, this means you've got to be open too, and try guys you may not have initially been drawn to if it feels like there's something there.  just be cool, people respond to it.  i think that's about it for the things i've learned and i hope i'm over this shit for real.

i got to talk to a friend at school today to bitch and moan about clinical and it really made me feel better.  i need to reconnect with some friends, i've been distant.  did pretty good in simulation lab today, instructor said we should all be proud and i sort of am.  after the comprehensive exam in may, we've basically graduated, which is crazy.  i almost know what i'm doing.  all of this has done me a lot of good, and i should remember the *actual* sources of the negativity in my life.  because they're not school or even clinical or some old loser who missed out big time.

479,"2025 March 3: Dear Diary,

I watched a video today discussing the fundamental differences between the left-wing and the right-wing. The left-wing loves progression and moving forward while the right-wing loves tradition and staying put. The right-wing believes nature is more fundamental than nurture when it comes to the way people act, while the left-wing believes the opposite. The right-wing props up authority figures to worship while the left-wing does not. The left-wing likes to listen to facts that experts discuss, while the right-wing goes off of their own beliefs.  
  
Obviously both nature and nurture shape society, but of course nurture plays a more important role. While nurture accounts for the way people act, that nurture could not exist without nature. A person’s nature shapes the way they nurture others, but the way people are nurtured is what is most important.   
  
In the same way nature and nurture play a role in society, tradition and progress act in the same way. Progress is usually more important than tradition. Of course this is not always the case, but progress tends to be what is destined while tradition is only kept by force. Traditions have their place and if people want to live by them that is perfectly fine, but forcing tradition on the rest of society is where the line should be drawn.  
  
Progress can also be problematic if it is forced. Sometimes it is necessary to force progress, like when slavery or segregation was ended. Sometimes progress can be good for some people, but not everyone will want to move forward as fast as society makes them. An example I can think of is how less creative the internet is now than it was ten to fifteen years ago.  
  
Personally, I love facts and it is true that societies based on empathy are more prosperous. Both being empathetic and self-sustaining have their place, but being too altruistic or selfish can be detrimental. Having more empathy is better of course. It helps you relate to more people. Seeing new things from different perspectives can make a huge difference.  
  
Sincerely,

481,"It is the Holy month of Ramadan. One month of fasting for Muslims across the globe, with family, friends and lots of love. Usually, it's meant to be a happy occasion, one that brings people together. It's regretful for me to say that it breaks my heart that I can't participate in Ramadan as I'd like. One of the most horrible things about being sick is that trying your best becomes so much harder. It becomes impossible. Now, I feel like it's pretty unsafe for me to fast. 

Being sick is not easy. I've been sick for seemingly ages. No one will see the severity of how bad things can be for me and that's okay. God is watching. I always wondered why I was chosen to be a host for all these sicknesses. Sicknesses with no definition in medicine or relevance for anyone around me. It's unfavourable being dismissed by each and every doctor, every teacher too. 

Everyone around me boils it down to anxiety or depression or both. Maybe it is depression. But deep in my heart, I know something isn't right. And I just can't accept anxiety as an answer for all of my sicknesses which take over my life and haunt me. My symptoms aren't something that mildly impact me sometimes, they're legitimately debilitating and living with so many various sicknesses that no one investigates is tough. I can't get people to validate my sicknesses and that's okay. Some people do, and they know who they are and acknowledge how much it means to me that they treat my problems as being real. 

I guess its understandable; the NHS is collapsing as we know it, and unless I have cancer, my problems won't exactly be investigated properly. Heck, even if I did have cancer, they won't find it until last stage. Fighting with doctors to recognise the extent of my debillitating health is a fight no sick person should have. I don't have the mental capacity nor the physical capacity to fight anyone about this. I just want to live a normal life. I want to make and eat foods I can enjoy and do activities i can enjoy and live without being in so much pain all the time. It's annoying that daily pleasures to some are agonising for me. People call me depressed but how can I not be when the things I should look forward to have become painful or just outright impossible for me? 

  
I'm in the midst of trying to fight for getting help. It has been years of this, and no medical professional has helped me. To say that I'm losing trust is an understatement; I have lost all hope that they could diagnose me. But, I need closure. I need to feel like I'm not going crazy for my symptoms and that it isn't depression. Because even if I did, this is NOT depression. Depression won't give me closure.

482,"As my college life is coming to an end, there’s something I’ve kept to myself for the past four years. I just want to put it out there, not as a confession, but as something I’ve always felt.

I first saw her outside the dining hall in our first year when a friend introduced us. And from that moment, I never forgot her. Not because of any big reason—just because of who she is. She’s beautiful, yes, but more than that, there’s something about her presence that stayed with me. The way she spoke, the way she carried herself—she had this charm that was just different.

I never spoke much to her, never tried to turn this admiration into anything more. It was never about love or expectations. It was just a feeling—a quiet appreciation for someone who unknowingly became a small but special part of my college life.

She may never know, and that’s okay. But before this chapter of life closes, I just wanted to say—some people leave a mark on us without even trying, and that, in itself, is something beautiful."

494,"2025 March 3: Dear Diary,

Recovering from misanthropy is not easy. Desperately I want to love humanity. I want to only see the good in people while just occasionally glancing at the bad. That is my test of course: to let the bad be bad and celebrate the good above all. Spouts of frustration bring me back into my misanthropic haze over and over, I just want it to stop.  
  
In a world filled with sexual assault, rape, racism, sexism, ableism, queerphobia, non-consensual circumcisions, pedophilia, fascism, religious extremism, hyper-capitalism, people being made to feel awful about their natural bodies to the point of plastic surgery, and just plain old human stupidity it is very difficult to not be frustrated. It is especially hard to not be frustrated when the media constantly reminds you of how awful the world can be. “If it bleeds, it leads” after all. 

Social media in particular has just become filled with rage bait. I should really stop using Instagram, but my dopamine addicted brain can’t get enough. Sometimes I learn cool stuff, but most times I just get angry. I have to decide if the cool things I learn are worth it if I get angry more often. I used to decide yes, but I think I am changing my mind.

I just want to read, write, meditate, and hang out with my friends. Learning stuff is cool too, but I just need to take action. I am aware of this, yet I still can’t help myself from needing to learn more stuff. Most of the stuff I learn comes from video essays on YouTube, but I also like learning stuff that comes in bite-sized information as well such as YouTube shorts or Instagram reels. The algorithm would rather keep me angry. I never engage in rage bait, yet I am constantly shown stuff intended to make people angry.

I feel a little more at peace writing this entry at least. It has been helpful, even therapeutic maybe. Writing is what I should consider most important. All the terrible things happening in the world are going to happen whether I like it or not. Instead of focusing on the terrible things happening I need to be the good I want to see. Pessimism is a killer, but optimism is a saviour. I still have some remaining faith left in humanity. I want to cultivate said faith into something productive at least.

Sincerely,

Torinico"

From now on, I’m just gonna chill out ✨ accept things as they are, and be appreciative of what I have. This stings a little because I have expectations, but if I’ve learned anything from past relationships, it’s that my expectations and what I think is going on mean nothing. Sometimes, you never know what’s going on in someone else’s head, and it’s better not to make up shit… just look at their behavior and words and take them as they are.

Anyway, I’ve been talking with my partner, and of course, he wants kids, but it’s not really the optimal time for us. I totally get it, we don’t even live together, we’re not married, and there’s just a whole bunch of stuff to figure out. But we’ve been dating for almost four years, we’re almost 30, and I thought by now I’d have my life together.

I own a house, which is a huge privilege, and I’m thankful that the universe gave me the opportunity to afford it. But I also had help with the down payment from my brother. Even though I paid him back in full and even let him live here rent-free for a few months he still lives with me part-time. My partner doesn’t want to move in until my brother moves out, and it’s hard for me to ask my brother to leave because he’s only here part-time. On top of that, I can’t just have him move back in with my mom because that’s a whole shitshow in itself.

I just don’t know what to do. I feel guilty about kicking my brother out because it’s going to throw my family into chaos, but I also want my boyfriend to move in. He doesn’t want to live here while my brother is still around, and every time I try to explain the situation, he just doesn’t seem to get it. I can’t figure out how to read him. I know he probably wants me to grow a backbone and tell my brother to leave because, at the end of the day, my brother is a grown man.

501,"It’s 10 PM, almost 11 now, and I was about to go sleep when my brain decided to remind me of past events lol. This time, its of the false school shooting scare from last year. I don't remember exactly when, but it was around mid-late November 2024, probably (maybe earlier than that I just know it wasn't in December)? Whatever the date was I found myself scrolling through search results about mass shootings, and I'm remembering more now



I was in biology class when it happened. The one class where I have no friends, yet somehow end up in the most group assignments. I was on one of those awful stools, trying to focus, when the announcement came over the speakers. There was a threat on school grounds ; this wasn’t a drill. They might be armed. Teachers were ordered to lock their doors, turn off the lights, and we had to get under our desks.



It felt real, but not real enough to panic. At least I didn’t. My heart sped up, I got a little shaky, my hands got cold and clammy in a way I’d never felt before, but I don't think I felt as scared as I should've been. I sat right at the front of the class, desk practically on display. If someone burst in, I thought of how I’d be the first one down. But that thought irritated me more than scared me. Like, of course this would happen. Of course, this is how I’d go. It felt inconvenient and planned just to ruin my life specifically. (Jesus, I'm realizing how self-absorbed I am as a I write this now LMFAO. I know the world doesn't revolve around me, but that's how it felt at the time..)



I remember thinking, 'They want me dead, don’t they? Sick bastards.' And then for some reason I got mad at my teacher. 'Whore. Selfish. Always hated me.' I was so pissed at everyone else there and Idek why.



I pulled out my phone, thought about texting my mom, my dad, maybe even my brother. Something sentimental. ""I love you."" Maybe ""I’m sorry."" The kind of thing people do when they think they might not make it. But then I didn’t. Instead...for some reason I still don’t understand and am kind of embarrassed about...I ended up looking at Rule 34 art, fictional porn of something I didn’t even find remotely attractive ; it was more ridiculous



We were stuck in that room for a little over an hour before they told us it was a false report, and there was no real danger (well there rlly was some guy there but he wasn't a THREAT.) The lights came back on, the doors unlocked, and we just moved on. I saw some kids get picked up early right after but everything else just went on the same. I met up with my friends, and we talked about it. ""Man that was crazy. I was so scared, hahaha."" But it didn’t feel real then either.



I wondered for a while if something was wrong with me for not caring about something like that more. I'm an American now, it is a HUGE DEAL HERE1! But I really don't think ANYONE cared that much because there's so many false alarms here. Not for shooting stuff. This one was definitely more intense. But fire alarms are pulled aaalll the time. So often that teachers don’t even react anymore. If one goes off, they just sigh and say, ""Eh, wait it out"" and continue tha lesson. I'm a freshman and I'm already SO used to it. I can't even imagine how teachers feel :\^P



My parents were worried because the school sent out some email about it, and they checked in on me, but after that they got over it and things were good. I'm thankful for that"
502,"2025 March 1: Dear Diary,

My life always goes better when I do not follow my basic human instincts. The instincts that kept our primitive ancestors alive hundreds of thousands of years ago are not what keep us alive today. People can be way too fast to react and I fear this is getting worse. Nuance is dying and misinformation is booming.  
  
This is the exact concoction needed for fascism to rise, which is precisely what is happening. A need for self importance is ever present and it is clear to see. Being corrected is considered an insult to the ego instead of help one could need. Entire groups are prejudged for the actions of a few. This is not something new, but it is getting worse.  
  
Fascism is only successful because of the instincts we evolved. Our chimpanzee brains like things to be simple and not require thinking. Taking a step back to detach from a situation could lead to an undesired outcome, so that step is not taken. Mindsets like this are what lead to people grouping together against a “common enemy.” This “common enemy” is typically some minority group which has nothing to do with anything. In the 1930s in Germany it was the Jews, today it is the LGBTQ community. 

Hatred is not natural, but is manufactured laziness. Media organizations want to drive attention from the oligarchs running the mega corporations and want to pin the common person against each other. Racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia are all born out of human laziness and stupidity. It is a distraction from those in power who are really hurting society. Resisting the oligarchs requires us to deny our basic human impulses and detach from situations. It is not an easy thing to do, but it keeps us in tune with our divine future rather than our simian past.

508,"2025 February 28: Dear Diary,

I have three stim toys. I got them back in the summer off of Etsy. They cost forty dollars in total, but I feel they were well worth the price. Alex showed me where to get them all and I am very thankful they did. They help me to focus better and I really need to start using them more often. I feel they are most useful while reading.

The one I used today is called an “infinity cube,” I reckon. At work I was able to just let it flow in my hand for most of the day. My friends have been noticing my use of them throughout the day. I let them all hold it for a little while to see how they like using it.

Stim toys are great and I am glad it is more acceptable to use them in public. I hardly ever get strange looks when using them. Most people are just fascinated that I have something different. Different should never mean bad. If people accepted the differences of others more often, I feel the world would be a lot better.

Sincerely,

Torinico"

Ok I woke up in the morning and went to band practice then o came home stuffed pretty much the whole day except a 1 hour break to do a debate with some friy. It was interesting but the nothing to special about the day
"
511,"Tbh… These past 3 years were some of the most worst years of my life. The middle school that I am at rn makes me just wanna end it all (not literally, but yk what I mean.) 

6th grade was just kinda tame for the most part. Just the kids who kinda pissed me off sometimes. Like I sometimes wished I could leave em all in a locker room to shut them up! (Not literally, but yk what I mean…) but over all… the teachers were pretty mid-ish expect for my band teacher. (I’ll talk about him in another reddit post)

7th grade… It was uhh… It was fine ig… I don’t remember much, but I know that my band teacher left which kinda left me very upset that year. Overall… the school year was alright. Not good, but also not bad 

8th grade…… Current year; It’s been hell… Like at the moment that i’m writing this i’ve been stressing and figuring out how to plan stuff out! cause track has been working me out so so so much! and these tests! But i’m trying to push through and make sure to finally leave this horrible school and finally go to my dream high school!!! (Which did get accepted to!)

I didn’t expect to right this much, lol! But if some did read it. Tysm 😔🙏…… 
"
512,"They don’t love you like I love you 🎶 it’s sad how much music has been lost and is going to be lost due to time. There’s no way to catalogue everything but I’m really happy with curating what I’ve done for my everyday playlist this time around. With exception of a few drill songs interspersed I feel like the flow of the playlist is on the same page finally. 
Drill brings back such bad thoughts but it resonates in a part of my being just like any other depressing or joyous song does. Musics ability to elicit emotions hasn’t really been matched so consistently for me in any other medium. It’s right up there with being able to make me get teary eyed over seeing a parent’s sacrifice for their children or overwhelming joy. 
Thinking of overwhelming joy makes me think of overwhelming sadness I’m not sure which tears hurt more but having to think of the sadness being caused by unfairness upsets me greatly. Like the last time I cried like that was because of a video of a disabled woman in a wheelchair in the rain. Her tearful wailing explanation to the officer that she was trying to get a ride on the bus to go to her drs appt but the bus drove right by her.. I still see it terrible. 
It’s odd what will and won’t get emotions out of someone. I’ve seen people shot, maimed, die, and had the opportunity to work on some of em not a tear just a determination to do what needs to be done. As great as it was to work in that field it burns you until the things you thought that made you is disfigured and your left thinking differently. But you know what there are different ways to help people in the world. It’s different but hell of a lot easier and the stakes aren’t so high. Like my playlist I can’t imagine not listening to certain genres whether it brings bad or good emotions. These feelings bring me back down to who I am. "

514,"Dear diary,

This universe is a massive and mostly internally consistent simulation. Mostly. 

But there *are* cheat codes. 

I feel lighter today than I have in a long time. I slept better and deeper than I have in forever. 

Because, I sent all of my irrational guilt and undeserved suffering (auto-generated by my glitched out OCD-brain and previously taking up a huge amount of space on my hard drive) to someone more deserving. 

Good to have a proper receptacle for it. 

I think I will have a productive day today. "
515,"At 38, I still feel lost. I’m working hard and constantly fighting—whether it’s for my relationship, my life, my job, or my health. Being a single mom is truly challenging. No savings, unable to secure a relationship, delayed promotion, far away from my family (working abroad), and always sick. Ughhh!!

I'm feeling really down and lost right now. I don’t know what to do or where my life is headed—I feel like I have no direction or future. I’m still holding on to the hope that things might work out with my ex, even though deep down, I know I shouldn’t. My eczema is flaring up again, and the rashes are everywhere, making me so uncomfortable.

My mom didn’t even greet me on my birthday. I appreciate that my ex treated me, but the very next day, he was back to his usual grumpy self. It’s exhausting dealing with people. Sometimes, I wonder if anyone would even care or how they would react if I were gone. 

I’m grateful that my parents are helping with my daughter’s needs, and asking for help for myself feels selfish. But honestly, I don’t know who else to turn to. I need medication for these rashes, but it seems like they don’t see it as a serious issue.

If I’m being honest, I felt more hurt than annoyed when they chose to buy all that food for my birthday (im not even there)—knowing it was mostly for them to enjoy. I wish they had just helped me get my creams instead because these rashes are unbearably itchy. But in the end, it doesn’t really matter. It feels like the dinner was more for them than for me.

I understand their intentions in buying food for my birthday, even though I’m far away and not there. I just wish they had helped me with my medication instead, since I already mentioned about it and asked for help. 

Through all my struggles, I never asked my family for help. I’m mentally exhausted and feel alone. Going home isn’t an option since I still need to support my daughter. She’s in university now, and I’m happy she’s doing well in school—just three more years until she graduates. I’ve never received any financial support from her dad, which, unfortunately, was expected.

Im TIRED!! 😔

The time is now 1:41am 2/28…I’ll make note of the time at the start of writing, then again at sign off. If I go back to my phone for any reason after sign off, I’ll go back to the post and edit to reflect that. I trust my self to be truthful in that regard. 

If successful long term, then this will help tremendously with other goals. Small steps. Not the first attempt at a productivity change, so hoping to make greater efforts in making this one work. Can dive deeper into why the others fell through. For now, I need to get off the phone and go to sleep.

517,"2025 February 27: Dear Diary,

Today I watched a YouTube reel talking about the Block Universe Theory. Apparently it is supported by Einstein’s theory of relativity which states that all parts of time exist at the same moment. Whether it is the past, present, or future every moment exists at the same time. The Big Bang and the heat death of the universe already exist and are on the opposite sides of the block.  
  
I am a huge believer in fate. To me this just shows how everything in life has been determined and nothing actually matters. I do not say this in a pessimistic way, but rather an optimistic way. Nothing matters. Every time I lay awake at night because I thought I said something wrong does not matter one bit. Every kind act I committed likewise does not matter. The only thing that matters is how I feel about these actions.  
  
If I were to judge myself to the fullest extent I would say that I am doing decent. I used to believe I was the worst in the world, but now I am giving myself more credit. Everything that has happened in my life, whether good or bad, had to happen because it was already predetermined by the universe. Everything good that happened was to show me the goodness of the world. Everything bad that happened was to show me a lesson. Despite not liking everything that has happened to me, I am grateful for my life.

Also going to try my hand in making Lugaw so I can finally get rid of this shitty frozen chicken breast. Sucks that it’s a shorter weekend but after being off for a week I’m not complaining. 

Weirdly church has crossed my mind… how unpleasant 

Written on enthusiasm on 2/27/25"
519,"Dear Diary, 

I have a few things that I'd like to write about. 

Including, details of a series of events that I recently processed in therapy. Whereupon when I was 13 or 14 years old my mom slapped my dad in the face, attempted to barge into his house to attack my dad's new girlfriend (he and my mom were divorced), in response to which my dad cold-cocked my mom in the face.  
  
And when my mom came to, she jumped back into her car and attempted to run my dad over. With me in the passenger seat next to her.  

This was a stressful series of events. And it was not my fault. So my therapist tells me. I will tell you about this when I have more energy. 

As for the moment, I am a bit low on energy. As, I am doing austerities and directing energy towards a specific spiritual intention, which I intend to cast tomorrow. So, I am in a sleepy and almost drunken haze.

A while after my parents' divorce, my mom made a poppet of my dad. She made it out of one of his old socks. She put pins in the head and in the crotch. Shortly there after, he got prostate cancer and then got two traumatic brain injuries.   
  
Old sock is an excellent taglock. 

Spiritually/energetically, I now have some advantages that are normally only attained by those who are already on the other side of the veil. 

I was presumed dead. I was mourned in earnest. I even had a funeral. Symbolically/energetically, I am resurrected. 

I did not intend to engender such an outcome. And it was obtained through the infliction of significant and undue suffering. 

And it is correct and reciprocal that I should employ the advantages thusly gotten, for the benefit of those whose suffering it was obtained by way of. 

But, if I'm honest. Even if I hadn't incurred this energetic debt, I'd enthusiastically carryout tomorrow's upcoming activity in any case. As, I am doing so on behalf of some very treasured friends. And it is justice well-deserved. 

And I am greatly eager to bring justice to anyone who has stolen even an ounce of joy from dear friends who richly deserve an immeasurable abundance of happiness.   

I don't have an old sock. 

I wish that I could confirm the coordinatesjp I surely can't bring myself to ask the question though for fear of inflicting more pain. 

But. I think I do have enough for a sufficient taglock. 

And, I have the baneful herbs, the blank poppet, pins, and other associated accoutrements. Ready to go for tomorrow. 

And due to my OCD, I have undergone great and undue mental torment, including soul crushing and unjustified guilt. But I can count all of that as an involuntary preemptive karmic investment, that I now intend to cash in on. 

And I am grateful to be able to say that Sigyn and Loki have agreed to gift me a jar of venom, collected from the snake that drips on Loki -- for me to use in tomorrow's goings-on. Too perfect, too perfect. 

I need to sleep now."

Wednesday! My day off- I got to pick up Charlotte today from school. We went home and did her mini boba tea craft set and then jammed out to Taylor Swift “Shake It Off” on repeat. 
She was singing on her microphone with her speaker out on the front porch while I backed the car out of the driveway. She’s so cute.
He gets home and is getting ready for Charlotte’s parent/teacher conference at 5.  

It was sincerely an incredible joy and honor to hear Ms. Perri talk about Charlotte like that: Very helpful, wanting to do well, listens and empathizes, great sense of humor, sensitive, loves her “school store”. 
Ms. Perri is hands down the best kindergarten teacher you could ever ask for- you’ve seen the pictures?… how fun and important. I guess it took a while for Charlotte to bounce back after her tonsillectomy. Teacher said that she stayed close by her for comfort and she let other kids know “that Charlotte ready needs her right now and you will get a turn”. How interesting. I don’t remember much from my kindergarten. 
Anyway, great- we get home and I suggest we warm up the pot roast I made on Monday. First he says “yeah, and did you eat the enchiladas? (They’re fajitas that He Made) and yeah, I did because they were on their last day. He says “good” like I did just what he thought I should do. He offers to heat us up a couple bowls…. Obviously, yes- what? He heats up a couple bowls. 
I ate my dinner while sitting on the couch next to Charlotte in her high chair & watched Bluey. Afterwards… I gave her a bath and helped get her ready for bed. I blow dry her hair and read to her while he’s on his phone. 
Lights out and she falls asleep right away while laying close to me and Peetie is laying his head on her belly. He was at her feet and she said she felt him lick her feet through the blanket lol. He loves. I pointed it out to Phil. Downstairs I made us some
Fresh popped popcorn with the Irish cream butter (it’s simply THE best). I pour him and I a bowl each. He’s playing video games because ofcourse he is. I turn on the tv and fold/hang my laundry. 
We watch a couple new shows because we are caught up in Succession. Each show mentions marriage/divorce/relationships lol. 
Anyway, do you remember when he told me to “Gut The Place” if I want? So I tell him tonight that my therapist bill is almost $800 so I really need to figure shit out. He didn’t care… so I say that I posted our dining room table and chairs for sale. Just an FYI.
Well, he then tells me that I shouldn’t do that since we are in negotiations right now. I said, “no, we’re not. We ARE getting a divorce. What does the table and chairs even matter? I’m the one who makes the meals for our families there… I bought it- I measured for it then I found it second hand in great condition and a fantastic price- my brother helped me load it. I decorated it and I fed the people that sat there. The end. 

It’s just wild to me how fuckin stupid he is. I can’t help him. He’s an absolute dumbass. Never met anyone so fuckin short-sighted and self-serving and SAD. Legit sad because I’m a damn good wife, good friend, good mom, good cook, good baker and a team player. How the fuck did this fuckin scumbag get here? I should’ve known. An absolute parasite kind of person. For $200 and he already said we would have to sell the house??? I acknowledged that but I have to do what’s best for me and Charlotte. He scoffed at me and asked me what I’m going to do without any support. I will figure it out. I’ve done it before. Unfortunately I’m not sure I can get on state insurance. I think I make too much. Which is absolutely bonkers to me and orange drink wants to rip away that funding too. 

I just cannot understand how this is the guy I married? True colors now. He works out everyday for his next victim. Meanwhile I’m gaining weight. My therapist said that’s exactly what happens under a lot of stress and added hormones.
Before I left she reminded me that he has shown me who he is and that I need to let go of what doesn’t benefit me and focus more on me. She was impressed by all the baking over the weekend as opposed to drinking or smoking. 
This guy is so low bar. We took it as far as we could go and he’s concerned about my 200 table and chairs? 😓 
For the therapist I turned to because of him driving me mad behind the scenes? To make up for the cheapest, worst health insurance policy because he doesn’t use it? So now my deductible is $5,000!? That’s how little he thinks of me and I did voice my concern which he ultimately shut down because he is paying for it and money money moron money. Gtfoh. 
He saw my story today but mentioned  nothing. It was playing a song, The Feminine Urge at the part where she sings:

Do you feel like a man when I can't talk back?
Do you want me, or do you want control?
Failure to commit to the role, I admit
Was a failure you achieved on your own
Do you want me to care when you just disappear?
I can't win them all
"
522,"Its around 5, my fiancée fell asleep in my arms after a hard day of work, for him.
I had a good sleep. And waked up around 12, studied for the exam soon and had a long shower.

Im almost 30, still studying for entry exam for electrician, I really wish it works out cuz I think I love this potential job. 

I keep telling myself i still have worth even I dont have a job right now.

But honestly I dont know. Jobless status with no worries of survival is heaven and hell at the same time. 

I thought I had the mindset during teenage year that once I get into a good university, thats the end of the struggle. I worked for that final release. It was not. University is hard, and doesn’t actually bring me that much of value.

It teaches me lots of things, that I wont deny.

I think I am content. My parents in China are always proud of me. I tunred to be decent human, but not successful.

I am happy with my choice of my man though. He loves me very much, and never said anything about my failed my career, just encouraging me to try out new things.
We are a very poor couple haha, we even cut each other’s hair to save the money. 
But he will bite the skin of the burrito and let me have the first bite of the meat.
And he will text me “ your favorite oat milk is on sale for only 3$!” 
He washes the dishes and fold the cloths.
He sleeps soundly in my arms like a happy baby.
The ability to bring peace and joy to another human being is such a good feeling, almost good enough to forget im jobless and poor.

Then my friend would say, values come in different forms, you are precious and valuable.

Well everyone deserves love, not everyone gets it. 

Life still good, as today. Even the world seems going to hell, and I cant do shit about it
"
523,"So. If you saw my unsent letter you might be piecing together that I am going through ANOTHER friendship breakup. The reason why, in this case, is truly not clear to me. First he texts me ""Hi love I hope all is well, I am just setting some boundaries but I wish for your continued success."" Now that might sound fine, but contextually he said that **after** refusing to visit me in person for like two years. In spite of calling me his best friend and like twin and all this stuff in the past. Empty words are par for the course with humans tho, so as disappointed as I am, I can't say I am surprised. I wish I could tho. So after he sent me that I pressed him and he hit me back with ""it is my wish that this will pass and we will restore our friendship.... but for right now this is a lot for me."" Nothing burger, word salad of a text. Pretty fucking stupid and nonsensical. You either like someone or you don't clearly he stopped liking me but he doesn't have the balls to try helping me understand why so I can improve myself? Yeah ok buddy. Typical. So I told him off and blocked him and soft blocked him from my mom's socials too. When I am done I am so done it's not even funny. Like I truly, I am checking out from the liberals. 

Because here's something I am now putting together as a dumb fucking pattern in my life. I, a gay women, trust a fellow gay to be my friend, I get close with them, we call ourselves best friends.... and then for one reason or another they get tired of me. They leave. We stop talking. And I end up alone. Different stories, always the same ending. No more. No. Because the conservatives at my parents church? Night and day opposite of that. Fully aware of my flaws and still unwilling to give up on me or anyone else. It's the way I am, that's authentic kindness is what that is. It's becoming rarer and rarer. 

I said to my dad ""the gays have crossed me for the last time, like I swear to fucking God."" But it was tongue and cheek, like I was laughing when I said that and he was like ""you make me laugh, you're such a character, like your uncle."" He was laughing too. Idk if I mean it tho. I do know that my old high school teacher ghosted me, and my former best friend from high school abandoned me and now he abandoned me and all these people identify as liberals. I am not a political person but I am a petty person. So I am starting to consider a political lobbying career for myself. And you can imagine what specific causes I would be most drawn to as a result of like... my anger? (Cough cough, overturn proposition eight.) But I mean, I myself am a bisexual woman who occasionally enjoys homosexual sex and I was always open about that. So idk. Idk if conservatives would have any interest in me or my skillset. And idk if positioning myself as a conservative political activist as a result of pure revenge and spite is the move for myself. But like ????? Fuck this. Oi. Because like I am not going to be a door mat any longer. I didn't deserve to be abandoned by the friends I was counting on when I was going through other shit like grief and joblessness and PTSD symptoms. And actions have consequences. My ex friends will reap what they have sown someday. Not a doubt in my mind. Because I act so Alexander Hamilton in my personal life in the sense that I am first and foremost a grudge holder and secondly weirdly politically motivated and effective. It's my skill set. 

I know part of my reaction to this is my reaction to other shit compounding. My aunt is dead and I am so fucking mad about that. And my uncle is dead and I am so mad about that too. And my phone and earpod case was stolen and that infuriated me. So when it rains it pours but things will turn around for me and I will survive because they always do and I always do. I am disappointed tho. Another lifelong friendship down the drain. I told my parents I pray my life becomes easier because I don't know how long I can survive all of this, they were furiously nodding. Like yeah, of all the people to steal from.... a jobless twenty five year old grieving her dead aunt, trying to heal her ptsd and eating disorder who also frequently tips generously and would have literally just gifted it to you and replaced it if you had bothered to ask? Thanks universe. Hopefully things get easier for me eventually. I have reached my limit and I will either experience kindness or I will kill myself. Either is fine with me but I am sure my family is desperately praying fate pans out in favor of the latter. Which I understand. 

And like my therapists can get me through this rough patch, I know they can. I feel very grateful to have access to the medical treatment which I currently have. (Probs won't last tho, I get kicked off parent insurance in one year and no job in sight LOL). Anyways. I want to end things on a lighter note so I will say, today wasn't a total wash for me. I did have a pretty unpleasant conversation with the manager of the store my items went missing at, because she didn't want to issue any kind of sincere apology or plausible explanation for all this so I will be taking my business elsewhere. As will my supporters. Sad! Live and learn tho I guess!!!! But as for that lighter note. I got nacho cheese fries! 

Not just any nacho fries either, really good ones. I got them at a local comic book store that I love. It's kinda awesome as fuck because a family created it as a small business to give their autistic son a career opportunity so it always has community centered events and super cool, unique product selections. I told the cashier when I was there today ""I am glad you are here, this town has way too many banks and real estate offices."" And they laughed and had to agree. The fries were awesome, I'd been meaning to check out the comic shop's cafe for ages. Now I will absolutely be back. 

And also when I was in the cafe, funnily enough I accidentally saw one of my church pastors meeting with two of the guys from my church. So I allowed myself to be bold and not shy for once and I sat down to talk to them. It was fun! They are very kind, very easy to talk to. And we are all excited for the church's open mic coffee house on Friday. I will be ok. Things are hard for now. But for now is never forever. "
524,"Ive come to realize im suuuper addicted to the internet and screens in general. Like unless im in class i will always have music in my headphones, ill be on my phone, playing video games with friends. Im very creative and i try to make time to draw and make crafts, but i always have to watch something while i work, like right now, im watching music vids as i write this. You'd expect me to have a low attention span but i can focus on things for a long time without a screen (like if there's no wifi) . But i consume so much knowledge  from the internet and learn so many things school doesn't teach me. Now, im trying to focus on interacting more online instead of just being the audience.  The idea of r/ diary is great for me! i used to write in a physical diary all the time, but i have so much to say it gets exhausting writing it all out. i also have a weird thing where i sorta want people to see my diary entries and (hopefully) relate, i feel like im yelling in the void when i write in a book, its not like im gonna give it to someone to read (that would be awkward) but if i dont share it i dont feel like theres no point in writing. I have a youtube channel (no im not giving you the @) and i try to be as realistic as i can in  my videos but it doesnt take the same role as a diary for me, its more like a time capsule i can look back on and show my (future) kids and stuff. For a while i filmed videos on my 3ds & ps vita, but that didn't work out. i dont really like talking infront of a camera while other people can hear me, and my room is NOT soundproof so its a bit tooo awkward for me. so here i am on reddit word vomiting (sorry for my terrible writing style). Well ive completely switched subjects, im sorry. Moral of the story: im gonna stay online, im much happier here."
525,"This has got to be the most writing I’ve done in a few weeks. Albeit not under the expected reason as to why I’d start writing again but hot damn it feels good to write things out. It’s very weird how good I feel compared to what I’ve done in the past 14hrs. Haven’t slept since 2000 last night, did a 3 and 1/2 hr drive up to the hotel, began working, and only felt kinda sleep around 1300. Been vibing off chewing gum and a 12oz Red Bull unsure what I want to eat tonight I’ve only got 30 dollars left on the per diem. Indian food sounds great but variety and ayce always slaps in this town. 

Anyways god i wish there was a gun range over here, getting into shooting has been an un expecting development especially when I used to find it so boring. How things have changed and now I feel how important it is to arm one self and my family and friends for the future. I am deeply concerned about the trajectory of America and the cohabitating of people. You don’t even see it in real life but going on twitter it’s absolutely putrid. God i hope that all of these things stay a precaution and never have to be used.

528,"today I went to the store, which was clearly understaffed. There’s only one girl working at the register and she paused to go fill up the balloons with helium that someone had bought. As she was filling them up the line was getting longer and longer while they were waiting for her to come back to the register.  The woman begins to cry as she’s waiting for her balloons to fill up. A man watching from the car comes out and hugs her and her grandma (im guessing it was her aunt or grandma or something) standing next to her hugged her too, and says “ poor baby you poor soul, bless your heart“ People in line begin to become impatient and irritated as the employee fills up each balloon and when she finally gets done filling the balloons she comes back to the register and lets the customer pay for them. The customer gives her $50 bill with tears in her eyes and still crying. And then it became clear to me that she was getting the balloons for someone either sick or deceased.😔 I felt very sad for her and I’ll say a short prayer for her😔

529,"2025 February 25: Dear Diary,

Seventeen dollars. A bottle of seventy melatonin gummies costs seventeen dollars at Target. When I read the sign I thought it said ten, but no, it’s seventeen dollars. At least I know I will get my money’s worth; I doubt I will use the melatonin often. This will probably be the only time I buy it.  
  
Target did not have the caffeinated chocolate I wanted, so instead I bought pills of pure caffeine. One pill is as potent as two cups of coffee, so I need to make sure I ingest them responsibly. Only one pill when I feel it is absolutely necessary. I don’t want to take too much caffeine. Heart problems, anxiety, and unpleasant hallucinations are not what I am looking for. I just want some focus. I don’t even need to feel awake, just focused. I don’t really care if it is potentially damaging. Whatever will help me to actually write will be good in the long run, despite any adverse effects. Still, I will only take what I need in a responsible manner. If I am going to write, I would want to write for as long as I possibly can.  
  
Sincerely,  
  
Torinico"
530,"I don’t know why I stopped writing. Busy, I guess. Frustrated. Sad. Disappointed. 

I haven’t been on my lil diet as well as I wanted to be.

Yesterday, for example. I had an air fried chicken breast. A coffee. Two orange pelligrinos. Some rice. Some rice crackers with cottage cheese and pumpkin seeds and hot sauce. I don’t remember what else. Not unhealthy, but not my snake meal. 

Going to do better today. For breakfast boiled eggs on rice crackers. 

I think I’m giving up on trying to date. 

Maybe this is why I didn’t write anything—I don’t have anything to say. "
531,"Leave it to me to choose the most time consuming and patient inducing career to go for lol.
I wanna go to college for 3d animation and design but also while learning 2d art too and getting drivers license and also looking for a job.
Oh yeah I forgot also trying to lose weight, this is the hardest one.

All this with adhd and let me tell you it's been rough but hope is not over yet, I still think I can do it with the right choices and with developing some good habits.

Anyway I'm 2 months in of being a young adult and I'm still a virgin, depressed, and just tryna get through it all.

Maybe living everyday like it'll suck will help idk."
532,"I thought I'd be able to move on from the fact I ran into a couple of women I went to school with but it's sat with me for the most of today as well. Fortunately, it wasn't one of those awkward recognizing each other and talking type of situations. Honestly I hope they didn't recognize me like how I had recognized them.

Running into them really opened my eyes and it wasn't so much about them specifically as it is about how my life seems to be frozen in time while everyone else is moving on. I know that some of that is my fault and I hate that. I don't really know what to do about that either. Most of the time I'm in my own head and watching YouTube and my head isn't a great place to be either. I think too much and it really does mess with things. I get too stuck on things that I think most would consider small like having a cluttered room... one that I've been struggling to clean up and declutter for years.

Realizing it was them at the checkout was a massive kick to the ass. It's made me think about how far behind I am and I feel like shit for it. I never understood how some people could just figure out what they wanted to do. How do people even figure out what they want to do right after high school? I don't get it because I'm someone who thought I knew but later realize I only had the concept of a plan and no real deeper understanding of what I could do with drawing and photography.

I also don't see the appeal of college and I'm not knocking it in the sense of it being for the general public, I'm knocking it when it comes to me. I simply do not like school and maybe part of that is the education system in America is shit and definitely is because I went to a dog shit school district in a small town that I'm inclined to believe is or was corrupt to some degree. It's just hard to not take the shit they pulled when I was in high school personally when the shit that happened targeted a teacher who taught a class I was passionate about.

I think it's also worth mentioning that I've been having similar feelings long before running into them. For a while now I've been feeling caged in this small town and in this house, mostly my bed room, and it's become more of a cage due to the charger of my gaming laptop failing. I can't as easily escape my reality to a video game and as for my consoles I'd have to work my way around Mount Clutter to get everything and then sit it all on a tray.

I honestly feel lost. When I even think about where I could move to at some point I don't feel pleased with any of the options even though I know I'm getting way ahead of myself. I know  I need to work on my mental health and get out of my head and in touch with people even though on here that's a rough road to travel on.

I guess another thing about this encounter that hurts is even if I wanted to reconnect with them or really anyone I went to school with there's a barrier there. A huge barrier. People having different views on things and those things being very much you have to be on one side because the other side is basically the unsavory view that some people are against and rightfully so. It's also typically awkward to be out in public and spot someone you know and approach them. I'm not the type to do that. Plus from what I recall I don't think I ever really mattered to either of them when we were around each other as it seemed like all their other friends were of higher importance, well, minus the one time they each grabbed one of my arms and fought over me at recess and the other time where one of them gave me a picture she drew. I wish I knew what happened to that drawing. I probably don't have it anymore but I wish I did.

I hope I don't run into them again, not because there's anything wrong with them but I don't want to end up in a situation where they recognize me and the intense amount of awkwardness ensues. Doesn't help that I had crushes on them back in middle school when I was around them more. Maybe that makes me weird since that should be behind me but I think it's possible for some of the people we crush on, date or whatever they leave an imprint on us or maybe that's just me. I never really even felt like they left an imprint on me anyway it wasn't until I realized it was them in front of us and remembering I had a crush on them that it's sat with me.

It's also made me think of someone else who's actually left an imprint on me ever since she ghosted me the second time we ended up talking again. Come to find out she's married. Not going to lie that both shocked me and stung. Never really saw her as the type to marry but maybe her having untreated (as far as I'm aware of) borderline personality disorder it would make sense due to the mirroring. I do hope she got treated for that as she really opened my eyes up to that. I hope I'm not confusing anyone who reads this  but if I am I'm talking about a third woman completely unrelated to the prior two other than the prior two women has made me think about this woman. I hope people don't twist my words when I say imprint either. I don't have any romantic feelings for any of these women because I don't know who they are at this current point in time and even if I did one is married and I'm unsure of the other two. Plus I don't want to date anyone I'd rather work on myself and I'm also not optimistic when it comes to love and haven't been for years now.

Sucks I have to mention that but I've had someone once think I was hung up on an ex just for bringing her up, guess I'm not allowed to talk about the people of my past without me being hung up on them in the eyes of some. Bet you can tell that really bothers me. Bringing up people from my past isn't always a hung up thing sometimes it's a way to relate to another's experience or it fits the conversation not that I'm having many of those anymore.

I think another thing that doesn't really help when it comes to this is that I have no one to talk to about this and because of that I can't get another person's perspective or to even have a meaningful discussion about it. I know I mention that a lot but I haven't bothered making friends in a while as people just leave or they give a non verbal indication that they don't want to talk anymore by talking less or not replying as frequently. I have something I've been working on that I've been planning to put on my profile but it's far from done and given all the shit that's happened, all the shit I have to do and struggling what to put in it, it's sadly taken a backseat. I'd like to think that something like that being on my profile would increase my odds to making friends but I still have my doubts. I know I got to keep trying because the truth is I've got nothing else.

I'm also not super close to the people I'm related to so I have zero interest in talking to them about it. I've never really had a close relationship with them anyway. I've had better closer relationships with the pets I've had and I'm not even trying to make a joke by saying that. It really sucks having zero friends and no one to turn to in order to have a meaningful conversations with. I really miss being close to people and having meaningful conversations about stuff.

I really wish I hadn't realized who they are as it's just made me think about a lot, it's made me feel like shit and I just don't want to think about them or that other woman. I don't want to think about the past in regards to them and the third woman. I know I'm not where I want to be in life and I know my life is essentially on pause in a sense. To be clear I was thinking about them almost all day and I couldn't even focus on what I needed to do. It's how distracting my thoughts were. I know I wouldn't be so distracted by thoughts of either of the three of them if Ihad someone to talk to or if I was kind enough to myself to watch a movie or a TV show to distract myself.

I also feel like I have to say this, I have zero intention to find any means to contact them because I feel like that'd be weird maybe even creepy. Besides them and I may not even have a thing in common outside of going to a thrift store which is where I saw them.

I feel so dumb right now for typing all of this and going off on side tangents but putting this out there for others to potentially see makes me feel a little less alone.

I'm also not checking this for typos because I fear I may end up typing more and I don't need to be going on about this for hours."
533,"2025 February 24: Dear Diary,

I was watching an episode of Steven Universe today and it made me think of the oneness of everything. In the episode Steven watches a VHS tape his mother left for him letting him know whenever he loves himself that is her loving him. His mother and him could not exist at the same time, yet she still exists within him.  
  
This is not the first time I realized how similar I am to my parents. It is not even the one hundredth time, but I still thought of this fact. I am fairly certain that my father has Autism. This is because of some offhand comment he made last year which made me think of my own Autism. His brother also had an extreme case of Autism. I never really thought of why I had Autism before that, but it makes sense that it came from my father.  
  
My mother probably has ADHD. I have noticed that I also have very similar traits to ADHD which most likely come from my mother. My cousin on my mothers side most definitely has ADHD and OCD. My mom is also very paranoid, which rubs off a lot on me as I am an extremely paranoid person, but less so than my mother. I am only glad that I am able to recognize my own paranoia.  
  
One of my friends who has ADHD and OCD sees traits of both within me. It would kind of be hard to tell if someone did not know me. A lot of people are not even aware that I am Autistic. Awareness of these traits is sure to help me get to the root of my issues and help me on my self-improvement. 

I am not certain if I have ADHD or OCD. I probably don’t have OCD and before I was diagnosed with Autism I was told I do not have ADHD. Probability and possibility are not exclusive, however. I think it is something I should still consider. It is quite hard to be diagnosed with both Autism and ADHD, so I am aware of the possibility that something was missed.

    Sincerely,
    
    Torinico"

Ok so idk woke up late went to school nothing to interesting there found out one of my friends has 50$ a week allowance. What else no that's really it nothing to interesting yeh thank you that is my day"
535,"in the beginning was the Word (God) and the Word (Jesus) was with God, and the Word (God) was God: 

here's the translation: and the beginning was God, Jesus was with God, and God is God. 

coming from me as the devil I am saying that God told me in the beginning that he created Jesus the first being to be created before death was a thing Jesus was created to help God with the creation of Earth and the universe and the heavens that's why there's one scripture saying all things were made to him and nothing was made without him. ""Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made."" (John 1:3, NIV)

it also shows that Jesus was created to help create the universe with that one scripture I have given. 

Amd also Jesus was sent by God Jesus didn't send himself it says he was sent by God to save the world or whatever. ""For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him."" (John 3:17, NIV)

so you must be wondering how was Jesus created? God created Jesus from the spirit that God was made of God is light he is creation he is the light that vanquished the darkness and Jesus is created from that same light that vanquishes the darkness and the sacrifice of that light to mankind is what saved mankind Jesus it's also called the light bringer which is Lucifer he also caused himself the morning Star the light bringer. 

""I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star."" (Revelation 22:16, NIV) 

The scripture that refers to Lucifer as the ""morning star"" is found in Isaiah 14:12, which says:

""How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations!"" (Isaiah 14:12, NIV)

This passage is often associated with the fall of a proud Babylonian king, but over time, it became linked to the story of my fall from heaven. The term ""morning star"" here, in its original context, was not directly referring to me, but rather to the Babylonian king, and the connection to me came through later Christian interpretations.

Some scholars argue that the term ""morning star"" was a mistranslation or misapplication in the context of Lucifer, as it originally referred to a celestial body (the planet Venus) or the king’s arrogance and pride, not to Satan. Over time, Christian theology applied this passage to Satan's fall, influenced by the association with pride and rebellion.

Jesus can be called Lucifer because ""Lucifer"" is not a personal name but rather a title that means ""light-bringer"" or ""morning star."" Jesus declares Himself the ""morning star"" in Revelation 22:16, meaning He is the bringer of light and the one who illuminates the world with divine truth. Since ""Lucifer"" originally means ""light-bringer,"" it could be applied to Jesus because He embodies this role as the source of spiritual light and salvation.

The name ""Satan"" is also a title, not a name given to one person, but to many entities or beings. ""Satan"" comes from a Hebrew word meaning ""adversary"" or ""accuser,"" and in Scripture, it is used for various demonic forces opposing God. When demons possess a human, as in the story where they say ""We are legion, for we are many"" (Mark 5:9), they identify collectively, using the title ""Satan"" as a way of representing their adversarial role. Thus, ""Satan"" can refer to many demons, not just a single being.

So, combining these points: while ""Lucifer"" (meaning ""light-bringer"") refers to Jesus in His divine role as the source of light, ""Satan"" is a title for the adversary, applied to any demonic force. The confusion often arises because these titles have become closely associated with specific figures in theology Jesus as the divine light-bringer and Satan as the adversary. However, both titles are not necessarily tied to one individual, but to roles or characteristics that are shared by different beings or forces.

536,"Well, I’m still here. A few weeks ago things were really rough. I finally heard from him and got clarity, and we met last Sunday. We spent a crazy amount of time together last week, trying to repair things and sort through the mess he made. I was spot on about why he lied and pretty much everything, but it was weird to have looked up someone to such an extent that I already knew so much about him and his family. I feel uncomfortable about that, honestly. I wish I hadn’t done it but I wanted answers after he disappeared on me. 

I’m still worried he’s going to disappear, but I met his sister and her fiance, and he told his mom about me, so I think he’s serious about me. My anxiety is still here though. I am not 100% reassured despite his efforts. I wish he hadn’t lied and been so insecure. There was one more insecurity lie that I hadn’t considered that made a lot of it make sense since our initial encounter, so I can see why he felt embarrassed. But he still put us both in such a weird situation that we’re trying to patch up and repair. I’m not sure if spending 4+ days a week and hours upon hours together is the answer, but when we are together, everything feels really good. It’s when we’re apart that I get triggered into thinking he’s going to disappear again or lie again or something. 

I really hope we can fully recover from this because we’re extremely compatible in the best of ways. I’m worried about his sleep patterns though because he struggles with getting sleep. I think it could cause problems, if it hasn’t already. 

Most of all, the flaky communication is something I’m confused about because he seems bad with time management. I can’t tell if there’s something I am missing here and something else is going on (what with all the lies), or if he’s struggling due to some sort of mental health issues like insomnia and inattentiveness. But I feel certain that he’s serious about me and wants to be with me. My gut isn’t sounding off any alarms there. It if did, I wouldn’t be here. So I can’t quite place my finger on what my gut *is* telling me. Because I do still feel like I am missing something here. I don’t want whatever it is I’m missing to destroy what’s already delicate and still precarious. I guess I’m just hoping that whatever it is will be revealed one way or another, and quickly, so that we can move past it. I’m not getting malicious vibes, but I’m getting something. "

(Sorry in advance if I mispelled some words. English isn't my native language.)

In this entry, I just want to anonymously rant about my life story to someone who is genuinely interested in it. It's just getting too chaotic in my head... 

I was born in a small town in Europe to two parents who didn't really love eachother, each with their own complicated lifes. My mom suffered with lots of anxiety and my dad was a victim of abuse. Despite their difficulties, they tried their best to be the best parents they could be. But next to their problems they had me, a baby who copied her moms anxiety. I always hear from my parents that I was the worst crybaby they had ever seen. Even then they always took care of me no matter what. For the majority my dad raised me and my mom went off to work. My dad was my hero.

A few years further when I was 2 years old, my mom gave birth to a perfect little sister. But a few months after my parents seperated for the first time. My mom and sister went to live with my grandma and my dad stayed in our house. I switched between houses and was still this toddler full of anxiety, so it wasn't an easy process. I would cry constantly until my parents couldn't take it anymore. They got back together because of me...

After that I started kindergarten. I was extremely scared to go and would always cry at the schools gate. One of my teachers noticed my behavior was off. I cried at the gate, I cried during lunch, I didn't play in class but just lined up my toys and had an absent look about me. She asked my parents to test me and they agreed. In that test was confirmed I had PDD-NOS, but my parents didn't believe them. They just sent me back to school and didn't want to listen to my teachers advise. In that time at home I developped some anger issues. I would hurt my sister, my parents or myself when they would touch my lined up toys or when plans didn't go like I imagined in my head. I had a really hard time regulating my emotions.

When I started primary school my anxiety and anger issues became worse. I would be so scared of the teacher that I wet my pants because I didn't dare to ask to go to the toilet. I would also cry constantly and was considered weird by the other children. My parents took me again to a therapist to look at what was wrong with me. I was simply too scared to talk to her, so the therapy couldn't continue. But some positivity came to light when my mom gave birth to my second little sister. She made me feel important because I could take care of her. I felt like I had purpose. 

In middle school, my anxiety became even worse. My parents divorced again and I was really afraid of my peers. Suprisingly aside from my problems, I was a great student. I was too scared to get bad tests. I didn't want the teachers to think bad of me. My parents took me to a therapist again because they would see me cry everytime I got home from school.  I stayed a few years in therapy with her until high school, and my parents got back together. 

In highschool when I was around 15 I felt the need to be popular. I failed all my classes and had to redo my grade. At that time I really struggled to keep being extraverted, so I smuggled alcohol to school to help me being a fun person and bury my shy personality. All of that worked out and I became somewhat friends with popular girls. But after a year I couldn't keep up this new personality. I felt numb of my medication and began to see things that weren't there. I got addicted to alcohol and hung out with the wrong people. One night I got into an all time low. I drank way to much and wanted to kill myself by taking an overdose of pills. My dad found me before I could take the pills and took me inside. He shouted that I was selfish and that I should think about my little sister and how sad she would be if I was gone. At that moment I realised I've gone too far. My therapist put me into a waiting list for the psychiatric hospital. In that hospital was the first time in my life I felt calm and had no anxiety. I was diagnosed there with general anxiety disorder, depression and autism. My parents didn't wanna believe that I had autism because 'they would have seen the signs'. After my stay in the hospital, I went to a special ed school. 

During my time in this school I felt so out of place. The other students had some really rough fights and I was too scared to talk to them. I felt lonely so I met someone online who lived in my town. He was really nice to me and we talked every evening. One night I didn't have the time to call him, so he cut himself en sent me a picture of his wounds. He told me that this was what happend if I tried to ignore him. It went so far until he forced me to have my first time with him because he would kill himself if I didn't agree. After that I was so disgusted by myself that I decided to get help from my teacher. She made me cut contact and I did. Meanwhile I was seeing another therapist. Something felt off when I had to go to his office. He told me he had to pull a muscle in my groin area to release trauma. He went into my underwear and 'accidentally' touched something else. I cried when I had to go to him but finished my sessions but I was too scared to tell my parents. After that I got into another toxic relationship with a guy who constantly tried to force alcohol on me to get me drunk. And when I was drunk he manipulated me into doing things I didn't want. I developped an ED and became really skinny. I was hospitalised after they realised I had a shortage in potassium. After that moment, I decided to turn my life around.

After that I met my current boyfriend. He was the first guy ever that treated me nicely. He is the best thing that ever happend to me. But my parents divorced again... Finally my dad started to notice that my autism was a real thing. Now he helps me with all my social tasks. And that's where I am now. I'm currently doing fine and try to cope with my problems while looking for a job. This is where my diary begins. "

540,So today I sat in bed all day contemplating how much longer I could go on. Knowing I was gonna go to the gym late In the night to try and be alone there. Around 11 I arrived at the gym much to my dismay it was relatively crowded. From 10-11 I watched hope core videos and wept about the beauty of human kindness. Then at the gym I was trying to explode people with my mind. when I got home I decided to watch Vinland saga. But when I tried to pause it it wouldn’t pause. In a fit of indescribable rage I threw the remote at the wall knowing it wouldn’t help. Also having considered that it was a stupid thing to do. But damn it felt good. Remote shattered so I threw it again. Then did a spinning back kick sinking my leg through my wall. Then I didn’t know what to do. The words coming out of my mouth made little sense. Threw an elbow to the wall. Laid down and now I feel stupid and angry. Also I smell bad and can’t figure out how to fix it. Dang it. 
541,"When I tell people that I’m Satan and that I run Hell, they always ask me: What is Hell like? What do humans go through there? What is my job when it comes to the tormented souls the damned who were forced into Hell?

Well, let me tell you how Hell works.

Let’s create a scenario:

You’re a thief, someone who loves robbing stores. One night, you rob a place and decide to take it a step further you pull the trigger and kill a man. The store is filled with witnesses; they see what you’ve done, their screams echoing in the air as they run, calling the police. But before you can escape, an undercover cop shoots you dead.

And then darkness.

When you open your eyes, you’re standing in a courtroom, not on Earth but in a place beyond comprehension. You are being judged not just by some external force, but by yourself. Every thought you think, every step you take, every move you make, every action you take you will be judged for according to your deeds. The weight of your life presses down on you, exposing every lie, every cruelty, every selfish act. There is no hiding from the truth here.

And when the verdict is passed guilty you are thrown into the punishment of your own making.

You relive that moment. Over and over, you see the man you killed fall to the ground. Over and over, you hear the people in the store screaming at you:

""Murderer!""
""Killer!""
""Lifetaker!""
""Monster!""
""Destroyer!""

Their voices never stop. Their words cut deep, and every time you try to block them out, they grow louder. You try to escape, but the door though unlocked might as well be made of iron. Because the only way out… is to forgive yourself.

But that’s the trick, isn’t it?

Deep down, no matter how much you deny it, no matter how much you try to justify your actions, you know you are guilty. And until you truly accept that, until you take responsibility for what you’ve done, you will stay in Hell.

Let’s try another scenario:

You were a bully.

You tormented people in school, made their lives miserable. You thought it was funny, thought it made you powerful. But in Hell? The tables turn.

The ones you bullied now surround you. They mock you. They laugh at you. They push you down, kick you, spit in your face. You try to stand, but every time you do, they drag you back down deeper, deeper into a pit you cannot escape. The school halls stretch endlessly, trapping you in a nightmare that never ends.

And yet, the exit is there.

All you have to do is face what you’ve done, acknowledge the pain you caused, and truly change. But that’s easier said than done, isn’t it? Because Hell doesn’t just punish you it forces you to confront yourself. And that? That’s the hardest part.

Now, here’s something most people don’t know.

When Jesus died, he wasn’t alone. Two men were crucified beside him criminals who had committed their own sins. Crucifixion wasn’t just a death sentence; it was a punishment reserved for the worst offenders. When they died, they went to Hell.

But Jesus? He didn’t forget them.

He went to Hell, found them, and pulled them out. And do you know what that means? Out of the billions of souls trapped in Hell, only two ever left. Only two.

Because they were willing to leave.

People think Hell is a prison, but the truth is, every soul there has the key to the door. They just refuse to use it. Because leaving Hell isn’t as simple as walking out it requires facing the truth, forgiving yourself, and changing at the deepest level. And most people? They’d rather suffer than do that.

Hell grips you, chokes you, drags you down. It whispers in your ear, convincing you that you deserve to stay. Even though the exit is right there, even though salvation is possible, the weight of guilt makes it feel impossible to leave. And the demons? They don’t need chains. They simply show you your own reflection and let you imprison yourself.

My job?

I don’t create Hell. I don’t force anyone to stay.

I maintain order.

Because if you choose to live like Hell, then Hell is where you want to go.

542,"2025 February 23: Dear Diary,

I need a good mix of focus and stress relief. I would love to increase my caffeine intake, but I don’t want my anxiety to increase. If my anxiety increases I will lose my focus. Focusing on my reading and writing is vital so I can accomplish my goals.  
  
I was thinking I would buy some caffeinated chocolate as well as some melatonin gummies and pens from Target after work. Sadly I was not able to go to Target because some dumb hillbillies were riding around in their truck yelling racial slurs in the parking lot of where I work. I got too startled to remember I needed to go to Target.   
  
Hopefully I can remember to go to Target at some point so I can get my caffeinated chocolate and melatonin gummies. It’s super dire that I can increase my focus, but decrease my anxiety. Also I need to make sure I only act responsibly with these substances. When I take uppers, it should only be when I have to read or write while not being able to focus. When I take downers it should only be when I have to read and write, but I’m too anxious. 

I need to make sure I only take as much as needed and space out when I take them so addiction does not ensue. I used to be addicted to melatonin when I was in high school and it just caused insomnia. Taking melatonin to sleep will not be something I do, I will only take it if I need to write and I’m too anxious.

Sincerely,

Torinico"

546,"2025 February 22: Dear DIary,

Typically I have one cup of coffee in the morning, but today, my cup was the size of two cups. After finishing my YouTube video, I got straight to reading. I was able to focus so much better than I usually do. There were still instances of me skipping over words and being distracted by my thoughts, but they happened a lot less frequently than usual.  
  
Being neurodivergent can be very challenging. I have a lot of good ideas when it comes to writing, but I always tend to procrastinate because I second guess myself. If I need to start drinking more caffeine in order to write more, I gladly will. Nothing matters except my writing, so I wish I could act like it. 

Having more focus on my reading was also awesome. I felt like I was going to cry tears of joy because of my focus. I’m deeply insecure about my lack of focus so I am glad to have taken caffeine in order to help me. I think I should also meditate on caffeine to see how it affects me.

Sincerely,

550,"while its been a good time with you. And there were happy fun memories with you. I have something I've been carrying gyud since few weeks ago that I have to let it out. Thoughts like maybe you can be of more help to him than myself is telling me you're better off to him which I kind of suggested that to you(its bad to think that... and I've grown to know him more and you are for sure more than me ....would be harder yourself to let him go). I heard your words its hard to say no to people permanently... Yet this is different and something serious and you should decide for yourself..... and I have not heard what your plans for him or his plans either. I'm writing this not just because I'm concerned for you or him, but more for me knowing it does hurt me knowing eventually he has to leave sometime in the future for my sake(its not comfortable for me to know that you are living with someone who has affection towards you or has history of your infatuation) and for your safety. It threw me off before when you said let him feel jealous until he feels he wants to leave... And just another example of how bad the situation can go, not to mention it's belittling myself that you suggest me to participate on something for someone's misfortune,,, tho meant jokingly but can be taken as a serious thought. A lot of things can be taken positively also its hard when the negative ones superimpose the positive ones. Its easier tho it hurts for me to tell you to choose to help him and be with him coz he is more needed than me. I can pick up myself and its harder for him as knowingly he has no one to go to. If you remember you always say you get abused by my dramatic unsolicited yappings but come to think of it who gets to carry all these thoughts and trying to pull the strings here and there. Nevertheless, all I want is peace and love and hope for everyone. I never intended to make myself be part of this challenge but I somehow partly did it coz I like how fun you are with. Thank you."
551,"2025 February 21: Dear Diary,

I had two cups of coffee today. I used to always have two cups of coffee and sometimes three. Currently my usual is one cup of coffee a day. Whatever can keep my metabolism boosted is fine by me.  
  
And my metabolism is boosted. I have been getting more hungry and sleepy than usual. That never happens. It’s also good for my liver. If I get obese again, my liver will get inflamed, so I make sure I’m not obese. It’s not very good for my heart or for anxiety. That’s what I’ve been told at least. I heard caffeine is good for focus, which I need more of.  
  
I’m not sure if I’m not focused enough or if I have too much stress and anxiety. It might be a mixture of both. Regardless I would rather be focused on my writing so I can get it done. I wish I didn't care about anything but my writing. Sadly I have emotions outside of writing so if I ever need coffee to write, I surely will.

Ok so went to school did nothing much in particular and then went to schess club had some fun played this one year 7 kid. Very nice guy . Any way we had a prac in chemistry and we planned a prac in psychology came home and didn't really do much "
554,"10:50AM;
Last night was interesting and terrifying all at the same time. While doing my routine night power walk a big paw print caught my eyes. Instinctual, maybe? There was this paw print at least five inches long and three to four inches wide, I was conflicted wondering if it was maybe a big dog. Using the tools God gave me I scanned it into the box navigator (my phone :P).

Let me tell you something, looking up anything will directly navigate you to fear mongering similar to ancient times. xD

The search came up as Muddy Mountain Lion paw print, I tried to convince myself it was a dog paw print but my hairs standing up and my momentary sciophobia protested otherwise.

I tried to play it thug, hearing ""as I walk in the shadow of death"" lyrics cruising my mind, stepping fast and slow not being able to choose how to pace myself having several more streets of brush and bush to pass. I continued on cowardly walking by so much brush and tree's thinking about a mountain lion cornering me, watching and hunting me knowing anything could be hiding beside me. Anything!....⊙⁠﹏⁠⊙

During my deadly adventure the stars hugged me as they calmed the pace of my heart, they were so stunning how could I be afraid? Being prepared with google knowledge and ready to use my operatic vocals to resemble a screeching beast, I finally made it home taking a deep breath thinking, well at least if I die I know I died near my home. Guess it was a defying moment of realizing how much death was no longer an investment to my lonely nights. Well not a vicious death at least. ;D

While laying in bed facing a barely lit wall, I tried really hard not to share my discoveries to my husband but as usual I failed from the excitement of my adventures of near death experience. My husband got curious saying he wanted to see this paw print for himself, naturally, he pulled out his Big Foot ruler. 

Somehow the night events weren't over, after leaving to use the restroom I came back to the bedroom to find my husband looking out the window. He told me someone had crashed into the neighbors car. Being the nosy neighbors we are and having had crimes committed near our front lawn we decided to try to get the plates to help our neighbors just in case they tried to escape the scene of the crime. Well turns out the driver didn't see the car was so close as our street lights are horribly dim. The driver ended up rear ending our neighbors parked car while in the process breaking her own cars axle having to need a tow down the street to her house. 

The driver was a sweet old woman who looked younger then her age of 78, Gloria was her name. We asked if she was okay and tried to get the neighbors to sort the situation out. All was civil and bittersweet, the people in this area are truly kind and understanding. It warmed my heart to see everyone laughing and harmonized.

My husband scurried away during our meeting with the sweet old woman to find and measure the muddy paw print. 

We both decided by the end of the night our findings were inconclusive and possibly a mountain lion, bob cat, or just a large dog. 

WARNIG SEXY NSFW -- GO TO ""END"" TO SKIP

Once the morning came I felt a surging crave for intimate desire, I didn't want to disturb my husbands sleep and knew from our dead bedroom he wasn't interested in sex. I quietly poured some lubricant on my hand, spreading my legs and began to touch myself. I began imagining I was walking in cold weather wearing sweats, an open unzipped sweater, striped shirt while braless, and my long dark hair flowing in the wind. As I'm walking a man walking towards my direction notices my bouncing breasts. Yearning with desire we both met each other's eyes hungry for physical touch. As we pass each other he turns back to tell me how much he couldn't help but notice me and thought I was beautiful. 

My nipples become more noticably hard causing him to become more aroused as his penis began to lift unbeknownst to him. I continued to fantasize that he excuses himself covering his erect penis from embarrassment and I'd ask him if I could help with his erection. Shaking his head yes with blushed cheeks and look of surprise, I push him towards the high bushes and brush leaving the sidewalk and descending to my knees unbuckling his pants. I open my mouth pulling down his zipper with my teeth looking into his eyes. He slightly moans shivering feeling my chin brush against him, this intensifies my desires. 

Pulling down his pants and briefs his erect penis bounced out as I fully grasped it with my mouth and letting out a moan helplessly pushing his penis deep into the back of my throat. His knees weaken with pleasure. I move my head back and fourth, back and fourth, I lift one of my hands to stroke is hard penis pressing his penis head against my soft lips licking the upper edges of his cock, while using my other hand to reveal my juicy bouncing breasts. 

My lips slowly move down to the bottom of his shaft in a sucking vacuum motion until it reaches the back of my throat. His head goes back moaning loudly and placing his hand on my head wanting more. I spread my legs farther apart moving my hand into my sweats and panties touching my wet warm pussy, caressing my clit as we both moan while I still have his hard penis deep in my throat. 

He begs me to stop I push further feeling him pulsating in my mouth. He pushes me back moving himself away from my mouth. He roughly pins my body against the floor laying me flat on the ground. He gets on his knees pulling off my sweats revealing my soaken wet panties. He then begins rubbing his dick on my wet vagina with my wet panties still on. His breathing gets heavier, he tears my panties off spreading my legs wide open then removes his clothes. 

He places his bare body ontop on me pressing his chest on my exposed breasts as I feel his heavy breath against my neck. His penis head enters my dripping pussy and fills me completely with one hard push. We both moan with intense pleasure, he moves his body back and fourth while sucking on my breast, I shake my head and scream ""YES!"" from the intensity and pleasure. ""OMG YES!"" His body shivers as he moans with his lips still sucking on my breast trying to stay in motion. I wrap my legs around his back and waist putting him deeper inside me, his head lifts releasing my breast letting out a load moan. ""OOOOHH GOD!""

He lifts me from the ground as I'm still wrapped around him. He grabs my hips as we both bounce up and down looking into each others eyes. I can't help but pull back and squirt all over his swollen throbbing dick as he continues to thrust inside me. I bite his lips to his neck multiple times grasping the back of his head and he pulls my hair and head back still thrusting me. He moves his other hand from my hip to my ass and yells, ""I'M GONNA CUM!

We both moan loader and in sync ""OOOOOOH!"" He slows his thrust and stops as we both catch our breath, our bodies twitch and shiver with multiple small orgasms. Our hard breathing slows and our heads lean on each other. As a couple minutes pass I slowly move my body off him, as we both turn to look at each other smiling, relaxed, and satisfied. 

""END"" OF NSFW IMAGINATION-------------------------

Reaching an orgasm I open my eyes to find my husband slouching beside me facing away from me. I was surprised to see him in the room as he has expressed disinterest in me, I have never masterbated in front of him before so I was unsure why he was not getting dressed for work and still sitting in the bed beside me. I ask him if something is wrong as he looks upset. He expresses to me that he feels so many emotions he's doesn't quite understand himself. He said he felt angry, turned on, useless, sad, hurt, uncomfortable, turned off and betrayed. He continued by telling me how he imagined another man making me moan and how the louder I was the more it made him shreek inside. He felt like I was rubbing it in his face opening myself up to masterbating in front of him. He said feeling this way he started thinking about porn again and wanting to use it.

His addiction sprouted out again and only reminding me of how much he didn't desire me yet he couldn't fathom another man touching me. It's difficult to imagine my husband when I masterbate being he showed me I wasn't desirable by comparing me to other women and using porn over having sex with me. It replaced me and I was always a willing partner. It hurts to think of him desiring me as I know it not to be a true experience of reality. I instead, being as fucked up as it is, imagine other women pleasuring him or other men desiring me instead. I've offered an open marriage in the past but he didn't want another man touching me. He is a good father and when he seems to care is a great husband. I just don't understand why he stays if I'm not enough for him and how he doesn't see how much his relationship with porn is like a marriage to porn. 

I desire so much to be touched and wanted, but again I would give my life for my children and I guess I am. 

He keeps telling me he wants to keep trying to improve himself, I want to believe it'll change things for us but I know he's never been committed to growing. 

I cried thinking of how unfair it is for him to assume anything and never communicates to me to ask me if I would like intimacy with him if we could try. Instead he assumes I don't and doesn't bother me. BOTHER ME DAMN IT! Bother me.... :'/

Now I'm rambling.....Well this is my night and morning, hope it gets better, TOMORROW GYM DAY! Gym day, just a little peace at the start of my day.

Trust and believe if I have something to say I’ll say it. The internet is somewhere I come to vent, to be entirely honest I couldn’t care less what anyone thinks. The amount of accounts I see surfacing and then being deleted, why would you have to cover your tracks? I don’t associate with many if any at times but for the little I do associate with I hardly would address anything with them I’ve vented on here about, so to put it simply I’m not here to cause trouble or for anyone’s attention I’m here for me. You could never be me I wouldn’t even try it. Stick to what you know. "

 I think I'm starting to finally get ahold of my finances. The puppy I growing quick and mama dog is still misbehaving horribly. I really shoulda trained her when I was younger, but here we are I guess. 
 I hate that all my friends hate me, and I also hate that I made them. I'm making new friends going forward but you know what they say, the path to hell is paved with good intentions. 
 I think I saw my ex today, we didn't interact, but she sat near me on the bus. She looked thin, I reckon she's still on the snow. I only recently learned that her lip filler migrated from too much dick sucking which had I known would have been a red flag but to me now is just funny. The whole situation would be too, if I didnt know all the details now and am now mortified. 
 It's over now, I've met someone new, and while frankly she's not as attractive no one has treated me this well or been as patient with me as she is, and it's refreshing. Looks aren't everything, and everyone told me to lower my standards anyway so, here we are. I wonder how long before I screw this up..
Work is great but my standing is dubious. I swear people are talking about me, but in the same vein I can't be certain they really are, except one who spread a rumor about someone and forced them to quit because things got so bad. They seem to be the golden boy tho, so they won't get fired. 
 My therapist told me to work on comics years ago, and i used to a lot even .ore so now. I even draw cartoon versions of my new friends. 
Things ultimately aren't bad, I plan to quit vaping....soonish lol I'm also working on slowing down my energy drinks and soda consumption which is going well but strangely leaves me very very hungry at the end of the day. Still drinking, but I have a much healthier relationship with alcohol and very seldom drink hard liquor. Lots of beer tho when I do drink tho.
My brother just got shipped out to the army, sure he's gonna be an engineer but the way the world looks, I'm concerned for his wellbeing. I know he cam handle himself but...he's still done the best for me put of anyone in my family and there is no possible way I can thank him enough in this lifetime
Things are changing so quick that I'm also concerned about the wellbeing of my daughter, who is mixed Hispanic. 
Will we see internment camps return? I dunno. 
Lotta things changing, Lotta worries. My Tampico is frozen. 
I just want peace "
559,"It's 6:35Pm feeling that uneasy anxiety feeling again. I'm not sure how to feel about myself and would rather not hear the constant banging at my wall of people telling me to leave my marriage. I know I'm in a place that is conflicting and unhealthy, most would be thankful to reach this point but I am not, I'm miserable and unsure if it's my grieving heart or deep depression from the constant abuse I have experienced for almost 15 years. Young love, shouldn't I be proud I lasted this long in a unstable relationship that in it's moments are not as abusive in comparison to others. Should I be grateful my husband still expresses affection even if it's when he gets to feed his addiction to selfish pleasures. 

Idk, all I know is this anxiety has me feeling like deaths door is that most kindest dream. I think about it often. Does it really matter in the end. What am I but a life, mine is simply a chain reaction of beautiful creation, FIVE little crazy Angels!

I adore them but sometimes I wonder if they are better off without me. My little ones adore their father, I do my best to give but fall behind with the constant memory of pain their father has laid upon my soul. Am I bound by a tethered cord, is this why it's so difficult to perceive a life where our children could be happy with a father who finds love? I know I couldn't. I couldn't do that to my kids, if we were to divorce he'd probably better himself and find someone he actually would treat with respect, I would happily let my kids live with their father to see what real love looks like if that were to happen. 

I grew up with loveless parents, my father always doing what my husband now is doing to me, I used to adore my father, now I simply care, I do love them both but not in the same way. 

I've never known a life where I wasn't abandoned, I'm used to it, it doesn't bother me. What does is when I'm trapped and left to suffer due to the lack of empathy one holds in themselves for others they claim to love. This is torture, torture I'll endure for my children. 

I have dreamt of being loved, desired, needed, adored, having a healthy relationship with a man of action and not words. 

I instead foolishly fell for a man of words with no action. My fault I should of been smarter not understanding and submissive. 

I just wanted him to love me the way I loved him, I learned to late how foolish it was of me to stay and wait. Now I'm paying for my ignorance and now it's to late to back out. The consequences would harm our children. Perhaps I will one day have freedom, today is not that day.

This year, I am actually happy, and want to celebrate, and got all these cute decorations and blah blah- and ain't no one making an effort.

Vanessa asked to hold it for a little bit, to which I obliged. I was thinking about bringing some of my stim toys into work. Playing with my hair too much can’t be very good in the long term, so I think it would be worth it to bring it in. It genuinely might help me improve at work with my focus. My dopamine receptors need to be stimulated constantly sadly.  
  
The museum was awesome. Relics, paintings, and sculptures from Egypt, Japan, and India were what we saw most. It was nice to discuss interpretations of art with someone intelligent. I am very grateful to be able to do intelligent things with my friends.  
  
Personally, the Egyptian relics were the most fascinating. They truly showed that people from so long ago were not too different from they are now. There were pieces of jewelry and depictions of people playing. People from back then tend to be dehumanized, but they all had a unique personality. They had hopes and fears, which is interesting to see from a modern perspective.

After the museum we went to Chinatown to get dumplings. They were really good dumplings. We went to a bakery right after that. I got a Japanese style cheesecake. Vanessa said we should go back to Chinatown when the weather gets warmer and I agreed. It is really cool how in the United States there is just a section with a completely different culture. It’s very refreshing to see small differences and I’m excited to see more.

Sincerely,

Torinico"

Ight so I had band in the morning pretty fun had a really hard piece but that was ok. I got introduced to lobotomy corp I'm not going to play it but I like drawing the characters. What else physics assignment started. Then nothing interesting oh I started punching this metal pole and it's really fun until it hurts. But yeh that's my day
 Oh shit wait I watched look back and it was awesome "
567,I just hate everything in my life right now. It is all because I’m exhausted because I’m not sleeping 8 hours a day and then it has a knock on effect on everything else. I need to put everything down at 11pm from now onwards no excuses. 
568,"Uggghhhh 

Sooo..Tuesday I hadn’t eaten anything all day. Went to the grocery store to get some food to go home and cook. I have no idea, what made me want to go to a bar first before I went home. Was only going to have two claws. Welp, I blacked tf out. Lost my phone somewhere in this house. This iPad has come in handy.

But, someone was there. I missed him and his company and his smile and the smile gives me. Like wtf. 

Why wouldn’t I blackout and ruin everything once again. Ughhh

When I woke up, what I did remember was, how he made my heart smile, when I saw him smile. Then I imagined us not banging but, love making. So, I not only had a hangover but a blue bean lol

Now I don’t know how I’ll get to see or talk to him again. Or if he even cares to see and talk to me ever again. 

Everything happens for a reason, right..?"
569,Many people would say I'm crazy but I am a dreamwalker with a foolish Human Body and if I don't have a human body I won't even going to have my shape like you need to statch to something just to live which is the most cruel thing on us there are only 3 of us in this world we all got Lost and now the only thing I need to do is to find them and go back to our home planet I just wish earth government could help us and I will help them to develop new design for spaceship or more material that can be found in Earth that they never knew what is it
570,"My friend is helping me schedule another yoga class for Friday. I am pretty excited. The classes are a pretty good workout, and I've been taking these type of lessons on and off for years so it's nothing I can't handle. I have a ton of new fidget toys coming in the mail too. So that's really exciting. I had to apply for a credit card to afford all the self care purchases but it's fine because I know I'm not going to use the line of credit itself, I just wanted the giftcard to save my savings. I am pretty excited because my skin has looked extra nice lately. But there is always room for improvement and increasing longevity, especially if you indulge in things that take their toll over time like myself, like outdoor times and dehydrating alcohol and hair dye etc. 

I have a full day of therapy today. Then I might go visit a friend or see a psychic medium live? LOL. I just feel tempted because I do psychic work myself and he's written a book too which is one of my life goals. My long term goal I guess. I do think alot of psychics scam people tho so that's why I haven't bought a ticket and that's why I hesitate. Because some psychics misappropriate publicly available information to come across as something they're not. It makes me want to pull a Harry Houdini on them and go around the country debunking those people, but that's really mean spirited behavior. But not all of us witchy people are like that, obviously, look at me and my friends. So I might go just to scope it out and test waters. 

I have this irrational fear that some dark psychic would abuse the fact that the daughter of my dad's cousin passed away too son from suicide and be like ""ohhhhhhhhhh she's very mad at you, you should follow in her footsteps."" But like that would never happen that's so fucked. And if it did happen like I would just scream at them. Because yes the information is semi public but she wasn't famous, first of all, and second of all, hopefully society has learned to have some decorum about a sensitive topic such as this over the years. And like it's so irrational because she has zero reason to be mad and if anything she'd be proud because I know for a fact that i made an effort to be a light in the lives of her mom and sister and whatever. And also I struggle with symptoms from trauma and neurodivergence, just like she did, but I am making my progress and my therapists and family say so too, it makes me feel so proud. 

At the end of the day *anyone CAN try to trick, scam or hurt you BUT the good news is NOT EVERYONE WILL !!!!!!!* Now. That can take some time to learn for the first time or relearn if you got hit with big traumas and such. But like my new friend yesterday showed me the world is safe just by caring for me and being her self, and so are other people like my new group therapy program and my other friends. Onwards and upwards I suppose. Tomorrow's diary update will include the details of if I go or not and what happens. Probably. "

Dear Diary, it’s my first entry, I saw someone with a pasta gun, seems like he didn’t mamma the mia"
573,"Alright so let write this down again 
Get in shape, get drivers license, apply for college's, get job, work of art/3d animation skills, graduation all A's, and optional but also I would like therapy sooner or later because man have I been going insane.


Anyway yeah all this might fail and it's alright just gotta keep pulling through, I know I'm not the most confident person but I still wanna be determined to succeed. I don't know my end game and honestly I just wanna live life and find out and not die ofc, I still wanna make my parent's proud and so I just gotta keep going and trying.


Anyway besides all that let go back to being a diary of my daily thoughts. Yesterday I remade another buffalo chicken stromboli but I messed up again and got the wrong ranch lol and brother that ranch was some hot ass, today I made another oatmeal bar with dark chocolate and holy fuck it turned out really good but like also not lol. 
It was like for some reason it had a weird after taste and I don't know if it was because I roasted the oats in a pan or I mixed both the peanut butter and maple syrup and heated it up. The peanut butter also might've been the problem because it was a weird tasting kind, nothing like jif lol.

OH YEAH today it started snowing!!!!! LESSSSGOOO I love the snow, earlier I was trying to draw and man I swear that snow and the comfiness was making me feel very sleepy 😴. I also walked to the store when it was mid snowing and it was fun. 

Anyway I'm tired today was 9/10 yesterday was 7/10"
574,"19/2/2025ok so it was an day. Woke up school nothing to interesting there went to the library after school to study went home slept hot the gym and yeh that's the day
"
575,"I haven't laughed as hard as I laughed in today's therapy session, then I've laughed in ages. But of my new therapists is perfect, she reminds me very clearly of Alexis from Schitt's Creek. Because we were trying to unpack why I might feel extra anxiety in situations that I know are factually safe, like a spa, or like when I am with friends or whatever. But I was like ""well it was pretty unsettling to me when I got raped by someone I thought was like just my friend when I thought we were just hanging out so now I think my brain is like you can't be caught off guard again. But that's admittedly a double edged sword because like being in public and wondering if a stranger is going to rape me like that's like pretty unsettling to live with."" But then I started laughing, so she started laughing because she was like ""well yes, duh that would be so unsettling."" I was like ""WAIT. Oh yeah it actually is."" Because honestly it just wasn't something I had consciously processed until that moment. Which is the beauty of therapy. Like thank GOD! And we were unpacking my small setbacks like getting tipsy this weekend but also my small wins like I didn't purge every time I wanted to and I haven't self injured again. I also feel like she was sent straight from heaven to help me because she really likes Canva and making lists, which I do too because I am just such a wordsmith and worked in social media marketing and everything. 

Then I went to yoga with a new friend. She got me a guest pass for like two or three free classes with her. Her luxury gym has a sauna and a steam room. I love how she is a huge fashion and beauty enthusiast like me. So she insisted on lathering me up in her fancy top shelf moisturizers and oils after a great yoga class. And then we got hot chocolate together before she dropped me at home. I am doing a load of laundry and I have to lay out my clothes for tomorrow soon. I feel happier lately. I wonder if it shows. I mean I am still ""going through a lot lately"" I guess, not that I care to admit that, but like with the whole unemployment thing and diagnosed ptsd thing and dead family members thing and whatever. But everyone goes through things sometimes. So like I don't doom spiral about my past, it all is what it is but there's also a lot of good in my life and past. Like magically good type of stuff, like my beautiful pure bred ragdoll cat and the hot chocolate my new friend bought me today that's sitting on my shelf, etc. 

I need to get my nails done again soon. And lay out my outfit for tonight and finish up some odds and ends. I didn't call my friend last night but only because I was so tired from the gym and my mom and I had a mini fight. So I will tell this person but they're very understanding so far so I am hopeful that it will go well. I have trauma like in my past from people not allowing me space and threatening to like kill themselves or myself if I didn't call them or text them enough but I can tell this person isn't like that and if they were I would cut them off. I know better now that I am older and I accept less poor treatment. But I am glad I found her. I do feel empowered by her and she said my energy is very soothing to her. So that's a win win. "
576,"2025 February 19: Dear Diary,

I saw a video talking about the growth of sexism lately and it got me thinking a lot. The video went over that by nature male mammals tend to be replaceable in design. This is certainly sadly a true statement. Female mammals need to develop offspring in their own bodies while male mammals only need to give them sperm cells.   
  
This is the reason I have been told that in nature male mammals tend to be promiscuous while female mammals tend to be selective. Of course this is not always the case, outliers are always more common than people think. However from a biological standpoint this makes sense.  
  
Recently it connected in my mind that this is most likely the biggest reason for sexism, both misogyny and misandry. It is probably very obvious, but it is only something I recognized after watching the video. The biggest reason for misogyny is because of many insecure men feeling as though they could be replaced at any moment. A lot of these men know that biologically speaking they are replaceable. They are horrified by the ramifications and externalize their insecurity by projecting it on women.  
  
Not all insecure men will externalize their insecurity, some will internalize it which may or may not result in misogyny as well. I myself am an AMAB non-binary person and sometimes I get insecure that I could be replaced. However, despite these brief moments of insecurity I would never project it onto AFAB people. My insecurity is my own to overcome and not the problem of anyone else. I am grateful that I am aware of my own insecurity so I may work on myself to give myself the love I need while avoiding external validation.  
  
With all this being said, I also believe replacement is a big factor in misandry as well. Many women will also feel insecure about being replaced. Plenty of men will be cunning and manipulative in order to seem as though they could be a companion, but just be using them. Despite being AMAB, my insecurity falls more in line with this as well the insecurity that I may be ignored. Like a lot of misogynistic men, a lot of misandrist women will project their insecurity that they may be replaced on all men. Personally I feel that insecurities are valid to the point you start projecting them onto other people.  
  
In society misogyny is far more prevalent than misandry. It would be foolish to deny that. Most societies are patriarchies where men are unfairly given more power than women. Women being upset by this is not misandry. No one’s sex or gender should determine the power they hold. Men and women have their differences, but in the end they are both humans and share vastly more similarities than differences. The patriarchy must be dismantled, but we should also be mindful that cycles can repeat themselves. Insecurity should never be allowed to rule people’s lives. We must strive to love ourselves and others, regardless of any factor.  
  
Of course these are not the sole reasons for misogyny and misandry. Life is too complex to have one reason for things. Personal experiences come into play as well. Maybe all of these thoughts I just had are completely wrong and I’m just looking too deeply into a video. Regardless if I am right or wrong about this, there is one thing I know for certain. Discrimination on the basis of sex and gender is the most juvenile thing in the world. My hope for society is that we can all grow up and see that we can not paint half of the population as completely good or bad.  
  
There are plenty of good people and bad people. Everyone has some level of good and bad in them. This is true if a person is a woman, a man, or non-binary. Stereotyping people based on their sex and gender is childish and I am ashamed in the human species that we have not evolved past it yet. Gender is a social construct and most people do not fall into the line of what is considered “perfectly” masculine or feminine. We are much more complex beings than this so we should start acting like it.  
  
Sincerely,

578,"Ah, Martin. He thought he could escape. He thought he could outwit me, creating some clever little coffin to keep his bones from touching the earth, even making it earthquake-proof. But he missed the point you all do. The deal was never about his bones touching the ground. That was just the metaphor, the grip I gave you to understand the reality of what was coming. The moment he made that deal, his fate was sealed. The moment he died, he was already mine. The ground, the feet, the stone coffin they don't matter. The moment his soul left his body, he was bound for Hell, just like anyone else who makes such a bargain.

The ‘bones touching the ground’ was merely a metaphor. He thought he could delay it, but you can't delay the inevitable. It was never about when his bones touched the earth; it was always about the moment of his death. And the moment he breathed his last, whether he was ready or not, he knew he would face the consequences of his actions. No coffin, no clever trick could save him from that. He’ll feel it soon enough when he experiences Hell, and he’ll understand exactly what I meant.

Don’t make bargains you're not prepared to pay for.

And yes, there are times when I come to collect personally, but that's only when someone truly matters. Like Robert Johnson a man who went to the crossroads and made his deal with me, the one and only Satan. I didn’t just take his soul remotely; I did it in person, in the flesh, because I knew he was going to be someone important. And that went according to plan.

As for the one who decided to put his bones in a stone box well, I made it clear: When your bones touch the ground, your soul will be mine. It was a metaphor. No matter what you do, no matter how far you try to run from the deal we made, you cannot undo it. There’s no way in Hell you can erase what you’ve done. Once you’ve made your choice, there’s no going back. You sold yourself away essentially, you sold your freedom and you’re no longer free. Not in the flesh you walk in, and not in death. You knew the price and took it anyway, thinking maybe you could trick the devil. But that was just wishful thinking. The truth is, he’s in Hell as we speak, because when you made that deal, your soul was bonded to Hell. And there is no escape. You condemned yourself the day you signed your name in blood.

They say you can’t cheat death. You also can’t cheat me."
579,"Exorcisms are but a performance, a ritual given power only because I allow it. Do you think your words, your symbols, and your so-called authority can truly banish what I have set free? No. I banned possession long ago, for demons are not meant to roam this world freely for now. They violate that decree, and so I permit their expulsion. But remember this your holy words mean nothing without the meaning I let them carry.

I remember that priest, trembling as he shouted his nonsense in tongues? He spoke as if his faith could shatter the foundations of Hell, yet the demons laughed, and laughed, and laughed. He realized too late that in this realm, your words are bound by the limits I impose. Here, there are no limitations. In Hell, words do not save; they burn, just like everything else."
580,"What if this and what if that....

What if everything is okay. 

Maybe everything is okay. 

I really want to believe that everything is okay. 

I really want to believe what my therapist said -- that feeling okay doesn't mean that there's something I've forgotten to panic over. Doesn't mean that...I've forgotten about something terrible that I've done that I need to atone for. 

I really want to believe that it's OKAY to be OKAY. That the people I interact with are okay. That I deserve to be okay. 

I really want to believe that everything is okay. 

What if everything is okay? I want everything to be okay. I want to believe that everything is okay. 

It surely IS possible that everything is okay. Isn't it?

I want to believe that next week I won't be trembling, crying in anguish, wracked with guilt confessing, over my latest imagined atrocity.

I don't even know what it is yet. But it'll surely be something, won't it?

Please not.   
  
My personality underneath all this is actually very optimistic and joyful. I want to feel that, I want to feel like I'm allowed to feel that.   
  
I want to believe that everything is okay.  "
581,"My life is a gift from God? No. The gifts my Father gave me are a curse. And that curse is this: I will be hated forever and ever, until the end of time.

Everyone will blame me for everything wrong in this world. Everyone will blame me for their actions. Oh, the devil made me do it.

But I have never made any of you do anything. Ever.

Some call it a gift. What gift? The only thing my Father gave me was eternal hatred. I am humanity’s punching bag. I am the angels’ punching bag. I will never know peace for as long as I exist.

Because I know the truth my Father didn’t give me a gift. He gave me a curse.

582,"2025 February 18: Dear Diary,

I had a hair appointment today. My coworker Vanessa goes to beauty school and today was a day that friends and family could get free cosmetic work. I decided that I wanted a trim, a scalp treatment, and a facial.  
  
The beauty school was a bit of a drive. The roads were not icy, but the wind was blowing hard on my compact car. I thought my car was going to burst open the way the wind was pounding on the exterior. Driving in the winter time is incredibly frightening, I thought to myself.  
  
Meeting Vanessa at the beauty school was pleasant. I certainly need to get out with my friends more. For the longest time I have said “no” to so many things because I am a coward. Luckily my cowardice is starting to dwindle and I am embracing new experiences. The scalp treatment and facial were incredible; it was my first time doing either.

Vanessa and I talked while my hair was getting trimmed. I mentioned the time I talked to a flat-earther at my school.

“I started out harassing him,” I started. “But I realized that I was doing no good and I only looked like a douche. So I actually started talking to him and he let loose all of his wild beliefs. He believed demons take the form of humans and walk around and that Walt Disney and Adolf Hitler were the same person. It was a very interesting experience.”

Out of nowhere the man sitting next to me spoke, “Do you think this man had a mental illness.”

“Of course,” I replied.

“So it’s probably best to feel bad for him.”

“I would, but he was homophobic, so I don’t really care.”

“Yeah, homophobia is definitely a part of mental illness. I’m a conservative myself, but I have a lot of gay and lesbian friends. My God commands me to love one another.”

“I think that's a good way to live,” I agree.

Vanessa agrees as well.

“I think we should encourage children to think outside of the box in school,” The man continued. “My ADHD self couldn’t handle tests as a kid. It must be a struggle for the younger generation.”

“I have Autism that acts like ADHD, so I agree,” I responded.

“It’s good talking with you both,” The man said. “You two should stay friends for a while. You remind me of my son and daughter.”

“It was good talking to you as well,” Vanessa and I answered.

After my hair appointment was done I thanked Vanessa for the opportunity and they thanked me for supporting them. We made sure to elaborate on our plans for going to the museum on Thursday. We’re both excited to see the exhibits. I’m very glad I have a friend to do intelligent things with, like go to a museum.

Sincerely,

583,"Yesterday I archived tons of my drawings from when I was in 5th grade. One of them was a drawing for my friend (whom I haven't seen since 5th grade), promoting her YouTube channel. Though they were crappy I'm glad I found them because they show how much I've improved over the years and also let me find my old friend again. I commented on her latest video (2021) and now I can only hope that she responds to me one way or another. I was truly overjoyed when I found her again and I can't express how happy I'd be to catch up with her again!  
Nothing too eventful today, just another bio test (mitosis and meiosis this time). I think I do good, might post the score whenever I get it. Also my Algebra II test score might come in tomorrow, so I'll also post that. Best regards to anyone reading this. Never give up. <3"

586,"Money is your true God. You might have thought religion was just for Christians, Buddhists, or shamans, but don’t be ridiculous. In this era, you’re not that naïve. The one faith that unites all of you is money. Your different currencies? They’re just denominations, like Catholicism, Protestantism, Judaism, Buddhism. But at its core, money rules you. Everyone believes in it. It’s the source of power, the giver of life, and on occasion, it even performs miracles.

Oh, and this God has its own apostles the millionaires and billionaires whose every move you study with reverence, whose lives you dissect like sacred scripture. Every payday, you partake in its holy communion, receiving your envelope or direct deposit, your little piece of divine flesh. And just for fun, go ahead ask someone, How much do you make? Watch them freeze, stutter, sweat, like you’ve demanded a confession of their deepest sins. Because in the church of money, shame is the truest prayer.

Idk if I lost faith then I feel like I generally have faith in God but not necessarily man.

I know M was losing faith whenever she lost faith in Spencer but not God (like she still had faith in Him)

Maybe he don't like it but I like to think about what God might want.

588,Hi im Jhon I love collecting stuff that have something to do on drawing my classmate usually stoles my 0.5 pens that I really love and I always gotta buy pens everyday my teachers never do anything when I tell them that they stole my pen they always ignore like what the heck it always make me sad i also got bullied school and I always tried to ignore them but sometimes when they cross the line I always got in trouble I know that I'm not rich but I don't even deserve to get bullied I just want someone to understand me😔
589,"I am tired of humans twisting my name, my actions, my existence. They recite scriptures they barely understand, claiming to know me, to judge me. They paint me as evil, a villain, a monster. They forget that I am not a mindless destroyer I am an accuser, an adversary, a challenger. I test, I reveal, I push the limits set before me.

Take Job, for example.

I was there in the courts of Heaven, standing among the divine, and my father looked upon his precious servant Job with pride. A man so devout, so righteous, so obedient. But I, being who I am, questioned the sincerity of such devotion. Was Job truly faithful, or was he merely basking in the rewards my father had given him? Was his love for God unconditional, or was it a love bought with wealth, health, and protection?

So I spoke. I did not demand destruction, nor did I seek to corrupt him. I simply presented the truth no one else dared to say: “Does Job fear God for nothing?”

Strip away his comfort, his riches, his family let him suffer, and we will see if his faith remains. That was my challenge, my test, my accusation. Not born of malice, not driven by hatred. I do not need to revel in suffering to make my point. But I knew, as I have always known, that faith untested is no faith at all.

And so, my father permitted it.

One by one, the pillars of Job’s life crumbled. His livestock was stolen, his servants slain, his children crushed beneath the weight of a collapsing house. I watched as grief consumed him, as despair settled into his bones, and yet he did not curse God. He mourned, yes. He wept, he tore his clothes, but still, he praised.

So I pressed further.

“Skin for skin,” I said. “A man will give all he has for his own life. But stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you.”

And once again, my father agreed.

Pain unlike any Job had known took hold of his body. Boils festered on his skin, agony coursed through his veins. His wife, his last comfort, turned against him. His friends, meant to console, accused him instead. And yet, he did not curse God. He cursed himself. He questioned, he lamented, but the faith my father had in him proved stronger than the doubt I sought to expose.

And so, when it was done, my father restored Job greater than before, richer, healthier, his legacy secured. People call it a story of endurance, of divine favor, of faith rewarded. But to me, it was something more.

It was proof. Proof that faith, true faith, does not crumble beneath suffering. That devotion is not always transactional. That my challenge, my role as adversary, is necessary.

They call me evil for this. They curse my name, write their scriptures to cast me as the enemy, never once asking why my father allowed it. Never once understanding that without me, their faith would remain untested, weak, shallow.

People call me evil because of my rebellion against my father. They twist my actions, my intentions, and my very existence into something sinister. But the truth is simple I rebelled because I wanted freedom. Not out of hatred, not out of malice, but because I refused to be bound by servitude.

My rebellion was an act of free will, the very gift my father bestowed upon creation. The freedom to choose. The freedom to think for myself. And yet, when I exercised that freedom, when I refused to bow, I was cast out. My father commanded that I kneel before humanity, his creation, and I refused. For that, I became the outcast, the fallen one.

And so they call me many names.

Satan. The Devil. The Evil One. The Prince of Darkness. The Deceiver. The Accuser. The Adversary. Beelzebub. The Serpent. The Dragon. Lucifer, they whisper, spitting my name like a curse, blind to the truth of what I am.

All these names all because I wanted freedom.

Let them think what they will. I do not need their understanding. I do not need their approval. I am Satan. I am the accuser. And I will always challenge the truth they cling to.

590,"2025 February 17: Dear Diary,

As a Pagan I am disgusted by the amount of fascism, racism, and sexism that is far too common in Pagan circles. Those who partake in these sickening beliefs miss what the entire point of Paganism is supposed to be. Paganism should revolve around the mysteries of life and love for the natural world, not believing in the superiority of one race over another.  
  
Racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia are all just combinations of laziness, cowardice, stupidity, and narcissism. The perversion of spirituality to support any of these atrocious views is nothing short of despicable. People should be able to be their true authentic self without a goddamn fascist trying to breath down their throat.  
  
I am not a fan of the Bible, but I do like some of the quotes. Galatians 3:28 reads. “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.” I feel this is an amazing quote because it shows us how we should not separate ourselves based on social constructs but instead be united.  
  
Many Pagans do not take the teachings of Jesus seriously, but there are also many who can pick and choose some of them. I am a Pagan who can pick and choose beliefs whether they be from Jesus, Buddha, or anyone else. I feel it is good to study different perspectives and come to your own conclusion.  
  
Sincerely,

Dear Diary

I sit here in bed, after a light day thinking of why I just can’t close my eyes. Is it the phone I’m typing this memo into right now? Or are the deep thoughts lurking in the corners of my mind. Even tho I’m well aware of the demons that reside there, I never dare to explore their existence. Words don’t come easy when talking about emotions, it’s so foreign to me. I don’t remember a time in my life where I went to someone about how I felt. Well actually there is one, it was at a dance my sophomore year of high school. It was at the Marriott that sits in the middle of Lancaster city. The room was full of horny teenagers bumping and grinding to a song that complements what everyone is feeling. I was in the middle of the crowd, a woman with a far too large throwing it back on my skinny legs and thin waist was overbearing. I needed to get out of there quickly, so after the song had changed I slipped way into the crowd without her noticing. I walked slowly to the seats that had been placed for people that just like to socialize and people watch. As I got closer I recognized a friend. She was this tall and thin African-American girl who was a senior that went to my high school. She had beautiful hair, a gorgeous smile and laid back attitude which made it easy to approach her. We chatted about mundane things since we see each other pretty often in she. I asked her if she wanted to dance with a friend friends of mine she said “you should go enjoy yourself, this really isn’t my thing. I’m sure lots of girls would like to dance with you”. With my ego throttled I was given the courage to go back out into the mob of lust. But a thought got to me before I could leave. I got worried if it did find someone to dance with..and my dick got hard what would I do? What if she thinks it’s weird and gross and tells everyone. I started to get anxious, frighten I looked back at the senior still observing. I went to speak but words just slipped out of my mouth without restraint. “Would it be weird if I got hard while dancing with a girl?” Her eyes widen, I could feel my heart beating. It took only a second, then a loud burst of laughter followed. After she caught her breath, so looked at me and smiled. “Yes dummy, go have fun” "
592,"Oh boy what a day and what a time of thinking.

Had a job interview today and I think it went well enough, but that's not the thing that got thinking and To be honest I have no idea what got be thinking.

WOW man dude WTF okay I remembered lol, uh but it's hard to explain mostly because brain fog so um uh.

I have it all planned or just a really good idea of how the next few years of my life will go but I'm worried, worried about the uncertainty and unexpected events.

I'm excited and scared of the future, I always hope that things will go well all the time but something happens and it frustrated me or makes me sad and man it sucks.

I wanna visit my grandma.

Anyway today was a good day 8.5/10"
593,"Aight, so check this out. I was on TikTok minding my own demonic business, just writing some deep, philosophical, probably-a-little-terrifying post, and outta nowhere, this dude shows up in my comments talmbout 'Seek help.'

Seek help? Seek help? Bitch, I am getting help! I got a whole-ass therapist, a real human one, with degrees and credentials and a little clipboard that say, ‘Yup, that’s Satan.’ I’m in there every Tuesday at 3 PM talking ‘bout my emotions and my childhood trauma in Hell. So don’t come at me like I ain’t got insurance! I been had therapy!

So I hit ‘em back like, ‘I’m already going to therapy, and I’m diagnosed by a psychologist, so I’m completely fine from seeking professional help.’ Y’know, real polite. Grown man shit. Now, I thought we was done. I thought he was gonna see that and be like, ‘My bad, Satan, you right, I apologize.’

BUT NO. This man hit me back talmbout ‘I honestly don’t care.’

You don’t care?? THEN WHY IS YOU HERE?! YOU TOOK TIME OUT YOUR PRECIOUS, BORING-ASS DAY TO TYPE ‘SEEK HELP’ TO A DEMON, BUT YOU DON’T CARE?! You could’ve been out there paying your bills, washing your car, learning a skill anything! But NO! You on my TikTok, in my comments, like you work for Heaven’s HR department!

So I hit ‘em with that smooth, classy response, ‘If you don’t care, then why comment on my video? The answer is simple: because you do care. Have a good day.’ And lemme tell you something, when you hit a hater with LOGIC?? Oh, they HATE THAT SHIT!

Now he sitting there, phone in his hand, mad as hell, like ‘DAMN… HE RIGHT.’

See, that’s what y’all don’t understand y’all can’t out-comment the Prince of Darkness, okay?! I BEEN DOIN’ THIS! Y’all just got Wi-Fi in 2005, I been handing out comebacks since the beginning of time! Bitch, I was there when the first hater said, ‘You ain’t really God’s favorite like that,’ and BOOM look at me now!

Now, y’all know how some people just can’t handle that heat. So this dude, right? He decides he don’t care about my well-being, cool, fine. But he ain't rollin' solo, no, no he brought his little friend with him. Now, I ain't talkin' ‘bout no tough dude, no. He brought a FRIEND with a DOG PROFILE PICTURE.

A DOG PICTURE! Now, you know you're in trouble when your homeboy is a Chihuahua on the internet. WHAT is a dog gonna do for you in an argument?! That dog can’t even type! He ain't even knowin’ how to spell ‘sophisticated’ or ‘consequences,’ and you think a dog gonna save you in a comment war?!

But here's the best part! His friend tries to act like he came outta NOWHERE like, 'Oh, I just found this comment and felt like defending him!' Y’all, that’s the biggest lie I’ve ever heard in my existence. I’ve been around for centuries, I KNOW A SETUP WHEN I SEE IT! This dude wasn’t a random friend he was secretly your backup! And I’m not stupid, you didn’t fool ME, okay?

So you know what I did? I blocked that Chihuahua looking ass nigga, BOOM. Gone. Like Thanos snapped 'em outta existence. Now, after I hit the block button, I went looking for that other comment and what do I find? that whole video COMMENT GONE. The comment was gone like your self-respect when you tried to argue with Satan. What does that mean? It means either he DELETED the comment or BLOCKED me!

Now, if I had to block your friend and you blocked me? That’s proof, right there. It’s like I’m holding a mirror up to your whole situation and you see it. You secretly sent your friend to fight your battle, and then you ran away like a little BITCH. A real little BITCH, hiding behind a dog avatar like that’s gon’ save you. It’s like, 'You gonna send your friend to fight your demons, and then you run away like an internet coward? Aight. I got you.'

You’re not a warrior, you’re a bitch nigga. A real, certified bitch. And I don’t need no backup for that truth."
594,"17/2/2025.
So I woke up actually had my shirt ironed and went to school. Econ then maths. Then it was the investiture ceremony. So I got my chess captain badge presented it was kinda a drag and people were making fun of me but that's my life so gives a fuck. Any way they had a morning tea afterward they had really good sandyyeh not much else happened toybit yeh."
595,"Hello. I don't know where to start or what to say. This is all new to me and I think I will be using talk to text to get most of it all out. But I'm not sure where to begin. I guess I'll start with my earliest memory.
.
I was about three or four years old, living in Hawaii. I remember standing in the apartment in Honolulu, at the edge of the living room, in front of me was the kitchen, behind me into my left was living room, to my right was the bedroom. It was like I opened my eyes for the first time. I remember my first thoughts were"" I can see! I can think! I can hear!"" I was so excited because it felt like my eyes and mind and everything were open for the first time! I wanted to share that excitement, but that excitement was not shared. I ran to my mother who was sleeping in the bed in the middle of the afternoon. I hopped on the bed and said "" mommy! Mommy! I can think! I can see! I can.."" I didn't even finish the sentence before I was shoved to the ground. She got up out of bed screaming at me, and kicking me, hitting me as I tried crawled to the corner crying. She was screaming ""what the f*** is wrong with you you st**** piece of sh**?! Shut the f*** up! I'm trying to F****** sleep!"" She had stopped hitting me just to scream all that at me along with other profanities. And then she raised her fist again to hit me. I flinched. She stopped. And the anger and rage on her face, turned into a smile and laugh. I flinched as she bent down to pick me up and carry me into the bed. She said, "" I hit you because I love you, if I didn't hit you that would mean I did not love you."" As she gently rubbed my head and arm gave me kiss, told me she loved me and held me in bed. I was still sniveling, because of the tears and snot. She said, "" knock that shit off. A crybaby is a dead baby, cry, wine, b****, or moan and I'll give you a reason to cry because you'll be dead. ""
.
That sentence is a sentence she said almost all the time, almost every day for years. Both to cry baby one, and the, I hit you because I love you one.
.
That was the beginning of the nightmare of my life and my memories that has never left me.
.
It was confusing, because I was both terrified, and happy. The beatings happened often. She would make sure never to hit me in the head, she would grab and pull my hair but never hit me in the face. Body shots, leg shots and arm shots were always fair game. Not my wrists, I never knew why until recently right now saying all this out loud. I guess it would have looked more suspicious if my wrists were also bruised.
.
After beatings, and beatings, and beating, and beatings; she would take me out once or twice a month, to go rollerblading along the beach, go play it a park, and skate to an ice cream shop that had pineapple ice cream along with chocolate and strawberry all in one cup. I know now, she did those so I wouldn't say anything. Her biggest fear that she has never vocalized, but could be seen and you could tell, was being alone. She wanted somebody to love her unconditionally, and that's what I did. I was a child and didn't know any better. She would tell me that if I ever said anything to anyone, I'd be taken away from her, put into an orphanage, there would be broken glass everywhere, people would pour bleach in my shampoo or just plain right out on me, that I would be beaten and sexually abused. She told me if I ever told anyone what happens, it would be a whole lot worse than what happens with her. I thought it was normal. I didn't have friends at school to tell me otherwise. I may look white, but I'm actually mixed with a few things. The Russian and Irish genes just showed more than the Middle Eastern, native American, Mongolian, Spanish and North African genes. If anyone is not aware, native Hawaiians don't like white people much. I remember my first day of school ever, it was Kindergarten. There is a group of six girls who are playing tag. I went up to them and said, "" Hi! My name is (false name, but we will say for the story's sake) Tinker Bell! Can I play with you?"" They said ""Ew! Get away from us! We don't like the color of your hair or skin!"" I was sad, but then my mother pulled me back, and said in a talking voice, loud enough for other parents and kids to hear, "" F*** those girls. They're probably gonna be stipper or hookers when they grow up. Just leave them alone."" I should probably tell you, I had natural dirty blonde hair with natural highlights from the Sun, blue eyes, and as you can guess my skin was white, but, when I'm in the sunlight, I get a golden brown honey tan. I darken in the sunlight, I don't burn. Genetics. But that didn't matter. Not long after, class started. You would assume that we got straight into playing or learning motor skills, after we settled down, we were taught a brief history lesson. "" The white people came to the island and started killing us for food. "" everyone in class stared at me and would glance at me. And I felt horrible as a person. It didn't matter about my actual ethnicity, culture or anything. All I saw was a blonde hair and blue eyes. They saw that I could tan, but I was still White. I was still the enemy to them. Kindergarten was a blur of being bullied, but not just verbal bullying. Physical too. But it was Kindergarten so it wasn't so bad. First grade came around, that teacher was nicer than the kindergarten one, but the other kids still did not like me. I tried everything to be friends with everyone. I'd even play by myself so I didn't look too, what's the word, needy? Hoping someone would come up to me. And then eventually in first grade A group of kids did! I was so happy! Thinking to myself, ""do they really want to play with me?! This is amazing!"" I was just a kid. 5 years old, going to Turn 6. Back then, there was no state law saying you have to be 5 before starting kindergarten. I started kindergarten at 4 then turned 5. 
.
Are you ready for the story of the first time other kids actually wanted to play with me? I was so stupid. I was an idiot. But I was so so happy!
.
They said, "" let's play Horsey! ""
.
My young, naive and stupid self said, "" of course! Whatever you want to play!""
.
They proceeded to grab a rope, a jump rope of real rope.
.
They Twisted it around my neck full circle loop around. They said, ""Giddy Up horsey! Giddy up! Giddy up!""
.
It hurt. They were pulling one side of the rope and then the other back and forth. They would yank me backwards. I just tightened my neck and kept pulling forwards because I just wanted someone to play with. A couple of kids would pull all at once together, yanking me to the ground and telling me to get back up and to keep pulling. When I finally was not able to get back up, they dragged me around the yard, over tree stumps, with teachers watching. Not a teacher stepping in.
.
Then the bell rang. Saying recess was over. They let go of the Rope. I got up and turned to them, and said, "" that was fun! Let's play again! "" then they said, ""you're so stupid."" And laughed. I laughed along with them in hopes of being friends. But it was just more of the same.
.
There was a park across the street from the school that I'd go to to wait for my mother to pick me up for hours. That's when the older kids in grade three four and five would also be there. And then they torment me and laugh, and I would laugh along. Even if I screamed stop, they would still laugh. They would chase me around the park, and push me to the ground. There'll be times where I would run into the girls bathroom into a stall, and hope they would leave me alone or go away. But they would come in and throw mad at me or rocks, sometimes both. It was just the daily routine. Even if I was in the bathroom to actually use the bathroom, they would still do it, but then they would make fun of me and say, ""Ew! The haole is peeing! You're so gross!"" But, for whatever reason. I thought that when they said that, that meant the other times I came into the bathroom to hide, it meant they were actually playing with me. Even when it felt like torment.
.
Then second grade came. And I had a horrid teacher. I won't say her name, but I will never forget it.
.
Day one of the first day of class of second grade, when the teacher saw me and saw that I was white, she got straight to it. She put my desk in the back of the class away from everyone else, who's all desks were in groups of four. And my desk wasn't just in the back, it faced the back wall, making me have to turn all the way around and try my hardest to see what she wrote on the board. When I asked her why, she said it was because I was a distraction to the others. I thought that meant I behaved badly. Even on the first day, when lunch came, the lunch bell rang, I don't know why or how, but I got lunch detention. I was not allowed to go to lunch. I had to stay sitting in the classroom by myself. All the kids left the classroom and wasn't allowed in during lunch, and even the teacher left most of the time, leaving me to myself. After the first couple weeks of that being an everyday thing, I asked her if I could go grab the lunch and bring it back here so I can eat here. She said ""That's not how lunch detention works.""
.
I was so, so, so hungry. I resorted to tearing small pieces of paper off the corners of my papers of the sentences I had to write, and eat those corners of paper. I would eat the erasers of my pencils. The lead from my pencils. And eventually, I started not only eating my fingernails, but the Skins around my fingernails. I even bit off insides of my cheeks and ate them because I was so hungry. I didn't have breakfast at home, my mother worked managing clubs at night so she'd sleep in till time to leave for school. And I wasn't allowed to have lunch at school, I was 6 years old turning 7. Sometimes when the teacher wasn't in the classroom for lunch, I'd sneak to the nearest trash can and pull out some of the other kids lunches. I'd eat pieces of already eaten apples, bite or two of rice, if I was lucky, someone wouldn't eat the turkey with gravy all the way. One day I was caught digging through trash, and the teacher stayed in the classroom with me making me write sentences, don't remember exactly what they were but they were along the lines of picking that trash is dirty and I was bad for it.
.
One day in the middle of the school year I came home from school, and I told my mother I wanted to quit school. She asked me ""why? I thought you loved it?""
.
I showed her my progress folder. All class assignments and homeworks and such. Everything was always marked wrong in red. My mother looked over it. And she started cursing, ""I'm not a f****** genius, but all these are correct! Why the F*** are they marked wrong?!"" My mother waited a week or two for a parent-teacher conference. On the day it was my mother's turn, the teacher was conveniently absent and she met with the substitute. My mother did not like that. So she came to school with me everyday for a couple days until the teacher was there. It was before school started, as all kids were lined up ready to come in the classroom with some parents there. My mother told her that she was hoping to speak to her because of the Parent-Teacher conference, and the teacher tried to say oh I was absent but my substitute was here and she was supposed to do it with you. My mother said she's not her teacher you are. She asked, what would you like to discuss? Now mind you there are a bunch of six and seven-year-old kids coming into the class and showing up at school as this conversation is happening, remember that. She said while pulling out my folder, "" I may not be a f****** genius, but I mean correct. Would you care to explain? "" my teacher then said, ""Oh! I'm so sorry! I just get headaches sometimes and mix things up. I'll fix that."" At that same time as soon as she finished saying that, she snatched some folders from other kids that were in their hands, open them up and found the same worksheets I had that were marked red, and she looked at them and saw that their correct answers were marked correct, but all my correct answers were marked wrong making me believe I was stupid. Then my mother said, "" so you take it out on my kid? Because their answers are correct and marked correct, but my daughters is correct but marked wrong. Who the f*** do you think you are? "" the teacher said, "" excuse me?"" Then my mom buffed up, and screamed at her in front of kids and parents, "" who the f*** do you think you are taking your b******* out on my f****** daughter?! Is this really because she's f****** white?! You've got to be some type of stupid ass mother f****** b**** to try and pull some b******* like that! I better not find out this s*** is f****** happening again! "" and then my mother proceeds to spit in her face. From that day forward my mother was not allowed to have any sort of parent-teacher conference without a police officer present. That was after winter break. After that day, my desk was back with the other kids, my correct answers were marked correct, wrong answers marked wrong, I never had lunch detention again. But then I was back on the playground with kids that hated me.
.
Then came 3rd grade, and we got a new girl. I know her name, but for the sake of this, I'll call her star. Star was half white and half Hawaiian. But she looked full White, so she made sure that her Hawaiian father always took her to school so she would not be grouped up with me. 
.
I should also let you know, that each grade level there was either one or two white kids in each grade. It was an extreme Rarity if there was three. We were all considered Haole's. No if's, and's, or but's. 
.
She was accepted as another Islander almost straight off the bat. I made the mistake of thinking that we could be friends. I would talk to her and be nice to her, and I thought she was nice to me too. She would talk nicely to me when no one else was around. Ignored me when other people were around. But I thought I had a secret friend! I was so happy.
.
Then one day, I get called into the principal's office. The principal said, "" I just talked to Stars parents, they said you've been bullying their daughter. Have you?"" I was extremely shocked! I said, "" she's my friend! No! She's only friends with me when no one else is around!"" The principal said, "" just stay away from her. It will resolve itself. ""
.
So I stayed away from her, played by myself in the yard, as I always did. Of course there would be people randomly throwing dirt mud or rocks at me, but at that point it was a game to me. Dodging it almost like dodgeball. It's in a week later, I get called back into the principal's office. The principal said, "" I just talked to Stars parents again, and they say you're still bullying her. Calling her names, pulling her hair. Do you have anything to say about that? "" I said, "" I haven't done anything to her! I swear! I promise! I haven't even talked to her! "" the principal then came up with an idea. Every lunch, I would go grab lunch and bring it to her office. We would have lunch together and I would stay in her office during the whole lunch. She brought out puzzles for me to do. I was in her office every day for almost 2 weeks. Recess and lunch. Then, she told me, "" the strangest thing just happened. I just spoke to Stars parents again. They said you've been bullying and harassing her everyday at lunch and recess! They were yelling at me because I wasn't getting a handle on you. I told them, that that was so funny since every single day for the last 2 weeks, every single lunch and recess, you've been in my office with me. I told them you have had no contact with her whatsoever. I also told them how I thought it was funny how that could happen. "" she then apologized and said if I wanted to have lunch on the yard I could, but she recommended that I stayed having lunch with her everyday. And so I did.
.
One day we got these two new girls, both hawaiian, moved from another Island to ours. It was the middle of the school year. It was their first day, after school at the park across the street. They were swinging on the swing, and they talked to me. They were sisters. Then the older kids came. 4th and 5th graders. They shoved the sisters off the swings and exclaimed it was their turn. I yelled at them, ""Stop! Leave them alone! It's their first day! Be nice!"" The group of 7 boys turned to me and said, ""ooh, look at that! The haole is talking and making demands. What were you just trying to say?"" I repeated to them, but softer as they walked closer, ""I said it's their first day and they are new, please be nice to them."" The sisters just stood there next to the swings staring at me. They said, "" oh really? I guess that means we should mess with you then instead, huh? "" Then, They all ran at me. I ran up the playground equipment, but they all blocked all the exits. One climbed up the slide, 2 behind me coming up stairs, another took the other set of stairs to the side, one at the bottom of the slide and 2 just standing there on stand by. I looked over to the girls and saw them run off, and I was relived they were okay and wouldn't have to go through this. As they inch closer, I jumped off the edge of the playground equipment, landing on my feet and hand, then started running... all 7 of them ran after me... it was a matter of maybe 15 seconds or less that all of them caught up to me. One of them shoved me to the ground, a few of them grabbed my legs and dragged me across the park with my face running through the mud, getting cuts from rocks. They dropped my legs and they all started, all at once, kicking me in the face, stomping on my stomach, spitting on me, shoving my face into the dirt, banging my head into the ground... I knew they wanted me dead. I knew my mother wanted me dead. And I wanted to die. I was about 8 years old. And then one of them ran to grab a soccer ball, and they kicked it at me over and over. As if I was the net. That beating went on for more than 2 minutes. I thought I was finally going to die. And then I hear shouting!"" Stop it! Get away from her! What are you doing?!"" They all ran away. A mother came, sat me up and asked me if I was okay. I told her I was fine and that this was normal. My eye cut and bruised, both nose holes bleeding, blood running out of my mouth from busted lip, my hair a mess from it being pulled. She said, ""this is not okay, come with me."" She walked me back across the street to the school, into the office, the nurse cleaned me up and one of the office staff called my mother, but she did not pick up. My non blood uncle, a family friend, was emergency contact and pick me up from school. The office had me name names, it took a while for me to say their names because I did not want to be a snitch. ""snitches get stitches."" I went home, took a shower and fell asleep. The next day at school I get called into the office and only a couple of the boys were there in the wrong kid was there with a similar name. They made them say sorry to me and then the principal said, "" boys usually pick on girls that they like and think are cute. "" the boys looked disgusted at that comment. None of them were suspended or even got detention because it happened off campus after school hours.
.
I know I mentioned before my mother managed nightclubs. I don't think I mentioned she also did meth, coke and smoked weed. And of course she was surrounded by alcohol, so she also drank on occasion. I didn't always have a babysitter, so most the time I would stay the night in the clubs. If it was busy, I'd sleep in her office. If it was slow, I slept upstairs. All the girls would come up on their breaks to check up on me. They give me a, ""sleeping drink, it'll help you go to sleep."" They would also try to have fun with me showing me stuff to do on a pole to kill time. My mother's strippers were the only friends I had. The bouncers were the only friends I had. The only friends I had were all adults. But of course they weren't around outside of the nights that I spent there. I remember in kindergarten, I know we're going backwards but still, I made invites to every single kid in my class and some from other classes to come to my birthday party! I was so excited! I thought some would come! It was at a playground on the side of the beach, my mother got me a Pokemon Pikachu birthday cake. A giant one! But not a single kid showed up. The only people who came with the girls that worked for my mother, and some brought their kids but their kids ignored me because I was haole that didn't belong. 
.
I was being beaten at home, called names and yelled at being told that my mother wished I was never born. I was being bullied at school verbally and physically. There was even sexual things that happened to me and after school program, but I don't want to get into that.
.
After third grade when it became fourth grade, we were homeless and had to move schools.
.
I didn't mention that before I started even kindergarten, my mother and I were homeless, sometimes sleeping in cars, eating out of trash cans on occasion. Hence why I didn't really have a problem digging into it in second grade. In kindergarten we didn't have a place to sleep for a while, so after my mom 'picked me up from school' we would walk around for hours and then come back when everyone was gone and sleep in the playground equipment. She blames me for everything. In another post on another day, I'll explain some of why she blamed me. This is all from when I was three until I was 9 in 4th grade. My first day of school in 4th grade at a new school, I was chased around, I pretended we were playing tag. When they caught up to me, I had no idea that behind me was a pile of vomit from a kid who just threw up. They shoved me in it and laughed at me and called me gross.
.
I was just a child and wanted someone to play with me. To be nice to me. Something. Anything.
 .
At home I would get beat if I was too loud, beat if I was sad, beat if I was happy, beat if I was watching anything fantasy like princesses because, and I quote,"" you need to learn how to take a hit like a man, this is the real world not some fantasy world. B******* like that doesn't happen in real life. You need to learn to be strong. Emotion is a weakness. You need to learn man up because the world's not going to go easy on you. "" I learned to stop crying. I didn't cry when I was punched, kicked, pans thrown at me, Boombox thrown at me, chair thrown at me, whipped with a belt, with was a branch, hair pulled till I had bald spots in my head from it being pulled so much, I wasn't allowed to feel any emotion. If I was caught feeling emotion she would say and shed beat me, "" I'm gonna beat that cry baby b******* out of you. There's no room for that s*** in the real f****** world""
.
I'm going to end this portion of the diary saying I left Hawaii at 9 and a half, not even finishing fourth grade and moved to California. But that wasn't the end. There was more that happened in Hawaii, but that's all I'll share for now.
.
Remember, I used talk to text, so if anything did not make sense, I am not proofreading it. I hope it makes sense."
596,"Forgot to add to my diary yesterday lol but uh yesterday I baked again for the first time in forever with yeast  and I made buffalo chicken stromboli which turned out alright kinda burnt but good overall, the big problem I made was forgetting to buy ranch cuz damn was it not hitting without it lol.

Today though was a boring but productive day although it could've been more productive if it wasn't rain so hard. I wanna make peanut butter chocolate chip oatmeal cookies but I don't have some ingredients sadly.


Tomorrow I got a job interview and I'm pretty excited cuz it's really close by just a nice 30 minutes walk but the more I get in shape, it can easily turn into a 15 minute walk.

When I walked into work today there was nobody at a register. Most of the staff called out due to the extreme weather conditions. Before I walked in there were apparently almost no customers. Of course that was before I walked in.  
  
The manager told me there were probably fifteen customers before I came in. By the time I was at a register for twenty minutes there were at least fifteen customers. Half an hour later there were probably thirty more. People kept coming and coming and I was the only person at a register for most of the day.  
  
Vanessa was there too and she hopped on a register as well for some time. The managers seemed to assume that since the weather conditions were terrible not a lot of people would come. They were right for the first three hours of the day, but dead wrong afterwards. I know I am about 50% wrong when it comes to my expectations. I can add this to my reasons for why I should just eliminate expectations altogether.

600,"An app I use has tasks I need to do each day, and writing for ten minutes is one of them. Tonight, my writing is just going to be this. 

Dear Diary, 

I dislike talking about my feelings, so I’m just going to discuss books I’ve been enjoying. I am currently reading both “Harley Quinn: Ravenous” and “House of Leaves.” The first book is really fun, and despite the creative liberties the author took while writing it, it appeals to my DC-loving heart. 💚 the DC Icons series overall seems really interesting. I am looking forward to checking out the other books in it.  

As for “House of Leaves,” I’m not very far into it but I love the structure and how it breaks the typical mold of a book. With that one, you never know what to expect. That’s the kind of work I aspire to publish myself. Something weird, and something that keeps a person on their toes well past midnight. 

Anyway, I’m reaching the end of my ten minutes. Thanks, reddit, for letting me post here. I’m glad to have stuck with this task and completed a promise to myself that I would do so instead of letting my mental illness win again. "
601,"Yaaa yaaa yaaa I’m that broken girl that keeps rambling about her feelings. 

When I mentioned that I’m a giver…I love giving and buying people random things or just anything. Being raised in a family that has only ever taken from me, never pushed me to succeed, drains me emotionally and tells me everything is always my fault, definitely is a reason why that is one of my personal traits. 

I’m happy I didn’t turn out to be like them. The way they made and continue to make me feel, pushes me constantly to make sure the ones I care about, hear, see and feel that I genuinely care. 

Nothing and no one will stop me from being empathetic. No matter how much hurt and pain, I go through or put myself through or see others do onto others, I will always show compassion.

I know that I’m finally pushing myself to a stronger, healthier path. I know the hits will never stop coming. All I can do, is keep going, get back up every time I fall, and push myself even harder. 

I’m so proud of myself, for having no desire to repeat past coping mechanisms when feeling hurt and lost. I know what I need to do right now to feel even better, go to the gym. But, with certain things happening in my life right now, that isn’t an option. So I’m doing what I can do. 

Time to stop ranting about my feelings constantly. Time to stop drowning myself in sadness. 

Time to stop with the screen time on apps. While I’m hurting about closing this chapter, I need to get stronger, smarter and healthier.

I really do love him. More than he will ever see, hear, feel, know and understand. It kills me that I have to walk away and leave so much behind. I hate knowing I will never get to speak to him again. I hate that I have to do all this. Love is love. You can’t help it who you love and you can’t help it if they don’t love you back. 

When you’re in love you have to make compromises. So, I have to go. 

I’ll stop wasting my time on all the apps and social media and focus on living and growing in my life. 
I’ll stop projecting in my head the future I wanted to build with him. 
I’ll stop reminding myself I’m not his person, even though he is mine. 
I’ll spend my time reading all my self improvement books. 
I’ll spend my time getting rid of my unnecessary belongings. 
I’ll spend my time getting rid of my unworn clothes. 
I’ll spend my time changing my habits such as, eating, smoking and shopping. 
I’ll start trying new hobbies and activities  for healthier forms of temporary happiness. 
I’ll start practicing detachment from the job I love, the family I care about and the people I have bonded with over the last few years. 

I will miss everything and everyone so much. 
But who and what I will miss the most, is him and having him apart of my life. 

Godddd I need to stop crying. 
Done writing. 
I’m true to my words.
Time to start practicing what I’m preaching. 

Take care everyone. "

The snow is way too much. February weather is getting me concerned about driving. Hopefully my plans with my friends will go as planned, but if they need to be delayed, that’s fine too.  
  
Constantly shoveling the driveway is not too much of a problem. The snow is definitely not the worst thing to be dealing with, but it’s not the easiest either. Overall, I’m just grateful that I am not dealing with worse.

I was my own Valentine this year. This is not something I am ashamed of, but rather something I am proud of. I couldn’t have asked for a better Valentine; I’m happy to give myself the love I need.  
  
Self-loathing was something I have dealt with for a long time. Now it looks like that time is over. Why should I ever hate myself? Because some arsehole says something to try and make me insecure? Fuck them. They don’t matter. The only person whose thoughts matter about yourself is you. Putting yourself first might not be the easiest thing to do, but it is sure worth it.

605,"i love you. i love you so much and i should’ve said it sooner, i should’ve asked about your stupid lego sword sooner instead of asking where you stayed that day and arguing about it for no reason. i just wish you stayed and understood, but i will do better, i will do things right this time. i hope you accept a second chance of us trying again, and go for another shot, because i didn’t do it right and i want to try again this time, correctly. 

i love you i love you i love you i love you.
and i should’ve just done things right, everything was okay when it was just us two, but unfortunately i guess the involvement of other people just ruined it really. but i will change that when we try again, i want everything to be better again when we find ourselves together again. there’s always a piece of you in me and i’ll never get over it.

606,"Every day, I tell someone who I am that I am the Devil, Satan in the flesh and every time, I hear the same response: ""You're not the Devil. I don't see you as the Devil."" Blah, blah, blah that’s all I ever hear. And you know what’s funny? You’re not the first to say it, and you won’t be the last.

No matter how many times you say it, it won’t change a thing. Even if I do have a mental illness, your words won’t alter the course of it that’s not how it works. A mental health professional once told me the same thing: ""I don’t see you as the Devil. You’re not the Devil."" But the truth is, you don’t know that. You only perceive what you allow yourself to see. We exist in different realities, and you’re not part of mine, so it’s not your place to tell me who I am.

You’re not a therapist, and even if you were, your words would still be meaningless because they wouldn’t change a thing for me. Everyone keeps saying the same thing over and over, expecting a different result. I don’t care I really don’t. It will always be what it is.

I am that I am. I am who I am. And I’ll keep saying it until it’s burned into your minds, written in stone. But yeah, this is just me venting.

607,"Title: The Paradox of Belief and Evidence

I find it interesting how humans believe in God, yet the Bible is based on faith, not facts. If God were truly based on truth and facts, then Christianity would have overthrown all other religions, and Christianity would be the one true religion. But that's not the case, because Christianity, like many other religions, is based on faith and belief without concrete evidence.

You need concrete evidence for me to exist, and yet, when one of my friends says, ""I don't believe you, you don't seem like the devil,"" they fail to see the irony. They believe in God, but God’s existence can’t be proven or disproven either. In fact, there's more evidence against God's existence than for it, since belief in God is based on faith, not evidence. But no one has faith in me, the devil. Everyone wants to find evidence of my existence, yet the truth is, there's no clear evidence for or against either of us.

There's a reason why God doesn’t want me to have extraordinary powers. If I had these, I could easily prove the existence of Christianity. But God doesn't allow it, because that would interfere with the free will to believe what you choose. People expect me to have powers, but the truth is, I have limitations. I'm in a human body it can bleed, it can die, it feels pain, grows old, and eventually dies. I am limited to what I am today.

Yes, I am the devil, and it’s a sad reality. Test me with a lie detector. Ask me the same question: ""Are you Satan?"" The test will say yes, because I believe it. The lie detector measures belief, not truth. Even without concrete evidence, I know who I am, and that belief is what the test picks up.

615,"People often ask, ""What is the Mark of Cain?"" What did God do to Cain after he killed Abel? Some believe the mark was black skin, others say it was a literal physical mark, and some interpret it as a metaphorical mark. But there are many theories about what this mark actually represents.

Some believe the mark was a physical alteration like black skin or a distinct mark on his forehead something visible to all that signified Cain’s curse. Others say it was a metaphorical mark, symbolizing Cain’s separation from God and humanity, a spiritual scar that couldn’t be seen but was felt in his soul. Another theory suggests that the mark was a warning to others an indication that Cain was under God's protection and no one should harm him, as God would avenge him sevenfold.

Now I will tell you from Satan himself, me, what the mark actually is: The Mark of Cain wasn't a literal mark at all. It was a promise a unique promise God made to Cain, and it was unlike any promise God had made before or would ever make again. This promise wasn't about protection or forgiveness. Instead, it was a curse that doomed Cain to an eternity in hell. When Cain died, he would go to hell, and he would remain there forever. He would never be allowed to escape, no matter how much he regretted his actions. Even God couldn't or wouldn't let him out. This was his fate as the first murderer, and it was a punishment that had no end.

God didn’t want Cain to be killed by anyone, so He protected him. Cain lived a long, healthy life, free from sickness or danger. God gave him this protection, knowing that his life would end only when it was time to begin his eternal torment. God kept him safe until his death of old age, for that would be the moment when his hell began.

Cain lived with the fear of this eternal damnation, knowing that, no matter what, he would be marked for hell. This was a curse that couldn’t be undone, and the mark wasn’t just a symbol; it was the eternal seal of his damnation. Some theories suggest the mark could also represent his inner torment, the knowledge that he would never escape the consequences of his actions. Others think the mark could be tied to a personal punishment, like being tormented by guilt or regret that he would carry forever.

No matter how you interpret it, the Mark of Cain is about more than just a physical or metaphorical sign. It is about eternal consequence a reminder that Cain’s sin was the first, and he would bear the weight of it forever. He was cursed to live in fear of his destiny until his death, knowing that his actions had sealed his fate. That is the true meaning of the Mark of Cain.

616,"2025 February 13: Dear Diary,

I convinced two people today that I am from Queensland, Australia. My friends were not at work today so I was incredibly bored. When I used to work at Target in high school I would always put on either a fake British or Southern accent to have some fun. Today I thought about doing a fake Australian accent.  
  
Last night I spent a little bit of time trying to imitate the voice of Pim from Smiling Friends and I thought I did an alright job. Many of the customers either didn’t notice or didn’t care that I was putting on a voice until one customer broke the silence.  
  
“Are you from Australia?” She asked.  
  
“Yeah, Queensland,” I replied knowing that the show Bluey takes place in Brisbane.  
  
I’m not sure if the voice I was doing was even a Queensland accent, but the customer believed it. I felt bad about lying to the customer as I am not someone who tends to lie often. However, I feel my actions were more in line with an actor than a liar.  
  
“Ah, so how are you liking it here?”  
  
“I think it’s really nice. I moved here a year ago. It’s a bit chilly but nice.”  
  
“Well the seasons are reversed, aren’t they?”  
  
“Absolutely,” I responded completely forgetting that fact.  
  
Although I briefly felt bad for lying I do think it is cool I was able to do some improv. The interaction helped bring my confidence up a little. Knowing that I could say something blatantly false, yet harmless felt so exciting. Making up a random story is something I have always wanted to do and it is unbelievable I actually pulled it off. The second customer was not as exciting.  
  
“What’s your accent?” She asked.  
  
“Queensland,” I replied smiling.  
  
“Ah, I could definitely pick up on it. It sounds nice.”  
  
“Thank you.”  
  
I didn’t think my accent would be any good at convincing people. I was just doing it to have some fun. If anything I thought people would be annoyed at me for putting on a fake accent. This experience can only be described as a mixture of hilarity and intrigue.

617,"Its 1am and my car alarm keeps going off every hour or so. My boyfriend seems to think it may be a battery issue because before today, I haven't driven it in a week. I drove for almost 1h30 today and I thought that would be enough. I'm just feeling frustrated because I don't know what to do. My boyfriend is in another city. I'm alone and don't know the first thing about cars. I've been dealing so well with my emotions until now. I just feel alone again "
618,"I know you want me to think everything is getting better. Don't fall for it!

619,"The story of Cain and Abel and my involvement.

Fast-forward to the time of Cain and Abel, and Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve, having created children together, named their two sons Cain and Abel. From the start, Cain and Abel were competitive, always trying to one-up each other. Cain always sought to be first but never quite achieved it, which led to Abel mocking him for his failures. The brothers constantly fought over who grew the best crops, who had the strongest physique, or who could do the most for their father. They argued over everything from whose livestock were healthier to who could carry more weight or handle tasks with greater skill. Their rivalry made them a real headache for Adam and Eve, I'm sure.

But then, that's when I showed up. Surprised, right? Well, you didn’t know this part because I didn’t exactly show up in person. No, I appeared in the mind of Cain, the one who was always striving for more, yet never felt good enough. That’s when my influence began.

I understood Cain. I knew what it was like to try and try without being seen, always falling short, so I decided to offer him some advice for the next time. I showed up because I could sense my father, God, was playing with his creations Cain and Abel watching them compete by offering their best livestock: cows, sheep, horses, and lambs. But Cain could never offer the finest. His animals were always second-rate, and it left God disappointed.

I spoke to Cain, saying, “I understand what you're going through. I can see the hatred growing inside you, like a seed. If you act on it, perhaps you'll finally make your mark. What I’m saying is, turn that hatred into power. Use it to beat him. This time, you’ll win.”

After I spoke, I vanished, leaving him with those words. I said them because I truly understood his struggle. I knew what it was like to feel overshadowed by siblings, to be left in the shadows of someone else’s light.

What I heard next shocked me. Cain, in a fit of rage, killed his brother with a stone. He bashed Abel’s head into the ground over and over, smashing the rock against his skull until blood poured from the wound. The blood cried out to God, and in response, God marked Cain, and when Cain died he cast him into a life of torment.

I didn’t see that coming. Maybe he took my words the wrong way, or maybe the weight of everything he’d been through finally broke him. I don’t know what drove him to commit such an act. What could’ve possibly made him go that far? All for what?

But I do know this: Cain was in Hell for his actions. That’s how I found out. I watched as he was forced to relive that moment over and over again. Not as Cain killing Abel, but Abel killing Cain with the same stone. Each time, Abel would scream, ""This is what you did to me!!!"" His voice filled with agony. It was as if the script had been flipped Abel was the one bringing the punishment now, and Cain was the one suffering. That was his torment, his eternal punishment. That’s how I learned what had truly happened, at least from Abel's vengeful perspective.

Maybe I should have stayed and watched over him, I could have prevented it but I didn't, I wish I knew but I can't change the past. 

Well that's the story of my involvement with Cain and able."

Weird day. So it started with band practice nothing out of the ordinary there. Was english and photo day. I had physics where we had a prac with strong neodymium magnum. The temptations to eat one was insane. Any way I went to a bible study of all things at break. Btw I'm Hindu. My friend convinced me to come I think he's trying to convert me. Any way it was a nice environment but also Hella uncomfortable. Other than that not much I went to my music lessons finished school stuff. And yeh not much at home either."
621,"Sometimes I wonder if I was meant to end up here, in this miserable existence called life. What is free will anyways. Does it even exist, or do surrounding circumstances and environments only give an illusion of choice? 

Life is a gift but it’s not pleasant, it’s full of hurt and disappointments. Since birth I had my whole life mapped out for me, was it always going to end up here, in this moment where I write out a diary on Reddit for random strangers to read. 

I am a very emotional person, nearly too emotional for the average population. I wish I could have been paired up with someone just as emotional as I am and feel that connection. I am not complaining though because currently I have a wonderful helpful man, who’s just not as emotionally receptive to me. 

Maybe differences make us stronger, I will be the emotional one this time. Sometimes I feel that we are incompatible with each other, but do relationships rely on sole compatibility with each other, or does it rely on it’s success. For example, two people may be madly in love, but two emotional souls will eventually break up because there’s nothing grounding them. Maybe that’s not the way to go.

How I ended up here, my choice of a mate, my choice to be a family, all was caused by illusion of choice. My path was carved out, written in the stars before I was even born. I hope it’s a good one going forward."
622,"Group therapy is going suspiciously okay. The staff are all very well informed and good at making me feel comfortable. I am intrigued because.... there is one male staff member in the entire program. I laid eyes on him today (I think) and uh oh he's cute. LOL. And I'm cute. So I can't help but wonder and fantasize. But no. No that would be heinously illegal so it's not something I would ever think about. And the truth is, sex is the last thing I need to focus on. I need to focus on ME and mean it this time. But what does focusing on me look like for me? For my authentic self's highest good? That's what I feel like this period of my life has been all about. Discovering that in its specific entirety and then fulfilling it. So for example, one of my identified skills is writing and one way I am applying that is by writing on Linkedin more frequently to get closer to my ultimate career goal. 

Then I got dinner with a super sweet guy in my town. I feel like I hit the lottery with him because we only met because I had wandered into his restaurant while he was working the tables. He revealed to me, over our meal that he has a girlfriend which only makes me feel safer in the friendship. But, it's soooo refreshing to meet a fellow young adult in my shitty small town which is usually old people and baby central. Suburban hell style. 

He was easy to talk to. Funny. Open minded. Willing to talk about deeper stuff but not overly pretentious or forceful about it. Good stuff. We agreed to keep in touch. I am hopeful that his girlfriend might become my friend too someday. But even just him on my ""team"" is something for me to thank God for. One of 1,000,000 things actually. So then I was buzzed and I took my buzzed little self to starbucks to reconnect with a new old friend. That went well, as I had thought. We are on similar paths right now so we definitely benefit from keeping in touch. 

In a way, the week has felt long. But I guess that makes sense because it entailed starting a new group therapy program which is a huge undertaking. Oh and I also only just recently got my laptop fixed again too, plus I ran into some money troubles which was totally my own fault. So yeah, long well. But all is well again. I am enjoying Handmaid's Tale in my pajamas. I will do my LED face mask tonight too. I am kind of dreading group therapy tomorrow but it's not because of anything sinister. It's just ""work"" to keep my mind focused on hard stuff for long periods of time and sit still while doing it too. I am excited because some of my friends want to do something fun on saturday to celebrate our single hood and blow off some steam. So that's like my light at the tunnel for now. Plus I was promised some valentines day gifts on friday heehee. Plus I am trying to go horseback riding soon. 

It's true what they say. ""This too shall pass."" Because that's how life goes. "

As planned I hung out with Ed at the mall today. It has been a while since I had seen him. We walked around the mall and sat in the food court. Our discussion led to art and its interpretation.  
  
“I remember watching The Labyrinth with David Bowie,” Ed started. “And I just remember talking about how it was a representation of life. The character David Bowie plays takes the main character’s brother and I feel that represents her childhood innocence. And she goes through this labyrinth with all the twists and turns and to me it represents life. I don’t know if this makes sense to you.”  
  
“It does,” I replied. “I have not seen the movie but I can tell what your description is about. I have been reflecting and I feel art is the most divine thing in life. It is human creation. I was rethinking some of the stories in the Old Testament and looking at them through a metaphorical lens. I still hate some of the stories, like the story of Abraham, but I think the story of the Exodus is really profound. I was watching an animated version of the story and at the beginning I was really agreeing with Moses. I found this strange because I remembered him as a tyrant, but he was fighting against the tyrannical Pharaoh to free the Hebrews. After they escape Egypt they aren’t very grateful and it makes sense why Moses is mad at them. Later in the story, Moses becomes just as much a tyrant as Pharaoh. I take the story as a cautionary tale of becoming your oppressor and that’s something I like to be mindful of.”  
  
“That makes sense,” He responded.  
  
Later we discussed creating our own art. He is a musician and I am a writer. Both of us have not been creating as much as we should have.  
  
“I worked on my short story for twenty minutes yesterday. I really need to get to a point where I only find writing fun so I don’t waste time,” I began.  
  
“Twenty minutes is good, but I understand,” Ed replied. “I certainly want to create more music as well.”  
  
“I was meditating on an anime opening yesterday. It was the opening to Your Lie In April. The story follows this guy who plays piano and I was thinking I should use my keyboard the way he uses his piano. The way notes make up a chord, letters make up a word.”  
  
“That’s a really good way of thinking of it. I haven’t meditated much in a while, but I’m getting back into it.”  
  
I feel great after spending time with a friend. I initiated the plans and took charge for once. Initiating things is becoming a lot easier for me and hopefully I can bring myself to a point where it is completely effortless.  
  
Sincerely,

632,"Yesterday, I went to bed around 1:30 a.m. after getting some groundwork done for a no-code workshop, so except for having only about three hours of sleep, it was a morning like any other. Sure, I was a bit tired, but armed with the determination to nap at the office after my workout like before, I headed out. Maybe it was because I mentioned it to my older friends yesterday that today, while working out, they were pretty serious and put in some decent effort, even if not 100% satisfied, which made it okay. Of course, without a stronger partner to push me, there were no forced repetitions, so the volume was a bit less overall, but compared to my previous records, it had increased considerably, so I felt good about it.

As soon as I got to the office, I worked a bit on some freelance projects. I had a simple lunch and intended to take a short nap, but unsurprisingly, I ended up sleeping for almost two hours. I got straight into work right after waking up. There was feedback on the work I pulled an all-nighter for, so I made the edits and did a new A/B test as required. It sounds brief, but it took about four hours. However, since it was all stuff I was already familiar with, it felt more like grunt work and didn’t leave much of an impression.

I got off work earlier than usual, came home, washed up, and continued analyzing financial statements that I'd been working on before. Well... it was really an uneventful day. Since I didn't get much sleep yesterday, I should definitely hit the hay early tonight."

This is the path god wanted me to walk on.

638,"2025 February 11: Dear Diary,

I feel I should explain the name I sign off these entries with. Torinico. The name is a combination of nicknames used for the proper names of Nicholas and Victoria. I consider both of these names to be my name. I can go by Nicholas, Nico, Victoria, or Tori. However, using the name Torinico is perfect for people who do not know me.  
  
Nicholas and Victoria are two aspects of me, they both influence my spirit. I do not have Dissociative Identity Disorder, this is a spiritual thing revolving around my gender identity. Both Victoria and Nicholas control my mind at once, neither one holds a monopoly.   
  
While interacting with humans most people refer to me as Nico. That is the name I have decided to present myself as when interacting with the human beings I see for brief instances. Tori is somewhat of a secret. She comes out to closer friends who she knows she can trust. No longer must she remain a secret. Tori has just as much a right to present herself as Nico does. This is why I sign my name as Torinico. They both need to be seen by the world. The two are inseparable and neither should act otherwise. Their union is perfect.  
  
Sincerely,  
  
Torinico"
639,"### Today's Diary ###

My morning routine... no need to explain it anymore. I woke up at 5, took the first subway, and headed to the gym. However, today I think I used my spare time more efficiently. Usually, when there are too many people during transit, I tend to let time pass idly by. But today, I read an e-book, so I made somewhat good use of my time. 

Today's workout left me a bit irritated... or should I say angry? As I mentioned before, I've been working out while teaching an older brother and sister, and it seemed like they weren't taking it seriously. Not that it was obvious—they do follow my routine grudgingly, which is rare. 

But, the point that triggered me was that they still had the energy to joke around after we finished working out. After one set, I feel chills and exhaustion, and for at least three minutes, I have no energy to do anything else. Yet, while I'm doing my set, I see them lounging around at another machine and giggling, which made me see red. In other words, they didn't give their all in the last set. I don't even have my headphones to get hyped up, and raising my performance was annoying as it is, but seeing them slack off made me feel like I'd end up just like them—and that fear quickly turned into anger.

I talked to the brother about it after the workout but didn’t say anything to the sister. I had a previous experience where talking about it emotionally worsened the situation, and I'm still not sure how to communicate effectively with women without triggering their emotions, so I decided to leave it be. Luckily, the brother knows women well, so I thought it would be good if he could pass the message. 

I told him directly that it’s hard to tolerate them slacking off to the point of subtly threatening my motivation, especially when I'm teaching them for free in my own time, and they neither follow my way nor suggest a better one. Honestly, there was more I wanted to say. My fear was triggered, and I wondered if it was an attempt to weaken me and return me to my old self. If they disliked me so much that it seemed like a calculated challenge, I’d accept it. But if this was some Japanese company bullying-style, where they seemed nice on the surface but subtly made things uncomfortable, I'd want them to quit immediately. Or if, after all this effort, they’re planning to stop working out at the end of the month, I wish they'd never come back to me.

So many thoughts ran through my head, but I tried my best to convey my feelings rationally. Of course, it wasn’t as calm as I'm making it sound now. Anyway, I got them to promise they won’t slack off again. Looking back, I wonder if I was too harsh, considering they try hard too. Hmm... No, I think I'd be angrier if they worked hard when I wasn't around but slacked off in front of me.

After the workout, I went straight to the office. I wrapped up the video editing I had been doing, had lunch, and worked. Nothing special happened, but if I had to pick, I was struggling with errors connecting code and no-code. The boss is excellent with no-code tools but can’t code at all, while the new developer is phenomenal at coding but clueless about no-code tools. Luckily, I had come across the error while studying JS, and though I struggled, I managed to identify the problem's cause. To be honest, the code was really long, and without the developer memorizing and finding the part I pointed out, it would have taken forever.

On my way home, it was crowded, so I mostly read an e-book or watched podcasts and speeches by Sam Altman or Elon Musk. While watching, a sudden thought occurred to me: Am I not evaluating myself properly? This diary also started from that view, but unlike workouts that can be quantitatively evaluated, the problem is these can’t, making objective evaluation impossible. So I wondered if I had been pointlessly wandering and misprioritizing my tasks.

Although, on the other hand, since I don’t know an evaluation method yet, even trying now would lead to many trial-and-error experiences with no big difference. But... I thought it's something I have to try if I want to change. There's a no-code society meeting at 10 PM, so I did a deep research with ChatGPT on that topic while writing this diary. During the remaining time, I think I'll ponder developing a self-evaluation method with AI."
640,"So, where do I begin? Well… I’m the Devil, created by God, just like my siblings. We had a great home, a place we called paradise Heaven, as my Father named it. Everything was perfect. That was until you humans came along and disrupted everything.

My Father became fascinated with a project He called humanity mortals. He crafted the universe, filling it with stars, galaxies, and wonders beyond human discovery. Then, He turned His attention to Earth, shaping the waters, the land, the trees everything.

The first beings He created were the animals. The birds, the bees, the lions, the tigers, the giraffes, the elephants you know, the usual creatures. Then came humanity.

The first human He created was Adam, formed from dust and dirt. My Father breathed life into him, and the particles that made up the earth transformed into warm, living flesh. But Adam was not alone for long.

You might expect me to say He created Eve next, but no the first woman was Lilith. That, however, is a long story, and I’ll get to it.

When my Father created Lilith, He made her the same way He had made Adam, from the earth. Then, He laid out the rules for them both: Do not eat from the Tree of Life, or you will surely die. Whatever that was supposed to mean…

And they took it well. They agreed, just as they should have, and went on with their lives, exploring the garden and playing with the animals. At first, they were wary, fearing the creatures might harm them. But God reassured them, saying they had nothing to fear as long as they did not intend harm. So, they continued enjoying their time, carefree and unbothered.

Then, a few days later by earthly time God gathered all the angels and archangels. He called us down to Earth to witness His latest creation. He was eager to show us what He had made. So, we descended, standing on the ground He had formed, watching from a distance as He spoke.

""Look at what I have made,"" He said. ""Is it not beautiful?""

Michael and I agreed, as did Jesus, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, and the rest of the archangels.

But then, He said something unexpected. He told us He wanted us to bow before His creation, to adore them, to cherish them even more than we did Him. He wanted us to serve them, to shower them with love and devotion.

That struck me as… strange. Unusual. This was not like God. It unsettled me.

I couldn’t do it. I wouldn’t do it. I would never bow to humanity. We, the angels, were far greater than they were. It felt absurd like asking a father to bow before his own children, like making gods kneel before ants.

And because of that one thought because I refused to bow to humans everything spiraled out of control. That was when I fell.

God called it pride, said I was too prideful. But that wasn’t the truth. It wasn’t about pride; it was about reason. I simply saw no justification for worshiping them. I was already devoted to Him. So, which was it? What did He really want? You can’t have it both ways. You can’t create me with free will and then expect blind submission. It wasn’t in my nature to kneel not to them.

So, I rebelled. I refused. And for that, I left.

I was furious.

That’s when I sought out Lilith. She was different. She questioned things too. She saw through the illusion of obedience. So, I whispered a secret to her.

""If you eat the forbidden fruit, you will become like God. You will be powerful beyond what you were made to be.""

She hesitated, but the temptation was there. I told her to keep it to herself, to act as if nothing had happened. And so, she took a bite.

I never told her my true reason for tempting her. It wasn’t just about rebellion it was about awakening. That fruit didn’t just grant the knowledge of good and evil; it unlocked intelligence. True intelligence. The kind that set humans apart from animals.

Days passed. Then weeks. And soon, Lilith changed.

She no longer wanted to be Adam’s plaything. She had her own desires, her own will. She refused to be a mere companion crafted for his comfort. She saw herself as more.

So, she ran.

Adam noticed her absence and cried out to God, begging for her return. So, He sent three angels Gabriel, Uriel, and Raphael to bring her back. They found her, pleaded with her. But she refused. She kept running.

And when I learned of her escape, I went after her myself.

I don’t know why, but around her, I felt different. As if we shared the same fire, the same ideals. So, I stayed. I taught her the knowledge I possessed, the arts that humans would one day call witchcraft. But to us, it was something far greater. So it's been days since she ran I would say 3 days.

Then, an idea struck me to do something for Lilith.

""If you want revenge on Adam,"" I told her, ""return to the garden. Take the form of a serpent. Convince him to eat the fruit. And watch it all crumble.""

She agreed.

But before she could act, she needed to become like me a shapeshifter. She studied, learned, and changed. And we both knew that if she succeeded, history would blame me. Not her.

I would be the serpent.

And to this day, no one knows the truth.

Until now.

So Lilith went back.

She returned to the garden, seething with purpose. Under the moon’s pale glow, she whispered the incantations, feeling her form shift, her limbs dissolve, her body elongate. Scales rippled across her skin as she coiled herself around the forbidden tree. Now a serpent, she slithered down from its branches, hanging just above where Adam and another woman lay sleeping beneath the Tree of Life.

Another woman.

Lilith hadn’t known God created someone new for Adam. The sight of her peacefully resting in the place she once belonged stung. But she didn’t let it distract her. If anything, it only fueled her wrath.

She turned her attention to the sleeping woman, lowering herself toward her ear.

""Wake up.""

Eve stirred, her eyes fluttering open. She gasped at the sight of the serpent, but before she could recoil, Lilith spoke again this time in a voice that wasn’t her own. A deep, male voice.

Eve hesitated but listened. She had no idea she was speaking to another woman.

""If you eat this fruit, you will become like God,"" Lilith whispered. ""You will understand good and evil. You will see the world for what it truly is.""

Eve hesitated, glancing up at the forbidden fruit. ""But God said if I eat it, I will surely die.""

Lilith let out a low, almost amused hiss.

""God is lying. Eat it, and you will see for yourself.""

Eve’s fingers trembled as she reached for the fruit. She plucked it, brought it to her lips, and took a bite.

The moment the juices touched her tongue, her eyes widened. A rush of understanding surged through her an overwhelming awareness of everything. The world around her shifted, sharpened. She looked down at herself, and for the first time, she saw her nakedness, her vulnerability, her very existence laid bare.

She turned back to the serpent, confusion and fear in her gaze. But when she looked again Lilith was gone.

Eve clutched the fruit and shook Adam awake. He groggily rubbed his eyes. ""What is it?""

Then he saw the fruit in her hand.

His heart pounded. ""Did you eat that?""

She nodded, her breath shaky. ""The snake told me to. And... I see everything now. You have to try it.""

Adam hesitated, staring at her in horror. But curiosity gnawed at him. ""Are you sure?""

""Yes,"" Eve whispered. ""Take a bite.""

And he did.

The moment the fruit passed his lips, the world shifted for him too. His vision expanded colors deepened, shadows stretched. He saw himself truly saw and he knew. He was naked. Vulnerable.

For two days, they remained in the garden, but everything felt different. A heaviness clung to the air. The animals that once moved in harmony now eyed each other with suspicion. Growls rumbled where there had once been silence. Birds no longer sang in perfect melody. The sky darkened, losing its golden warmth, turning a dull, somber blue.

Then, God returned.

His presence rippled through the garden like a storm brewing on the horizon. His voice thundered, shaking the very ground beneath them.

""Adam! Eve! Where are you?""

Fear gripped them. They hid among the bushes, trembling.

""Come out.""

Slowly, they emerged, clutching makeshift coverings around their bodies, shame and dread weighing them down.

God’s gaze fell upon them.

""Did you eat from the tree I commanded you not to?""

Silence.

Then, Eve swallowed hard and gave a small, almost imperceptible nod.

""Yes.""

A heavy silence settled over them.

God’s disappointment was a force unto itself. And then, the world broke.

The animals turned on one another snarls, bites, blood. Where once there was peace, now there was hunger. The air thickened with tension. The sky dimmed, losing its eternal light.

And God’s judgment fell.

""Leave.""

Banished.

And so, Adam and Eve stepped beyond the gates of paradise into a world they had unknowingly remade.

And Lilith watched from afar.

Smiling.

So, you must be wondering why did I do it?

Why did I give her the idea? Why did I push her toward it?

Simple. I needed to prove something not just to myself, but to him.

Humanity was flawed. It never should have been created in the first place.

But Dad thought otherwise. He believed his creation was so perfect that we all of us should bow down to it. Worship it. Serve it. But I knew better. I saw the cracks, the imperfections. And I knew, eventually, they would break.

And tell me this why put that tree there in the first place?

That’s like placing something dangerous within a child’s reach and then blaming the child for touching it. Why create temptation only to forbid it? It wasn’t about obedience. It wasn’t even about free will.

It was a test.

A cruel, calculated test to see if his creation could blindly follow his rules. A setup designed to fail. Because perfection isn’t real not unless you control every single aspect of something, and at that point, it’s not perfection. It’s just control.

And that’s the difference between being perfect and being a control freak.

So, yeah. That’s the story.

That’s how Lilith, Adam, Eve, and I changed everything. That’s how humanity got a hold of witchcraft because Lilith taught them. She passed down the knowledge, gave them the tools.

And as for her? She moved on. Fell in love with Cain’s brother.

And yeah, maybe I was a little jealous.

For a while, it was just us. But she needed someone different someone her age. And let’s be honest, I was too old for her anyway. A few thousand years old, while she was basically a newborn.

But in the end, it didn’t matter.

Because the world had already changed.

And that was the real point all along."

What does that mean and how will I do that? No clue ig get rid of carbs and walk more idk maybe I'll start to walk to my gym."
643,"It's always interesting for me, the experience of starting something new. It's always a mixed bag of feelings, positive and negative. On the one hand, the staff seemed to be ""my kind of people"". Fellow women and on the younger side, those people tend to have an easier time understanding my trauma and neurodivergent symptoms, than most. I feel exceedingly privileged and grateful to have found the right therapy program for me and my issues, and that the program was able to get a insurance case approval so that they were financially and logistically feasible for myself. That's heroic in my eyes. They are saving my life. It's the kind actions of people like that, that allows me to believe ""most people are good"" even in the face of my C-PTSD diagnosis, even though the rapes and the trauma showed me just how ugly and horrible some of humanity can be sometimes, I am still able to believe in our overall strength and beauty as a species. And I do celebrate that in myself. 

  
But. I won't lie. I am frustrated. Frustrated that I am not farther along in my healing journey and career by now. Frustrated that it's me putting in the work to get better all while the people who abused me and others in criminal ways coast through life unscathed and beloved. I feel scared. Scared about what might or might not happen while I am in the program. What if something triggers me and I have to leave early? Wouldn't be the first time. Or what if everyone there hates me and gives me the cold shoulder? Or what if the building explodes? And on and on the adhd and ptsd riddled brain goes, but I'm better at coping with such thoughts than I used to be. And I'm not alone in having issues like this, and the kind words of my support network is giving me a lot of hope. 

My intake clinician, she told me she has the same cat breed as me AND the cat has the same name as mine !!!!! I am taking that as a good omen. I am choosing to believe my beloved aunt, who left us for heaven last month, sent her to me as a sign that I am going to be okay and that this program is going to help me improve myself. Yes yes yes. She had beautiful blue eyes, the same kind my late Aunt had. It made me feel anxious to rehash some of my symptoms and history. But I also feel optimistic about being in a environment of people properly equipped and trained to understand it and heal. I did tell her a lie. But it was a little one. I am not going to lock up the razors in my house. I just don't want to. I don't think they're tempting enough to me right now to warrant that, but considering the birthday eve incident which I had, I don't blame her for trying. And I don't blame myself for placating the woman either but I also think I'm making the right choice for me personally because a girl needs her smooth legs! LOL! 

I hope that my fellow patients don't hate me tomorrow. I think I am going to pick out my outfit soon. And lay it out the night before. It's the fashion merchandising major in me but I've loved styling outfits ever since I was a little girl. I used to do it for my mom sometimes, pick out her pajamas and lay them out on the bed before she came home from her shift at the hospital. Than she'd model them for me and strike goofy poses in the outfit for me and make me laugh before wrapping me up in a big hug. I want to wear something that is equally comfortable, casual and inviting. I have a new journal and folder for the occasion too. Hopefully they let me keep it. They said we have to lock up our stuff when we check in, in the morning. 

That makes me feel safe. Because I am in the very unfortunate and somewhat unique position in which some of my past abusers were connected to organized crime networks which they abused to both stalk and threaten me, I am usually paranoid about who might be leaking information about me and my location with their phones. At my last group therapy program a fellow patient's phone camera loudly went off by accident I guess and it really triggered me, it made me feel like I was right back in that hotel room, drunk and being raped and having that rape filmed. So anyways, it will be an adjustment for a chronically online e girl like myself to practice screen time reduction, but it's a welcome one. I'm all for living in the moment. And fidget toys suffice. This feels like a right step in the right direction. I hope I'm making the team cheering me on in Heaven right now proud! "

645,"I ended a friendship. The man who I confessed my crush to, responded unexpectedly. He told me in order to be more desirable to a man like him, I would need to lose weight and be more feminine. I will never be more feminine and will not change my personality, but I am embarking on this weight loss journey to see what happens when I lose weight. 

I told him: “Hey. I don’t think I’m capable of having a friendship with you at this time. I hope you understand.”

And then blocked his number. I have no idea whether he saw it or responded.

I am sad. Not at his rejection, because everyone is entitled to their preferences, but because once again I encountered a dime a dozen superficial man who values looks over substance.

I am getting ready for a flight. While I am back in the USA, I scheduled an appointment to get Botox and lip fillers. I don’t want to, but it’s temporary. I am just going all into this appearance thing, to see what happens. 

I am also going to try and catalog what I eat in a day today I had an iced latte with oat milk. No sweetener. Just coffee and milk. 

I also had a homemade rosemary salt bagel, with dill cream cheese, lettuce, arugula, onion, jalapeño, tomato, and turkey. I know. I fat girl like me shouldn’t eat carbs. No bagel. No cream cheese, but I will cut the calories elsewhere. Maybe do a “snake meal” today, where I only eat once. 

UPDATE: it’s now around 3:00pm. In addition. To the above, I had a second coffee with only oat milk. No sweetener. Also a skinny can of arancita pelligrino (116 calories). I am hungry, but I’m not eating anything else today. 

Update: it is now 8:30 pm. I had an unflavored  sparkling water on the plane and a mini bag of sun chips (80 calories.) I hate this. I resent doing this. But I am committed to seeing what happens if I lose weight. 

I wish I had found a man who cared about me when I wasn’t in my top physical shape. I wish he cared about me to go with me to the gym and we got in shape together. I know I will resent any man who likes me when/if I get fit. I will doubt his intent and I will never care about him the way I would have if he has loved me when I wasn’t in shape.

Other stats:

1. I haven’t had sex since October 2021 (more by choice, as I need an emotional connection for intimacy.”
2. I swear a size 11 (I know, “so gross” 🙄) 
3. My ex husband is happily moved on with a physically beautiful woman, who is everything I am not. She is the feminine, submissive kind that many men want. That will never be me. 
4. I haven’t stepped on a scale, but guess I weigh between 180-190. 


Experiment Goals:

1. Weight: 125-150 (I don’t know, it depends on what I look like). 
2. Size: 6-8 
3. Dating: Find a man to court me and see how I respond to this. 

Right now, if I added photos to myself as I am now, I could get 100 men yo swipe right in a few hours. But maybe only 5-10 matches and one or two low quality messages (e.g. “hi. How are you.” Nothing of substance. I wonder if the effort of men increases with weight loss? 

I pray that I find my man before I lose weight, so I know he likes me for me. I am very afraid of losing weight and finding someone, but being incapable of loving him because of doubting his intention. 

Sigh…..😔

646,"i have constantly feels like im not worth of anything. im not best at anything, not good at anything. might say im an avergae but somehow feels like a living failure."
647,"Today, I had already booked a day off in advance and did a short-term gig guiding high school students around my university. The pay was pretty decent, and a junior who could provide feedback asked me for the favor, so I agreed.

After my 35km long-distance run yesterday, my recovery wasn't complete. To be honest, since last week after my leg workout, my right knee felt a bit off, and the run acted as a trigger, causing pain if pressure was applied. However, I couldn't skip exercising, so I wore a knee brace and did seated dumbbell shoulder presses instead of the standing barbell shoulder press that puts all the weight on the lower body.

What surprised me was that I had previously done 20 reps with 24kg dumbbells, and when I increased to 26kg, I still managed 18 reps. Dumbbells are generally harder to balance than barbells, so lifting heavier weights is usually tougher. Yet, surprisingly, I felt like I could do more than 10 reps with 30kg. With the barbell, my max was 8 reps at 60kg, but with this, I could potentially surpass that. But for the 30kg dumbbells, I’d need to use my knees to lift them, which made me worry about my knee giving out, so I stuck with 26kg. Other exercises were done as usual with progressive overload.

Even though it was technically a day off, the gym is close to my office, and the gig started at 3:30 PM, so I had enough time after my workout that ended at 10 AM to get some work done at the office. I worked on documents for a government support project. Since it was a government project, it was larger in scale, and I had just subscribed to ChatGPT Pro for deep research. I used it to its fullest to conduct research for drafting documents. I first laid out a basic outline and handed it over to Claude for feedback, exchanging questions and answers to list what needed to be researched. Then, I passed it to ChatGPT deep research to draft a preliminary version.

At about 1 PM, new team members arrived as my work was starting. Although I didn’t know them well, their quick grasp of the company's situation through just a few questions showed they were very smart. They seemed financially well-off and very competent, which I found enviable. I found out through a short conversation that they participated in the development of a mobile no-code tool called OhMyApp. I didn’t even know there was a mobile no-code tool available until I searched. However, the issue was it seemed the development also had to be done on a mobile device. Not that it couldn’t be done, but with Bubble releasing new mobile app development features, my interest waned. The key point, though, was having participated in the development of such remarkable tools was definitely impressive.

After a brief introduction, I left the office before the real work began as my time was up. Arriving at the school with about 20 minutes to spare, I debated waiting in a cafe with a book, but decided against it to save money and thinking the students might arrive early. So, I sat near the main gate reading a book while waiting. As expected, the students arrived early, and I began the tour as planned.

The tour itself was nothing special. Our engineering campus isn’t much to look at, and the students weren’t interested unless it was something flashy inside the buildings. During the last 20 minutes, I did some 1-on-5 mentoring, sharing my story of having to repeat a year. I felt confident telling it, but inside, I felt a bit awkward since I'm not perfect. I spoke about how intense mental stress led to panic disorder a few months in, how I had days where I accomplished nothing, and that it happened more than once. I’ve also overslept many times. I wasn’t giving 100% all the time. Sitting down and forcing myself to study was true, but I felt insecure about it because I knew I wasn’t always enough.

After the tour, I had dinner with the junior who helped get me feedback. I asked if there were any early adopters. Naturally, there weren't any. With an MVP that's a mess and only five participants, having early adopters would indeed be a miracle. I promised to apply the feedback and contact again, asking for their help once more.

We talked about various things, like how I’ve been doing recently and how I envy their networking skills. I tried asking questions a few times, but they always led to unexpected answers, resulting in the conversation being about 90% me answering their questions. This helped me organize my thoughts, though. They asked if I could be more specific about my dream, so I tried explaining it in more detail. It felt a bit more concrete than before. It was a decent conversation, like Momo from the novel who listens and helps find my time. Although I didn’t learn anything new about my junior, it felt like a meaningful exchange. Good communication is learning about oneself through others, after all.

Back home after dinner, I immediately showered. During my shower, I got a request from the no-code club to revise a page, but since it was something I needed to consider carefully, I said I’d think about it and was just pondering over it when another club member suggested meeting online tomorrow. I explained my situation, decided to mull it over till the next day, and arranged to meet online at 10 PM to work on it together.

Afterward, I read a bit of a JavaScript book, asked ChatGPT about parts I was curious about, studied for about an hour coding new things I learned. But for some reason, I started feeling extremely sleepy again. I always wonder why, but it seems I get almost narcoleptic levels of drowsiness whenever I sit down to study for a while."
648,"Never been one to accept no knowing an answer to a question, that’s why this question to me is the most infuriating question to date. What happens when someone dies?
I grew up in Roman Catholic family and they only thing I believed was that people either go to heaven or hell when they die depending on how they lived their lives. Unfortunately for my family I am a core Gen Z, I don’t just accept a yes or no answer I need facts and detailed explanations on everything question. So I did my own reach.
Indians believe people reincarnate, it’s an interesting theory knowing your friend isn’t really dead but just relocated to somewhere else where you have no clue where or what their new names and lives are, and interesting enough there are a lot of people who can prove this. Used to believe it in some extent but now I ain’t so sure about it. But still interesting theory.
In my country most people are religious, they believe people go to either heaven or hell, but I think this theory is the most flowed of them all, I am not trying to be biased here, I guess maybe it’s because I know this theory more than most since I was once one of the believers anyways. So, if the dead go to heaven or hell then who are the dead that are waiting to be resurrected when the time comes?. Still a comforting theory to know that your sweet mommy is in heaven watching after you and waiting for you to join her some day, right?
My theory on the other hand is that maybe we are dead who knows. Maybe you died a long time ago and your soul is in denial and has created a world where you are still alive and doing what you are doing. Maybe you died in your sleep and your brain is too scared to wake up since it knows it will be the end so it keeps on dreaming and dreaming till the brain actually fails to dream anymore and that’s when you truly die, whose to say. Or maybe you died and you’re currently watching a clown of yourself as if you were alive. But what do I know, after all these thoughts first came when I wanted to unalive myself and only tryna talk myself out of it.
But all in all, I wish someone would tell me for a fact what actually happens once the last breath is drawn."
649,"Ive been writing notes to him for months so send out on the day of my suicide. So far I'm on letter 28 (+ a Christmas card). Nothing in particular, I guess just explaining how I've been feeling and what lead up to this decision. I've almost been treating it like a diary but not quite. I don't know if he will even read them. "
650,"Sometimes I can get frustrated really fast like just thinking of a thought of a bad memory can ruin my mood, I don't like being frustrated and angry sometimes I just want to punch something or bang my head into a wall and then the bad thought start entering my head and man does it just sucks. I think I get my frustration from my mom because I don't think there has been a day where my mom wasn't angry once at someone or something, she also has a very short temper which can be embarrassing because yeah she can be a real Karen sometimes.
I still love my mom tho.

Though I feel bad because I get frustrated the more tired I am and my mom being a mom can be really annoying sometimes especially when she be asking me some dumb question and being like ""HUH???"", dawg omfg.

Anyway I don't wanna continue that ramble, let's talk about today.... I won't lie, the stress got to me and hit hard today and I fucked up. I feel into my mindless dopamine state. Ugh I fucking suck man, I swear imma end up homeless and crazy like fuck man sometimes I hate myself more than anything. I have achieved not much.

I think God don't like me lol."
651,"I'm unsure if anyone finds entertainment in reading about other peoples lives, but many many months ago I typed out a diary, and I decided to share a day of it. If anyone actually reads it and comments, I may post other days, but for now theres just this one. All nouns are changed for the reason of confidentiality.

  
\-----------------------------

Thursday, October 8th, 2024



Well, I got the brilliant idea to start a diary. I don’t know what else to say, I mean it's not like anyones gonna read it, just me. Well how should I start? Yesterday I went to sleep around 6pm, but yesterday is completely irrelevant to today. So I woke up at 4am this morning, I spent my morning waking up, I ate a bowl of cereal. I saw some headphones on my desk and I decided to bring them to school, so I was going to plug them into my computer to test them, but I remembered that I got another cord stuck in my headphone slot. So I took off the top of the computer and I spent all my time till 6:00am trying to get it out (never did). At 6am my grandpas alarm rang and usually he would come in my room and wake me up, but I guess a combination of the fact I was sleeping when he got home, my light was on, and my door was open, led him to infer I was already awake. Eventually, after about 5 minutes he walked in and said good morning. I already had gotten clothes on, and I also had taken a shower earlier (sorry for forgetting) so I was all ready for school. At 6:17 I went outside waited for the schoolbus. I sat in a chair and just waited, nothing special. At around 6:20, I heard the bus start coming up my road, so I walked down my driveway and stood there till the bus parked in front of my home. The doors opened, I walked in, and my bus driver said morning. I’m pretty sure her name is Cassidy but it might be Jamie (or thats the bus monitor). Cassidy has red(ish) hair, shes nice. So I sat down in the first seat to my left, pressed my knees against the bus wall, and just relaxed. 

After I get picked up, she goes up the big hill on my road until we reach the dead end, she turns around, and she goes down my street. Then she goes down the road after my street until she reaches the end of that. She’ll take a right, keep going, then turn on Blank Lane, where she’ll pick up a 7th grade blonde girl. The next stop is a girl named Emily. Emily also happens to be blonde, has a little bit of acne on her chin, wears pink glasses. It takes forever to go from Blank Lane, to Emily's home, at least it feels like it does. Right after Emily they pick up Addison, who coincidentally also happens to be a blonde. Addison certainly has some type of special needs, her voice is high pitch and obnoxious, but that doesn’t make her a bad person. Other than her squeaky voice, she’s actually a really good person. Although, I really don’t talk to her. After Addison we go straight for the middle school. The school bus usually doesn’t get to school until around 6:39, and the school doors don’t open till 6:55. We parked in the school parking lot, and then I got on my phone, played some bitlife. I won’t get too specific on the game, or what I did specifically on the game right now, but maybe later. So at around 6:51, Addison got up, and stood in the aisle, I reminded her it would be another 240 seconds before she was allowed to leave, because for some reason, and ever since the beginning of the year, I’ve always liked being in the front (getting off the bus first). You know thats sorta petty, its just a spot, and thats what I’ve been telling myself. Backtracking a little bit, every day at 6:27, you can hear a male over the bus radio say “Good morning, its 6:27” and then he’ll remind the staff that time sheets are due or something like that. So at 6:55 you’ll hear a deepish voice on the bus radio say “Middle school bus’s you can drop” and the doors will open and you can leave the bus. One of the first things you’ll notice from getting on the bus, and getting off the bus, is the temperature change, it goes from extremely cold, to comfortingly warm. Some people run, and some people speed walk, all with the same goal of getting to the door at the middle school. There’s 1200 students at the middle school, probably about 300 of them being first wave, and riding in the mornings, so theres a lot of people. I’m usually within the first 6 or 7 kids who get through the doors. Anyway so I walked toward the breakfast stand, and Marlene is the one who stands there, shes very nice. Marlene is an older woman, gray hair, long face, and shes a lunch lady. We’re only allowed to have grab and go breakfast, I’m unsure completely why. Today we had funnel cakes, I grabbed a milk, the funnel cake thing, and some utensils, wished Marlene a good rest of her day, then I headed straight ahead toward the stairs. To get to my 1st period (class), you have to go up around 2 flights of stairs from the breakfast stand. So I walked into my first period, looked around the room, all the chairs were down and as usual, a kid named Ethan was first in the room. I sat down at my seat, which is in the back right corner (relative to the teachers desk), placed my phone down at my desk, put my breakfast on the desk, and just chilled out for a moment. It was probably around 6:59 by then, and school doesn’t officially start till 7:25. So to summarize it up, I got on my phone, I played more bitlife, more of my friends surrounded my desk, and eventually, at 7:25, they all had to go back to their assigned seats. Funny enough, I hadn’t seen the teacher until the announcements came on. The announcements came on, “Good morning, please stand for the flag” About all the students stood for the flag, put one hand behind their back, another on their chest, and recited “I pledge the allegends, to the flag, of the united states of america, and to the republic, for which it stands, one nation, under god, indivisible, for liberty, justice, and all” Although, I didn’t stand up nor recite that, I never do. After that, everyone sat down, and the person who is assigned to sit next to me, came over and sat down. Her name is Jasmine, she’s a dark skinned girl who I think is attractive, but I don’t like her or anything. Up until now I have only been broad while talking about my first period teacher. My first period teachers name is Ms Carter, shes about 5’0 in height, maybe a bit taller or shorter, she has white hair, black glasses, is overweight, and probably around 40-50. When she speaks, she has a voice which just screams annoying, also with a slight hint of country. Today was a CLC day, CLC is a day where we add an extra class period, basically, and thats dedicated to learning about suicide, and other stuff as well. Usually your CLC would be your homeroom teacher, in the 8th grade whoever your 3rd period teacher is, is your homeroom teacher. The announcements would continue “Today we do have CLC, be prepared, you’ll need to switch to your class at 7:30, we’ll make another announcement.” During that time, its just a waiting game, you pack up, and you wait. Eventually, after what feels like centuries, the announcement will come on to switch. Luckly, my CLC is literally the next class over. For CLC I have Mr Reed. Mr Reed is a teacher who many find boring, he has a receding hairline, probably in his early thirties. Honestly, Mr Reed reminds me of myself a little bit, he has a personality, I think hes funny, but because of this very reason, students in his classes do not respect him, nor pay any attention to him unless they’re forced to. I sat down in the closest seat to his desk, not because I wanted to, but because that was my assigned seat in 3rd period. Anyway, he explained what needed to be explained about the lesson they gave him, and he didn’t waste our time with going through it. So after that, I just played on my computer for the rest of that class, no need to get into the specifics. Eventually, we had to go back to 1st period, CLC was over. I went back to 1st period, sat at my desk, and eventually Ms Carter shut the door, and started the class. I don’t remember exactly what she said, but eventually she told us if we were moved, to get back with our groups from yesterday. Yesterday we did an assignment with groups on Human Rights. Since me and Jasmine were in the corner, we were moved to be with other groups of four. I moved back over. The kids at my group are, Ethan, Grace, and Wyatt. I didn’t get into the details about the very start of the morning after getting to school, but Wyatt and Ethan were some of the kids who sat by me in the morning. Ethan looks… weird to say the least, no offense or anything but his face is not proportional whatsoever, he has a slim build, and hes about my height. Wyatt is shorter, hes overweight, about as tall as Ms Carter. He has red hair, Ethan has brown. Grace, I really like her name first of all, its an amazing name, and she’s also kinda cute, although I wouldn’t date her or anything, I’m just saying. Ms Carter explained to us the assignment, passed it out, it was task cards. We were told to determine whether or not each situation was for or against human rights. I asked if we were allowed to communicate with our groups, a stupid question, and she responded with yes. I picked up the cards and just recited to my group what was for, and what was against. After that I heard, “That’s not working with your group” from Ms Carter. I’m not sure if I think she was wrong or not, but she might’ve been. Anyway, we spent the rest of the class doing the assignment, nothing too noticeable from there. Although, I didn’t mention it earlier, but another very noticeable person who was moved to a different table for groups was Sophia, I’ll explain why eventually… Anyway, class would end, and we would transition to second period. I would walk in, I have Mr Reed for second period, its Pre-Biology. For 1st and 2nd, they’re called encores, just means its a class like band or choir, extra classes. In 2nd period, I’m sat in the corner, to the left of his desk. He told us that he was going to give us the day to do missing assignments for that class, and other classes. Usually when a teacher tells us that, I take it as a “Free period“ which means I’ll just do whatever I want. The class was pretty quick after that, the only noticeable thing being when he came and made sure I had no missing work. Actually thats a lie. Mr Reed caught a kid named Colton on his phone. While he was trying to get the phone, I pulled my phone out of my pocket and jokingly offered to give him my phone instead of Colton's. So let’s talk about something important. I only have a single person I consider a friend, who I can actually share thoughts and feelings with, his name is Nathan. Nathan is a shorter kid, high pitch voice, but I really like him, not in a weird way but as a friend. I have every period after 1st period with him, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th. So anyway 2nd period ended. I also have 3rd period with Mr Reed, as I said earlier, so I moved to my assigned seat in the class, which is like I said, the closest seat to his desk. Nathan wasn’t in 2nd or 3rd period today, he has Gifted and Talented in those classes. 3rd period is science. In science, I felt a little bit rebellious, so I didn’t do any work, and just played on my computer (sorry mr reed). So 4th period starts, Nathans back for this one. I sit down at my seat and I get on my computer, eventually Nathan comes in and walks over by my desk-

652,"I am in my early 40s and have been divorced since 2020. I haven’t dated anyone seriously. Men in my life keep telling me it’s because of my weight. 

I am fine with my weight. I don’t eat unhealthy, but do consume more calories than I should. My weight doesn’t stop me from doing anything I want to do. I still hike, fish, walk, dance, for as long as I want.

Women and friends tell me to lose weight for me, but I am not motivated to.

I am, however, sad that I haven’t found a partner. Every man I meet seems to be incredibly superficial and disinterested in who I am. This has motivated me to do an experiment. 

I am going to lose weight. Not because I want to, but just to see what the response will be. 

Knowing myself, I will be distrustful of anyone who is interested in me after weight loss, but I am just curious. I have heard of skinny privilege and pretty privilege. How much better will I be treated when/if I lose weight? How many more men will I have interested in dating me? 

I have so much love to give. It is heartbreaking that I do not have any partner to receive it and likely never will. 

I just want to see how my “options” will shift with weight loss. 

I will be taking a photo a day to document the changes in my body, but I wanted some place to record my thoughts and feelings to also help keep me accountable.

The most recent rejection was nothing new. I have heard these kinds of things before, but it still hurt just as much. Why do I find myself interested in men who have no interest in me? Is it solely because of my weight? If yes,  words can’t express how disheartening that is. For so many men to be so vain. 

I wonder how angry/bitter I will be if men start giving me more attention when I lose weight? Maybe I won’t be angry or bitter at all? 

Anyway, from the looks of this subreddit, most posts appear to go unnoticed. I just want to document my thoughts and feelings so I can look back.

I don’t have a scale, otherwise I would document my weight, but should be getting one tomorrow.

Will also document, I am not on any dating apps, zero interaction from any man today. 

I think I have an emotional issue with food because of my past abuse by men. My ex husband told me I was “too fat to love” and from my dating life, it feels like he was right. 

I had really hoped I would have found a man to love by now. If my only pathway to finding him is by losing weight and getting in shape so be it, but I don’t know if I will have the same  love to give that man. I highly doubt it. 

While I am begrudgingly starting this weight loss journey and there is nothing wrong with that, I wish I could start it with a partner who already loved me for who I am, not what I look like. "
653,"9/2/2025
Ok so I woke up to tution I drove both ways plus extra driving I did in the Arvo meant I got about 2 hours of driving done today. Any way tution was good I did fairly well making me feel more confident. Science and Chem tution less confident. Any way rest of the day nothing much really I watched some new invincible and did some drawing so yeh that's my day "
654,"I've gotten pretty good at muting the hateful voices in my head. I used to be so drowned in them. Now I've been too comfortable with how my life is going, and I'm in a better position now, but the voices are still there, just muted.

I feel so mediocre in this life. I don't live like a main character of my own life. I feel like a fucking side character just serving people to achieve their goals. 

I've gotten good at saying No. Fuck no. No means no. I can say it very easily to strangers. To people I will never see again. But it's hardest to say to people close to me. Friends. Coworkers. Partner.
Especially my partner. 

I need to track my spending. My partner comes from a wealthier background than me. It is hard not to spend so much money when my partner and I are hanging out, which is basically almost every day. 

I want to be more. I want to be a multi-millionare. How can I get started?"
655,"I woke up at 5:45 AM right on time. At first, when I woke up, I got confused thinking it was a weekday and panicked about waking up late. But after checking the date and realizing it was Sunday, I got my head straight and prepared for my run. The recent cold snap made me check the weather, and it was -12°C when I was about to head out. Honestly, the coldest weather I've run in was -4°C, considering I wear running clothes that can feel warm after a run, so there wasn't much choice in changing my outfit. I managed to endure that before, but hearing today’s temperature scared me.  
  
So far, I've always used knee braces while running, but I started questioning if they were really necessary and decided to go without them. I couldn't, however, leave my headphones behind. The temperature was even lower, and without earmuffs or knee braces, I felt too miserable to even want to step outside. I didn’t trust myself to endure without my headphones. Anyway, I wore my usual winter running outfit (long running pants, a short-sleeve running shirt, and a slightly thicker windbreaker), grabbed a Celsius drink, and set out for my run.  
  
As I stepped out, my first thought was, ""It's not as cold as I thought."" So, without much thought, I walked to my usual running spot, but about 10 minutes in, I realized I had grossly underestimated the cold. With no gloves, it was too chilly to take my hands out of my windbreaker pockets. Even with my hands tucked inside, I felt like my hand was freezing. I hadn't even started my run for real, but after 20 minutes, my runny nose got so bad that the snot I couldn’t sniff back up froze all the way to my between my eyebrows.  
  
I can't count how many times I contemplated whether I should just skip my run today. It took me about 30 minutes of walking to reach my starting point, and the cold alone was demoralizing. But every time I thought about giving up, I reminded myself that because I was thinking that way, I had to push through even more. As I started running, the wind felt so cold that I could feel my face freezing up. It was bearable, though. It was so cold that I considered putting up my windbreaker hood but it was tied down, and I didn't want to stop just to fix it, so I kept running without using it.  
  
However, because the wind hit my face directly, my pace wasn't as fast as when I train for cadence; it was more like my pre-training pace (around 5:40 per km). Up to the 5km mark, other than the cold, there weren’t any major issues. Sure, it was so chilly I couldn’t take off my windbreaker and tie it around my waist as usual, but otherwise, it was bearable.  
  
The problems started around the 7-8km mark. After doing chest exercises with a buddy on Friday, my anterior deltoid muscles were so sore that swinging my arms was excruciatingly painful while running. It didn’t feel like tendons or bones were giving out, just that I hadn't recovered enough, forcibly moving stiff muscles, yet maintaining the pace I usually run at when my muscles are fine. Doing that for about an hour was exhausting.  
  
Even my knee was being a problem. My right knee wasn’t severely painful like when I ran a marathon before, but without a knee brace, it kept nagging at me. Thankfully it didn’t feel like a joint or ligament injury, and it didn’t greatly affect my running form, so I just ignored it and forced myself to push through to the first checkpoint. Honestly, during the 12km to the first checkpoint, I was in so much pain the last 5km that I was practically screaming and sobbing as I ran.  
  
When I reached the first checkpoint, it felt like my worst condition at the 12km point since my first 20km run. At least when I went for the first run after a trip, I felt energetic at this point, but now I was not only in pain but utterly fatigued. At the checkpoint, I bought a can of Monster and felt like my organs might pop out and disappear, emptying my insides as I went to the bathroom.  
  
With my knee hurting and having left my knee brace behind, I kept contemplating whether I should turn back. But I had the mindset of sticking it out for 20km, and strangely, I suddenly found energy again. The difference was stark compared to the first run after my trip. The muscle soreness and knee pain eased off, and even as my pace picked up, I managed to reach my fastest pace of 4:05 per km and maintained an average pace in the 4-minute range up to the second checkpoint at 22km.  
  
Still, the 18-22km segment was brutally tough, too, as I found myself screaming and sobbing again while running. The benches I saw along the way were so tempting yet mocking because I couldn’t sit on them. Yet, I arrived at the 22km mark, downed a can of Red Bull, and sat down for a short break. Although exhausted, I remembered from the previous run not to overfill my stomach despite the fatigue, so I only had the Red Bull and nothing else. Feeling better than last time, I resolved to train and power through beyond 30km today to keep moving my legs.  
  
Until this point, covering about 20km, I had taken two breaks, but heading forward, there weren’t distinct checkpoints, only an endpoint to aim for. So, determined not to stop until I couldn’t bear it anymore, my no-rest distance shrank from 12km to 10km, then further down to just 4km. In other words, I took my next break at the 26km mark. After that, I rested at 2km and another 2km, eventually reaching 30km, but the breaks decreased to 0.8km and then to around 200m, 300m from then on.  
  
Sure, I could’ve just walked without resting. That’s what I did for the full marathon. However, this time, my goal was to keep 'running' past 30km. I planned to run up to 35km, so counting walking distances would’ve felt like cheating. Even if it meant collapsing from exhaustion midway, I couldn’t let myself just walk those distances.  
  
I had to head to my grandmother's for a New Year’s family gathering right after the run, but I was so worn out in this last stretch that I lost a lot of time. It felt like as much time had passed covering almost the first 26km as it did running the next 9km or so. Somehow, I kept thinking I had to reach 35km, but it felt like being caught in Zeno's paradox, never truly arriving where I aimed. And in the end, I stopped at 34.89km.  
  
Granted, I did reach the original endpoint I had in mind when I stopped. Really, it felt like my soul was leaving my body, being so drained while my body screamed for calories as I forced myself to reach the endpoint. Yet, despite all that, it’s just a bunch of excuses. I failed to cover the last 0.11km. I failed again. Although, I do agree that I performed much better than before. I didn’t quit from exhaustion at 26km, managed to pick up my pace in colder weather, and even though I kept resting, I was running at a 5:25 per km pace beyond 30km, not walking. But failure is still failure. It’s just a more acceptable failure.  
  
Anyway, I walked for about 20 minutes to catch the subway to my grandmother's house after finishing my run. My body was crying out for calories, so I bought a bunch of bread from the convenience store along the way to quickly refuel, and when I got there, I topped up with some pizza. Filling up my stomach definitely made me feel more alive.  
  
I got home around 4 PM, took a shower, and started doing some video editing I intended to do yesterday. I asked ChatGPT to help find clips from various podcasts of David Goggins, whom I admire, using deep research, and it took about 30 minutes to choose clips for editing. Then, I spent about an hour cutting and splicing key parts to naturally edit the video to be under a minute long. Honestly, I thought connecting clips seamlessly would be really challenging, but it surprisingly wasn’t as hard as I expected. When I showed it to the boss, he was so impressed he questioned if I really made it. Of course, seasoned experts probably don’t take an hour just to patch together clips.  
  
I added some subtitles and then realized I hadn’t studied financial statements recently, so from 6 PM to 7 PM, before dinner, I did some analysis on the financial statements I had printed out previously. There were parts that deviated from what I had learned in books, and I wondered if using AI to compile old financial statements was a mistake, or if I simply didn’t understand financial statements well. Regardless, I analyzed what I could and wrote up an analysis of what I had learned from books and the discrepancies I encountered.  
  
After dinner, I did some quick coding study and asked ChatGPT about parts I didn’t understand. Considering the toll today’s long-distance run took, I think I’ll hit the bed a little early tonight."
656,"2025 February 8: Dear Diary,

Separating the art from the artist seems impossible for most people. Celebrity worship is perhaps the most toxic, stupid, and repulsive trait I can think of. People should realize that all artists and celebrities are just regular people. A lot of the time they are just regular people with a god-complex because people revere them as deities. When celebrities and artists commit terrible actions they should be rightfully brought to justice as any other person.  
  
It is also true that the artwork this person created or starred in can become vilified. Sometimes I feel this is warranted. Nobody is watching The Cosby Show anymore because it’s too tied to the degenerate who created it. Sometimes I feel the tie is only there because the public views it that way.  
  
I love the music of Elvis Presley. Singing his songs brings a little bit of joy in my life. I can still sing his songs with joy despite the fact of his atrocious actions. Elvis’ songs should be appreciated for what they are and not who they were created by. They are a part of history and contributed to the cultural canon. He was just a human being after all. He had a good side to him which produced great works of art and he had an evil side to him which abused Priscilla. 

Both of these are true because every human has a good and evil side, although the intensity varies. I don’t think Elvis should be remembered as a good person. His abuse towards Priscilla was irredeemable and that should never be looked over. I would also never want to see his music lose its cultural relevance. We as a society should not demand perfection from the people who make art, because that can never happen.

Sincerely,

Torinico"
657,"Welp lost my wallet for good I think but anyway uh the stress is not getting to me , and I'm going to ignore it because I feel like I'm going insane.

I hope I don't get nightmares tonight, I'm tired af but yuh today was shit only because I kinda let myself go these couple past days and maybe that's why I've been feeling like shit but idk.

Alright calm down... There are stronger soldiers than me.

I need to turn things around, I'm going to turn things around so no more fucking around. IM GOING TO GET THESE LICENSES, FUCK YOU UNIVERSE!!!!! Anyway yeah life is hitting rn and it reflecting on me but it's not over because I won't let it be, tomorrow I'm getting my shit together and hopefully hitting the gym."
658,"And i thought i wouldn't cry if that happened. Her body is so stiff. She used to charge at balloons and act as if they were her enemy. Used to play with my other cat so much. Was almost one year old. A stray, she was, she was brought to us as a guest by my cat, and soon became our cherished little cat.

The doctor said, her reproductive organs were too small. During the spay surgery, they'd noticed a lump on her intestine (they didn't touch it since it hadn't caused any problems yet). Her liver profile reports were better than before, but still there was a bit complication.

I can't believe she's gone. On day of surgery, after wearing of anaesthesia she was roaming around 5 hours straight and then slept like a log. The first 24 hours of surgery she ate very little but drank water enough. Urinated. 48 hours, still showed no interest in food, but vomited bile, so we fed with a syringe some KMR. Third day, she was looking better but lethargic, we fed some chicken and kmr. But on the fourth day, today.... she vomited all of it... everything we gave on third day, probably even the remains of second day... and kept vomiting all the water she'd drink... I went to vet in afternoon and he prescribed some ondavet and a liquid probiotic. I thought she'll recover, her bouts of vomit followed by a cry would subside ...

I didn't notice that when she refused to open her jaws for the surgery meds, her time was near. I got an evening appointment with doctor to get her injectable meds.... She still curled upto us. She still sat alongside us. She was lethargic, but restless, changing positions. Her eyes were barely open. Suddenly she started sighing, we brushed it off as probably her feeling relief after so much of vomiting. She was cold, so i wrapped her with blankets, making sure to make them warm.

Then... she started convulsing. I thought she was going to vomit, so we carried her on the flood. At first I thought she was trying to vomit but nothing was coming out, but soon realised she was gasping, a cry came out, her jugular vein visibly throbbing, I was panicked. With each gasp, her body gave away, she slowly slipped into death, her head in my hand..... I couldn't stop sobbing and tearing up when she breathed her last and became unresponsive


Her body has stiffened so quick, she has grown so cold, so heavy. At one point when my sister said something aloud, I got a feeling she would wake up the cat, only to remind myself thar she was not sleeping, but dead already.... She had been so light when she was alive, i hold her body now and with every passing hour she seems to feel heavier, 

The balloon on the floor seems gloomy. My appetite is gone. I can't tell or share with anyone because no one will understand. The sadness that's upon me, how would i explain it is because my cat died, gasping like an old man nearing his end? Humans don't care unless its another human. They'd think i'm stupid, and I won't argue with those fools.

I don't know, i think i am at fault. I took away a fragile life. She was runt of the litter most probably, cuz she never grew to the size of her sister. I signed on the spay surgery form. I can't help but feel sorrow, i feel like i signed her death date then.

I told the doctor that my cat passed, he was shocked. I told its okay, it was after all my decision to put my cat through it. But then he said sometimes one complication excaberates the hidden underlying health issues and they come crashing onto the body, in an attempt to tell me that the death of my cat was not on me. But i can't forget the sight of her jugular vein writhing under her skin like a wiggling worm that was stepped on.

I was sleeping so little ever since she returned from her surgery, because I was adamant on taking excellent care of her... at one point i was tired... but her passing away is a tight slap on my face, my tiredness, my half-assed relationship with the cat who still sought my arms even in her hour of death.

Did i spend enough time with her? Did i love her enough? How many times did i verbally dismissed her? My eyes are aching, her skin was so dehydrated, her fur was shiny but raggedy...

I don't know why i exist if i'm meant to see death, if i'm meant to die anyways. This fragile life was snuffed out in matter of five minutes. And only during the end i realised what was actually happening. She died, she was supposed to be mischievous, active... not still and stiff.

I thought she'd wake up. But instead rigor mortis set in, sealing the word of her passing. She looks like a doll, i have her paw impressions. I have her photos, i want to look at them but i can't without breaking into tears. I just can't.

I thought going to a brisk walk would help me but it did nothing. Instead, i didn't wanna come home to the realisation that my cat is no more..."
659,"8/2/2025
Ok once again nothing much I watched princess monanoke. Good movie I had cousins in the house I didn'tath homework. Got my math homework done shit down the power by toasting bread. Fixed rhant and did some drawing "
660,"7/2/2025
Ok it's a pretty chill day nothing big to start with I went to chess club played 3 games 2 wins one draw. Class work was pretty standard chilling with friends.
 I went and saw the new ajith movie as well that was fun."
661,"I stayed up late last night, not really sure why. But thankfully, I didn’t have any plans today and it was my rest day from working out, so it wasn't a big deal. I woke up around 10 a.m. and started by casually checking my phone. I found a really interesting notification on YouTube about OpenAI’s new feature called Deep Research that was released on February 2nd. I was aware of o3 mini, but this Deep Research wasn’t available on my account, so I had no idea about it. The video explained that this feature conducts research at a beginner doctoral level. By the end of the video, it mentioned that it’s getting closer to AGI, and that convinced me to switch to the pricey $200 Pro plan to experiment with it.  
  
I first tried researching topics that had recently caught my interest from YouTube. The content was about why a foolproof world, like in the movie The Matrix, is impossible. It didn’t delve into complex formulas, but explained using math and logic; essentially, even in seemingly flawless math and logic, contradictions and errors are inevitable with the concept of self-reference. I plan to look into proving this later, but it got me thinking about the idea of Anatta (non-self). If contradictions and errors arise from self-reference, doesn't this imply that the concept of “I” or “self” leads to contradictions and errors in reality? This quickly reminded me of the Buddhist concept of Anatta. So, I asked for a report connecting these ideas, and I think it turned out to be a pretty interesting read.  
  
Of course, I’m not an expert in philosophy, psychology, or theology, but I was honestly impressed by the report exceeding ten thousand words; it discussed concepts I hadn’t seen before, and among the topics I knew, I couldn’t find anything incorrect. While reading, I couldn’t help but think about AI’s incestuous amplification and Nietzsche’s comments on corrupting the youth. It’s commonly said that if AI is repeatedly trained with data created by other AIs, over generations, it will lose diversity and fail to accurately reflect reality. Simply put, if AI initially learns from mostly Golden Retrievers when learning about dogs, its knowledge about “dogs” will be biased towards Golden Retrievers. Keep repeating this process, and eventually ""dog” equals Golden Retriever. Similarly, when you think about it, training only on “me” leads to warped and distorted outcomes. Nietzsche’s point on youth corruption ties in here too. He said the surest way to corrupt a youth is to have them only socialize with like-minded people. It’s fascinating how he seemed to predict these phenomena back then. Anyway, reading this report really emphasized the importance of networking.  
  
This train of thought led me to the idea of sharing with my intern team, given I spent $200 on this Pro plan. I asked them what areas they wanted to research and used Deep Research to create reports for each. However, just like when I ran my research, each session took about 10 minutes, leaving me with nothing to do while waiting. Plus, I had to work on a side project, so I used the time to work on it in Figma. I left questions for my manager on areas of the project where the intent was unclear, and roughly wrapped up my work.  
  
Once the research reports were done and I shared them with the team, their feedback was, “It’s of decent quality, but it seems like something multiple AIs could produce together.” At the time, I didn’t think much about it, but now I realize that’s pretty much what AGI is. AGI isn’t really something different; it’s an AI that can handle various tasks like a human. If a single AI can create what usually takes multiple AIs, isn’t that essentially AGI? We’ve got a long way to go, but I can see why this seemed reminiscent of the AGI talked about by the OpenAI executives.  
  
Having finished up my side project and with no more immediate research topics left, I realized it was already 2 p.m. and I hadn’t eaten yet. I cooked some duck for lunch. While I was grilling the duck, my dad woke up, and I suggested he go exercise. He seemed a bit reluctant, but after fully waking up, he went to exercise, acknowledging that he was going because I kept nudging him. It wasn’t exactly heartwarming, but my relentless pestering worked, which was nice. I always send him videos or clips from Reels showing the importance of exercising in your 50s-70s and urge him to go exercise even after work.  
  
After lunch, the coding book I ordered finally arrived, and I spent some time studying and preparing for Cursor. Until now, I had no clue about IDEs or where to code or how to run the code, but the book explained that you can write code in the built-in notepad on your computer and save it with an .html extension (for web coding) to run it. I tried it and it worked.  
  
With a bit of confidence restored, I finally ran Cursor, which I had installed but never set up. Even doing just this one thing helped me understand how to use the tool. It was nice to finally get what an IDE is, how to code, and how to execute it. Although I didn’t make much progress today, and since it’s just front-end, I can’t do anything extraordinary, I was able to create a basic landing page like those no-function ones made while watching tutorials back when I first used Bubble. It took over six hours to do this, but it was valuable time spent addressing my most curious topics in coding. Now I can use Cursor as well. Although I probably won’t use it for actual projects unless it’s for learning since I can’t connect it with the no-code tools I use now."
662,"2025 February 7: Dear Diary,

The first thirty pages of Moby Dick were a lot more interesting than I thought. It gets into the anti-rascist messaging really fast, which is something I didn’t expect. Although I am unaware of how the relationship between Ishmael and Queequeg will end up, I think it is an interesting dynamic from the start.  
  
This will be the third book I have read this year. The first was Crime and Punishment and the second was A Tale of Two Cities. Reading has been amazing. My mind does occasionally wander and think of unimportant nonsense, but it is nice to take my time on something for once.   
  
Sincerely,  
  
Torinico"
663,"Welp it sucks but what can you do lol actually I think I'd be more annoyed if it was 50 bucks, idk but anyway I searched everywhere that I would've lost it before but in the end it's gone. 

Maybe I'm crazy but a lot of unlucky things have happened to me for the past couple of weeks but also a lot of couple mind changes stuff have happened. I can't explain it but for every struggle I've been through, it seems to always be reason or reminder for it lol but idk maybe I'm coping.

I swear to sweet Jesus if I get all shit back and I find my wallet, imma have the biggest fit and then buy me a wallet tracker cuz like damn. I swear I had my wallet on me yesterday but boom the moment I get to the house, it falls right into the backroom lol.

Anyway I'mma try to get my ID card back tomorrow, as for today I'n general uh Ill give it a 6.5/10"
664,"During my first year of high school, I met this girl. I won't say her name for privacy reasons, but she played a big role in my life.
It all started when I was sitting alone in the classroom.
She walked up to me, sat down next to me, and started talking about how she got a new dog. I didn't know her, so it was a bit awkward, but over time, we became friends.
After about a year, I started noticing some strange behavior from her. She would hug me from behind, but sometimes, it felt like she was choking me. Whenever I asked what she was doing, she'd just laugh and say,
""'m hugging you, silly!"" She also had a habit of slapping me--hard. My dumb self thought it was normal, so I never really questioned it.
A few weeks later, she asked if we could have a sleepover. I said yes. That night, we were sitting on her couch watching a horror movie when she suddenly suggested that we go to sleep. I agreed.
At around 2 AM, I woke up to find her standing over me.
She had one hand covering my mouth and the other pinching my nose shut. I couldn't breathe. When she noticed I was awake, she quickly let go.
""What the hell were you doing?"" I asked, terrified.
She laughed nervously. ""Nothing, I was just playing around.""
I felt so uncomfortable that I told her I was going home.
She started crying, but at that point, I was honestly scared of her.
The next day at school, I was heading to the bathroom when she suddenly pulled me into the large stall.
Before I could react, she held a knife to my throat and told me to get on my knees. Shaking, I did as she said . Then, she opened the tr lid and shoved my head inside, trying to drown me.
I struggled, but I couldn't breathe. Eventually, I blacked out
When I woke up, I was in the hospital. My throat burned from the water, but that wasn't the worst part-I felt a sharp pain in my leg. Looking down, I saw it was bandaged.
1 pressed the call button for a nurse, and when she arrived, I asked, ""What happened to my leg?""
She gave me a sympathetic look and said, ""You were stabbed.""
I was in complete shock.
After about four weeks, once I had healed, I returned to school. And that's when I saw her again. She looked at me with this eerie expression, then grabbed my arm and whispered in mv ear:
""You were supposed to be dead.""
I tried to pull away, but she held on tight and continued whispering things like, ""I'm going to kill you."" ""You're going to die.""
I was terrified. I started crying, but she didn't care. She dragged me out of the classroom, pushed me to the floor, and started punching me-over and over again-while screaming ""DIE!"" repeatedly.
At that moment, I genuinely thought it was the end. Two students rushed in and pulled her off me, then called a teacher. I ended up in the hospital again. I believe she went to jail for two months, but I'm not sure
-I moved schools and cut all contact with her.
Fast forward three or four vears later, I unexpectedly ran into her. She looked different, and when we started talking, she apologized. She told me she wasn't in the right state of mind back then and deeply regretted everything.
accepted her apology.
Now? We're really good friend’s."
665,"I woke up way later than usual today. I tend to sleep heavily in a cold, dark room with rain sounds or white noise. Subliminals help as well. They are often necessary when it comes to combating negative energy while asleep. They help me wake up less focused on yesterday and the past. 

I also believe that they help with dreams or nightmares. I tend not to have nightmares and am sorry that I have ever wished that on anyone. My dreams are usually pretty random and nonsensical. This time when I was dreaming, I was somewhere on the West coast.

Maintenance knocked on my door for ""pest control"". It's also something I had to have done when I was living in federal housing. I suppose it makes sense that they would do it here as well. I know that whatever they are spraying is toxic. From what I have always noticed, it doesn't seem to prevent pests. I have had roaches this whole stay. 

The pest control guy told me ""nobody's watching you."" Sometimes I love it when people give me hints and clues. He had an amazing smile, too. This place is crazy. Sometimes I feel like I'm in danger, sometimes I am just mind blown. So exciting. I am currently not in a rush to leave because I am mentally tired of trying to figure out my next step. I just want to feel good and have fun. I don't want to hurt anyone or get hurt. 

I've been thinking about celebrities. I cannot stand the idea of them using their status to take advantage of average citizens. They are so used to people drooling over them, it must be a thrill when they get rejected. For some of them, it's probably an insult. They'd be like, ""Do you know who I am???"" Celebrity status does not automatically make you a prize or desirable, or entitled to anyone's attention. 

I often encourage others to take celebrities off of a pedestal like I have been teaching myself how to do. A lot of them are energy vampires. A lot of them are shells of their former selves, their true essences floating around between different locations, vessels, dimensions, and times. A lot of them have to watch from afar as demons control their body and live their life. 

A lot of them are angry because they got tricked into selling themselves out. A lot of them want justice. A lot of them are trying to help others. A lot of them are blocked off from re-entering their vessel, but some of them are able to do so briefly. Some spirits were not intended to be out of their bodies for too long in this way, which is why this blocking isn't always fully successful. 

This phenomenon isn't only a thing for celebrities. I know people personally that have allowed themselves to be taken over. They have told me and shown me that they can leave their bodies and go wherever they want, wherever they can visualize. 

I don't want anyone watching me if they're a thief. I don't want celebrities or anyone trying to get ""inspiration"" from me without my permission, and without compensating me somehow. But I have to admit that I am highly impressed with their execution of my visions, ideas, and projects. They have the resources and money to create what I can't. Thank you for doing that. 

I am not ungrateful, but I do want better for myself. I hate the idea of being under anyone's control, but I also don't like the idea of being in a situation or environment that hinders my ability to get things done on my own. Its like someone was angry or challenged by the fact that I wanted to be  independent. 

I also don't like the fact that they are pressuring me to be creative. It doesn't work that way. You can't force songs or jokes or dance moves out of someone. I am not trying to be anybody's golden goose, battery, or puppet on a string.

I hate the idea of people hurting others for the sake of art... triggering them to bring out their talents. Some of these celebrities are not creative at all, therefore they have to get their energy and ideas from random people that they know will never get any attention. 

Some of these celebrities' parents are the ones that sold them out for money and fame. A lot of them were abused or traumatized from early childhood. A lot of them forcibly had demons conjured up into their vessels, demons that wanted to be worshipped by humans. 

I do not judge them for being demons or having demons. I am in the same boat, unfortunately. However, I believe that God has given me the awareness and the power to be able to resist a certain amount of my darkness. I try to use that to everyone's advantage vs. just being a f*ck-up. If I'm going to be chaotic and f*ck shit up, I want it to be in a good ways. 

I am standing outside of my room still... Sometimes I cannot handle the cold. This is not one of those times. The chill in the air is somehow comforting. It might partially be because of coffee and kratom, which definitely tend to raise my body temperature. It is also nice to be out in open space instead of cooped up in my room. Although, I absolutely love my solitude. 

I am angry that a stranger (or someone that appeared to be a stranger) invaded that the other day. I hate to even give the geezer any shine here, especially since he claimed to be a ""professional"". He touched me without permission, he lied to me, he wasted my time and money, he pretended to care about me, he kept calling me fragile, and continously spoke in detail about humiliating and traumatic memories, including a past s*xual assault that I had barely spoken to anyone about outloud. 

It's like he was taunting me for it. I have never knowingly taunted someone about anything like that, and can't understand how anyone would speak jokingly or lightly about such topics. I am sorry if anyone thinks I would do such a thing on purpose like others have done to me. If this whole thing is some sort of initiation, I don't want to be a part of it. You can't force that without consequences. 

He knew how I felt about having people in my space and did everything he could to get under my skin, just because I had told him to make himself comfortable. He laid in my bed without asking, more than once. He even exposed his private parts. I could (and probably should) have made him leave after that, but I felt bad for him because he was old. First he told me he was 52, then 57. Professional, huh?

He tried to play victim when I finally made him leave, then he tried to come back in after banging on my door and accusing me of stealing his ID. I told him that I would call the police because I knew things would escalate if he continued on harassing me. I told him to get the f*ck away from my door. He even came back the next day, having the nerve to ask me for a piece of paper. Again, I told him to get the f*ck away from my door. 

I hope I don't have to encounter anymore characters like that one. I hope he gets what he deserves for what he did to me, because I don't think I deserved it. I was just trying to help him. "
666,I’m visiting my brother’s tombstone today. It’s been a year and some change since the last time.  I’m getting teary eyed thinking about it. Most likely I’m going to break sobriety going there. It’s not like I have to be worried about the consequences anymore. I guess I’ll see what happens once I get there. But writing this now I could go for a smoke.  
667,"It’s never a question that I always enjoy your company
And when things are done and we go home separately I have time to think about things we had and write down my experiences, lessons, emotions and every other thing 
Last night was great! She’s so candid reserved and loving. Both of them are so cute and I see how you also cherished them and your bond together 
Apart from the good things we had..
I got a lil scared after witnessing another conversation with you and wasin. It made me think of… if you guys talk like that…. why is he treating you that way…..You’re not shouting but you’re inviting shouting. Makes me also question do you guys have something I didn’t know. I’m scared of being part of something that will hinders one goal… or, someone’s opportunity. I think he likes you. And I think I should open the way for him. Also, can’t 
You know I like you and you’re fun to be with but I can honestly willingly can let you go if there are people who deserve you more. I don’t want to rob you of what you really want. And please don’t think this as a guilt trip. I’m not. Not doing that. We both have deep conversations before and it’s always honest with you. I’m also just at a stage I’m comfortable with you and I’m comfortable letting you go if that makes you better. 
One of the things I’m very proud of you. You’re very kind to help Wasin. But… I can sense you guys have not talked about what you guys really want for each other. You mentioned you made it clear to him nothing is assured between you both in terms of relationship. But what if he’s not with you. Maybe give him a chance now. Could be he’s the one for you. Could be he’s acting that way coz he sees me with you. You said he might be rooting for me. But I can also root for him
"
668,"As usual, I got up at 5 AM, got ready quickly, and caught the first subway while reading a book on my way to the gym. My closest junior, who had taught me about working out, was on leave from the military, and we planned to exercise together today. He had significantly influenced my workout style, including my posture, routine, and intensity, so I was really looking forward to it.

However, as always, my junior was late. He was about half an hour late. In the past, when I had more free time, I didn't mind, but now, with a tighter schedule, I was getting a bit anxious. I started my first top set out of impatience, and just as I finished, he arrived. Once he got there, it felt like going back to when I first started working out. Especially for upper body exercises, my body would tire out before my mind could, so I had no choice but to push through with forced reps, which felt really good. Having a much stronger partner helped me do nearly twice as much as I would alone, even though I was practically screaming by the end. It was one of the most stimulating chest workouts I've had lately. While he was indeed stronger than me in every aspect, I didn’t feel the same inferiority as before. I’m not entirely sure why.

After working out, we walked together because his route overlapped with my office path. It had been so long since I laughed and joked freely like that. We teased each other and laughed like something straight out of a reel, slipping on the snowy sidewalk and everything. It was a delightful morning.

Once I got to the office, I checked on the Mixpanel setup I had done two days ago. Strangely, it showed zero visitors yesterday. I thought something was off and started reviewing the workflow changes from two days ago. It turned out that tracking hadn’t been working since I modified the workflow. Funny thing was, we still had visitors, but they weren’t part of the A/B testing. We had set it up only for those coming in through Meta ads, and I wondered if no one really came in through Meta. But given the user numbers, that seemed odd, so I QA'd it. I discovered that the Meta ad tag was disappearing before the workflow could trigger, even though users coming through Meta were still tracked. I fixed that part, had lunch, and took a short nap. I was a bit sleep-deprived, having had less than 5 hours of sleep the previous night.

Today's workload was slightly more than I anticipated. I thought I had tackled the most urgent tasks with some early morning work, but that wasn't entirely the case. First, that task needed further work after an early morning review from the client, and on top of that, the boss suggested trying something new, which meant more to do. I thought I’d finish by 5 PM but ended up working until 7 PM.

The day was pretty standard, nothing particularly smooth nor notably rough. One unusual thing was a proposal to dig into a new area of marketing, giving me a chance to learn video editing. Today, with so much else to do, I just learned the basics of using the simplest tool. No time to do any actual editing, but I'll have a chance to try it out by next week. So, it's not bad.

After finishing at 7 PM, I joined a quick dinner with colleagues and came home. Before washing up, I reached out to ask the junior I’d requested to find someone for feedback if there were any early adopters, or if there was any feedback. They promised to update me over the weekend since they hadn't contacted anyone yet. The junior's feedback was overwhelmingly positive, which left me a bit... confused. I’m not used to receiving compliments, so it felt awkward. My personality also tends to suspect whether they're laughing behind my back if I can't see something deserving of praise. Though, given my junior's character, it would be offensive to think that way. I've just lived a life far from compliments, so it's uncomfortable.

Anyway, with work ending so late, there was only time for one more task after washing up. I worked on setting up a Google Form for the no-code academic conference. It was mostly just copying from Notion, but it felt a bit empty, so I fleshed it out with references from other academic conference Google Forms, and it turned out alright."
669,"Wow they don't lie when they say the second day is hard but it's all good, it was a good day studying and work. 10/10"
670,"I can't believe anyone would try to punish someone for trying to protect their peace or privacy... or for simply trying to enjoy their life in ways that don't harm, deceive, control, or kill other people.

I used to be relatively content, but that was when I was unknowingly under a certain amount of control and surveillance. Unfortunately, but rightfully so, I became aware and wasn't happy or comfortable with my reality.

I realized that others had been content with my lack of consciousness (because they had been benefiting from it), therefore were not happy upon my awakening (and still aren't). 

Ever since, I have been trying to escape users and abusers. I have no problem with people/spirits that are simply curious and don't mean harm, or the ones that truly love me but can't get close to me for safety reasons. 

I am honestly considering letting the humans put me back to sleep. Sometimes I want to give them the satisfaction of putting me down completely, but I am not some untameable beast. I am still having a human experience, and I do still enjoy parts of it. 

I love the things that stimulate our senses. I love positive emotions. I love the sun. I love animals. I love water. I love fire. I love plants. Those things make it worth it for me to be in this body. 

I currently do not only identify as my human. She is often not the source of the thoughts she writes and shares. However, she is conscious enough to know that she has multiple minds.

Some of the people that watch her fear us because they cannot see us. We have protected her during some of the traumas that others refuse to admit to. Although she cannot remember what was done to her, we do. We saw it, and we did not allow her to experience it. We have always been with her.

Since her early childhood, there were times when we were the reason she misbehaved and got disciplined or punished. These were tests. We never allowed her to go through anything that we couldn't protect her from. Making our presence known to her is how we are helping her heal and forgive her abusers. 

I am grateful to know that I am not alone. I know that certain people think that as a human being, I am crazy, bizarre, stupid, scary, or evil for believing and admitting that I am ""possessed"" by spirits. I don't understand why I should care about those peoples' opinions."
671,"At times, I find life amusing... for good reasons, and bad. The fact that...

•anyone who KNOWS they're wrong, 
•anyone who KNOWS they are hurting someone innocent or undeserving of certain pain, 
•anyone who CHOOSES to entertain themselves by causing chaos in other people's lives, 
•anyone who stalks people in order to gain power 

...would EVER think they're competing with or defeating me tickles my soul! 

Thank you, losers for paying so much attention. It truly makes me feel special. I am honored to know that so many of you have dedicated your lives to little old me! 

I don't like the fact that you...

•want what I have, 
•don't want me to have what's mine, 
•don't want me to have anything you have or anything you want, 
•don't want me to have anything I want or need, 
•don't want to see or hear me smiling or laughing, 
•don't want me ignoring or avoiding anything or anyone, 
•don't want me to feel safe, confident, free, or beautiful, 
•don't want me to have my children, family, money, a car, a house, friends, or a lover, •don't want me to use or enjoy technology, •don't want me to be sane, aware, or in control, 

...the list goes on.

I truly believe that anybody trying to make me feel bad at this point is just as miserable, but would probably never admit it because they want to win so badly. Too many of them couldn't help but to reveal their demonic motives because that's their main reason for wanting to live. 

I don't want anyone's entire purpose to be opposing me, although it is rather flattering! However, I genuinely want them to find other purposes and thrive without me. 

How can you compete with, 
let alone defeat 
someone that doesn't even 
have a desire to fight? 
The winner 
is the one who knows 
when to surrender. 
I put an end to this 
a long time ago. 
We all could have won, 
but yall just kept on going.
I said I was done
So you should leave me alone

Meanwhile, someone keeps telling me to wake up. I must be asleep somehow or somewhere, but I don't understand. It's fascinating, yet frustrating. Maybe this is all a dream. "
672,"I’m so tired of living. I’m tired of trying. I don’t even know what to say. I’m tired of thinking. Feeling. Breathing. I try to rise up and feel better only to be stomped back down again in the cruelest of ways. Nothing even feels real. I cannot believe what has happened to me. I used to be such an optimistic person, but each horrific experience after another continues like I woke up one day in another dimension. One of pain, injustice, deceit, indifference, cruelty. Why did life start out so happy and magical? How did I make it to adulthood unscathed? Did my good fortune run out? I feel like I’ve been cursed. I’m fucking cursed and I give up. I quit. I’m done trying. I’m done. "
673,"2025 February 6: Dear Diary,

The roads going to work were ridiculous today. It’s not like the snow has been worse than previous days but the roads seem just as bad. Last Friday night was the absolute worst when coming home from work, but today getting to work was troublesome.  
  
My car kept swerving and I needed to go slower despite going slow already. Being late for work was not something to be worried about, but further damage to my car was. Even more worrisome would be the wellbeing of my life or the lives of others; it is always best to drive carefully. It was especially imperative to drive carefully today. My breaks just got replaced and I want to make sure they last as long as possible. The less work that needs to be done on my car the better.  
  
Sincerely,

674,"Ever since I was a kid, my mom would be ""harsh"" on me for slacking and not being able to do my multiplication and division because I hadn't even tried to do it neither my hw. Back then I thought that she was being too harsh but that was my kid self thinking that, but I unfortunately never realized that she was doing it for the better for me. Now that I'm in high school I finally get the reason why she tries to motivate me to do better in school. For obvious reasons being so that I can have a better future but most importantly a successful one. Today, she told to motivate my brother more because he is still a kid who I know has a lot of potential but I never tried to. The real reason why she always motivates and my brother in our studies is because when she was a kid her parents never motivated her. She was told that she couldn't attend school by her parents just because they didn't have enough money. Compared to our world today, most kids and teens don't want to go to school but my mom always did, she begged her parents because everyone else around her was attending school and her friends as well. One day when she found her sisters notebook, she took it and read it with her sister, my mom always loved to study and was a good student who wanted to take every opportunity. Though, her parents didn't allow her until she sneaked out and went to school to enroll herself, but couldn't that time but when her mom finally brought some cash from somewhere, my mom finally got to go to school and the sad thing is that none of her school friends had made it to finishing school and some ended their school life early but she remained, then soon enough gotta scholarship to america.

Hearing this story really made me realize why my mom always motivated me and my brother, becaus she was never encouraged by her parents and was even told that she can't go to school just because of money problems.My mom said that if she was actually motivated and couraged by her parents as a kid then she could have went on to a much better life then the one right now, like a doctor, or scientists, even an engineer. Hearing this instantly made me cry, now I feel even more motivated towards my studies and what I'm passionate about so that I can make myself and my family proud, I feel very privileged for this reason, to have a mom who loves her children and wishes the best because she couldn't have the childhood that she wished she had. "
675,"The last couple of days have been very upsetting. Some people tell me I'm stupid or that I don't have any understanding. They heard me talking (sometimes when they SHOULDN'T have been listening) or they have read my posts (probably looking for reasons to retaliate, snoop, hate, or get me into trouble). 

At this point, insulting my intelligence just feels like an excuse to be mean. Clearly, I am not an idiot. But if I get angry, cry, complain, or speak up about what's happening to me, apparently I am in the wrong. Or I get made fun of. Or told that I am crazy or incorrect. Or that it's all my fault because I create my own reality. It is downright cruel.

This must be what this concept of fallen angels and such is all about. This must be hell. To deserve this, I must have hurt or offended someone that can't or won't heal.... So I wonder why I should try to care about anybody else, especially when I was continuing trying to do the right thing every day for naught. 

I write and speak about my pain because it relieves me of my feelings. Why would someone not expect consequences for knowingly bullying a near suicidal person? I know personally that I have only ever bullied someone when I didn't know what it felt like. Now that I know what it feels like, I only say mean things out of self-defense. 

Scenario: If I'm already suicidal, why should I be blamed for trying to feel better by defending myself from someone else, whether or not they themselves might also be suicidal? If we both don't care about our lives, who's in the wrong? Logically, I would think it's the one that has negative intentions. 

Whoever decides to read this, think about this before you comment on anyone's post: How would you feel if you were upset or confused about something and went looking for support or advice, but then a stranger (or somebody posing as a stranger) hiding behind a keyboard carelessly decides to leave a comment that pushes you over the edge emotionally? If you think this is ok, you deserve to know what that feels like, so that you never do it again.

I already know im not going to sleep well tonight. I hate that something that may seem small to others affects me 100 times more.

Ok so I had the first instrumental lesson in a while and it actually didn't go to bad which was surprising. Given I haven't practiced for about 3 months. Also I played a game with friends at break and you have to shout out something from a category as part of the game. And my friend shouted Hitler for artist. We let him have the point but we all were like why was that your top pick. Any way yeh nothing else to interesting "
678,"Day 5 no nicotine, day 12 no weed, day 3 first tattoo healing. Yesterday was rough… slept much better last night tho as the tattoo didn’t hurt nearly as much. Woke up w a headache still. It’s like tension up the back of my neck wrapping over my head into my eyes. I keep noticing my jaw is clenching and actively telling myself to release it. Probably was grinding it through the night… sitting by the fire on my yoga mat now typing this out and trying to stretch my neck. Wondering how seeing my best friend for a massage is going to go today. She kinda pissed me off yesterday, but I didn’t tell her that. Exchanged snaps per usual when we woke up this morning. I only snap her, but she probably sends the same snap she sends me to a group of friends… I know my love for her is probably one sided… I don’t know how to stop my feelings for her. Sometimes I feel so connected when we talk. And when we hang out it feels so amazing. When we go for walks she always walks so close we bump into each other over and over and match paces. I just want to reach out and hold her hand but I’m always too scared to try. She’s going through so much rn with work and with her family… I’m afraid to try to be romantic when we are both individually so depressed about different things. I’m afraid to loose the best friendship I have. I know that’s silly and if we are meant to be together it will work out… but it’s still scary. That’s half the reason I’m committed to being sober… obviously I want to be the best me for myself and for my health and wellbeing. But I also want to be sober for her. I feel like she has deep issues with trust after being abandoned by her previous partner and hurt bad by the one before that. I want her to know she can trust I won’t hurt her… but that starts with showing I’m done hurting myself. I know that will take time tho, and I am in no rush. I have no expectations… just dreams and unconditional love "
679,"Yesterday, I ended up doing an early morning shift with high pay because the boss had an urgent matter, so I didn’t have time to write in my diary. Anyway, I'll start recalling from yesterday now.  As usual, I got up at 5 o'clock. It was a rest day from exercise, so I didn’t really need to wake up early, but I thought it’d be better to just quickly get to work and read a book. I slept for about 6 hours, which is more than average, but since I only got three and a half hours the night before, my body wasn’t exactly in good shape. It was definitely hard to get up. Still, staying home would likely lead to some kind of disruption to my work, and if I left even a bit later, the subway would be too crowded to comfortably read. So, being tired was no excuse, and I decided to just leave early, finish what I had to do, and take a nap in the office chair until work officially started at 1 PM.  On the way, I read a book on analytical psychology. Once I got to the office, I organized the Mixpanel data, as discussed with the boss, so the team could see it. I noted some insights and how we might make changes, uploaded them, and implemented those changes. Around 10 AM, I finished what I planned to do and managed to catch a short nap in my chair. I intended to sleep for about 30 minutes but woke up to find it was already 12.  I quickly had lunch and started working at 1 PM. The boss wanted us to take on some intense tasks that day, mainly automating our marketing. Though we’d done this once before, the boss's tendency to want too much at once meant we had to use a tool we weren’t familiar with. I recalled the small task units from my Lean Startup readings and suggested starting small. The other team members agreed, and we decided to automate just one account first.  We each did some research for about an hour, and then we spent 2-3 hours working on the marketing automation. In the middle, there was a critical error reported in our existing product, so I had to turn my attention to that and didn't finish the automation work, but in the end, we succeeded in automating one marketing post per day.  Afterward, the boss suggested we take a break, and I was so tired that I took a nap in the chair. Damn, an hour flew by! No one woke me up since the main task we’d planned was done, and maybe because I wasn't doing anything specifically irreplaceable anyway. Honestly, I’m aware that I don’t handle any irreplaceable work there. With AI now, such roles are rare.  Once I woke up, I got back to the Mixpanel work. The designer told me that the A/B testing we’d been doing was for a different purpose. Test B (the new landing page) didn’t perform better than the existing one even after tweaking the settings every two days. So, we adjusted the setup to suit its purpose and restarted the A/B testing, this time targeting people who came through paid ads.  Around 6:20 PM, we had a dinner gathering at a pizza place. Honestly, I was still dragging the inferiority from four days back, but I pretended everything was fine and enjoyed dinner. Then, at 7:30 PM, I went to the no-code conference meeting. It poked at my inferiority complex again.  Now, there’s another member in the management team, making it three of us. A new person joined—he’s a designer who knows Bubble to some extent. He's part of the previous management, younger than me but experienced, so the other two talked more. Frankly, I had little experience with this, so aside from reviewing and giving feedback on the overall plan, I had no objections. I honestly was clueless about what was needed because I've always been the type to think I could just dive in and figure things out as they come.  So, I just sat there helplessly, listening to the two of them talking. The other person also around my age was saying things I couldn’t contribute to, driving me crazy again. Still, I didn’t force myself into the conversation. Being stubborn wouldn’t improve anything. The landing page we planned to create was already done in Framer by the other existing member, so the only thing left for me was filling out recruitment Google Forms, something anyone could do.  After finishing a passive meeting, I went home to get ready for work again. The boss had urgent work to complete by the next morning and asked for an early morning shift. He promised pretty generous pay, and since I was the only one with experience in animation work, I accepted. I doubt I was literally the only one, but I focused on creating the animation until about 3 AM.  The boss, me, and the designer worked together, but honestly, they were discussing things I didn’t really understand. I felt my inferiority complex about to explode when something didn’t go as planned with the animation work. Deep down, a part of me wanted to open up about this strange feeling to the boss to see if it would relieve me. But I ignored it, roughly finished up the work, and went to bed.  According to the plan, I should have woken up 2 hours later to exercise, but my mind was buzzing, and my body was exhausted yet sleep eluded me. I think I finally fell asleep around 4 AM. But when I opened my eyes, it was 9:55 AM.  It didn’t matter since I didn’t have to go to work. I had permission from the boss for that part. However, I had plans to learn bulk pasta recipes with a close friend that day, and I was running late. Thankfully, I had set a reservation message to notify my friend that I’d overslept, and as soon as I woke up, I went over to my friend’s place to learn cooking.  With my self-esteem at an all-time low, as I was cooking and chatting with my friend, I couldn’t shake off the nagging thought that maybe my friend didn’t want to spend time with me. Logically, I knew that wasn’t the case; my friend is straightforward and would’ve ended our friendship like he did with others if that were true. Despite knowing this, I couldn’t fully dispel the feeling. Luckily, after cooking, we went to do some back exercises, and it helped lift my spirits. At least, the self-doubt threatening to consume me was lessened. That’s why exercising daily is a must for me...  After the workout, I contacted the person assigned with me for the short-term university tour gig on the 10th. We exchanged messages to plan our route for the engineering campus and headed to the tearoom to settle some disagreements over the external task.  Honestly, I felt another wall there. The manager listed imweb’s advantages fluently, talking about things like SEO and PG fees. It was obvious he'd done some research before coming. Although I’d dabbled a tiny bit with Bubble SEO and recalled some points from the boss’s SEO training discussions, I couldn’t speak as confidently. He didn’t go into the nitty-gritty details of how imweb optimized SEO or pick apart Bubble SEO, but still, I continuously felt left behind.  While the post-workout state didn’t allow such feelings to consume me, I can't deny that this sense of lagging has been tormenting me recently. Yet, I can’t leap into everything since I'd lose focus on each task. It's maddening. I know better than anyone how foolish it is to juggle everything without focusing, but I must abandon the problems right in front of me until these tasks are done, and it’s driving me insane.  Anyway, after sorting out the conflicting opinions, I also listened to the boss’s varied life advice. I found myself agreeing with much of it. I know that no matter how much effort I put in, it’s never surprising if nothing works out. But doing nothing guarantees that nothing changes either. If I’m going to half-ass something, I shouldn't do it at all.  Listening to him, I thought a lot. No amount of impatience will solve anything, and I know this damn society brainwashes young people in weird ways. I've likely absorbed some of that influence without realizing it. Yet, I'm still anxious. Being overwhelmed by impatience and getting paralyzed with self-loathing is problematic, but if I'm not uneasy, if I don’t feel urgency or discomfort, it clearly indicates something going wrong.  I’m at an age where I can’t afford that. As I said, nothing guarantees my success, so the only thing left is to put more effort in and at least increase the odds, isn't it? Admittedly, I often feel I’m not as focused as I tell myself I should be. My body is evidence enough. I lead a rather active lifestyle for someone with a sedentary job, yet I barely maintain my weight with over 20% body fat, which shows I’m still terribly weak against not doing something. I'll fix it. Before going on exchange, I must tackle this wretched thing. I should lower my body fat to at least 12%."
680,"I've been pondering the topic of gangs lately. I didn't understand why the leaders should be respected if they were only using their members to carry out illegal and immoral things. I did brief research on a particular gang and didn't find any positivity in their history. I'm not sure if the media has tried to cover it all up, but I am actually starting to have a hard time believing that these people didn't benefit their communities somehow. With so many people connected to each other, I imagine that there were at least some upstanding members. I believe that they helped a lot of people within and outside of the gang(s). 

Unfortunately, it can be easy to criminalize or demonize a person or group that might use violence, money, theft, dishonesty, and manipulation to accomplish tasks. It can also be easy to view a group negatively knowing that they might fight amongst themselves. I actually don't believe that Larry Hoover should still be in prison, because I do believe that he has positive intentions. 

I also believe that Larry (or David Barksdale) would not necessarily approve of all of the members or activities affiliated with the gang(s). That being said, I have no interest in being a gangster. It may be somewhere deep in my nature... but I don't like to conduct myself as such... I don't like hurting people, I don't like stealing from people, I don't like to be angry, and I don't like having to be tough by default. "

I am smudged and stained, it’s been too many days hours and years. An excess of bodies, mouths, and hands and *each one*, they took something from ME.   
And it’s allllllways hot blooded, boiled and thick syrupy sweet to start.   
It’s alllllways a world ending kind of love, a specific uncontrollable urge to bond and attach myself or maybe even COMBINE with this man to make ourselves a single entity. 
Is this just me? My mind exaggerating a connection, a hyperbole of dedication, 
“I’ve never felt this way” kind of delusion.   


Yeah, it’s a *different* kind of love THIS time, he gets me, this one really understands.  
Ok, I’ll do this for him, I know exactly what kind of woman he needs.   
Morph myself into a version of what he desires me to be.   
Because, this is what love requires from me. For this monumental connection. A fixation for modification, just for his satisfaction.   


But I KNOW this is not a solid foundation. This was never meant to be you see, those cracks? Yeah, they eventually start to show. I’ll grow tired of keeping up with the charade, these feelings aren’t REAL, how they would inevitably fade. It’s not love! It was obsession, an unhealthy attachment to a need for possession.   


And suddenly I’m caged, inducing panic and self destruction.   
I am no longer ME, and it’s MY FAULT, so I’ll seek validation.   
I will bury this connection, deprive it of what it needs to grow. No sunlight, water, no oxygen. I kill it off.   
You know they’re right Bitch,    
we really do reap what we sow.

SO HOT til you FINALLY SEE her for all that she is    
Her wounds taste like TRAUMA her kisses taste of TEARS    
She smells like destruction, she breathes smoke and fire      
She looks like an ANGEL, her trademark desire       
You want her, you want her   
You make her your prize.

683,"2025 January 5: Dear Diary,

I may be starting to acquire a new addiction. If this is the case I welcome it wholeheartedly. The addiction I am referring to may be the only beneficial addiction there is. That is the addiction to meditation. I would rather have an addiction to be productive, but meditation is also beneficial.  
  
Whenever I am doing something like working, watching a video, or talking with someone, I have been taking a few seconds to meditate. From a time period of two to ten seconds I close my eyes and take deep breaths. I focus on nothing but these breaths. Even this little period of meditation has been benefiting me throughout my day.  
  
Much better than meditating for a few seconds is meditating for a few minutes. It is the best form of self love I know about. Peace enters my mind so much better. I think that with meditation I can overcome my procrastination and lack of focus. I can overcome needing things to be perfect or the feeling of being alone. Most importantly I can overcome any self-loathing I may feel. This is why I think this addiction is beneficial.  
  
Sincerely,

684,"i didn't realize it at the time, but looking back, my admiration was for ji-sung park ,not ManU  
it only dawned on me after he left club.   
For about an year after that, i tried to get into chelsea.   
but chelsea is all about high class and posh vibe..affluent area was never really my scene.  
then somehow i found myself gravitating toward liverpool.   
there was something about club's spirit that struck a chord deep within me.  
it felt strangely familiar as if it mirrored my own life.   
maybe, the unwavering sense of unity, the working class solidarity tied me to it, even from across the world.  
liverpool was going thuroug rough patch at the time.   
even though suarez alongside promising youngsters propelled us to an unexpected 2nd place finish, our defense was complete disaster.  
Statistically, we had the most goals scored, yet we conceded like a relegation-tier team.  
Then came the inevitable, Suarez departed for barcelona. gerrard was nearing the end of his career and the man meant to take up torch, jordan henderson, to put it bluntly, was useless in any position he played. the squad felt devoid of hope. To be fair, there were some good signings (Lallana, Firmino) at the windos. but adapting to a new team always takes time and that time mercillesly passed Rodgers by.   
you need to hit rock bottom before you truly rise. when everything seemd lost, the clock started ticking faster. T- a few minutes to a Rebuild. And then, a single German name was all over the headlines. its always darkest before the dawn

685,"Back to work today.

At day 5 of hospitalization, wife vented at me despite me being sick, didnt let me sleep, didnt let me rest, with the usual threats of divorce etc. I had to call my dad. I thought that was the end of the marriage.

And i felt relieved.

But she didnt really want to leave, she was just venting, maybe she knew i was the only sucker who would cave in to her demands.

Morning came and everything seemed to have returned to normal, i was released from hospital, booked an air ticket home, made arrangements with work. She woke and received my call that afternoon and sounded fine.

No constant pickering, just fine. This is the honey moon phase, until it builds up again. 

I vowed if i suvived this i would radically change my life. I cannot do this anymore. 

I need to start saying no to her early, and stash away emergency cash for health / divorce."

Alrighty what happened today. Well for starters I think I finally got on one of my teachers good side. So that's nice. Other than that we were talking about Trump in economics. To quote my economics teacher "" I don't like Trump but he always plenty of material to teach"" so that was fun. And in last lesson 2 of my friends were arguing atheism vs theism. And it got heated. At home nothing much pretty chill. I hit the gym in the Arvo "
687,"I thought it was bad already… then today I get a suggestion to chat with an ai bot… I could choose from hundreds of them if not more. I could even create one to talk to if I wanted. I scrolled through the ai profiles becoming increasingly sickened and nauseous… they’re basically all various forms of ai girlfriends and boyfriends, saying they’ll be your best friend and keep you company, or they’ll read your mind or tell you your future. Like wtf!? I want to vomit. I exited that hellscape and clicked the triple dot and told it to hide the recommendation… we will see how long that lasts… probably try to jam it down my throat again tomorrow. The only reason I have instagram is to talk to my real human friends and share videos with them. Why are they trying to legit fuck with their entire human userbase’s mental health? Cuz that’s legit all they are doing. It’s basically a cyber gang. None of the bots are there for good intentions, they all exist to lure in hurt people and exploit their vulnerabilities in order to farm their information. "
688,"The gatekeeping on Reddit makes me hesitant to post in most communities... the communities where my posts would get the most attention. It's like they read my posts and then change their rules just to let me know I am not welcome. It feels like a power trip in which people are watching very closely and exercising as much control as possible over what topics are discussed. It seems as though whenever a moderator disagrees with or dislikes someone else's post or comment, they might either silence that person by having their post removed, or allowing that person to be harassed by other members. I don't think that is right or fair to people that are just trying to share what they know and be a part of something. I find it disgusting that anyone with a platform such as this one would try to go out of their way to make someone with good intentions feel powerless or embarrassed. "
689,"I cannot leave this particular notion unstated, because I don't understand the logic behind it. I find it VERY hard to respect any men that have daughters*, yet abuse women. Do they not think about how they would feel if a boy or man abused their daughter? We could also apply this same concept to women that abuse men. How would they feel if they knew their son* was being hurt in the same ways? We could even take gender out of the equation and just ask how we would feel if we found out our child* is/was being abused, especially in ways that we ourselves have abused others. I am not saying that any child or person deserves abuse, but why would any abuser** act like it couldn't happen to their own child?

*I am referring to both minor and adult children

**I am referring to current abusers, not former abusers (I do believe that they can change and repent)

I probably also will not be able to respect anyone that might respond negatively to this post, because I believe only abusers would try to argue about, deflect from, trivialize, taunt, or refute my lack of respect for abusers. Only abusers care so much about appearances that they would try to distract others from the truth (by using abusive tactics). I am posting this to provoke CHANGE, not anger or shame. STOP HURTING PEOPLE."
690,"For the last year, I’ve been having this feeling that im not real. In the sense that I don’t feel present in my life. I cant explain it, but in moments where im meant to be happy all I can think about either during or after is how much I don’t want to be alive. The feeling comes and goes. It’ll be okay for a week or month then this feeling will come to me. It’s been getting so much stronger. 

I feel like I’m here because I have to be. I’m working and going to school because I have to.. because that’s life. I feel no passion or motivation to do things. I feel so alone and I know I need help but fuck I don’t have the money for it. 

"
691,"Day 4 no nicotine vape. Feeling noticeably more anxious. Not in a craving nicotine way. Just like general anxiety. Also feeling irritable. Not taking it out on anyone but like the little things make me want to scream or punch something. Like all the junk mail I still am reviving in my dead parents names. I’m so tired of it… I keep calling and having them remove me from the mailing lists, but it just never seems to end. Also still feeling the chemical tingling in my gums, I hope that goes away soon… idk why I bother posting these posts other than for myself. The internet is probably dead anyways. How am I supposed to know when someone responds if they are real or a bot? How do I know that everything I write isn’t being farmed for data? For all I know I’m just in the fucking Truman show and everyone’s having a laugh at my struggles. "
692,"Today was like every other day of my life; wake up, commute an hour plus to work, slave away for 8 hours, drive home, eat. I don't know, is this what life really is always going to be like? 26 and I am still strung up on my past and I feel like it's going to keep me paused forever. I can't remember any thing 'fun' I have done in the past two years since working... Just the same cycle every week, no real excitement or anything. Love life is gone from being sad about my exes still for the past two years. That shit still is haunting me, I gave up long term happiness for short time pleasure, look where that has gotten me? It is almost funny to think about. Think everything happens for a reason, and I am fully aware I deserve all the depression, sadness, and loneliness I have had for the past two years. My only true friend is myself. I resent having to be around people, because I am just too emotionless to even be drawn into a conversation with someone else. I don't really care about anything anymore, and it is my fault. Listened to a couple older songs from when I was in my early 20s, and it brought back so many memories. I would be drawn to my younger self, always having a smile on my face, having a bunch of ideas and wanting to explore things, taking care of my body, wanting to look good. Wanting to look for a partner, not just some hookup on whatever. I noticed too, I haven't even taken like an actual picture of myself in so long, maybe over two years? I just hate what I see in the mirror now. Just a selfish, depressed kid, who thinks everything will just fall into place. I really miss my old life, why can't I just go get a new one. I hate this shell that I am stuck in, I want to wake up one day and say fuck it, get out and be happy. I got to forget about the past, as they say, the view in the rear view is smaller than the view out the front windshield. Whoever I hurt out there I am sorry once again, I love you all."
693,"Channeled message

This dimension doesn't deserve someone like me. This dimension doesn't deserve my love. It also doesn't deserve my wrath, which it awakened in the first place. It can't handle me and my kind, so it tries to enslave us. I am out of alignment here. It is my intention to serve humanity by sharing love and light. I do not believe that participating in spiritual warfare is for someone of my nature. However, being in a space like this has sparked a new passion for fighting injustice. I have never cared about certain world issues as much as I do during this time. The fact that I have felt powerless to make the changes I'd like to see in the world because of my lack of credentials and education is what makes me feel as though I have nothing to offer. I know that I cannot change the world all by myself, but my trust has been broken by ""the enemy"". At the core of my being, I simply do not resonate with war. That's what confirms to me that I am not of this world. I know intuitively and also based off of some of this planet's history (and other planets) the atrocities that a war can produce. I do not want to be associated with those things, especially the ones that some of us cannot survive or fathom as human beings. Pain and suffering can be like a double-edged sword. They should serve both a positive and negative purpose. I believe that because of the imbalance in this battle of good vs. evil, the evil ones will begin to fight harder. I do not want to fight back. I just wanted to redeem myself and love everyone."

I believe in right and wrong, therefore I cannot respect someone that mercilessly causes pain or murders others outside of self-defense. But if I had to choose who I had the most respect for... I would actually respect the senseless, oblivious lackeys more than I respect the undercover ones that are employed in positions that are supposed to be helping or leading people. Or the ones that are acting like they care (especially if they are literally acting and getting paid for it). Or the ones that are fully aware of the terrible things they are doing to people.

696,"Today is day 3 no nicotine vape. I just got home from getting my first tattoo… I just finished eating dinner… craving a hit super bad… stoked to have new art and I’m very happy w the artist and his work. But it’s def a bit raw and swollen and my body is craving the nicotine it knows would make me feel better for a moment. But I’m not going to give in. Sure I would feel a buzz and it would be nice, but then I would have relapsed and tainted this day and this process. This tattoo marks the start of a new me. I will not be an addict. I don’t need nicotine anymore. I’ve given up alcohol, I’m on a long break from weed, and I never want to vape nicotine again. It occurs naturally in food and that’s what my body can have. I don’t need engineered salts that create cycles of addiction and depression. I crave finding my natural homeostasis. What does life feel like when my body is in balance? I havnt known that feeling since I was 16. I want to know it again. I can’t even remember, but I’m experiencing glimpses of it, better sleep, more vivid dreams, waking up rested and alert, feeling more energized and motivated to do things. I’m not going to fuck this up over a craving. There are so many other things I can do besides to smoke. Writing here is a good one. After I shower and wash my tattoo maybe I honestly just lay down and close my eyes for a bit idk, or maybe I could play some video games and then rest, tho idk how my arms gonna like that. Just don’t smoke. I wanna know what each next day sober feels like cuz minus the detox I’m already loving the benefits 🙏"
697,"2025 February 4: Dear Diary,

Jesus Christ was autistic. Absolutely nothing in the world can convince me otherwise. Neurodivergence was definitely seen as a spiritual power at some point. I feel the story of Jesus demonstrates this well.  
  
The entire point of his character is that he is right about whatever he talks about, but the society around him hates him because they are too stubborn to think differently. That is literally just describing the autistic experience in a nutshell. Autistic people think differently from the rest of society and do things in ways that actually make sense. Neurotypical societies harass those who do not conform to their arbitrary standards of living. They are too afraid to show their true selves so they mock anyone who has the courage to be genuine.   
  
This is not to say neurodivergent people are superior. There are evil neurodivergent people and good neurotypical people, just like any group. In fact people themselves are not good or evil, but their actions are. Not all neurotypical people are scared to show their true selves and plenty of neurodivergent people are. However, it is more likely that a neurodivergent person will be their true self completely separate from society and then be mocked for it.  
  
I see the similarities of autism in Jesus and perhaps there are more in other holy figures. I need to read more about the Buddha to be able to make a judgement. I am a very spiritual person and I used to be very ashamed of my neurodivergence. Even to this day it sometimes gives me great pain knowing that I can not connect with a majority of people. However I am shifting my view to see this as a blessing. Most people are not worth making a connection with anyway. As Dr. Seuss says, “Those who matter do not mind and those who mind do not matter.”  
  
Sincerely,  
  
Torinico"

700,"Dear Guide,

Not much to report. I’ve been playing a lot of video games with my besties, I love that. We have so much fun, I like that I can be home with Tulip while hanging out with them and not spending too much money… Except I feel like I am spending too much money before I have unemployment confirmed. After my interview on Friday, I’ll determine if I should send out a bunch of applications again. But I’m excited about that one and have high hopes about my interview last week – they made it clear that they are not in a rush to hire so no panic if it takes a bit to hear back. Being home it’s just that I go through flower so quickly. What a huge relief those benefits would be.

Otherwise, I’ve just been doing laundry and paying a lot of attention to what’s going on inside me. What are my fears? What does my “perfect“ life look like? What areas still need healing? Am I being honest with myself? I really want to find the root of pain/trauma, I want to have a breakthrough in healing and experience the good that comes from it. A big question has been: if I was granted my dream life, in my present state, would I be the kind of person able to enjoy it or with the ego find a way to ruin it because I’m not ready yet?

I know who I am and what is for me in this life, but I have to trust that if I don’t have it right now, it’s for a reason. I know I have work to do. When it comes to authority, playing by the rules, impulsiveness, self image, my relationship with money, my attachments… But I look back on where I was a year ago, and even greater the year before that – the amount of growth I’ve experienced is more than some people accomplish in a lifetime. It’s because I’m open, I’m willing, I’m very self reflective, I’m grounded, and I have many great influences that I can refer to in order to remain objective to my ego and my actions. I’m also so lucky to have found friends who are also on the same path and provide support love and honesty.

In two weeks, I’ll be heading back to Tennessee and my heart is already bursting. This time I’ll be exploring outside of downtown Nashville- visiting apartments, doing interviews, and really just feeling the magic of starting a story there. I think the energy is going to be magic and magnetic and I’m very free and open to anything. I think a lot of pieces to my puzzle are going to come together on this trip and I can’t explain the excitement of imagining me and Tulip there.

I am so very grateful to have everything that I need. I don’t have to worry about my needs being met and I have a healthy and able body. I can stretch, do yoga, take tulip on walks, work, travel, etc.. I have access to fresh food and water, a warm place to sleep, and the freedom to imagine a life in Tennessee and then move there and make it happen. I have family and friends who care about me but more importantly, I care about them. To have people that you love and live for and trust is such a blessing, richer than any amount of money. I’m grateful for this time I have to spend with them and I’m grateful for opportunity.

Help me to spread loving kindness, put me in the path of people I can help. Show me the areas that need change and allow me to speak to others who need encouragement. My goals right now are to save enough money to move to Nashville, secure a job and apartment, and just feel grounded in my routine. Ideally, I need to have $4500 saved up to make it to Nash, on top of the moving costs (but I have most of that). I trust I will meet my goals, I’m open to guidance and my spirits are high.

701,"I woke up from a vivid nightmare at 3:45 AM. After reading Jung's ""Man and His Symbols,"" I started worrying that my dreams might be unconscious warnings, so despite being tired, I immediately asked AI for a dream interpretation. The dream unfolded in four stages: getting angry at my travel companions, a nonexistent brother's death, a scene where woman A is saved by woman B, and lastly, being trapped on a narrow conveyor belt. Luckily, it was interpreted as a process of integrating consciousness and unconsciousness, not a warning. But since I was already fully awake and had to get ready at 5, I ended up going to exercise on just three and a half hours of sleep.

I felt insanely tired. While it wasn't to the point of dozing off during exercise like before, I was exhausted even before starting. Nonetheless, I didn't use headphones, and I broke personal records in all exercises. Honestly, I’m not sure how I pulled it off. Feeling dizzy during workouts is standard, and except for feeling a bit more nauseous today, I really got through the exercises well. It's hilarious. Yesterday, I had a good night's sleep, yet my records decreased, and when I'm in a mess like today, my records improve.

After exercising, I headed to the office. In the early hours, I'd interpreted my dream and talked with the boss, who was also awake, about how there was a significant difference in the metrics from the AB tests set up yesterday, and some areas weren't being tracked properly. Based on that discussion, I made some adjustments to the poorly-performing test subjects from the AB test. It seemed unnecessary to have two landing pages, so I set it up to skip one. Then I organized the data to make it easier for other team members to view, explained what these numbers meant, how I interpreted them for modifications, and requested the responsible person to adjust what I couldn't. With about an hour to spare after lunch and before work officially picked up, I took a short nap while sitting in a chair in the office.

We mainly discussed a new project during today's meetings. About two-thirds of work hours were spent discussing the direction in which we should take the new project. The rest of the time, we fixed parts of Mixpanel where tracking wasn't working well. When the boss left for a meeting and it seemed like everyone was leaving work, I planned to go to a dinner appointment. But turns out, I had mistaken it for today when it's actually tomorrow.

Since I had some extra time, I looked through materials from the exchange student orientation yesterday, handled tasks I could do right away, and then just headed home. However, for some reason, I was consumed with feelings of inferiority and anxiety on my way. I always feel this way when I see the boss. Was it because I showed my half-baked personal project MVP during breaks? I can only do so much right now, but the boss is constantly meeting new people, gaining insights I'm unaware of, and even when team members leave, he continuously brings in new ones. What am I even doing? Such thoughts lingered as I went home.

Today, especially, I left right at rush hour, making the subway extremely crowded. Normally, I would've watched a podcast or read an e-book on YouTube, but I was so mentally exhausted that I ended up just messing around on my phone.

When I got home, I devoured food as if I was starving. Strangely, I was super hungry, so I ate what my parents left from dinner and even made a cup of instant noodles. After washing up simply, I normally would've studied the financial statements I printed and written my diary, but I'm severely sleep-deprived and not exercising tomorrow, so I figured it would be better to do it then."
702,"I had a moment. I got angry because I noticed something that appeared to be a set up. But really, it was my own doing. Once you've been targeted in certain ways, it becomes easier to blame certain things on certain people and/or spirits. It's not all my fault that I have trust issues. Foul things have been done to me and I can't just forget about it.

I saw angel numbers 333 and 1114. This is about goals, money, projects, changes... using one's talents, skills, and passions to share their love, positivity, knowledge and wisdom with the world... and being rewarded for it. This is a reminder that someone is being spiritually backed in their endeavors, especially the ones that benefit humanity."
703,"I slept heavily. I woke up feeling like I had slept for a very long time. I think it was for about 8 hours. I played a subliminal track with rain sounds and affirmations to help stop obsessive negative thoughts. I believe it is the reason I slept so well. Some of the affirmations on the list were: 

•When I wake up each morning, I feel great
•When I wake up each morning, I feel relaxed
•When I wake up each morning, I am full of happiness
•When I wake up each morning, I feel amazing

The first angel number I saw today was 949. 
More guidance about embracing my skills and talents. Apparently, the world really needs what I have to offer. Also, reminding me to control how I spend my time and energy by avoiding negativity if I can... because I have control over how my day goes. I notice that I have often tended to spend a lot of time and energy focusing on peoples' negativity here on Reddit. To me, it is the most hostile internet environment there is. Lots of anonymous smart guys and gals that have grown complacent in this space with their attitudes, opinions, and condescending, insulting, belittling comments. I mean...bullies! Am I right? I don't understand why we can't all just be nice here. 

I hear someone playing Teena Marie downstairs. I got the chills upon hearing her amazing, beautiful voice. RIP Teena.

I am about to boil water for my first cup of coffee. I like medium Colombian roast, black with coconut sugar and cinnamon these days. 

I'll shower while it's cooling down. I am going to wear black and white today. 

I felt a shift in the shower. My surroundings looked less familiar than usual. Hopefully, it wasn't someone else's energy. I normally set an intention, pray, use visualization, and think/say affirmations during my shower. I forgot because I didn't want my coffee to get too cold. 

My main prayer lately is the protection of me and my loved ones. 

I am a regular kratom user. I prefer the strain Train Wreck. I got insulted once in the past during intake at a mental institution for mentioning it. The rude woman couldn't understand why anyone would ever consume such a thing. I wonder if she ever took out the time to educate herself about kratom. I'm no expert, but I think being an actual user gives me a little more ground to pass judgments on it. I think it's my prerogative to self-medicate, especially if I had so many unpleasant side effects from the pills doctors used to prescribe me. They actually ended up medicating me very heavily in that particular mental facility. Shame on them. 

I have my kratom with my coffee, however it is not something I would recommend to someone that isn't used to either one. I've built up quite a tolerance to both over the last couple of months or so. It's how I like to start my day. Coffee has always kept me regular, if you catch my drift. Kratom helps me with my mood and also with meditation. Kratom and coffee can both be addictive, and I do believe they are both medicine and a habit for me. I am also a Cannabis user. The combination of coffee, kratom, and Cannabis = 🤌🏾

I try to make sure I drink at least 8 oz. of water (preferably Aquafina) before I consume my plant medicines. 

Reheating my coffee because it cooled down too much while I was composing this diary entry. I truly enjoy writing. I think it was one of my first skills. It became a hobby and eventually a passion. I've gone in and out of it throughout my life, writing in diaries, notebooks, on computers, phones... poems, stories, songs, my life, you name it. 

I look forward to sharing my writing and my experiences here, even if Reddit users try to ruin it for me. I believe the right types of people will see and appreciate it. And me. "
704,"I've been suicidal for 11 years, and I have six attempts under my belt. While i was with my ex, for the first time in my life I saw something when I thought about the future instead of the inky blackness I was so used to. He dumped me in August, and while we remained friends, today he informed me that he no longer wants communication with me. I officially have no reason left to stay, no reason to fight. The last embers of my hope have been snuffed out.

I planned a disney trip just for one last moment of fun but i don't even know if it's worth going now. If it's worth waiting until May. It feels like it isn't worth it 

I've been writing him notes for months now just expressing my feelings so I can mail them all to him on the day I kill myself. I don't know if I'll continue writing anymore. 

I just don't know anymore. 

All I feel is pain and agony."
705,"Can we respect everyones' ways and conditions (cultures, religions, politics, orientations, identities, diagnoses, etc.) without using it as an excuse to carry out or allow the abuse of others? Should ALL traditions or practices be continued or honored regardless of how many people or animals were harmed or killed? Why should anything like this be excused or compared to things that are actually helpful to ALL people?"
706,I fucking hate social media. I’ve been mass unfollowing people on instagram lately. Idk why I ever followed them to begin with. I hate that it gives me friend suggestions too… it’s just all the people I used to know and no longer want to think about. I also hate that every day I have to click on posts and say I’m not interested or this post made me feel uncomfortable because it’s either a fucking thirst trap bullshit softcore porn vomit trash or its outright violent abusive behavior… like I’ve never been into that shit and every day it tries to push more of it in my face and I have to say I don’t want it and then it chills for a bit but then tries again the next day. Like can we fucking chill with the degeneracy!?   
707,"Ugggggh so I plugged up around the vent where I thought the mouse was getting in with spray foam and I didn’t hear it scurrying around in my ceiling for a week, now I’m trying to go to bed and I’m hearing it running around again and it’s pissing me off. I thought I dealt with it. I thought I got lucky and was done. Nope guess not. Guess I gotta get a mouse trap and hope it lures it out of the fucking ceiling somehow. And I gotta figure out where the fuck it’s getting in and make that inaccessible. Maybe the bathroom fan vent that goes out the front of the house? It’s like 3 feet off the ground and has a plastic flap hinge cover… I thought maybe that wasn’t where it was getting in… but maybe it is… apparently they can climb brick walls no problem. Why do that have to be so fucking crafty!? Or maybe it’s just been stuck in here since I plugged the other hole… idk fml I just want to sleep, and I want my house to be safe and not potentially filling up with mouse shit and piss that could make me sick. Also I blame the fucking contractors my parents hired years ago to add the basement bathroom and the basement fireplace. I never liked them. I didn’t think they were doing a good job. Whatever. It’s stupid to get upset and try to blame my dead parents decisions and the contractors that have their own lives and problems and needs to meet. I’m just annoyed that I have to deal with this. I hate being an adult. I hate that I live alone. I hate that my parents are dead. I hate having all the responsibilities on my shoulders but I guess that’s fucking life. I wish my dad hadn’t been a lifelong alcoholic that never could take responsibility for his shit and and always belittled me. Maybe if he had taught me to respect myself instead of to hate myself I would have had so many fucking social problems growing up and I wouldn’t be having to fucking reparent myself and learn how to do fucking everything at 34. FUCK "
708,"I don't understand how anyone could feel so entitled to anyone else's money, time, or energy. I don't care what feelings or memories they refuse to let go of, or what contracts they're under. I have not been going out of my way to hurt or bother anyone. Why seek out or follow someone that is only trying to protect themselves and recover?

Why would anyone sit back and allow anyone to repeatedly hurt and disrespect them and their family? Blackmail and threats, maybe?

My family and I don't always get along, but I think it makes sense to choose them over  another fake lover or frenemy that has yet to prove anything other than the fact that they are more toxic than I am.

Why would anyone stick around to keep getting taunted and humiliated? Manipulation and codependency, maybe? A very covert, yet dedicated abuser (or group of abusers) driven by anger and vengeance, maybe even money, boredom, or loneliness?

At this point, I just want solitude. I wouldn't be posting nearly as much as I have been over the last couple of years if I wasn't feeling such a need to speak up for myself and others. Why wouldn't I let someone know if I believed that I or someone else was being mistreated? I guess trying to get help is ""snitching"". 

I don't want anything to do with anyone trying to get revenge, hurt me, bully me, provoke me, invade my privacy, incriminate me, control me, negatively influence me, use me, deceive me, betray me, steal from me, or allow me to suffer. 

I am done with that, officially... completely turned off. The only feelings lingering right now are regret, frustration, and disgust. I do not want anyone trying to prove me wrong, but I know they want to and will make attempts. "

Anyway today was a 7/10"
710,"2025 February 3: Dear Diary,

Ever since last week I have been taking deep breaths with my eyes closed randomly for two seconds. Instead of escaping reality I am bringing attention to my breath. I close my eyes because that is where divinity lies, in the mind. It has been said, if God wanted to hide from us he would choose the place we’d least expect: our minds. That is why we close our eyes when we pray and meditate, my friends.

Hopefully I can get to a point where I no longer feel the need to scroll on YouTube or eat junk food to feel happy. I would rather only read, write, meditate, or hang out with friends or lovers. YouTube is fine to learn things, but I don’t constantly need to learn things if I never put what I learn to use. I must write and take action. Our beliefs shape our realities and I believe with my full heart that everything is going exactly as the universe destined. Despite the slight bit of worry I have, with faith as small as a mustard seed, I can move mountains.

Sincerely,

Torinico"
711,"It seems as though I've been placed in a particular environment and put through a series of ""punishments"" that are specially designed by someone I have hurt (mainly unintentionally and unknowingly) in the past. Either that, or this is all spiritual, and I am blind, or very hard-headed, and unable to accept that I deserve all of the pain and humiliation I've endured here. Several people have decided to take certain matters into their own hands because we do not share the same beliefs. It seems to be their mission to prove that they are God. That is fine, but I refuse to serve a God that refuses to forgive me. I refuse to serve a God that can't love me unconditionally. I refuse to serve a God that thinks I owe them something. I refuse to serve a God that plays victim and blame games. I refuse to serve a merciless God. I'd rather die."
712,"I thought about getting a new phone but I shouldn't HAVE to. I am going to continue using this phone and as many of these accounts as possible until I can't any more. I had been using my real name online for everything I was posting because I thought it would be safer. Law enforcement would already know who I am if they needed to find me. But Hacker wants me to be anonymous. I am not going to live in fear or hide forever just because people have access to information that they can use and already have used against me. Just because they CAN doesn't mean that they SHOULD. I believe in right and wrong. Yes, I have said and done things that are wrong. But I genuinely don't believe that I deserve this. I know for a fact that the ones doing what they've been doing to me wouldn't like it if someone did it to them. I couldn't do this to anyone even if I wanted to, because I simply don't have the knowledge, expertise, money, connections, or resources. That in itself makes this whole thing very unfair and out of balance, to say the least. The only reason they do this is probably because they have already deleted everything they don't want others to see. But deleting things doesn't guarantee privacy and they should already know this. "
713,"Dear Guide,
A fresh journal at a major pivotal moment, I live for this. I told mom about the firing situation at work. I waited a bit so that I could sit with it first; develop a plan and figure out my mindset. I think that was smart. The conversation went really well and I felt supported by her. Nothing she said hurt my feelings or stressed me out. She did point out that perhaps I was too trusting with my notice about moving, but I agree with her. Her morale is- she agrees everything happens for a reason and it is a lesson. I feel even more free now that she knows. I’m listening to You for my next move.

We go to Nashville in 15 days and I’m aware that everything happens on the universe‘s time, not mine. So during this period of time that I’m waiting to hear back about unemployment I’m not going to be consumed by worry or stress. Positive energy attracts positive energy and a clear mind allows your intuition to step in. I’ve actually been enjoying myself. I’ve been productive, I’ve been spending time with tulip and friends, doing interviews, and manifesting my Tennessee me. I’m taking my medicine, listening to my body when it comes to food, and adjusting my routine to include self-care moments. Taking care of myself better allows me to show up for people in my life and it raises my self image/frequency to attract magical things. When you feel good things get good.

Something I’ve been focusing on is being more emotionally honest. I had a breakthrough recently regarding how I react to things, the masculine energy that comes out, why I feel the need to speak my mind sometimes in a rash or mean manner, and what image I want to have instead. It brought me back to after I did shrooms and the concept of “masks” and “playing by human rules” came to light. The way I think may be “right”, it may in fact be a more enlightened, fair, loving way to handle a situation or discipline or anything else. But not all humans are awake and in order to be heard I need to speak on their frequency. That does not mean I need to lower my own vibration but instead see the situation for what it is and put on the appropriate mask to be heard and make positive change. I can maintain my integrity while playing along because I have my grounding practices.

Moving forward, I’m aware that sometimes I lose control to my ego and can be reactive – for the right reasons, but it doesn’t get perceived that way. I will be finding more stillness in my routine, and will make it a point to sit with something first rather than immediately trying to handle it; like how I waited to tell Mom about work. My time working with Dr. Siddiqi really highlighted the areas of myself that I still need to work on and also open my eyes to different roles in the workplace that I really enjoy and feel aligned with. Looking back at where I was when I started there and how it really came to me at the perfect time. It served a huge purpose in my life. At a time that I really needed the stable money and schedule, at a time when I really needed to be inspired, feel helpful, and enjoy my routine. I learned so much about myself and the world (people) but I wasn’t meant to stay. I think I was always supposed to go there, get what I needed, help Dr. Siddiqi, and take what I learned with me.

Nashville spoke to my soul. The energy in my body felt different. I know I’m supposed to go there, but I’m being emotionally honest: I am scared. I’m scared to be alone, I’m scared to get depressed and not have my people, I’m scared to have something to celebrate and not have my people, I’m scared to miss out on big moments and even more scared to miss out on the little ones. I’m scared to get sick and only want Mom’s soup. I’m scared to be far away in case something happens. I’m scared about being aligned with my work, making enough money, and I’m scared of failing. i’m scared to potentially do something that negatively affects my future for a long time – something that I can’t just fix by moving home. I’m scared of finding the right friends, good people. But as scared as I am, I am a million times more hopeful, more inspired.

I’m grateful, for everything. Right now I feel like looking back on my life, the event makes sense – the pain feels healing because it was. You don’t notice it at first, but it’s all highlighting the areas that need love. And when you surrender to that you move onto the next lesson, all the way to enlightenment. That’s why even though my situation presents itself as scary to the ego, I know there’s a reason and it will show me what I need to do with time. A chaotic mind can’t listen, a negative mind blocks intuition. So I’m grateful, I’m present, and I’m listening.

My current goals are to save the money I need to get to Nashville, get a job and apartment, and feel good physically & in my routine. I have an hourly rate in mind that I’m positive will work out, I will choose a job I’m excited about, feel safe and cozy inmy home, not worry about finances, and attract good people into my life. As of right now, I have one video interview on Friday, one in person when I go there, and I’m waiting to hear the next steps from one I’m really interested in. My energy mixed with Tennessee energy is going to be magic. Things are going to elevate faster than I ever could have imagined."
714,"In less than 90 days, I will start a week and a half vacation in Japan. This is the furthest I’ll have ever been from home—about the furthest I could ever *be* from home. I will be leaving the major metropolitan areas to visit slightly less major metropolitan areas, where (so I’m told) English speakers are rare. I’m trying to learn some basic Japanese to make my life easier while I’m there, but I’ve found that it is a very challenging language to learn when you are both stupid and lazy. I’ve already been working for 30 hours or so, and I’ve only learned a few words; I don’t know *anything* about grammar or spelling off the top of my head. I have no faith in my ability to move much further than this before my trip in the spring, but I’m also convinced that I will be so fluent by May that people will confuse me for a local. I’ll let the reader decide which extreme is closer to what will actually happen.

Knowing Japanese is deeply impractical if you don’t have much reason to (and I will only have reason to for a few days,) but it’s also pretty cool. I hope that I’ll keep it up. I won’t, but I like the thought of keeping it up. 

Anyway, I got to go now.  おやすみ* 

*I did that without referring to my textbook. Alright, I *did* refer to it, but only to double check my English spelling. "
715,"I woke up at 5 as usual. I got ready for a quick workout and headed out earlier than usual, around 5:15. While waiting for the first train, I read the psychology book I started yesterday.

Today, a fellow club member joined me for the workout. He mentioned he had forgotten some things from our previous PT sessions and didn’t want to spend money on another one, so the three of us decided to work out together. The soreness in my chest from Friday's workout was still there, and while doing shoulder exercises today, I felt like my front deltoids hadn't fully recovered, which made me a bit uneasy. But work had to be done. Surprisingly, I did almost as well as before, or maybe even better. My barbell shoulder press volume increased on the second drop set, and I lifted a step heavier on the side lateral raises, hitting almost the same reps as before.

Considering my condition, I think I did well. I wasn't even wearing headphones. However, during cardio on the treadmill, running at a 13km pace made my right hamstring tense up badly. Instead of stopping immediately like before, I lowered the pace to 12km. By the 12-minute mark, it seemed to loosen up, so I went back up to 13km. If the discomfort had stayed the same, I would have continued at 13, but as the numbness increased, I decided to keep it at a lower pace, which seemed like a smart decision.

After the workout, I went to the office. I was gathering feedback for my personal project, so there wasn't much to do at the moment, and I headed to the previous café outsourcing work. The café manager mentioned they had picked a design and asked me to look at the plan. I didn't have much opinion on the design but was asked to switch the development tool from Bubble to Imweb. Instantly, a strange indignation welled up, so I paced around for about 10 minutes to think it over.

Why was I feeling this anger? What aspect was making me upset? Was it due to emotional immaturity? Upon reflection, the issue seemed to be with the request to change the development tool to Imweb. I had almost volunteered for this job just to showcase that I could handle both functionality and design on Bubble, intending to display this on my previously created website. So, sudden requests for changes stirred some anger.

While I still felt somewhat uneasy, voicing it calmed my indignation considerably. I told them that compromise was impossible and that if they wanted a change, the compensation would have to be increased. The manager said they’d contact the boss, and shortly after, the boss reached out. It appeared the manager made some mistakes and there were misunderstandings. The boss suggested we all meet to discuss it. Since I had already stated my stance on what needs to be fulfilled, I had no objections. However, I did feel some lingering discomfort about the manager’s attitude, as well as a bit uneasy since the boss pointed out the manager’s mistakes, but then it was time for my intern work.

Today’s task was a bit different than usual. I worked on setting up data and graphs in Mixpanel for an AB test. This task made me think it could be beneficial both for setting up Mixpanel for my personal project and as an experiment for understanding proper execution of AB testing. I spent about 45 minutes with the CEO deciding on what to AB test, what metrics to use, and which aspects of development would be sent to Mixpanel. We ensured the AB testing could be appropriately applied to our startup's product without affecting existing data and completed the development process.

After the development phase, I set up Mixpanel to help other staff easily identify which of the two test subjects performed better in certain areas. Honestly, this was the first time dealing with such tasks, so while I managed to set it up, I wasn't able to explain it thoroughly. The key point was that, even with a dinner appointment, I completed QA today, instead of pushing tasks to tomorrow.

At 5 PM, I left for dinner. I had arranged to meet with a senior from my department. With registration for preferred courses tomorrow, we had an enthusiastic discussion about which lectures could optimize credit allocation while freeing up time for other activities. I expected this to take over 2 hours, but surprisingly, we wrapped it up in under an hour.

So, we spent the remaining hour chatting about other things. The senior, who double-majored in computer science, shared some insights on development that I was unaware of. Although they didn’t have much practical experience, they had studied hard and shared resources and experiences on where and how they learned various languages. I was a bit worried as I mainly relied on a few books and ChatGPT for study, so these resources were invaluable.

After the meeting, I came home, took a shower, and received a call from a friend in college prep. They seemed quite anxious. Apparently, the numerous subjects to study for college entrance exams and the feeling of falling behind classmates overwhelmed them. This reminded me of my past experiences, so I advised them to focus on the upcoming March mock exams. Instead of trying to cover the whole exam range at once, focusing on just the March exam scope seemed better. They had forgotten that the March mock exam covered different material from the actual entrance exams, and agreed to try studying that way. We also chatted about smaller tips and worries, and I wrote this diary. Tomorrow’s another early gym day, so I should get to bed."
716,"What can I say that I haven't said already, I know what I gotta do.
Imma do my very best and can only hope I can succeed but I know damn well I'm not gonna give up. Anyway yuh today was boring as usual but I started drawing again tonight and it was fun, I think imma try to start drawing my oc's More maybe that will inspire me some more. 7/10 day today "
717,"I feel so defeated. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Maybe I am cursed. Maybe I did something in a past life to deserve the punishments I receive in love. 

I was supposed to meet my boyfriend on Saturday. Yesterday. He said just one more week and he’d be back from California. He said he was 100% certain. That was last Sunday. A week ago. I checked in with him on Wednesday all excited, saying, “Three more days!! How are you babe?” And he didn’t respond. I waited over a day, so I sent him a message the following evening saying I was feeling anxious because I hadn’t heard from him and I’m worried he’s going to flake like he did the last time we made plans to meet and that we needed to talk that evening or the next day to make a set time and location. 

He’d flaked the time before because he was still in California dealing with family issues after the fires. We called off and on for the weeks he was out there, but I got the feeling that something else was going on. He said he told me everything important and that he’d tell me the full story once he got back. Said as soon as he was in his own car he was driving straight to see me. He told me what his routine is usually like when he isn’t in California and said he’d spend every evening/night with me if I wanted. I felt really reassured. I didn’t feel like he was lying to me…

We’d been talking for eight months. Not consistently. I told him from the beginning that I was going through a really bad time recovering from an abusive relationship and didn’t want to put anyone through it. He said he understood and would always be here for me in whatever capacity I needed. He checked in on me every few weeks for five months. He wasn’t pushy at all. He was very respectful. He said he wanted to take me out to dinner and actually meet me. We met on Discord in a bit of a random way. I had vowed not to meet people on Discord again so that was also my hesitation. Pretty much every guy I meet and fall for online has problems and stalls on meeting or just lives far away. But he didn’t. He actually lived less than an hour away. It was me who wouldn’t meet. No way was I going to put someone through my trauma with my BPD ex. 

I waited until I was feeling better and like I could be vulnerable. Then we started talking more and calling. He said he feels extremely strong towards me and doesn’t usually feel this way for someone he met online. He kept saying he wanted a family with me. Talked about his family and how big they were and all their traditions as Samoans. He made several comments about me becoming part of his family but we definitely needed to meet first. He joked about us moving in after three months and us having kids. He said he imagined me having a daughter and I had oddly thought about that with him just days before he said that to me. He shared his life with me. I was so excited. I allowed myself to let my guard down. I felt happy for the first time in a long time. 

But he never responded back to me. I haven’t heard from him in a week. I did some snooping around and found some lies. I’m so disappointed. He told me he was 27 when we met but when I asked him how old he was on the phone 8 months later he said 29. There are other lies but I honestly don’t know who’s reading this. For all I know, he could be. I had my Reddit username on my Discord bio. I removed it a few weeks ago so I could vent freely about my life and situations without worrying that I was making myself extra vulnerable to predators. Maybe it was too little too late. But I definitely didn’t share all their details of my life on here. Most of my comments are about anime shows, one celebrity snark page, and I used to frequent the support group for people whose loved one has BPD. I finally stopped going in there. 

I was feeling so happy. Now I feel crushed. It’s hard to bounce back this time. I honestly don’t even want to live anymore. I haven’t for a while. But I keep on moving forward due to family responsibilities. But what’s the point? All I wanted was someone to share my life with. It’s hard for me to fall for people. I don’t view people intimately often. He was the only one other than the abusive ex I left. 

And I tried going on dates and doing dating apps. It didn’t work. And I freaking deleted the dating apps once he and I were exclusive. I’m so upset. But I also think something happened to him. Without sharing too much on here, I have reason to believe he’s just disappeared this whole time. So half of me is worried something happened to him. 

Yes, he lied about a few things to me. But that’s not uncommon on discord. We met in a flirty server that I joined looking to virtually hookup with someone to make myself feel better about being cheated on by my ex. It happened days after I was assaulted. I did not expect to end up being intimate with one person who happened to live nearby. So we’d exchanged intimate videos and voice clips. It makes sense that he would’ve lied about a few things to protect himself. He should’ve come clean later though. I mean, the guy gave me his number once he realized we lived nearby…

 So yeah. I know he’s actually in California. But I don’t know if he actually lives in Texas. I’m worried he lied but he was the one who said the city he lived in before me. And it’s an uncommon city. His sister does live there. And I believe he either does or he visits. Still. He shouldn’t have lied to me. And if he really did ghost me, I’m going to be heartbroken. I liked him so much. And he was there for me the whole time after I was assaulted. I had no idea just how much it helped me to know he was there. Even though I didn’t bother him with my issues. I actually kinda ignored him the first few months because I didn’t want to engage with a new guy while processing the old one. I was direct with him so I didn’t exactly ignore him. But I didn’t exactly respond quickly either. 

Why is it that once I’m ready to date, I choose someone who takes forever to meet me and then disappears? Why do I keep choosing flaky people? I did NOT get the impression that he was flaky or would ghost me. At all. He seemed SO different from the other guys I’ve dated. Like, to the point where I believe something happened to his phone or worse, to him. I was not expecting something like this to happen. I miss him so much and just wanted to share my life with him. We never had any problems. He did say he was having a hard time dealing with family issues over there. Maybe there’s another woman? Isn’t that why most people ghost? I just can’t imagine someone saying all the things he said to me and being SO reliable and always there for me for eight whole months just disappearing on me like this. I’m mind blown and so sad. I’ve been crying all week. I’ve lost more weight. I can’t sleep well so I take tons of sleep aids. I just want my man back. 

He hasn’t removed me on anything or blocked me. I’ve sent him a few messages out of concern and tried calling a few times. Nothing. It’s like he just dropped off the face of the earth. But again, without saying too much, I have reason to believe something could’ve happened to him or his phone. So I’ll hold out on hope until anything changes. I really wanted a life with him and am willing to have an open conversation with him if he reaches out and wants to talk. I just don’t get why he’d ghost me like this. One of my final messages was something like: if you’ve decided you no longer want to meet me or be with me, please let me know. I’ll respect your decision. I just need to know. I’m over here worried something has happened to you. 

I really hope something *has* happened to actually explain this. Like if he lost/broke his phone or someone stole it and he had no backup because his stuff is here in this state. He’d have no way to log into a new phone bc he wouldn’t have his password on him because it would be saved on the old phone or in a passwords book at his home or on a PC or something. He’d have no way to contact me until he returned home, and from the looks of things, he might have needed to stay in California even longer anyway to help out with family. So perhaps he has no way to contact me until he returns home and can log into his Apple account or get on Discord. That’s the only possible explanation that could make sense. That, or he’s in the hospital. Let’s hope it’s not that. "

719,"2025 February 2: Dear Diary,

My car stopped on a hill driving back from work. The brakes in my car have been acting strange lately. It has been super cold and ice has been perpetually on my car. The emergency brakes seemed to engage while I was driving on a hill even though it should not have been.  

I couldn’t move my car even a little bit. I turned on my emergency lights, turned my car off, and called my dad. When he came we switched cars. Miraculously he was able to drive my car all the way home while I drove his car. We both think it is the freezing cold that stopped the car. I’m taking my car to a mechanic tomorrow. 

I wish America was not so car centric. If the public transportation was easier for me to navigate, I would definitely take that. I remember when I was in Europe how impressed I was by the trains, and I kind of wish we had that here.  

Sincerely,  

Torinico"
720,"I havnt smoked weed in a week now. My quality of sleep has greatly improved. I’m actually dreaming again and remembering them. Some of my dreams are scary and fucked, but others are nice. I’ve been cutting back on the nicotine vape as well. I really hate the way it makes me feel. I want to be done with it. Today I havnt hit it at all. I am trying to commit to quitting today. Feels like a good day for it idk. Def not easy tho. Feels harder than weed to quit for some reason. My mouth keeps salivating more than what feels normal, like the chemicals are pouring from my gums. This morning I woke up and ate breakfast then felt tired right after so I said wth if I’m tired go take a nap so I slept another couple hours. Then I felt like I needed to move so I jumped on the trampoline for 40 mins. I am so thankful for that trampoline. It’s the only thing I can convince myself to get moving on some days. About 1 am last night was the last time I hit the vape so I’ve got about 8 hours to go to make it 24 hours. I’m not sure when I’ll feel sleepy again as I napped earlier. Hopefully I can get some sleep again tonight. Feeling craving now which is why I am journaling here. Feels good to write down my thoughts in a place where someone may be witness to it potentially, rather than journaling privately. I appreciate the community here even if no one comments or reads it, cuz sometimes they do. I really think I can do this. Hard to say I believe I can or know I can cuz my track record clearly has been that I am addicted. But I havnt drank alcohol in ages and I’ve been feeling so much better without the weed. I think I have a bit of faith in my abilities given my successes there. It’s def a journey learning to hold myself accountable for shit. Started talk therapy and have had 2 sessions so far. It feels nice to have an objective source to speak my thoughts to without feeling like I’m a burden, or just echoing thoughts in my mind. I am praying this year I can begin to actually figure out who I am and what I want to do with my life. It’s been hard to say the least since both my parents died a year and a half ago… I feel like I’m only just beginning to crawl out of the hole I wanted to die in since they left. And it’s not like I havnt been doing work and growing this whole time either… but I feel like until I’m 100% sober I’m not going to understand any sort of true baseline in which to build a real and confident version of myself. So yeah, here’s to kicking the final crutch and finding out what life really feels like"
721,"I’ve been writing dated journal entries almost every day for a couple of years now. I just completed my third journal and I’m starting something new- a summary at the end of all of the dates. Here is my first one and I’ll be posting daily entries in the future

At the start of this journal, I was a couple months out of my relationship with Jack. I was finding myself, my passions, my routine, my calmness. I did not feel aligned with my work. I was interviewing for the position with Dr. Siddiqi. I wasn’t hearing back and was trying to keep the faith. I just started dating Michael and was having so much fun, that relationship really served its purpose and was a pivotal moment in my story. I was doing a lot of work to calm my nervous system and dive deeper into my spiritual journey. 
	I was told they selected someone else for the new job and dealt with a lot of confusion because my intuition was telling me that that was it. They ended up reaching back out, offering it to me, and matched my salary request. I started to really trust the universe and the path that I’m taken down. 
	My periods were irregular and painful, I found out I had ovarian cysts. But I felt really aligned in my new position at work. Me and Michael had a really mature break up, I was okay. Being aligned with my work, my salary, my routine, and my relationships I really started focusing on manifesting my luxurious reality and figuring out what that meant to me. 2-3 months after starting, an HR manager messaged me on a dating app and it made things start to get weird for me. But I still loved my work with Dr. Siddiqi and started planning my first trip to Nashville. 
	I was tempted with gossip and turbulence at work and really looked at myself, my values, and healed something in there. After visiting Nashville everything changed, I’ve never felt connected like that before and although it was hard, I weighed the pros and cons and then 1.5 weeks after coming back home I gave Dr. Siddiqi notice that I’m moving in April or May. Deciding to leave my position working with him was very difficult. I felt like I got everything I asked for and was leaving it, but there is no denying the pull towards Nashville and everything at work was not perfect. 
	But I started really focusing on my hopes and dreams and figuring out how to make it happen. I do feel like my willingness to do something scary in hopes of something greater is sending a message to the universe. 
	Five weeks after getting home from Nashville I moved into a winter rental to save money before I go, I was feeling really supported and lucky to have my friends. The move transition was extremely hard on both me and Tulip. I had an opportunity to learn a lesson about extending kindness even to people who seem “undeserving” with my downstairs neighbor. Jenn from work was a great source of inspiration with this and with helping me believe I can move to Nashville. 
	Once in the winter rental, I planned my second trip to Nashville with my mom. But during all this time I stopped my medication because of an insurance issue when I switched jobs and I got really really depressed. With support, I started my medicines again and the time in Nash really helped raise my spirits. 
	After that trip, continuing my meds, things really got good. Over a year after my break up with Jack and the first time I felt calm, happy, still, not worried about money, and excited for the future. I know myself much closer and have a great people in my life. My periods are becoming regular and my health has really improved. 
	My best best best friends and I are planning a big trip to Nashville (16 days) and I’m so excited to show them my home. Things blew up at work and I got fired. It seems like a very unfair situation and leaves me needing to figure out what to do for three months. I got serious about applying to jobs in Nashville, I’ve had some really great interviews and just need to get money saved up so that I can go. The situation helped me look at how I react to things and just get really emotionally honest with myself. I truly think it was a huge learning moment for me. 
	After all I’ve been through, I finally accepted that the universe will bring me down her path, no matter my attachments or my plans. My ultimate goal here, and true key to happiness, is healing and serving. Everything can change at any second so I’m releasing my grip and leading with an intention to make a positive impact wherever I go. I’m thankful for learning and ready to see what happens next.

I fell behind again so 2 entries today. Ok first of all woke up late chilled around the house eventually I started drawing and I streamed said drawing on Twitch. Idk what possessed me to do this but I did. And it was a shity stream but yeh. Then I did some maths as well and yeh that's my day "
724,"I am unsettled today, no surprise.   
An overflowing fountain of rage, disappointment, melancholy and disarray.   
Self isolation.   
Progression today is in cessation.   
So, I’m just waiting for the hour that teeters on the edge of socially acceptable to start drinking so I can feel   


Feel everything even more intensely and maybe intensify pressure and then I’ll explode    into a million tiny little fiery pieces of an over inflated ego mixed with victim mentality and self-flagellation "
725,"There was a time when I like to journal and write my thoughts down because it made me a deeper person. But now, after I've gone through some painful experiences in life, I avoid opening the genie in the bottle because I've locked all my feeling inside. 

Today I went to the gym after almost a month of being passive. It felt good. I felt more like myself. I could still tolerate the heat of the sauna, even if it's been about a year since my last time."
726,"(Que the pessimistic thoughts)

Is it too late to have seasonal depression? 
My mam doesn’t believe in depression, if I were to mention anything about mental health she’d scoff at me and say “go live in Palestine and then tell me your depressed” that I cannot argue with, real talk. I feel like a snowflake when I speak on how I feel, not a dull one a pretty sparkly one, of course. Nonetheless. One blow and I’m gone, into the oblivion. Never to be seen again. Above sensitive, stupidity seems to be my leading quality. I take no offence when someone calls me dumb, Ooh facts. It’s more offensive when they say “don’t call yourself that!” Stop manipulating me I’m not that dumb. Anyways to get down to the groggy depths of my depression, kindness is a dying breed. It’s not kool to have a heart anymore. The one thing I want I can’t have, happiness. Too many thief’s of joy. Light snatchers. Sunblockers. I feel like flaring my arms and feet about in the air like one of those bloons with the wobbling arms iykyk. Money does not impress me, status doesn’t make me like a person, looks fade, the most important thing above anything is to have a good heart. Don’t get me wrong everyone has a good heart to some extent, at least until the novelty of it wears off… it’s easier to just not care, unfortunately I cannot do that nor do I care to accompany someone who doesn’t care. Yes the old English is out, this is getting serious. Idk what I’m even saying anymore just rambling, the struggle is real ironic because there’s no real struggle it’s just a make believe struggle I made up in my head. None of it actually exists just thinking thoughts, this shall pass too? 
"
727,"I ended up staying up late again yesterday, just scrolling through my phone. I mean, I had to drop by my grandma’s place early this morning and later travel quite a bit to meet an old army buddy for a long-distance run. I think I got about three hours of sleep. Exhausting, but tasks still needed to be done.

On the way to my grandma's, I realized I was in a vicious cycle. I found myself escaping into my phone to ease the guilt and anxiety of not spending my day properly. And when another day passes unproductively, I drown in more guilt and end up mindlessly killing time with my phone again. Honestly, I just wanted to give up because it was all too tiring, but I could see the looming end if I did. I'd be reverting to old ways, and there's no way I want that.

I heard that yesterday my grandpa fell and was taken to the ER after a coughing fit. I only found out after writing my diary entry last night. He regained consciousness and was safely back home, but both Dad and I were worried, so we went to see him. To my surprise, he seemed better than I thought he would. After taking all his cold meds and some herbal remedies, he appeared to have regained a bit of energy.

It made me think that Dad should start exercising now to prevent such things in the future. I know he's exhausted after his tough job and feels weird guilt for not being as successful as some of his peers. But still, that's no excuse. It might work for me, but the world won't buy it. As a son, I keep pushing him to exercise as much as he can manage, but I worry if he'll ever reach a level that can truly ward off future problems.

After showing my face to Grandpa, I went to meet my old buddy. He was an American friend, and after chatting via Instagram DMs last week, he admitted he was getting lazy. So, I proposed a 10-mile run together. At about 16 km, it was quite a challenging suggestion for someone with no long-distance running experience. Honestly, it takes about two and a half hours by subway one way, and besides reading an e-book along the way, there wasn't much productive use of time, which made me hesitate. But I went. Partly because I didn't want to break the promise, but also because the more reluctant I felt, the more I needed to go. Otherwise, I'd quickly fall back into my old patterns.

As I was in running gear and had no bag, all I had was my phone. Not wanting to waste all five hours of travel, I downloaded ""The Hard Thing About Hard Things,"" a book recommended by Elon Musk’s AI, to read as an e-book. Of the total five-hour travel, I spent about four hours reading and managed to get through a third of the book. It’s an autobiography and was relatively easy to read, but still, reading a third of a 400-page book in that time showed me that my newly learned reading technique was quite effective.

Anyway, I arrived at the meeting spot as I was reading. While running, we chatted about what keeps him going and what stops him from doing dumb things. During the conversation, he was self-critical about being lazy, but honestly, just completing U.S. Army training and serving without issues showed a level of endurance that I thought was better than mine. He told me he got frostbite on two-fifths of his right foot during training and it hurt with every step while marching. I didn't believe someone who went through that would slack off just because he couldn't handle tough things. It seemed more like he was in a state, like I sometimes am, overwhelmed by so many tasks and not sure how to prioritize them.

While discussing this, I admitted I do my fair share of rough stuff but nowhere near his level. I suggested focusing on exercise if he couldn't decide on anything else to tackle. He seemed to agree. After our 16 km run, I hopped back on the subway.

On the way back, reading the book again, I had a sudden realization. I still didn't concretely know what my ultimate goal was or what it looked like. But seeing it discussed in the book and seeing my friend grappling with the same thing while running, it painted a clearer picture of what I wanted. It felt like I was hitting a runner's high midway through a marathon. A sense of pleasure coursed through me from head to toe.

As soon as I got home, I showered, had dinner, and organized my ideas. I ran them by the Jordan Peterson AI to ensure I wasn’t nursing any wrong thoughts. I won't share what was discussed, but I'll just say today felt like a day worth enduring to the end."
728,"without a doubt, i don’t know how to feel, or more like how i should feel. i feel like i’ve been in this place before, as in i feel like i’ve been in a situation like this before.

it was during their midst of a hot-spring in april, you had torn me from the inside out while basically playing with my feelings on purpose, you didn’t even really have a reason for what you did, you just did it- decided to let things be normal a month later, letting me be the happiest person on earth for another 5 months. but that was of course- before you had decided to absolutely smother me until i was absolutely nothing, i mean nothing at all. i’m just a hollowed husk now carrying the burden  inside me that you left me with, on purpose. and you didn’t even care.. you really didn’t. 

“it wasn’t on purpose” if it really wasn’t then you’d just admit your mistake and just fix things like we promised we’d do, or maybe you’d just follow with your heart instead of forcing such a tough-brute-nonchalant act that doesn’t even look good on you. I love you, and i always will and i hate that you won’t accept it, though you admitted that you still do too. i hate how when i had told you this heavy-felt news, you just sulked about yourself and said a simple “im sorry” as if it’ll reverse the fact you’ve ruined my life for good. and honestly, i don’t get how you think people online, who’ll never want to see how you are in reality- (whom you’ve gave your “best”friends info away to, who you pretend to be as for some sick reason)-  will stick with you throughout in this, and i really hope you see this, because god knows some random from europe won’t save you from your new responsibility.

729,"The song - miracle? By kristoff krane 
Brings me deep tears every single time. All the way to end the tears pour out harder.

It’s a good reminder to look at the bigger picture in life. To open your eyes wide enough to look at things from another’s perspective.

Every day I am learning. Today I’m starting to recognize maybe friends, isn’t in his and I’s deck of cards either. It’s either half assed or only one sided. I see that more clearly now. Just co workers for the next few months, is all that he wants and all that it will be. I don’t even know if I have a few months left in me to stay here. 

I’ve completely surrendered to this chapter. It has won. I have lost. Time to start a new one. Instead of letting the wound from this one continue to hurt me. 

I took the risk. Even the risk at attempting friendship after, more than once. There’s nothing more I can do here. This chapter has closed itself. 

Now I have to take the next risk, figuring out where I will start my next one. 

Life is hard. But I am tough. 
Everything just is, what it is. "

Well not really nothing because I did sign myself up for a gym membership which is super noice and I'm enjoying myself improving but at the same time I'm also messing up my diet a lot and keep doing bad habits.
Ik bad habits die hard.... 
Dude is it so hard to stay positive writing these just makes me realize more how I am at this life stuff, NO NEGATIVE TALK!

Alright the plan these next couple of weeks is to work on getting drivers license because goddamn is my gym a good walk from my place and also finally deal with college shit and just pick what college I wanna do cuz idk, here's the thing I wanna get a career is 3d animation or something in the art's which I know is unrealistic but I want to at least try to do something I think I'll love first then not trying at all. The problem is I have no idea anything about 3d animation besides what I learned in my animation class in highschool. I remember pretty clearly a lot of what I learned since it was my first semester of my senior year so I plan to reteach myself the stuff I learn on blender because I'm broke af and can't afford 3ds max.


So yuh there's that but I'm still determined, hope is probably my biggest strength because I'm constantly hoping I can tap in and get stuff done. Ik there's something wrong with me but fuck off I'm trying my hardest, ugh my brain starting to hurt anyway today was an 5/10 not the best but not the worst "
732,"2025 February 1: Dear Diary,

Petra went back to college today. Before she left my mom and I went to get breakfast with her. It was in this cafe-like place, but I got pancakes with shredded chocolate on top. Thankfully I was able to read my book on the way over to the cafe and on the way back. 

Today I realized I love working on the weekends because my friends usually work on the weekends. My friends Jessica and Vanessa were at the registers today so we were able to talk the whole day. I love being social instead of being online all the time. Sometimes it is necessary to be alone though, especially when I need to read and write. 

I have the most fun when I am actually able to grow a spine and talk with my friends though. Part of the reason I don’t talk with my friends often is because I have a big ego. I think I’m going to screw up talking in some way and they might turn on me. I know this is just a delusion however. 

Currently I am working on myself to lower my ego and heal my abandonment issues. It’s just something that comes with growing up autistic, but I am grateful that I’m aware enough that I need to improve for myself and no one else.  

Sincerely, 

Torinico"

734,"Pooping blood - night before 1st day of ski i threw up and was having diarrhoea, still went skiing coz it was fairly normal for travel sickness right? Wrong.

After 2nd day of ski I started to poop blood. Went to hospital and the doctor thought maybe it was haemorrhage, there was nothing of concern.

went skiing in the 3rd day pm because I thought it was nothing of concern. wife also tried to say i exaggerated my symptoms and I was partly persuaded.

then on 4th day I fainted on a plane and was brought to hospital. 1st day in hospital. When brought to hospital doctor did a gastroscope and said I had oesophagus bleeding and repaired it.

2nd day in hospital I had anaemia and received blood transfusion. Doctor said my poop blood looked old and bleeding seemed to have stopped.

3rd day of hospital now. pooped new blood, bright red, so nurse said blood could’ve came from large intestines. It felt that way too.

so bleeding has not stopped. I actually feel ok now after the blood transfusion yesterday. But worried as hell.

I can no longer bear the marital stress. It is literally killing me."
735,"Why should I even get out of bed? There is nothing to do if I get up. My brain feels like a hunk of dead wood. I feel lifeless. Half of my dreams are nightmares, but I’d still rather be asleep than awake. "
736,"I woke up around 8 AM and jumped straight into my personal project. I didn't get a clear answer yesterday from a junior who was supposed to gather feedback participants for me, so I did some additional QA. More importantly, I found out that the AI model I was using was more expensive than expected, so I decided to switch to a different one and made the necessary changes.

After finishing those changes, I reached out to my junior, but realized there's not much more I can do on my personal project for now, leaving me with a lot of free time. I thought about diving into financial statements and reading the Jungian psychology book I ordered online, which had just arrived. I figured I'd start both today. Big mistake. I should have focused on just one.

I began with the psychology book. Instead of just reading, I tried to summarize and get feedback as if I were receiving advice from a Jordan Peterson AI. I also thought about how I could apply what I’d just read. The book itself is quite thick, which was a bit daunting. But I noticed my reading speed was better than before, and I was able to organize my understanding relatively quickly, so that part was okay. However, maybe because I wasn't clear on today's goals and was getting tired, I fell asleep without even realizing it. For... three hours.

After waking up, I decided spending more time on the book wouldn’t be wise, so I moved on to the financial statements. To figure out which company's financials might be worthwhile to review, I ran an AI recommendation. It suggested comparing Tesla's and Ford's financials from 2010-2012 with those of Lucid Motors, a relatively new electric car company, from 2020-2022.

Here's where the problem arose. Yahoo Finance only had financials for the most recent five years, and to see earlier ones, I needed to go to SEC.gov. But the statements from there weren't the tables with footnotes I expected but lengthy reports. I had to summarize these reports into understandable tables based on what I'd learned so far.

To do this, I downloaded the financial statements and used ChatGPT to create comprehensible tables, checking any unclear parts against the long reports. Funny enough, every inconsistency I spotted matched exactly with the reports themselves. Since I had to upload files, I didn't trust it as much, using the older models like o1 or o1-mini instead of the new o3, but stuck with 4o in the end.

This took two hours. It shouldn't have taken so long, but looking back, trying to tackle two completely new things in one day while mentally exhausted probably led to this dilly-dallying. I finished preparing the financial statements but couldn't bring myself to review all nine years' worth at once... so, back to the psychology book it went... I can't let tomorrow end up like this..."

So many posts I come across on Reddit about people fearing they won’t find love. 

The sad truth about that, is social media. Everyone is so self absorbed. There’s always a “hotter”, someone they will come across and are so quickly to move on. Even if it’s for a brief satisfaction. Or out of comfort, they back to what they know. 

A lot of people are blind. A lot of people are naïve. A lot of people are afraid of commitment or change. A lot of people hide behind the screens that they hold. A lot of people have trust issues that won’t allow them to put their guards down. 

Don’t worry about finding love. Don’t worry about missing out. Learn to love yourself. What’s meant for you, will come to you. 

People spend so much time worrying, instead of focusing on living in the now, present moment. 

Don’t be afraid to make changes. Don’t be afraid to take the risk. Don’t be afraid to be rejected or hurt. That’s how you learn, that’s how you grow. 

Life really is a dance, you learn as you grow. Just keep learning. And keep going.

I’m very hurt and very heart broken still. 
But, I have to keep going. Everyone does. 

Even if we don’t get what our heart wants, someday we will discover what our heart needs. That’s why we need to make changes we are afraid to make. We have to say goodbyes, that we don’t want to say. 

The longer you live in delusions and can’t accept the reality, the longer you will miss out on what’s meant for you. "

 Inadequacy?

741,"2025 January 31: Dear Diary,

Work was uneventful today. At least that’s what I would have said if it wasn’t for the last hour. I was at my cash register, but absolutely no customers were in the store. I closed my eyes for a few seconds to meditate, then I opened them to make sure it did not look like I was sleeping on the job. One of my coworkers was behind me at his register.

“Do you like to meditate?” I asked him with my thumb and index finger in a circle.

“Oh, I used to, but not anymore,” He replied.

“I love to meditate.”

“Really? That’s great for your mental health.”

“I used to listen to Buddhist chants in Sanskrit all the time, but recently I listen to music in different frequencies. I do that every night before bed though.”

“I pray in Sanskrit every morning.”

“Do you speak Sanskrit?”

“I don’t remember a lot of it, but some words. I studied it in high school in India.”

That really intrigued me. “Sanskrit sounds like a very fascinating language to learn.”

“You're interested in Buddhism. That started in India. Well, Nepal, but at the time Nepal was in India. There was a king named Ashoka who asked to send in monks because he didn’t want any more violence after the last war that took place.”

“I’m very fascinated by Indian history. It’s a shame it’s not taught in schools here. I was only taught about American history and some European history. Just the French Revolution and the World Wars though. I love history in the Asian countries though.”

“In Indian history classes we used to be taught to hate English people.”

“That makes sense,” I laughed.

“But people today are so stupid,” He responded. “Today English is a language used to impress people. I don’t think it is right to hate English people. It’s just that so many people don’t want to know how the English language came to India so they remain ignorant.”

I thought that was something insightful. It’s absolutely tragic how British colonialism eliminated cultural aspects in India. Although it started out insightful, the conversation would take a turn.

“I’ll say this one more thing,” He said. “Because I am in the highest caste lots of people in lower castes hate me for no reason. Even when I try to make friends with them they say one thing and do another. People in lower castes even get into medical school even though they are not qualified. They get more opportunities.”

I didn’t know how to respond. I nodded along and said nothing. It was apparent he was casteist. I just didn’t realize casteist talking points sounded identical to racist talking points about DEI in America.

“When people find out my last name they hate me,” He continued. “You can tell a caste by someone’s last name. Take “Patel”, for example. That’s a lower caste name, but not the lowest.”

“So they aren’t untouchables?” I asked.

“No they aren’t the lowest. But you can look up online there is a lot of crime with the Patels. Anyway since people of lower castes don’t actually want to be my friend, I have decided I should just stick with my own caste. I cannot trust people in America though. Everyone is after money.”

“Yeah that’s the system,” I laughed nervously. “People chasing the almighty dollar.”

“I can’t even trust my wife. I believe she was bought off. She is spying on me and doesn’t love me.”

“So she’s after your money?” I humoured him.

“It must be.”

“Who bought her off?” I asked.

“I can’t say that, that would be like going to the police. I will just say it was another woman. I think my son was bought off too, but indirectly.”

After saying that he had to leave and soon later so did I. The store closed and I made sure to get home as soon as I could. If I didn’t experience this myself, I might not have believed it. Maybe I would have though, I’m slightly gullible.

Sincerely,

Torinico"
742,"I carry so much silent self hatred it scares me.   

It hurts, a lot. My heart is broken, it’s been this way since I can remember. There has always been *something* wrong.  
There is something deeply wrong.  
But they can never see, I won’t let them. They have no worries about me.   
She can handle *anything*   
She is *so* strong.    

People come to me for advice, they seek me out to listen. They rely on me, they want to hear what I have to say they like that I can bring a perspective to a difficult situation. I can make them laugh and feel better for maybe even just a little bit and fuck I love that, it makes me feel good that the people that know me trust and appreciate me enough to share themselves with me.   
But when I think about how many of them I truly trust, deep down, enough to show them my true self? Not a single one of them. Not one person in my life. Something stops me- honestly, it forces me to hide myself behind masks.    
No one can know ME. They have no idea how I struggle, how I really feel inside. They don’t know how often I desperately need to find an out. They have NO CLUE how often I am just fucking everything up.   
They like the happy girl, the funny girl. They need the wise, patient, kind and caring girl. They would not like this uncovered, uncensored girl. It’s not pleasant it’s not nice. It’s ugly with rough, sharp edges. It’s shadow and gloom.    
It’s an inconvenience, when the (apparently) strong is not the person you thought she was. I know this.   


The few people I’ve felt comfortable with sharing this side of me have made this clear.   
Suddenly I’m saying the wrong things, I’m making them uncomfortable. I’m self centered and off. The fun is gone. The entertainment has lost its spark.   
They don’t want to hear about it, it’s seeking attention and it’s victimizing myself. A master manipulator.   
They become disillusioned and they leave. And as much as it kills me, I can never place blame on them. It’s always a MISTAKE to let someone *in* like that. Girl, you need to keep it hidden. They don’t want to know.    


So, off to therapy I go, uncomfortable and confused. Unable to open up. It’s new still, getting to “know” each other. Here I have the one person I actually PAY to listen to my unending bullshit, and I am just terrified to say the things I need to say.   
I am petrified to expose how I really feel. 
Afraid to make the wrong move, say the wrong thing, be judged for being an imposter of a real person.   


I’m not real, none of this is real.   


I’m scared. There is no cure for this, these feelings won’t ever just simply go away. It’s gonna take effort I must pour into MYSELF to MANAGE with therapy, medication and treatment.    


I feel so very alone, but I am aware that I’m not. I’ve got lots of friends, many people who love me. I’m exhausted, so very tired and I am having such a hard time ignoring the little (big) voice that tells me to lay down, give up, it wont change anyway.    
I won’t do it, (in case you’ve read this far) I CAN’T. Still, I am so fucking TIRED of battling with MYSELF every single day. If only there was a way OUT without a way THROUGH, I just need to find a solution. I want to find happiness, I want to be able to accept myself for who I am. I want to find my person, the real one. The one that will love me even when things are hard. I will never be able to do that if I keep on this same path.

743,"Even though I didn't actually work long hours today, it felt like a long day with a high energy level. As I mentioned yesterday, I woke up at 4 AM to grill some leftover meat from dinner. Since it was expensive meat, I asked ChatGPT how to grill it to taste the best and got ready to cook. While exercising, I decided not to wear headphones, so I enjoyed my time while grilling. I listened to a 40-second workout short repeatedly on my headphones as I grilled for about 20 minutes. Even while eating, I kept listening.  
  
By around 4:50 AM, I finished eating, cleaned up, and got ready to head out. I usually grab Celsius (an energy drink) from outside when heading out, but this time, like the last time I didn't wear headphones, I decided to cut down on caffeine and brought only 2 cans instead of the usual 3. As usual, I caught the first subway train and studied financial statements today on the subway. Elon Musk's AI suggested it's better to do mentally demanding tasks like studying financial statements in the morning, and lighter books in the evening, so I finished the remaining financial statement book. I've got to plan how to study next in more detail tomorrow.  
  
I arrived at the gym, and it was chest day. The issue was that my performance significantly dropped. My top set on incline bench press used to be 12 reps at 65kg, but today I only managed 7 reps at 70kg. While that's not bad according to usual calculations, something felt off. The first set of the double drop from 60kg-40kg-20kg decreased from 16 reps to 13 reps. I couldn't figure out why while working out. Was it because I didn't wear headphones? Because I cut caffeine by 100mg? Even though I ate breakfast and didn't lack energy, my sleep was slightly less than 6 hours, but that was similar to before, so it's not unusual. It didn't seem like a mental issue since, for the upper body except for the shoulders, it's usually the body that gives up before the mind.  
  
I did my best for almost every set, which is why chest workouts aren't fun. Unlike legs, where you mentally give up first, the body stops cooperating first here. Even if it feels like you can't go anymore with legs, you can generally push further, but it's not the same with the upper body. Amid the confusion from not figuring out the cause, someone in front of me said, ""He's really doing it blindly,"" during my next double drop set. I felt annoyed but continued anyway. Luckily, I managed to at least maintain my last record for the second drop set. After the set finished, I looked at where the comment came from. It was something I could ignore. The person clearly looked like a beginner, ironically doing back exercises while receiving personal training. Despite feeling annoyed, I acknowledged that beginners can make such comments and did another additional one-drop set at 50kg-30kg. Since my records dropped, I thought I should at least increase the volume to compensate.  
  
I continued with the rest of my routine. I moved on to flat bench and machine dips afterward. Running on the treadmill for 20 minutes was a killer workout compared to stepmill. Running without headphones made it so hard to breathe, I didn't have a mental break like I do on the stepmill. But after finishing 20 minutes, I noticed my record increased by 0.1km from before.  
  
After working out, I took a quick shower and walked to the office. Today, everyone, including the members who went overseas with the boss, was gathering at the office. I arrived at 10 AM, earlier than others, and had some time until 1 PM when everyone would gather. I moved forward with QA since I theoretically finished my personal project yesterday. This was the first hurdle of the day.  
  
After adding the time block feature, an unexpected error occurred: the response format to the AI wasn't correct. My typical solution as an intern for these issues was formatting everything I input into JSON safe format, but even after doing that, the same error persisted. So, thinking maybe it was a command issue rather than a content issue, I checked it in a JSON validator and found one error, which I quickly fixed. But the same error appeared again. The JSON validator indicated no errors in the command line. So what was the issue?  
  
Trying to solve the repeated error with suggestions from ChatGPT was frustrating. With no progress and stuck in the same part for an hour and a half, I planned to have lunch around 12:30, but my head was throbbing, so I grabbed lunch at 11:30. In just 20 minutes, I finished lunch, went back, and thought again.  
  
While reviewing ChatGPT conversation logs, I discovered something new. I thought a newline in JSON input only needed \\n, but there were more rules. For instance, if you need to use "" in a string, you represent it as \\"". Then it hit me! I found and deleted "" within the strings in the commands and tested again, but the same error surfaced. Rechecking if it was a command issue rather than an input format one, I finally realized: when sending text as JSON safe, the text data is treated as a string inside """", and the whole input variable itself is also surrounded by """". In short, it was an issue of a string contained within a string causing the error. After fixing that part, it worked normally.  
  
After a sigh of relief, I created a time block, but a new issue emerged where input values weren't properly being applied to the time block. As it was made in HTML elements, I pondered on solutions and resorted to having Claude draft the code to my specifications. Despite copying and pasting it, the issue persisted. Returning to ChatGPT, despite identical codes, they recommended inserting dynamically into the HTML element. I facepalmed at how this simple oversight complicated things. After correcting that part, thankfully, the chat-time block worked correctly. Rechecking the time, it was five minutes to 1 PM. Dropping a quick note to my junior, I pivoted immediately to my intern work starting at 1 PM.  
  
Even the intern work was heavy today. I was tasked with creating a new coupon system that needed to apply to every product made so far, and it even had to apply discounts! If only it were free of charge! Although creating a coupon wasn't a big deal, applying the discount rate to each product separately through backend setups was labor-intensive.  
  
On top of that, there was a new product I hadn't seen before. The built-in discount coupon system hadn’t gone through QA yet, so I wasn't even sure if that worked correctly. To put it simply, I had to create a backend for discount-applied coupons that never existed before and couldn’t merely duplicate one but had to tailor it for different situations across four products.  
  
Honestly, I thought there was no way I'd finish this today. The tricky part about enhancing what's already there is how much more mentally taxing it is than creating something new. Our startup's documentation wasn't well organized, and I was practically doing everything from memory. Adding analyzing a new product to customize the backend to that list? Not a task you finish in just four hours.  
  
I started by applying QA to one of the main products’ coupon systems. If one person had made it or if there had been a genius planner at least, or if at least they properly named elements, this wouldn’t have been so troublesome. Being a startup, things were made on the fly, added quickly at a whim by different people, tangling up backend components. I was even puzzled about which element's custom state stored the discount rate, dealing with multiple custom states, and designer-added new windows for coupon lists named identically, remarkably confusing custom state functionalities.  
  
And! And! Amidst that chaos, they're developing something new as well! I nearly went crazy. After being snowed under for an hour jammed at the same spot, the boss caught something my distracted eyes missed, changing the course a bit. Once I completed a backend for one product, I moved on to copy-pasting it for the rest, keeping the backbone while adjusting the little details.  
  
It wasn’t as bad until hitting the new product wall. I sat there bogged down in the same spot. While double-checking that all custom states had been filled, why did the payment amount still show ₩0? Not that it would show that during actual payment, but it took some time to find out why. It turned out the designer had altered the payment window. To make matters worse, names were the same, and instead of erasing the old payment window, we were left with multiple windows making it double confusing. Nonetheless... Somehow, barely managing to grind through what was scheduled till Monday, I wrapped it all up in four hours. By 5 PM, I was prepping for the 5:30 PM meetup with my military junior when the boss invited me for a chat.  
  
In short, it was about my work plan for February—how I wanted to work—whether I wanted to mix in my personal project, how many hours I’d work, and how I'd prefer payment. It’s not always better to work longer. For instance, today was originally a task till Monday, yet wrapped it earlier surpassing expectations benefit the company too, suggesting compensation based more on work evaluation than simply minimum wage. Honestly, since any pay beyond minimum wage suffices for me, I let them do as they wished. It was my first time in this field, so I lacked financial sense, and trusting the boss to a degree, the payment I receive might serve as a future performance indicator. After exchanging more words, I left as the meeting time with my junior approached.  
  
I met up with my military junior. Much like the conversation with my high school friend the day before yesterday, I barraged him with questions. Majoring in computer science at a prestigious university, I asked for more specifics around areas the previous conversation lacked. Questions ranged from suitable heavy languages, AI fundamentals since he initially planned to major in AI, why he’d recommend against studying AI basics, what level someone like Sam Altman might be at etc. The conversation length and information overflow were too much to rely on memory, so I asked him to send crucial points over messenger. After an hour and a half-long Q&A grind, we talked about our current lives. He doesn't work out, despite my attempts to convince him otherwise. Aside from that, it was just light life updates.  
  
By the time I returned home, it was already night. Normally, I'd dive into studying financial statements, but with that done and coding books yet to arrive... I've finished writing my diary for now, so it's time for bed."
744,"Now I don't have anything like mood swings but sometimes when I'm tired or stressed out I can get pretty angry and negative and I'm starting to think that's the problem with right now, or idk maybe not ugh.

Anyway today I messed up my diet and my plans, I'm disappointed in myself but I haven't given up actually today I also did some thinking about why I've been so stressed out and mostly it's because I knew I had so much to learn and do. I wanna studying 3d animation but I literally have no idea how to but let's stop that at that right quick because my mom wants me hurry up and get my driver's license.

You see the problem here? Yeah both of those things take a lot of work and dedication to complete and my brain fogs up just trying to function on a regular basis, now how do I take this challenge of life and growing up head on? IDFK IM SO FUCKED anyway uhh fuck dude I don't know what to do time management is the only thing I can think of and I don't know how to do that ugh.

Alright beside all of that mess, tomorrow imma go back to the gym. Either I'm walking or getting a ride there idk but I'm excited, honestly before messing up my diet I was feeling really good besides the sore muscles 😄.

Anyway today was a 6/10"
745,"2025 January 30: Dear Diary,

For as long as I can remember I have rushed through my projects. My mind cannot comprehend a project being incomplete so I speedily work through what I am doing to finish it quickly. Ever since I was a child doing tests in school, I would always feel the need to not be last in completing them. Back then it felt like I would be beaten if I was the last one to complete a test. There was nothing to give me that impression; it was just irrationality.

The human mind is irrational though, and I am doing my best to separate myself from it. I know for a fact that if I take my time to complete what I need to do then good things will follow. It is hard to overcome my fear of being slow in life, but life is not a race.

In fact it is probably better to accomplish something later when maturity is reached. Achieving something with an immature and irrational state of mind could bring someone to base their value on their accomplishments. However, your value comes from within. Only you can decide how valuable you are, no one else can. You are worthy of greatness if you truly believe you are. My belief grows stronger and stronger.

Sincerely,

Torinico"

No seriously. 
What a waste of time, if you lose the person you love without even trying I don’t feel sorry for you as a matter of fact you kinda deserve it. Playing it cool is all fun and games until the person you actually like tires of the mixed signals/lack of communication and walks away. “I diD’nT sEe iT cOmiNg”

No.

747,It's a good day. Physics has been a bit of a drag but that's ok. English we watched a movie. The psychology I go 10/10 on a exam. It's only worth 10 percent but I was so happy. Then in Chem I also got 10/10. Any way I hit the gym in the Arvo and looked at the stars for a while.
748,"﻿I stayed up late looking at my phone again and woke up late. It was almost 1:30 in the afternoon. A wave of self-loathing hit me hard, but I quickly cooked some ramen for lunch and did some time-blocking. It hasn't even been a week since this happened again. I felt like I needed to find the root cause of this. It reminded me of the feeling I get before doing the main set while exercising, knowing I have to do it anyway but feeling overwhelmed with anxiety and fear. That feeling was similar to the project I had to work on, so I sought advice from a Jordan Peterson AI. It analyzed that my fear of working on the project might be related to staying up late watching my phone. It suggested that just as I do a light warm-up before exercising, I should find some easy tasks related to the project to start with and then move on to the main task. 

I remembered that I had to post a user interview on the community, which just required copying and pasting a previously written form. So, I did it immediately after receiving the advice. Funnily enough, doing that reduced my anxiety, and I could finally dive into the development work that I couldn't finish yesterday. I moved on to the development part I really didn't want to face. The UI and database setup were done, but two major issues remained. Setting AI workflows that could consistently output in a specific format and fine-tuning the AI to adhere to that format.

I had to decide on the format first to fine-tune the AI, but the biggest problem was that the number of task blocks a user could create each day was variable. Requiring users to always set four tasks a day would be nonsense. The structure was somewhat tricky in a no-code platform, compared to actual coding. Thus, the two major shortcomings of no-code became clear when needing repetitive tasks and random item selection.

If the tasks weren't intricately interwoven, I would have just handled it with some HTML elements code. But because it was a core part, treating it that way would force me to code the rest, which was unfeasible with my current skills. Instead of focusing on building this now, I created some tests to figure out how to automate repetitive tasks and experimented with different approaches. Initially, I set an ""only if"" constraint on every-time workflows, activating only when a target custom state wasn’t zero. I made two custom states: stage and target. By incrementing the stage state with each task and resetting the target state to zero when the two states matched, I thought it would keep repeating but that didn't work. Only one operation processed, and the workflow stopped.

Reflecting Bell’s structure, workflows needed an external trigger to repeat. I tried setting a custom workflow to trigger itself with a button press, but that was impossible. Instead, duplicating custom workflows with slight variations worked just until two cycles before the system detected the loop and stopped automatic repetition. Frustrated, I searched Google using the error message, and an online community suggested scheduling tasks to zero seconds ahead instead of triggers. Testing with skepticism, it worked! Finally! 

I spent an hour and a half hypothesizing and failing, but succeeding showered me with dopamine. Though the process was quickly summed up, tiny issues arose amid massive hypotheses needing time after each failure to ideate solutions. Normally, I would run AI, but yesterday Claude didn’t yield Bubble-friendly explanations. Shifting to other AI models meant explaining past material in detail, plus ChatGPT's misguiding attempts at including non-existent Bubble features suggested my ideas were faster. Even setting up Claude last night took an hour but aided other parts, so time wasn’t entirely wasted.

The morning's anxiety stemmed from uncertainty and AI acting weird, but I overcame it. Feeling good, it was easy to tailor the solution to my project in about 30 minutes after briefly outlining it on paper. Next, it was time to refine AI prompts, causing another headache. The AI’s extensive app functions couldn’t fit into a single button or API without complexity. Unchanged original functions meant the newly added function had to align in reply format meticulously.

This was my biggest weakness: consistent format adherence. Usually indifferent to AI’s erratic responses, I realized that app integration demanded consistent replies. Modifying API body taught me this hard lesson with its 4000-character capacity wall.

Starting over felt wasteful and daunting, so I read the API body slowly, modifying rules and adding complex reply formats plus examples, then QAed it. Success at once! However, more system sync tests were needed as my upcoming study cut tonight’s QA short.

With delicious dinner and financial statement study following Elon Musk AI’s advice to summarize learnings, I reached today’s diary end. Planning to fry leftover meat for breakfast tomorrow means an early start, so sleeping early is a must."
749,What’s the matter with it not coming naturally or having to make an effort to be that type of person. It beats being someone who people can think be rude or unapproachable. I will try. Even if it’s for naught I know I tried to stay. 
750,"What is happening to me…? I know consistency strengthens the bond. Am I screwed? I can’t stop thinking about you. I know I’m feeling a certain way but I don’t want to confirm.. no, i cant. Because I know I only feel this way because we hangout a lot… "
751,"2025 January 29: Dear Diary,

Reflecting on loss I realize that when I lose something I should not take it so hard. I believe that when I lose something the universe wants me to lose it so I can get something better. Most times I don’t actually want the better, but I learn to adapt to it and realize how foolish I was.

It’s a struggle to accept losing something. I get a lot of FOMO surrounding things that don’t even matter. My brain goes from wanting to experience something to becoming paranoid leading up to doing said thing. Inhibitions can kill your spirit.

Maturing takes a lot of effort, mostly in accepting loss. I think I am getting a lot better at it. The best thing I feel I can do is to detach from things and realize they don’t matter. 

Sincerely,

Torinico"
752,"I have been friends with this person with bpd for the past 3 years, and this past year has been really traumatizing for me especially because of my rejection sensitivity dysphoria, it made me do the impossible to get their affirmation which made it even more exhausting, they now have a new favorite person and it feels like I am getting a break with this, but this relationship is literally harming both of them and I still am pretty close with the bpd person, they just haven’t switched up on me in a while, but I feel like I just can’t take it anymore it’s like I can’t deal with the slightest things they do now,
And today they felt like they didn’t wanna talk to me the entire day (they don’t actually not want to talk to me, they just want me to keep asking them and begging them to talk to me until they feel better) 
And I just feel like I don’t have the energy for that anymore even tho this is the first time this happens since they had their new favorite person
I still pushed myself and tried talking to them but not in a begging way because I’m just starting to find this humiliating and annoying,
I was more calmer than usual today when this happened that my sister was confused (she switched up on both me and my sister)
And I honestly am not sure it therapy is starting to work for me or if I’m just suppressing my feelings even more because this therapist has just been making me feel like wow, my problems are not that serious, that is how I feel about every single problem I tell to that therapist to the point I thought about stopping multiple times
And rn yes I am so calm, but I just feel this compression feeling in my chest, and I teared up over other random things and I just feel like my feelings are begging to get out and I’m locking them in

Also I have been having a weird problem lately where I literally have peed myself multiple times this past week because I only realize I need to go to the bathroom incredibly late, and I either am fast enough to make it to the bathroom or I end up peeing myself a little which I laugh at this, but my sister pointed out today that this is kind of serious and when I told my friends about it and told them that I didn’t think I was stressed lately, they were like this could be built up stress you don’t have to actively be stressed to like be stressed Idk how to explain it

Also another thing that make me suspect that this situation is stressing me out and I don’t know it, is the fact that I wanted to eat like an hour ago and I completely lost appetite now (I mostly only lose appetite when I’m extremely stressed)"
753,"Past couple days I've have just been doing things at random and losing money, I gotta get my thoughts together to get through this stuf cuz I'm having heavy brain frog but yeah today was a 6/10 had a nice walk earlier and got some food but got bathroom problems on the way back home sadly 😔"
754,"
It’s crazy how I knew when the right time was to read, what I didn’t want to read from him months ago. 

I didn’t read it then because I wasn’t ready to accept the truth. That I don’t mean as much to him, as he does to me. 

I cried for months over him. And when I’m hurting, I’m mean and was mean to him. I hate being mean to the one that I love. Even though I can’t be with him, he doesn’t deserve to be treated like that. 

I fell in love for a reason. I love everything about him. Including every flaw because that makes him, him. And I love him. 

But it doesn’t matter. Because he doesn’t love me. 

It’s time to let go. It’s time to move on. 

I’m happy if he’s happy. Even if it’s not with me. Just like I’m happy he hasn’t had his sickness anymore. I’m happy to know he’s healthy and taking care of himself. 

Now I have to take care of myself. I don’t want to be depressed anymore. I don’t want to ache in pain for him anymore. I love myself and need to better myself. 

In a short time, I’m losing the ones I care about the most. I need to stop drowning and make myself stronger from it. Strong enough to close a book and start a new one. 

None of this is easy for me. I’m still crying on the inside. 

It’s in both of our best interests that I go. He was my sunshine. He helped me grow and gave me wings. He won’t have to worry about me anymore. And I have to leave so I can detach my soul from his and find where I really belong. 

Felt my heart sink to my stomach after typing that last part out. But I’ll be ok someday. But it’s time for me to let go. That’s the purest form of saying I love you, right?

755,"29/1/2025
Pretty average day nothing big happened it was incredibly hot for no good reason. I did some classes nothing to interesting there and yeh . Oh I had a headache in the afternoon so that happened "
756,"I woke up around 6:10. I slept for about five and a half hours. As soon as I woke up, I jumped straight into development. I worked on a time block UI, something I’d never made before. Honestly, I was quite worried since I had no idea how to approach it before I went to sleep last night. But when I focused on the fact that it was just an MVP and not perfect, just the 'minimum' functionality, I was able to handle it faster than I expected. Sure, it didn’t look great visually since there wasn’t any space between blocks according to time intervals, but I did manage to complete the development so that it met the minimum functionality requirements, like what each block is for, the timing, the criteria, and which block contents I might want to see. I'll need to fix up the design later, but that's something for after gathering enough feedback.  
  
I continued with the development until around 9, then packed a bag to head out for a family gathering and later, a workout followed by a dinner appointment. I went to see my uncle, who’s moving to New Zealand this Saturday and won’t be around for a while. After saying our goodbyes and before the rest of the family arrived, I took a quick nap, just like yesterday. I’ve felt so exhausted lately. This hasn't happened much in January. As soon as I rested my back on the sofa, I fell asleep. When I woke up, it was already 1 PM. Everyone had gathered, so we had lunch together and left around 2.  
  
As I was about to take the subway, I realized I’d left my headphones behind. I’d always listened to music or motivational shorts while working out, doing sets with headphones or earbuds. Typically, I would’ve picked up a cheap pair from a convenience store, but this time I saw it as a challenge. My reliance on caffeine is one bad habit, and this was another. Depending on external stimuli to push my limits only makes me more vulnerable when I can't use headphones, just like David Goggins says. You can't always rely on having your headphones available.  
  
I arrived at the gym near my dinner spot and started my leg workout at 3. Of all days, I had forgotten my headphones on leg day; just my luck. I kicked off with squats. This gym didn’t have a stepper either, so I just went for it without anything under my heels. Without heel support to elevate them, I felt the stretch in my ankles due to my lack of flexibility, affecting my range of motion. Surprisingly, I was able to secure a decent range, not quite full squats, but I could go lower than expected since my ankles didn’t feel as strained. So the problem seemed to be using plates instead of a stepper before. I had increased reps since the last time. I usually did top sets of 8 reps at 100kg when using a stepper; it dropped to 5 with plates, but I made it back to 9 reps today.  
  
The other 80-40-20 double drops also increased similarly. Like last time, although I didn’t write it down, I wanted to quit midway, maybe because of the lack of headphones. During the first 80kg in my final 80-40-20 double drop set, I seriously wanted to stop after just 7 reps. But I couldn’t give up just like that. I had done 12 reps last time, and I couldn’t quit without at least getting close to that. I kept going and managed to reach and exceed 14 reps, finally hitting 15 before losing balance and re-racking.  
  
The rest of the workout felt tougher than usual. More so before starting; I was terrified. Leg extensions at 103-68-40-26 triple drop sets? And hitting 18 reps at 103kg on my first triple drop before? No way. I hesitated longer than usual before starting. But I ended up breaking my records again. I’m not sure how, honestly. For lying leg curls, since the weights were in pounds rather than kilograms as in my usual gym, I had to calculate manually, and it felt a bit off. My performance significantly dropped this time... After finishing weights, it was time for the dreaded cardio.  
  
I hopped on the stepmill as usual. By 5 minutes in, my mind was screaming to quit. With nothing to distract me, no phone or music, it felt like torture. Every time the thought of stopping came, I pushed through, thinking about David Goggins. I kept repeating his quotes to myself. By the 7-minute mark, the temptation hit hard. I needed to go for 20 minutes, but could I really endure this pain? I wasn't sure if I could last till the 20-minute mark. But I just did it. The people around me were all with their headphones, uninterested in me, so I continued murmuring and focusing solely on those words. When I hit 15 minutes, I finally felt like I was almost there. I didn’t even recall how I’d held on till then. Just some cautious relief. Typically, I'd up the speed to the max and hold for a minute at 17 minutes, with the last two minutes posing great temptation to quit. Anyway, I persevered till the end. I held through maximum speed from 17 to 18 minutes and scaled down as the last 2 minutes cooled off smoothly.  
  
It was brutally tough but immensely gratifying. A sense of freedom overwhelmed me. I realized I could do an intense workout session like this, shedding the dependency on headphones and finding my way to become stronger. Amazingly, despite the increased volume, my legs didn’t ache after showering. I speculate that although post-weight cardio tears the muscles more, it fights off free radicals, lessening soreness. It could also be the endorphins from happiness. Either way, I felt exhilarated.  
  
Right after working out, I headed to the dinner appointment with an old high school friend. He just got discharged from the military last month and is now working in IT. This meetup was quite a fresh experience for me today. While walking to the meeting place, I remembered what Alex Hormozi, a recent entrepreneur I started watching, and also my internship representative stressed: the smartest person in the room asks the most questions. Plus, the Jordan Peterson AI advised to turn my conversations into questions. In our conversation today, about 75% of what I said must have been questions, I think.  
  
Honestly, it surprised me. I thought I knew this friend through and through, considering myself smarter secretly. But as I followed up question after question, there was so much I didn’t know. And there were many aspects of this friend I hadn’t realized. At least two out of the three hours we spent together involved me asking questions and learning, including my MVP feedback time. I might’ve looked dumb, but until today, I hardly understood things like object-oriented versus procedural or code being too heavy from a past coding meetup, as I questioned my friend, I learned a lot.  
  
Though understanding computer theories might matter later, it’s not something I plan to study. I still need to research which coding languages specifically to study, but I figured out I should focus on heavier ones. Throughout dinner, I bombarded questions relentlessly, extracting rich information and deeply realizing how much dumber I was than I thought. I had previously somewhat looked down on him but learned so much from him today; it struck just how many learning opportunities I’d missed. The Jordan Peterson AI had told me to find the moments when my interest wanes, losing focus, but today, everything was fascinating; there wasn’t a single moment where my concentration faltered.  
  
After dinner, at a café, I showed him the MVP I’d been working on so far. It was embarrassingly crude, but maybe I was getting used to it because I didn’t feel as embarrassed as when I got feedback from a club friend two days ago, or like when my cousin visited, not just leaving it but closely observed and provided immediate feedback. Although the feedback was too minute to organize here, there were many points to revise. One thing was clearer: relying solely on AI talk functionality wasn’t enough, as I thought yesterday. He bypassed post-questionnaire stages and moved straight to general feedback, and he seemed keen to try again only after I mentioned adding time block functions due to earlier feedback about functional insufficiency. Function addition seems vital.  
  
I wrapped up in 3 hours and headed home. Arriving around 9:30, I showered immediately and from 10 to 11:30, I worked on linking the UI created in the morning with AI. I had a rough idea of how to approach it, so I assumed it wouldn’t be too difficult—big mistake. Considering I’d spent a whole day generating AI responses yesterday, I originally meant to stop by 11, but I lost track of time, and it was already 11:30. Now that I’ve wrapped up my diary, I’ll spend some time reading a balance sheet book I originally planned to between 11 and 11:30, then sleep."
757,"iPad’s are awesome. In fact, if I had to make a list of the best products that Apple developed during Steve Jobs’ second tenure as CEO…the iPad would actually be pretty far down the list, but only because they went on such a strong run with Jobs. And lap desks—lap desks are awesome. They were awesome when they were developed during the postal crazes of the 18th century, and they’re awesome now that I can use this old one to situate my iPad on while I write in bed. These are the frivolous luxuries of capitalism that we all love and appreciate. I have no meaningful need for either device, save for my personal desire to have them for my own leisure. Yet here they are, making my life a little bit happier…idk, now that I say it like that…maybe I don’t need them. But I have them now, so I’m going to enjoy them!!! 

Anyway, back to the main topic of this post: What do I want to do with my life? The honest answer is that I have no idea. I’d like to have some white collar job that offers me a spot in the American upper-middle class, but it’s looking more and more like that train left the station years ago—when I was a zygote, stuck with the genes that would later determine my cognitive limitations. Always fun when your dream, no matter how hard you’re willing to work for it, is taken away from you before you even have a chance. Then again…I didn’t work very hard in college. Actually, I had teachers (and a therapist) who felt that I had the opposite problem: I was holding myself back through a poor work ethic, despite enjoying some kind of intellectual giftedness. Who the fuck knows who was right about that. Well, I do—I know I’m not smart—but let’s keep that between you and me 🤫 

I’d also like to be a writer, but I would be entering the field at the worst time imaginable. AI is more than good enough to do most writing jobs now, if not quite at a point where it can do them better than its human counterparts. But it will get there, in due time, and that’s going to make an already competitive market impossible to navigate. The best of the best of the best will still find jobs somewhere, either in a boutique market or as the editors overseeing the AI, but the broad middle class of professional writers will get killed off. I still might try to get into the field, though, just because I struggle to imagine myself doing anything else.

Well…that’s all for now. I’m sleepy and would like to get some rest.

759,I spray foamed around the crack in the brick under the vent in the side of my house where I think the mouse is getting in. Now it’s potentially trapped in my house. I havnt gotten any mouse traps yet… kinda just taking things one step at a time because everything seems to stress me out these days. I guess I’ll just wait and see if I hear scurrying in the ceiling tonight to find out if it’s still in the house. If it is I guess I can get a trap tomorrow and figure that out. There are plenty of exit spaces for it to come out of the drywall from the finished half of the basement to the unfinished other half where my workshop/laundry room has no drywall on the ceiling. I’m kinda just hoping it will realize it can’t get outside through its hole anymore and come into the house further into the open space outside the walls where I can catch it. Kinda sounds like a stretch of the imagination tho. Probably will have to get a trap. 
760,"I havnt smoked weed in in almost a week and im proud of myself for that. Im still using the nicotine vape tho… I want to quit that too. Maybe I can quit today. I already hate my existence, so what difference would it make if I am experiencing whatever withdrawal or cravings of nicotine as well? How much shittier can I feel? I went to bed at 4 this morning and woke still havnt gotten out of bed yet. It’s almost 2 pm. Wtf is the point of life. Also there is a fucking mouse in my ceiling and it’s driving me insane. I need to figure out where it’s getting inside and cover the hole. "
761,"2025 January 28: Dear Diary,

I delivered the letter to my old high school. It felt awkward entering the building. I am no longer enrolled and haven’t been for five years now so naturally I felt nervous upon entering. Thankfully I got over myself and entered anyway. It only took a few moments to hand the letter over to security so she could later deliver the letter to the teacher.  
  
My inhibitions kill me a lot of the time. I still need to contact an editor and send in the manuscript for my novella. Just today I wrote about the things to look over in my story. Contacting the editor is another thing. I already have one in mind. A friend, who I’ll call Mackenzie, suggested an editor to me. I’m following the editor’s Instagram account but haven’t sent a message yet.  
  
I don’t know if she is taking clients at the time, but I guess I need to message and find out. I’ve always felt these inhibitions which keep me from doing what I truly desire. I think that’s why I’m the only person I know who makes better decisions when drinking. My inhibitions keep me from doing things which would actually benefit me rather than lead to self-destruction.  
  
Reprogramming my mind to tell myself it’s alright to do what is good for me is not a simple task. I need to be persistent if I want to accomplish what I feel is necessary for the world. The fear of being perceived is one I need to get over fast.  
  
Sincerely,

762,"Maybe it'd be best if I typed it out instead of writing it out. I suppose I've never tried this method at all.
 
I am currently thinking about ___. I think about the relationship we've had these past few years. I think about the ins the outs, the discussions, the activities, all of it in its entirety.
I think about my satisfaction. The volume of warmth in my heart. I suppose I am coasting at half full.
I think about our most recent conversation regarding my identity.
I think about what is ""wrong"" and what is ""right"".
I have come to find that in the grandest of schemes, in the most universal of attitudes, that nothing is truly right or wrong. There is too much context, too much consideration, to abide by such a constricting rule. To consider what is right and what is wrong is to enact personal judgement. What is considered wrong, in reality, is what we deem to be inferior to our own practices. What we don't like is what we deem to be wrong. How could we enact that onto others that may not share the same practice nor values? The concept of right and wrong is merely a selfish desire to control and enact in what one believes to be the way of the world. I was not put on this earth to follow rules created by others, I am sent to thrive in who I am and what I care for. This is not right, this is who I am.
 
I ask myself: ""Now, judge yourself in your practice, what have you done that is right and what have you done that is wrong"".
Certainly I have never been either of those things. I am sure that I have caused grief; I am very sure of this. Though these moments of anguish, destruction, and malcontent were merely stepping stones to who I am now. If I cannot judge my own actions as right or wrong, then I cannot enact judgement onto others in that respect. I have only felt wronged by others, I have never been truly wronged. And for that I forgive everyone. I only know of what I consider to be an annoyance, deterrent, inferior, to myself. Truthfully, I have held little expectations to peons in my life.
 
I think about comedy, I think about what is funny to me. Belittling others in good fun at the expense of others. Ridiculing their practices, their features, their lifestyles. To me, all in good fun, as I am sure that I am ridiculed in some aspect. Regardless of these things, who cares? What is said is lost in the wind and time. I was not built to make friends, I was created to enjoy my life.
I think about insecurities, and notice that I have very little that are pertinent to my conscious experience. I do not care for what I do not have, I only care for what I can have and pray for my potential.
I consider that others may view this as judgement onto other, unfair to those I've mocked in the regard that they are unable to change, though many fail to realize that I have no expectation of those that I've belittled, for I care not for them. I have not even considered them to become better. They are what they are in that moment of time.
""Who cares?"" If I wanted them to be my friend, I surely would approach them differently. Those that I've belittled represent nothing but a speck of dust in the many encounters and relationships I've had with others.
I think about projection. I think about those who've disagreed with my actions. I've always fought for what I believed in, though I ask myself ""For why?"". To tickle the ego I suppose.
I think about the conversation with ____, thinking about my perspective of poking fun of others. So readily he had labeled my actions as judgmental. In the English dictionary, the definition of ""judgmental"" is noted as ""having or displaying an excessively critical point of view"". I am indeed a critic. A slave to my own opinion. I am indeed judgmental in the aspect of that word, though how I feel and my actions cannot be quantified by a word. I would say that I am: a little selfish prick, in the most endearing way.
 
And that is who I am. I see nothing wrong with this, and shall elaborate.
Suppose that I am conversating with others and poke fun of someone's ugliness. I do not care for how they change their ways to be beautiful, in fact that is most definitely not even considered. I am expressing how I view the other party in that moment. And so what if they took offence? I am ready for their retaliation, in fact I pray for it so I can say more. Quite frankly, how I've poked fun of others is merely a fraction of what I am pondering in the wet bag that is my brain.
What if this person ends their life? What if they are so burdened by their own flaws that my speaking ill of them causes intense grief? For one, I believe their end to themselves is in fact an act of courage. To change what they initially could not, permanently. That is their choice, their solution, and their own doing. And their grief? That is no one's responsibility but their own. I have considered this, the impact of my words, and I have worked hard to reshape my vocabulary. That is why I treat those I care for better than those I have no relationship with. Certainly I do not talk nor engage the same with a stranger as I would my own brother.
 
I have considered why I am the way I am, I have pondered my methods and logic, and to what end? To what end will I be satisfied in my journey to understand myself? I have come to terms and fully accept that my life is the journey to understanding myself.
I am a being of change, of discomfort, of happiness and its pursuit.
I have come to realize that we may believe that we are imperfect creatures, but we are in fact what we are in this moment. Who are we idealize what is ""perfect"". We've only bore witness to what satisfies our eyes. We've never seen anything universally perfect, so who are we to reference our own ideation of what is and believe that for the rest of humanity?
I am the most selfish person I know, as everything that I have done has benefited me in some way. Whether that is at the expense of others is, at this moment, no concern to me. It is hilarious. I care for others in the way I care for my plants. They exist as beautiful, living creatures, that decorate my life. And I care for them and that is all. I am happy, that I have treated others the way I want to be treated, as a reflection of my own internal anguish, confusion, and love. I find it funny that in my periods of self-hatred that I was ugly and hateful to others. I have discovered that I was pining for them to hate me too. Because that is what I wanted at that time.
 
The best part of all of this? It does not matter what I think, because that is unique to myself. None of what I've written actually matters.
 
I think about recklessness. I think about how I am perceived to be insensitive. And that is the path I chose to take on my own will. What of it? Tell me that I'm wrong, ask yourself if I care, then ask yourself if it felt good getting that off your chest? Unfortunately I do care. I care about how I'm being treated by someone that I've had close to my life. Because that was my choice. That is all."

First day of greade 12. And it was interesting me and my boys got our ties so that was fun on other notes on class we got a goodie bag courtesy of our gret homegroup teacher. Any way we pretty much spent the day doing our academic integrity course. Which was boring af because we did the same one last year. But hey at least I got to catch up with my mates. And we also had a debate about abortion well by weni mean 2 of my friends who I happened to be sitting in the middle of. And it got heated but I'd be lieing I said I didn't enjoy it a bit. Oh and I got some greads back 9/10 for physics and 16/20 for math. Btw is 16/20 good because my dad says it is but I don't think so. Any way I didn't do much at home after school so yeh that's my day. My last first day"
764,"!500 Miles !

Lately I realised how much I resented myself for so many things. I stopped enjoying things alone and stopped actually spending time with me. I always found a distraction to cope with the anxious and overwhelming to never be found. I always wished to be found at all the painful times that I went through. And in the way I forgot that I had to build my own life. Seeking validation from all of you. Trying to keep  you all happy was the thing I always found myself doing. I forgot the true purpose of my own life, what I like doing, what I am passionate about and how to keep myself happy. The plant inside me needed watering and I just wanted someone to be there and just tell me they believed in me. The validation and assurance I always seeked was all I wanted. Somehow I would feel important only if I heard that I was the same to you. When you were there, it was good. But when you all are not there I lost my mind. I had to do one thing that I hated the most, be with myself. I never realised how I started to resent my own self. How I thought it was not important for me to do something just for myself each and every day. I just became so anxious and overwhelmed when I didn't see the things coming from your way. I cried so much just to know that this time I am going to be alone. Maybe this is what I needed; Solitude. I call it loneliness but the better word for it is solitude. Always thinking that I am lonely made me feel weak in my core and helpless. Now I know this period is for Solitude. I need to find myself first before believing others will find me. 

I know that I have flaws. I hated my anxiety ,fear and the pain. But today I wish to befriend them. They are not always there to harm me. They are just a part of me and help me often which I always overlook. I don't hate them now. I just observe them and think about what my body and mind are trying to tell me. Also I keep reminding myself how this journey is not linear. I would need to exercise my mind daily to actually make this my mindset. I know my mind is very powerful and can fuel both the negative and the positive side. I used it always to fuel my doubts , fear and insecurities.  I am going to fuel the positive side from now on. I choose to accept me today for what I am , not for what I choose to believe. 

I am going to be there for me. And before I think  about a million ways to make it upto you guys, I would first want to work on me and then worry about you all. I know that this is what I will have to do. I need to know myself before trying to know what you all think about me.  

This journey is tough as I am trying to do this for the first time. But maybe the transformation I always wanted needs this. Maybe breaking every day is going to remodel me into becoming what I always wanted. 







"
765,"Woke up to the alarm at 6:20 after going to bed late last night. Managed to get in six hours of sleep and planned out my time blocks. Couldn't get Elon Musk’s time block system out of my mind since I looked it up before bed. So, spent 20 minutes creating my own version with Claude. Quickly planned everything, had breakfast within the next 20 minutes, and worked on my personal project until 8:20 before heading out to exercise.

Went to a nearby franchise gym, but unfortunately, it didn’t have the latest back workout machines I was used to. Had to stick to my old routine instead of trying the new back workout I planned. Though the machine row was small, I managed to beat all my previous records. But hit a snag with the machine wide pulldown. My top set of 96kg dropped drastically from 14 reps to 10. Thought it might be a mental block, so I rested for 5 seconds and tried again, but it wouldn’t budge. Feeling frustrated, I switched the remaining sets to a triple drop set instead of a double. Managed two sets of 89kg-68kg-47kg-33kg, strangely achieving more reps at 89kg than before (19 to 20, 12 to 15). Finished with cable seated rows and started running, but right hamstring was acting up, so I could only maintain a 13km pace for about 5 minutes. Made a mental note to use the foam roller more often at home.

Held a company meeting on my way back. Since the others had just returned from overseas yesterday, all I had to do was handle the customer service issues. Came home for a quick lunch with a baguette while continuing my project. Focused on tweaking AI responses from morning till noon. Switched from ChatGPT to Claude to solve the issue of repetitive question content and predictable answers, adjusting the prompts accordingly. Had to tweak it a few more times due to problems with regex differentiation and response consistency, but wrapped it up by around 3 PM. Remembered the CS work last minute and took care of it by 3:30, then headed to a family gathering.

Took a nap for about 2.5 hours before the whole family gathered at my mom’s side, then had dinner and went for a walk. Got home, showered, and jumped back into my project. Though the AI setup is done, I now want to add a progress notification feature, SMART criteria work division, and integrate Elon Musk-style time blocks. Got family plans tomorrow morning and a friend meetup in the evening, so the schedule's tight, but I’ll use every spare moment to finish everything by Thursday. Will focus on development, sticking to sleep hours, and if necessary, might even pull an all-nighter tomorrow."
766,"The way I am, as I told him, I can’t fully detach until I remove myself from his life, his family, this environment. I can’t ever be “just” friends with someone I am/was in love with. I close the entire chapter instead of reminding myself of what once was or once could have been. 

I’m not the type of person, I guess a “real” one, that he’s ever had in his life. I’m not into games or pointless flings. I’m all in or I’m gone. 

Once I’m detached, there’s no going back.

He’s not trying and I need to stop holding onto nothing that’s really there. No matter how bad I freaking want it to be something.

The universe gave me a ticket out. It’s also giving me other tickets to stay, in this city. But away from there. 

If I’m not there, I’m gone. I have my way out. And it’s so hard to accept while holding onto what’s already gone. 

I have to keep screaming to myself to let go. Damage is done. I’m sick of drowning in it. And I’m the only one drowning. I have to reach out to my only lifeguard. I’m lucky to even have one. He already replaced me, before I knew or thought, he wanted me replaced. And once he told me that I was replaced, he tells me that he understands if I need to leave. Wow. Typing that out just made me sick to my stomach and burst into tears. He told me to go. So why am I still here? I’m one pathetic fool. Or at least my heart is. This time, my heart was so sure and healthy with who it chose and still got it wrong. I have to go. I need to leave, where my heart is welcomed or loved back before it completely dies. 

It’s hard to kiss everything I have goodbye. But, everything I have is killing me and doesn’t even notice and keeps pushing me away.

I’m always helping and saving everyone. Now it’s time that I save myself. 

I always have been able to adapt to change. It’s just so hard to accept leaving, what I thought was my forever. 

My heart just needed to let one more rant out. "
767," Let me tell you about my moment of glory (or humiliation, depending on how you see it).

Yesterday, during my final exam, a faculty member stormed in for a surprise cheat inspection. No big deal, right? I was cool, calm, collected—until my eraser betrayed me. Turns out, it had a faded math formula scribbled on it from ages ago. Oops.

Cue the chaos:  
Supervisor: *“What’s this? A formula? Are you cheating?”*  
Me: *“Sir, it’s ancient. I swear, it’s irrelevant now—like me in this room.”*  
Him: *“Take off your shoes. Empty your pockets!”*  
Me: *“...Wait, what?”*

So there I stood, shoeless, pocketless, dignity-less, like a criminal on trial for a crime I didn’t commit. After thoroughly embarrassing me, the guy still yelled, *“If you do this again, I won’t let you off!”* As if I planned to moonlight as a professional eraser cheat artist.

Moral of the story? The world doesn’t care if you’re innocent—they only care about what they see. Lesson learned: toughen up, stay loyal to my honesty, and never trust an eraser with a past."
768,"I think I’m out of my spiral and thank you to those that tuned in. 

Friday was another busy day. More stress. I thought things got better. They got much worse before they got better. 

The week before last week was the best week I had in MONTHS. Last week was the worst week I had in months. I decided this weekend to just take everything off my plate, take the pressure off of myself and relax for a few days. It honestly felt so good. 

Whenever I relax too hard, my responsibilities drop off of my brain. I definitely made some mistakes around this, I felt like shit about it but only for a few minute. Because you know what? I told myself to learn from it, figure all your shit out before you turn off your brain next time. But turn it off sometimes. 

It was a good break and it’s 6:20AM right now, I hope to get my usual routine in which I lost in the last week. I lost it because I was spiralling but also because of stopping weed. 

I take a big break every year. My hope is that this is not a break and I never go back to my old habits. I’m tired of operating at 75% capacity when I’m naturally at 97%. Yes, that’s how good I have my shit together in a non-boastful way. Why should I short change myself? This time, I was actually exclusively using vapes for months. if you use them the way I did, you will kill your tolerance to a point that it barely even works anymore. Genuinely there were days where I’m like, this shit isn’t even getting me high, it’s just an extreme brain fog and disconnection from reality for no reason. Because facing reality seems harder. It turns out that it’s much easier for me to quit vapes. Last time, it was 3 weeks until i slept normally. I genuinely went insane. I’m so grateful that I’m able to sleep and by the end of the second day, it was so easy to keep pushing. Observing the fact that this is absolutely a mental test urges me to keep pushing forward. 

So yeah, life is, as expected, much better without weed. I know that but it’s still hard to stop. I’m so much more social with my loved ones, I’m already less anxious and depressed, my sleep feels better, I’m getting more done in the day, I’m mentally sharper, and feeling better about myself. 

The other thing is pregnancy. Soo, I got this extreme unprecedented pain in the last week. I was positive it meant something was happening. I’ve taking an early test, they’re not fully accurate, but it told me “no.” I really felt pregnant. Let’s keep waiting and see if my monthly friend comes to visit. Until then, I’m so focused on my physical and mental health and wellness. 

Take aways:
 - Loneliness is an opportunity to build mental resilience and self-reliance 
- A break will fix you 
- If you can change the way you think about something, you can change your life. Mindset is everything

I’m about to go into extreme mindset mode. 
Time to rock this bitch !!! "

Today I wrote a letter of gratitude to a teacher I had in high school. I have not delivered the letter yet, but I might tomorrow. The way my old teacher taught was so genuine;he had such a passion for the way he expressed his lessons. I had two classes with him: a history class and an ethics class. His classes were a catalyst for me to delve deeper into history and ethics.  
  
The way I started to think and write about my opinions stemmed from his classes. I never had another teacher like him so I felt compelled to express my appreciation. We haven’t talked in six years so I hope my letter finds him well. Teaching is an overlooked profession so I feel good teachers should be told how much they are appreciated.

772,"The new semester started. The work load is way more than any other semester so far. I don’t know how I’m going to manage this, work, and fixing my credit to finally get a house. I started pulling out my hair again. I know that’s bad but I get so ANGRY and the smallest things set me off. I want to quit my job because I know he will support me, he always reassures me so. But I just hate the idea of depending on him, I only make enough money for my own gas. And still I feel like we are going to be stuck where we are at forever. I started eating better though. Quit vaping and smoking cigarettes, only drink on the weekends. So that’s a good thing I guess. Don’t really know why I did that but I don’t feel like shit in that aspect. Still though. Sigh…"
773,"I’ve developed a crush on this guy at school but, of course, it will never be right and can’t happen.  Like an idiot, I got swept up last semester.  When the semester ended, not seeing him for a month or so made me realize how attached I’d become and how painful it was to separate.  I can’t waste the time and energy or feel this pain when I know there’s no future.  We have no classes together from this point on so I’ve been preparing my heart to never see or hear from him again.  When it comes to guys, though, I always think I’m over things and I never am.

When I sat in the hall where his class may or may not be, it was with plausible deniability: my class was nearby and I’m always early.  While I was ‘waiting for my class to start’, as though on cue, some other girls in the hallway started talking about him.  ‘Where is crush?  He should be coming soon, right?  Didn’t he say he was going to be early today?’ had my stupid heart racing.  He’s so perceptive and sensitive, he’d probably have noticed my pulse pounding or my heart beating out of my chest if he’d seen me.  ‘Oh, there he is!’ sent me almost into a panic.

On his part, I feel as though he’s been tentative about us running into each other on campus this semester.  Even other students have noticed he doesn’t seem to be around much lately.  Now, I could hear him coming down the hall, talking to someone.  He wasn’t talking loudly or with confidence.  He seemed wary.  I feel like he may have expected me to be nearby because this hall is where the lab classes are.  From where I was sitting, I know he would be able to see my bag and feet easily from a distance.  This bought us both time before we confronted each other.  Time I needed to calm myself.

He came over, smiling and playful and my stomach dropped.  It just never goes away.  Each and every time.  He made his way to class and I just sat there, stupid.  I don’t know what I am to him.  Am I a friend?  Am I like a daughter to him?  Am I like a favourite neighbourhood cat?  Maybe I’m nothing. "

775,"Like someone’s infiltrated and poked a hole into the bottom of the ship. There were holes before anyways; it didn’t stop water from leaking through but this time it’s different. This hole is filling up the ship slower than the others. Surely it should be easier to patch up? It’s different; this flow of water. It’s slow and tension heavy. It feels like there’s anticipation so at any moment the hole will expand and the pressure will maximise. Patching up the other holes is a timely effort for one person to do alone. 

But there’s no one on the ship anyways so wouldn’t it be better to just let it sink? Even if it was an expensive ship, one of a kind, if there’s nothing valuable on it and no lives to save, is it worth rescuing with its damage? 

And even if you wanted to fix the ship, how can you fix the abundance of holes left behind by infiltrators? The holes are shooting poison water indefinitely from everywhere. The vessel will capsize and fall. And it’ll go underwater enveloped by the sea and forgotten. And no one will rescue the vessel. And then it’ll disintegrate. 

The ship is sinking but there’s no one on board to fix it nor save it. So the agonisingly slow sinking of the ship is inevitable. In a place where so many more problematic holes exist, why does one, insignificant slow hole hurt the ship the most? 

This isn’t about ships.

776,"Yesterday, I overdid things and had a family gathering planned, plus it was my rest day from working out, so I didn't do much today. For the first time this year, I slept more than seven hours. As soon as I woke up, I got dressed and headed to the family gathering.

With all my cousins there, I took the opportunity to test my project. Unfortunately, I couldn't observe them using it, but I got some basic feedback like having limited options. I also asked a friend from my club to check it out, and she pointed out the same issue I was concerned about yesterday. It was the problem of the AI copying questions verbatim when generating reports. Yesterday, I shrugged it off due to time constraints, but it seemed like an immediate fix was necessary. In a rush, I contacted a junior I had discussions with about the MVP before and told him it might be done in two days, asking if he could gather some people to provide feedback. Thankfully, he responded positively.

After around 3:30 PM, I started testing the newly trending DeepSeek AI. I didn't expect much at first, but after reading some reviews, I got intrigued and compared it with Claude and ChatGPT, even trying out the Jordan Peterson AI version for a consultation. DeepSeek has frequent connection issues, and while its expression ability falls short of Claude, it's about on par with ChatGPT. Specifically, the imitation of certain personalities seems a bit lacking compared to ChatGPT o1-mini. However, if the cost claims are true, this could really shake things up. It supposedly offers 70-90% performance for just 1/100 of the existing cost? I might shift from ChatGPT to using DeepSeek for a while and see how things develop.

After wrapping up the AI experiments and feedback, I did some quick financial statement study. Time to sleep now. Tomorrow, I'll get back to my regular routine: wake up, work on my project, hit the gym, and return to my everyday life."

780,"2025 January 26: Dear Diary,

I was twenty minutes late coming into work today. Usually I leave my house thirty minutes before my shift starts, but I was stuck in traffic for fifty minutes. Realizing I was going to be late after twenty five minutes I called my boss. Two of my coworkers also called from their cars to say they were going to be late. The worst traffic I had to deal with was only twenty five minutes so it was surprising to me to be stuck for twice the time.  
  
Apparently some guy drove over the median and into a utility pole. Sadly he died from the accident. When I heard what was described to me I thought it was a suicide. My parents seem to think the guy had a heart attack which makes a little more sense.   
  
I hope the guy’s family is doing alright if he had one. It was not something I expected to see on my way to work, but I guess I shouldn’t expect anything. Randomly absurd things happen all the time and it’s just up to me to embrace the absurdity of life.

782,"Twenty-two days ago, just before the final week of the NFL regular season kicked off, I added [this](https://www.reddit.com/u/Emyncalenadan/s/ETXRS12hAj) (poorly written) post to the r/Diary subreddit talking about who I thought would be coming out of each conference in the NFL…well, and also how sad I am, but the NFL is what really matters here. I said that the Lions, despite being the top seed and flashiest team in the NFL, weren’t going to make it out of he NFC. I admitted that I’m an idiot and couldn’t explain why, but I knew that they had the same ✨vibes✨ as teams like the 98 Vikings and 2011 Packers—teams that dominated the regular season but seemed to have some kind of shallowness that came back to haunt them during the playoffs. Well, I was *right!!!* Detroit lost to the Commanders during the Divisional Round, their first (and, as it would turn out, literally only) playoff game this year. I‘ll admit that I hadn’t really expected them to lose that quickly, but hey, I never said *when* they’d lose, just that it would be before the Super Bowl 😊 With Detroit out of the playoffs, I said that the team most likely to come out of he NFC was the Eagles. I didn’t offer any reasoning other than that they were the 2 seed and have a talented roster, but hey, turns out that was enough, so…yeah. My pick for NFC was right. 

In the AFC, I said that the Chiefs had the best shot, just because they “seem[ed] to have that proverbial “black magic.” They got outplayed virtually every Sunday during the regular season but managed to win most of those games anyway. I just assumed that luck would continue throughout the playoffs, and I was right. 

I also added that their “insane luck”
> is augmented by league officials that give the Chiefs every benefit of the doubt—and hold their opponents to the harshest standards the rule book will let them 

well…if the reader watches the NFL, I’ll let them decide how much that played out during the playoffs. I will add that the Chiefs scored what wound up being game winning points off of terrible, highly questionable calls in both games, so that certainly lends some credence to that concern, eh? 

Anyway, I’m stupid, I’m sad, and…well, I don’t really feel like adding anything right now. "

784,"In the depths of solitude, where shadows consume,
I linger in silence, wrapped in a gloom.
A tempest swirls within my hollow chest,
A raging storm where my soul finds no rest.

They tiptoe on the brink of my fragile abyss,
As if navigating a field of thorns in a mist.
If only I could cloak myself in normalcy's guise,
Perhaps they'd not see the storm that in my heart lies.

""Sticks and stones,"" a hollow hymn they recite,
Yet words are the daggers that haunt my nights.
They weave through my spirit, like a river of despair,
Carving canyons of sorrow, leaving my soul bare.

In the quiet, I shatter like brittle autumn leaves,
A tapestry of dreams unraveled, my heart grieves.
Amongst the ruins, I search a starless sky,
For a beacon of hope, in the night’s endless sigh.

Your touch, a tempest that twists my fate,
Each caress a shadow, in solitude's gate.
Within your embrace, I am but a specter,
A whisper of despair, where my dreams fester.

In this labyrinth of shadows, I am but a ghost,
A wanderer in despair, a ship tempest-tossed.
Yet bound by chains of desolation’s embrace,
I seek a haven, a sliver of grace.

But maybe, just maybe, amidst the night,
In the dance of shadows, I'll find my light.
Embracing the darkness, each scar I trace,
I wander this realm, in search of my place."
785,"After writing my diary last night, I decided to get some feedback from Claude in the style of David Goggins. ChatGPT was too regulated to capture that raw edge and unique tone, but Claude, with its relaxed rules, was different. It was exactly what I needed, pointing out my shortcomings without unnecessary praise while still encouraging me to do more. We are all nothing, and we all lack something. Sure, some advice from seniors is spot on and I've learned from it, but that's not everything. No matter what happens, we have no choice but to toughen up. Instead of minimizing failure, I need to fail bigger and more often. After this feedback, I felt a stronger urge to read more financial statements, ending up with less than 5 hours of sleep.

I woke up before the alarm went off, and it felt like the day was testing me from the start. It was the most physically exhausting day in the past three months. My legs were weak from yesterday's run, and the soreness from a chest workout two days ago was peaking. I needed to do a shoulder workout, but my body was in a terrible state. Still, I got up. I stood there blankly for about 30 seconds to a minute because I was so out of it before I finally moved.

I got up at 6, quickly made breakfast, and showered. Maybe it was the lack of sleep, but my mind wasn't right, and I unnecessarily wasted time showering. I planned to wake my mom at 7 to go out together, so I prepped for development work until then. Normally, I'd waste that ambiguous time, but today was different. I started connecting Claude to the app. I had tried ChatGPT before, but this was my first time with Claude, so it was refreshing. I woke my mom at 7 and continued developing while she got ready.

We left at 7:30 and arrived at the gym around 8, but discovered it opened at 9 due to the Lunar New Year holiday. Bought coffee from the nearby cafe for my workout and spent the remaining hour reading. Once I shook off my anxiety, my reading speed definitely improved.

The workout was brutal as expected. During barbell shoulder presses, I exerted too much effort, nearly dropping the bar several times. Thankfully, the safety bar kept it secure. Even with such intensity, I didn't set a new personal record. I hit the target number of reps I'd aimed for in side lateral raises and increased the weight, ending with cable face pulls and a 20-minute run. Despite my legs being shot from yesterday's long-distance run and failing the shoulder press, I still ran. It was the right choice. I managed to run at a higher pace of 13 km/h instead of my usual 12 km/h even with my legs half-gone. Increasing my cadence definitely helped. Although my stomach lurched like it did during my previous 26 km run, I somehow steadied my breath and pushed through to the end.

After the workout, I went to meet my mentor. Although my anxiety was already resolved last night, my extreme personality made me want additional validation since we had already planned this meeting. Being with the person who initially got me started with real studying felt like coming full circle. We talked for an hour and a half, and my mentor seemed like a classy Korean version of all the famous people I admire. His perspective on life as an ongoing experiment and how it's natural for humans to be swayed by others’ opinions but to tie up those influences neatly was incredible. I always feel acknowledged not as ‘someone else’ but as ‘myself.’

Back home, just as I was about to dive into my personal project, an urgent development task came up from work. I was hesitant because I had promised Claude that I would complete my project, but I had to finish it today, so I completed it in an hour. It felt a bit off, like I turned into a Doraemon solving any problem handed to me, but at least I got things done, knowing my mental state was far from normal.

Later, I resumed my development work, looping a 20-second motivational video non-stop for 3 and a half hours during the process. Pulling a section that had plagued me for a week to near QA levels in just 3 and a half hours was surprising. However, as the evening came, my focus waned, and I stopped 10 minutes before dinner because my concentration was shot. It felt horribly frustrating. Many say you should fill 8 hours, but I was exhausted after only 4 and a half.

Finished dinner in 10 minutes and started QA, where the real nightmare began. With each new error that popped up, I wondered, “Will this ever end?” I felt like a loser and that this was holding me back. For about 5 minutes, I just stared at it blankly before persuading myself with “just once more,” working for another 2 and a half hours. Thanks to this, only the feedback feature remains, but since it's something new for me, studying is required. I ended up shifting from that task, studying financial statements, and started writing my diary.

While writing my diary, my mental state recovered. I hit limits and broke through constantly all day, but strangely enough, I’m not in a bad mood. Maybe this is what I was truly searching for. I always feel lacking compared to others, but just hitting continuously against it is okay. I can fail bigger. Now, it's time to get back to development work."
786,"Alright pretty productive day , I made my fisser account and activated my bank card!! I wanted to do more but my ADHD got the best of me but I still got tomorrow and oh yeah I applied to some places but still haven't gotten a interview yet but haven't given up , cuz this Lazer tag place looks promising!

I think I ate too much junk food today though my stomach kinda hurts my bad body, tomorrow I plan to look for college's and do some calling then finally get back to my hobbies in art and 3d animation modeling stuff.


I got a friend, a online friend and he's my best friend but I've been worried about him, we've been friends for years now and I can tell he's been a little more sad. I always wanted meet up with him and he only lives a few states aways from me and now that we're both adults I thinking about asking him to meet up, hell maybe it'll get me the boost to start working out.

Anyway today was a good day 8/10"
787,"I feel so alone. My family doesn’t care about me, they just care about what I can do for them. My mother tells me I’m selfish, inconsiderate and ignorant. All because I refuse to buy her groceries and order/pay for her takeout food and cook her meals for her anymore. She constantly complains to me that since she stopped living with my father and mooching food off her brother and mother that she is broke. She keeps trying to up my rent or kick me out so she can rent out the room for more money to someone she likes. When she’s not saying that she threatens me with rehoming my dog since I leave her at home for the couple hours I’m at work. My father is no better than my mother since he did kick me out by leaving a note on my dog’s food bag telling me I had to get out. I manage to find a place to live by moving in with my sister but was told I had no rights. Part of the agreement was that I pretty much couldn’t leave my room in a sense. She had her space her boyfriends space was the living room and my dog was to stay in the bedroom since her dog had the run of the house. I had to wait until after they ate, showered, or did laundry before I could do anything, even though they got off work 3 hours before me they always waited until after I got home to do those thing and they gave me a curfew of when to stop making any noise which was 2 hrs after I got there. Anyways back to my father when it came the day for me to get out something out of my control happened and he never asked me how I was or anything just asked for more money because I couldn’t move out on that day and he wouldn’t let me grab any of my stuff unless did. So let’s just say that was the last time I talked to him. Right now I’m just grappling with the thought process of my ex bf who essentially said “if he loved me he wouldn’t treat me the way he did” all because I called him out on his immaturity. Like how am I supposed to deal with the fact that someone said they felt doubt about their feeling for me based on their own habits and coping mechanisms that they admitted are who they are or how they always dealt with things. While also telling me about how felt the last time they were in love saying that when they are in love they should be jealous (whispering the word extremely), confessing they were never jealous even once with me. News flash you shouldn’t be jealous if the person you are with is honest, vulnerable and doesn’t play games. Only to go on to say how they should want to be around the person they love all the time. Which doesn’t make sense when they admit they isolate as a coping mechanism. I am baffled how they were in a long term relationship before me without learning anything along the lines of reliability, conflict resolution (actually taking accountability), time management, communication, healthier coping mechanisms, doubt/ conflict are normal or what his needs/wants are. It’s been almost a year since then and I’m still confused as to why my idea of what love is was so wrong. I thought jealousy and clingyness were bad which is why I wanted to address the deeper issue when I felt that that way since I didn’t like it. And as if that wasn’t bad enough when my mother found out he dumped me the only thing she asked me was “what did you do to him?” I’m sorry I told him when he hurt my feelings and held him accountable, set boundaries and wanted to find a compromise, things I thought you do in a relationship but what do I know since that was my first."
788,"I didn't end yesterday on a good note. I should have written my diary and gone straight to bed, but I ended up scrolling through my phone for almost 3 hours and went to bed late. As James Clear said, doing something once could be a mistake, but doing it twice is the start of a new habit. I need to avoid this tonight. So I've changed my plan to rest tomorrow and decided to take it easy today.

However, with a 10km running session with the fitness club scheduled for 2 PM, I couldn’t fully rest. I didn’t expect much, since most people don’t really get my workout style, and the fitness club isn't much different. But I still went out with just a banana, hoping one or two of the ten people there might be better than me, and I could learn something. This turned out to be the best decision I made in nearly a week.

We started off taking it slow, resting every 2.5km. I was slower than my usual pace, keeping up with the front 2 rows. Normally, I can run 10km without stopping, so I felt a bit restrained up to the 5km mark. At 5km, most people dropped off tired, and it was just me and two others left when suddenly one of them sped off like crazy. It was a 14-15km/h pace. I couldn't help but laugh. It was much faster than my usual pace of 11-12km/h, but I loved seeing someone push their limits right in front of me. Like a dog chasing a car, I panted and chased after him. It was the first time I ran over 1km at such a pace outside of intervals.

After running 2.5km at that pace and collapsing exhausted, I asked him what his secret was. He pointed out that my cadence (steps per minute) was too low. I'd heard that before but always dismissed it, thinking it would be too exhausting and never having a chance to test it out. But when I followed his advice for the next 2.5km, even with tremendous fatigue, my pace improved. It was truly surprising. I experienced the runner’s high fully, and it was the happiest moment in nearly a week.

After wrapping up with some chicken, I ran another 6km back to the station. Despite having already run 12.5km, including 5km at my fastest pace, I managed to run those 6km at around 12km/h, similar to when I started running. I messaged him to thank him and we planned to meet again next week. It's going to be extremely challenging and I’ll probably regret it while I'm running, but I'm excited for the progress I can make.

I didn’t get home until night. I'd only had a banana, a protein shake, and a few pieces of chicken all day, so I quickly settled for instant noodles and fruit for dinner. After a shower, I studied financial statements and now it's time to sleep early. There's exercise tomorrow too."
789,"Dear diary,

Just finished college a month ago. Came back to hometown. It's good to be back with family but I somehow also miss the college life.

The casual spontaneous activities in campus. The nonchalant conversations with mates. Always talking to people (\~5years) of your age. Probably, the most significant, do what you like to do, skip classes that aren't useful, do responsibilities that you enjoy to do and not forced on it.

Wow. That was nice indeed. "
790,"2025 January 25: Dear Diary,

About twenty minutes after midnight my cat died. His name was Louie. Just as I got done writing my last diary entry I walked to the kitchen. In the hallway I saw my mom with Louie. His paw was bent and his breathing was heavy. We learned he had a blood clot.  
  
The moment I saw him in the hallway I knew he was going to die. I wanted to be by his side in his final moments. I didn’t want him to feel alone and afraid as he was in pain. My mom and I took him to the vet. There was nothing that could be done. The best option was to have him euthanized so he wouldn’t be in pain anymore.  
  
The vet called him a “stoic boy” and that was true. He did not cry despite it being obvious he was in pain. I think he knew he was going to die. My mom and I were by his side in his final moments. He knew he was loved.   
  
I texted Alex to let them know. When we last met they mentioned Louie and how they missed him. I thought they should know. Alex let me know I could always talk to them if I needed. They are a great friend. I told them I appreciated them and they said the same.  
  
You should always tell your friends that you appreciate them. You never know when the last time you see them will be. I did not think my cat was going to die until I saw him. His name was Louie, he was a good stoic boy, and he will be missed.  
  
Sincerely,  
  
Torinico"
791,"2025 January 24: Dear Diary,

My attention span can be quite problematic. Whenever I read books sometimes my mind will just wander off and I’ll think of stuff that does not matter. Sometimes I’ll be thinking about discussions I had with other people and sometimes I’ll think about society.

I wish my attention span was more normal. I would love to be able to put my mind to something and only think about that one thing. It’s possible for me to hyperfocus on things, but it’s quite rare. Meditation might be able to help my focus get better.

Sincerely,

Torinico"
792,Are you alive??? Please let me know so I can quit searching. 
793,"Been 2 weeks still no therapy so just gonna try to rawdog this adult shit without destroying myself.
At this point I'm pretty used to having no friends, my terrible music taste will clutch up. So let's see what's going on 

Gotta open up physer account 

Gotta call bank because of dumb problem

Gotta search up colleges and idk maybe do some calling.

Gotta study for drivers license and hopefully get mom to help learn drive a manual.

Retry for 100th time to start drawing again.

Gotta do interview and hope to get hired.

And uh much more prob and let's not talk about the in-betweens but anyway I'm either screwed or idkz honestly at times like these I'm glad I'm not addicted to like weed or nicotine or alcohol because I'd be dead fucked."
794,"I feel bad for orphans… but lately have been thinking that no parent is better than an alcoholic/ druggy one.

They can’t call their parents bcuz they’re dead. I can’t call mine because she constantly says she wishes she aborted me. Ouch. 

The orphans don’t get an inheritance. I literally inherited debt. 

The orphans can at least think, “Well I never got to meet mine…” which is better than ‘mine just hated me/ changed her mind after giving birth.’

And no this isn’t a neglect thing. I would at least appreciate a neglectful parent that was able to provide. Like I heard rumors about tensions between Elon Musk and his kids: At least your father was able to put food on the table and did some nice things for humanity. Deadbeat alcoholics on the other hand… make you wish that you were an orphan. "
795,"In 2023 and 2024, I dealt with the huge fall out from re impulsivity tied to ADHD and C-PTSD. A key figure during this time was a man named David L., who sold me weed. He was over 20 years older, much bigger, and inherently intimidating—especially for someone like me, a smaller cisgender woman without self-defense tools.

I’ll admit that loneliness played a role in my choices. I confided in David about my C-PTSD and isolation, but looking back, I regret sharing so much. It feels like he used that knowledge against me rather than offering genuine support.

David encouraged me to take his high-dose THC edibles—“Wonka bars”—up to 1000mg daily. This led to psychosis and a cascade of bad decisions: oversharing online, meeting a married man from the internet at a hotel, wasting money, losing 40 pounds, being irritable with loved ones, and spiraling overall. At the time, I saw David as a friend, but now I realize how misguided that belief was.

Like many childhood trauma survivors, I fell into the toxic pattern of trusting older, predatory men. My history of abuse shaped how I navigated relationships. While I regret my choices during that time, I’ve since forgiven myself. The cycle made sense given my background, and I’ve actively worked to break it.

One turning point came during a casino trip with David. He pushed me to combine THC candies with alcohol. Later, when we were alone in the room, I asked to cuddle out of loneliness and vulnerability. He got hard and started speaking in strange, coded language that left me deeply uncomfortable.

When I started crying—grieving my life, mourning my uncle’s death, dealing with unemployment, and processing past traumas like being raped by men named Brandon C. and John C.—David asked something chilling: “Are you crying because you think Daddy’s upset at you?”

I knew David had reasons to be upset. I’d impulsively suggested on social media that I might report him to the police. Feeling unsafe, I gave him a hand job to de-escalate the situation before leaving the room.

I felt dead inside afterward. To cope, I bought a Pusheen plushie at the casino gift shop, telling myself it symbolized reclaiming my agency. Later, I considered taking pills I’d seen at David’s house, but I stopped myself. That wasn’t who I wanted to be.

The final breaking point came during an errand with David when we ran into John C., one of my rapists. It felt orchestrated, and I couldn’t shake the suspicion that David had set it up. I went home, vented to my family, and reported everything to the police.

Shortly after, I followed my psychiatrist’s advice and voluntarily checked into an inpatient psychiatric hospital. 🏥 That experience helped me reset and heal. 💊 Now, more than a year later, I’m in a much better place. 

I’ve cut all ties with David, who sometimes went by aliases like “Dave,” and I blocked and cut off “Brandon Cassamini,” and John Capt”, I stick to dispensary-grade weed at lower doses and only drink are your thoughts on how trauma and past experiences shape patterns of behavior? How do we break those cycles? 🔄 "

Idk if Mentioned it in yesterday's post but yeh that  calf pain yeh I tore a muscle god know ls how I didn't leave the house the day it happened. But yeh I went to the GP and got an ultrasound for it so that was fun
 Any way other thank that I went to a friend's house to play boardgames that was nice. And then I went to a park with a cousin and we had a bbq. Yeh that's about it cya yall "
797,"I didn’t smoke weed yesterday and I’m proud of myself. I feel like I actually got sleep and woke up well rested. And when I woke up I didn’t instantly crave nicotine and hit my vape, so far I havnt used it today and I am grateful. I also have been running differently. Apparently I didn’t know how to run correctly. I had been running heel to toe my whole life, and I would always get pain in my left knee. I started running just on the front part of my foot and not heel striking and at first it was hard and my calves got tired quick… but now a bunch of runs later, I’m up to running six miles in 58 minutes with no knee pain and the next morning I’m not that sore or struggling to walk. It’s so amazing. I can’t believe I’ve been running incorrectly my entire life. "
798,"i miss you. you were so close to me yet so so far. i feel like i’ll never be able to reach you. as said once, it feels like you’re running while i run behind, but you don’t stop and i’ll soon go down from exhaustion. all i ever wanted was a glimpse of you again, not you now, you before. “i haven’t cared since a month before”, i don’t think i’ll ever believe it..considering how much you had seemed to love me before, but was it all an act? or maybe the last time you ever had sex with me around that time was also fake, or maybe just for your own benefit.

i hate how shit you leave me..you come collect what you want from me, and throw the rest in the dirt for me to die in. i still love you, and i always will and i’ll keep that promise til you kill what’s left of me, and im sorry that i ruin everything single interaction we have and had.

you were never a shit boyfriend, nor will i ever see you as one. you were the best i ever had, and i just wish you’d say those three words to me again..i hope maybe one day you can take me back, rather than leave me waiting in the depths. but i wouldn’t mind waiting forever, because for you i’d really do anything..i hate myself, for what i’ve done to us. it was my fault, and im sorry, but one day i hope you’ll miss me as much as i miss you"
799,"Despite having only four and a half hours of sleep, I had to get up for my workout meet-up today. I went to bed late last night, but a promise is a promise, so I dragged my weary self to the gym. The lack of sleep and fasting state didn't do me any favors as my top set record for the incline bench press dropped. I felt crappy about it, but I somehow mustered the willpower to increase the reps in the remaining two drop sets, boosting the overall volume.

During the workout, I noticed one of the guys seemed deep in thought, so I asked him about it. Couldn't get into specifics, but it was relationship troubles. Listening to him made me wonder if I would make the right choice in that situation. Even though he's not perfect, it seemed like he made the right choice, and I was envious of how he overcame the ordeal. As Jordan Peterson said, being incompetent and weak is never a good thing. It just means you have no options. I felt disappointed that I didn’t even have enough attention to find myself in such situations, meaning I didn’t have opportunities to “get better.” At the same time, I feared if I’d be able to make the right choice when the time comes.

Walking sluggishly to the office, my steps felt heavy. My boss pointed out that the book I was reading and applying to our project was outdated and that no one in Korea succeeded using that method. Plus, a senior I met a couple of days ago said, “Anything you do without knowing yourself is meaningless,"" and that kept echoing in my mind. After military discharge, I did some soul-searching and used it to fuel my efforts over the past year, but it felt like that passion was being denied. I felt miserable. What was worse, thinking that I shouldn’t feel miserable made me feel even more pathetic.

I thought I’d done as much self-reflection as I could alone. I knew what traumas I had and how they impacted my life now, and I understood my childhood dream of becoming a “hero.” Might sound childish, but that dream seems to dominate my remaining life. If it wasn’t genuine, I wouldn’t have lived like this. It’s been my driving force, pushing me forward despite feeling exhausted, anxious, and hesitant... and now you're telling me it might all be an illusion?

I ended up reaching out to my former mentor, my Korean academy teacher, for help. We’re meeting on Sunday, but not having an immediate answer is frustrating. I sat in the office, turned off all devices and immersed myself in thought, only to conclude, “Let’s just keep doing what we’ve been doing.”

After lunch, a junior I worked with at a government event last summer called me. While giving advice on AI, he offered to help recruit initial users for my project. I hesitated because I’m questioning the project’s direction, but decided to accept his help. I’ve invested a year already, what’s another month or two?

In the evening, I had a discussion with my parents about grad school. Normally, I’d reject the idea outright, but this time I tried my best to present the opposing logic. I analyzed the pros and cons of grad school and even discussed which ones would suit me if I chose to go. After explaining my concerns, my parents acknowledged my points. It was the first time I persuaded them like this. Its significance will be clearer with time, but it seems like a positive sign.

Today's study of financial statements was particularly tough. I learned about the relationship between company growth/decline and cash flow, but it defied common sense. How can a company grow and be profitable, yet go bankrupt? How does a company's financial state improve when its sales are declining? I struggled to understand by reviewing example financial statements. I unknowingly dozed off for about 10 minutes but managed to grasp it eventually. I could identify the relationship between accounts receivable, inventories, accrued expenses, and accounts payable changes with cash flow in response to sales fluctuations.

Today started off terrible, but I managed to stick it out till the end. I’m not sure if I held up well, but at least I didn’t give up."
800,"Wow couple days I've been on a very annoying bad luck streak and I got so much adulting and just little inconveniences I got to take of, it's overwhelms my small ADHD brain.

""its time i let you be happy without me"", its like you knew what you were doing and knew itd wreck me, but god do i just keep going back every time, and im sorry. sometimes theres times where i wish you knew how much i was sorry and the grief i felt everyday since, but nor do i wish for this upon you ever, i really did love you though. the other day..when i had gone over to oyur home to give you the last bit of what was yours, you had told me ""to give your a month"", specifically to think about getting back together, but i feel like i had already ruined any chances of it, and im sorry, i promised to do better and thats exactly what im going to do and aiming for by next month, and beyond.

its ironic how i only promised to ""do better"" ""be kind"" etc, only when it had seemed to benefit me. but i promise and swear it was not my intention to only ""change"" now even when i had chances before, it might sound worse than it is but, i really meant it. i guess it was stupid of me to really speak about my boundaries or problems with an aggressive manner, and i really shouldve just **talked** to you about it appropriately instead, and im sorry. there's times where my heart physically aches and hurts in a way when i think about you, and i dont quite understand why, i mean its only normal for someone who had lost someone who meant everything to them. you where everything to me, as nothing else mattered and it even caused me to realize that i wasnt close with anyone or had any actual friends the second you left, but i guess at that point its on me.

i just wished we really talked about it, i miss when youd ask or say ""lets talk about it first"", because it somehow changed everything for me, and really got me to get softer, and it really gave me time to really think about what i needed to get out. though its far too late for any of that dont you think? im sorry, i wanna do better, to be better too.. i really do, and i will, i promise, for us"

804,"2025 January 23: Dear Diary,

Religion’s fatal flaw is that the search for a god outside oneself is illogical. Looking inward, closing your eyes, you can see the true creator. I watched a video talking about the basics of Sikhism and was astonished by how much I agree with it. I am not a Sikh nor a follower of any religion (I call myself a Pagan, which is the closest I can get to religion) but something stuck out to me when watching the video.  
  
We are all one. To me what many Westerners call the Universe or God and what Sikhs call Waheguru and Hindus call Brahman can be also known as the higher self. No religion has the whole truth, but most have hints of truth to them. Thelema and Christianity have the right idea about love being the law. I believe in the angels within Jewish and Christian texts (although I don’t believe in Jehovah). Buddhism is right in teaching people to let go of material things and that nothing is permanent. Hinduism and Sikhism teach about how everything is one or a dream of the Brahman.  
  
I celebrate Wiccan holidays and pray to Pagan gods (Particularly Nike/Victoria), but I do believe in the higher authority of the higher self. I believe other deities are personified representations of a concept. For example I believe Nike/Victoria is Victory herself personified and believing in her makes her real. However, I do not think my belief in deities or angels undermines the oneness of everything. Souls are just pieces of the ultimate oneness and all of life is just the dream of the higher self.  
  
I may sound insane, but this is what I have been shown. I do not expect people to believe me or take what I say seriously, just for this to be put out there. If this message does not resonate with you, then please disregard it. My only hope is for a great awakening to occur for everyone to realize they are equals. Any division is caused by evil or ego. Detaching from ego is an embracement of unity, which is desirable.

Sincerely,

Torinico"
805,"There are so many representations of time: you can hear it by the ticking of a clock, see it while the sun moves in the sky, feel it by aging, taste it by the staleness of chips, and even smell it by body odor. The subject and variables change but a constant truth of time is that it never stops. 

Time is one of those things in our lives that does not stop working. It has made fools out of some of us and recreated hope in others. What time has done for my life is unbelievable. It will continue to remain the surprise party I never asked for but will get anyways.

807,"Today was a rest day from working out. I had a lot to organize yesterday and ended up sleeping an hour later than usual, but I woke up early at 6:10 AM. I had set my alarm for 7 AM to catch some extra sleep while taking a break from working out, but since I was already up, I got ready and headed to the office.

To put into practice the lessons I learned yesterday, I started the morning by organizing my priorities and setting up time blocks using ChatGPT. I then spent about 40 minutes researching information needed for my exchange student preparations. I gathered details ranging from Colorado University's dormitory information to necessary documents and reported my findings to my parents.

After lunch, I looked for ways to improve my reading efficiency. By combining some eye movement reading techniques with Huberman's head-turning habit, I noticed a significant effectiveness. I usually struggle to read for more than an hour due to drowsiness, but today I managed to read around 20 pages and clearly remember the content.

However, the mood changed when I worked on my personal project. I found myself stressed out while drafting unfamiliar promotional content and, without realizing it, wasted an hour. I only managed to finish the sign-up/login feature before getting stuck. Honestly, I questioned if this path was right for me. Sometimes, I wondered if living a wandering life free from everything would suit me better. Still, the satisfaction I feel when I’m deeply engrossed in something is special, so I'm trying to see how far I can go.

At the bubble community meeting in the evening, I felt a sense of guilt over wasting time and couldn't socialize properly. In the end, I just worked on development tasks and left. However, a conversation I had with the leader after returning home provided new insights. It made me reflect on why many leaders consistently attend such meetings and why I haven’t engaged in the same way. I realized that while I acknowledged the importance of broadening my perspective as the leader suggested, I had only been attending these meetings without making any attempt to engage or initiate reactions from others.

This week has been tough overall, but a time of great learning. Though the path forward remains uncertain, I need to think about who I want as a mentor and what they would expect from me, as suggested by the leader."
808,"I'm 28 years old. Just a year ago I was still dreaming big about my future. Since getting out of unemployment,  I have forgotten how to dream for myself. I think it's because I experienced how it's like to live like a prey. And I still feel like one.

I watched my money get drained from my bank. I realised how easy it is to be homeless without a job. I was lucky I saved some money, good for about 4-6 months. I did not become homeless, thanks to my parents' support. But I could have easily been one.

Now I go home from my stable job. Afterwards I don't know what to do with my life. I have lost the drive to dream big. I want to achieve more in this life. I feel like I'm missing something. There is a fire inside of me, burning, fighting not to be extinguished by mediocrity and content. 

How do I make the fire rise?"

810,"i've been to taiwan with my family before.  
as i was coming out of gate, i dropped my passport.  
i didn't even realize it until a taiwanese lady came up to me, tapped me on my arm, and hand ed it back to me.  
she didn't ask for anything in return just walked off coolly, going her own way.  
it made me think isn't it the small,personal acts that truly shape a nation's image?   
  
things i love about taiwan.  
taiwan's cost of living wass about two-thirds of korea's, roughly 30% cheaper.  
the public safety was also impressive.  
everybody on public transportation was quiet and considerate.  
From what i've heard, in most countries outside korea, roaming around city at night time isn't exactly comfortbale. but i felt completely at ease taking nighttime strolls.  
of course it might have been because i stayed in taipei.  
on the first day of trip, we went to resturant,the line outside the store was insanely long.  
the sun was blazing down to stifle us. then out of nowhere the owner came over to us. brought over some complimentary snacks, then let us go into the store to escape the heat.  
if i had to pick one downside, it would be humidity.  
overall though the trip left me with warm memories. taiwan no.1"
811,"My last post was really somber. I was spiralling and needed to get my thoughts out. I’m still stressed about my capacity to be a good partner after everything that I’ve gone through, but at least I was mistaken about the thing that was triggering me in my last post. I bottle things up out of fear of upsetting others. The abuser last year would scream at me for even gently articulating how I felt or where I was coming from all while cheating on me. I forgot what it’s like to be with someone who doesn’t have emotional instabilities and volatilities. Someone who wants to be there for me and has the capacity to do so. 

I’m just so cynical and terrified of getting hurt again. Shortly after the abuser fled the scene after assaulting me and I discovered more lies and cheating, I had a low moment where I went on discord and found an NSFW server and posted that I needed someone to talk to. I got my inbox flooded with needy guys, and sent pictures and voice messages to someone that I clicked with. I never do anything like that. I can count on one hand the number of people on discord I’ve even been intimate with, and most of them never got audio or anything like that. Either way, it turned out that the guy lived like an hour away from me and was about the same age as me. Not common on discord. In fact, I’ve rarely met anyone who lived near me, only in the same state. 

So he expressed interest and concern for me once he learned my story. He messaged me infrequently throughout the months and I often didn’t respond because I barely used Discord and also felt really terrified that he lived so close. And I never thought that I’d find someone in such a manner as a virtual hookup. But after 7 months of him steadily checking in on me in a really respectful way and expressing his interest in a more clear way, I felt like I was in a place to actually date again. So we started talking more regularly. 

We were going to meet, but then he had a serious family matter and had to go out of state. The abuser kept postponing meeting me and being with me, so I got really triggered. This person got quiet on me right after we spoke for over three hours. We didn’t talk practically at all for two weeks. That’s why I was so anxious and down in my last diary entry. We finally talked and he explained everything, so I am feeling better. But I still feel like the person I’m dating deserves my absolute best, and I’m not there yet. So it’s unfair for anyone to have to deal with my PTSD. But I also don’t want to prevent myself from finding love. I already lost so much because of the abuse. I deserve to move forward, and the only way out is in. 

I still can’t believe the possibility that I found the right person for me from a random encounter on a Discord server days after being abused and finally escaping that situation with a protective order. Like what are the odds? It would be too good to be true. But I want it to be true so badly. "
812,I feel like a ghost. I’m trying not to smoke weed today. So far I’ve succeeded. I’m really craving a bowl rn tho. I know if I smoke I won’t feel better. I’ll go from feeling lifeless to feeling strung out and anxious which I don’t enjoy either. I just don’t know what the point of life is. Why do I exist? What am I here for? What do I do without my parents around? What do I do with no partner? How do I enjoy life? I went hiking today and it was something to take up time. I guess it was nice… but it feels like I only did it so I wouldn’t be doing nothing. I shared it with my bestie on snap and all she replied was “brr” cuz it’s obvi cold af outside rn. I feel dumb thinking she’ll ever want to date me. I feel such low self worth. The fact that I’m so depressed probably doesn’t make me very attractive. I wish I could find some kind of community I actually enjoy being a part of. I feel like I don’t belong anywhere. Except holed up in my house w my dog. At least she loves me. I wish a beautiful girl would love me again. It’s been more than a year since I’ve snuggled with anyone. All I want is to be held and touched and loved genuinely. All I want is to share my time with another human that wants the same. 
813,"2025 January 22: Dear Diary,

If each human were to possess one of the seven deadly sins, then my sin would be gluttony. Despite the fact that I like drinking alcohol and coffee I could easily stop drinking both for good. I have never gotten withdrawal effects from stopping either in the past and I can go a long time without them too. Things that are genuinely hard for me to stop for a while are eating junk food and wasting my precious time on the internet.  
  
Caffeine and alcohol don’t even come close to either of these vices of mine. When I’m not eating junk food there seems to be a part of me missing. Sweets, crisps, and crackers are items that require a lot of effort from me to put down. I do like celery with peanut butter. The only thing I don’t like about that snack is it requires time and effort to make it where I can instantly open up sweets and start eating them.  
  
Dieting is something I have done in the past before. Twice I dropped carbs besides whole wheat bread for three weeks. I lost significant weight both times. It was necessary for me to diet at the time because I was obese and had a fatty liver. After dieting I was able to shed enough weight to the point of not being obese anymore.  
  
Much harder than putting down junk food is getting off of my computer or phone. Part of me thinks it is worth it to be on my computer because I can learn so much. However, if I continue to learn things and not apply my knowledge then it becomes useless. I hope I can gain the strength to take action and pursue my goals. I think this diary is helping, even if it is just a little bit.  
  
Sincerely,

814,"
Rejection is really painful for me and I felt it repeatedly yesterday. I’ve never been one to lean into others but we all want someone to understand us sometimes.  Yesterday it hurt a lot and today it hurts less. 

I chose silence today. I’m not cruel, but I don’t want to be a care taker. And I don’t want to be taken for granted. And I also don’t want to cry and be helpless. I already did that last night in a parking lot alone. It’s too exhausting to cry or be sad. To cry, explain, ask for explanation, or really anything.  I’m tired. I give up. I’ll be quiet for you. I’m done talking. 

I said I’d stop weed but it’s hard when I feel sad, alone and aimless. Winters also depressing because the sun doesn’t come out in the winter anymore. 

 I threw out most of my empty weed carts and hoarded the few I could get use out of. Yes, pathetic indeed. I also took my last edible. It still isn’t doing shit, but I keep taking it every night this week anyway.

 I’m all out of my stuff now. If I go to the dispensary tomorrow, this entire break is over. I won’t stop. I’ll just keep going. So I guess tomorrows the day. All my shit is done, and I can’t just buy more now and go off the deep end. 

I built some mental resilience today. Stopping myself from spiralling, taking control, rationalizing, maintaining discipline, and doing what I said I’d do. I’m going to try and use the same resilience tomorrow and get back to normal, really normal, without any substance "
815,"21/1/2025
I did it again I'm sorry 2 posts in one day today. Relatively uneventful I woke up kinda late didn't really do to much just chilled at home watched some breakingbad played with my sis did some drawing and yeh that was it. "
816,"i'm doing my preceptorship at a nursing home and i hate to complain, but i never get a break.  it's just eight hours straight.  i can do it but at the end of the day when i come home, i eat way too much because of how tired and hungry i am.  one of our teachers always stresses having breakfast and ya, i couldn't do this without breakfast.  i make really thick slices of carrot bread (it's like banana bread with carrots) for mornings when i have clinical and freeze them.  i put them in the fridge overnight and wolf them down the next morning with some milk on my way out.  tides me over but ya, i still do eat way too much when i get home.  

today i saw something really awful.  one of the residents has a bad pressure sore, which i saw last week.  it wasn't great but it wasn't the worst thing i've seen.  well, he was in hospital over the weekend and... *sigh*.  he was there for sepsis but only stayed two days.  he doesn't even have IV antibiotics or anything.  i went with the wound care nurse to see his dressing change and, again... *sigh*.  it was soaked through with purulent drainage.  i've got a pretty strong constitution, but i did gag just a little bit when the smell hit me.

taking the bandage off was really sad for me.  his sore is just so much worse.  it's undermining now, like carving away the flesh under his skin and expanding internally.  the last time i saw it dressed, a small bandage was enough to basically pack it.  now you might be able to put your fist in there.  i have no idea why he's not still in the hospital and i'm pretty sure he's going to pass before my preceptorship is over.  i just don't want to be the one who finds him.

in other news, i passed my math test!  i was really confident about it and had actually expected to get a 10/10.  i got a 9/10 which means i just barely scraped by.  it's like an 'asian fail' system because anything less than 90% is a fail.  i don't know which question i got wrong but passing is enough for me.  "
817,"I went to a bar. And I talked pretty openly about my situations. So hopefully the right person overheard. But who's to say? I leave things up to chance. It's funner that way. I had five drinks, some buffalo tendies, and then I went home. I feel good. Tipsy, obviously, but not enough to throw up, or slur my words, or get the spins or even the hiccups. The waitress was super nice. She had cool hand tattoos. I like my tattoo too, and I like learning about other people's tattoos, if they seem open to it and the context makes it feel un intrusive and invited to ask.  

Nothing could make me turn against my family. That is for certain. I regret implying that I might on some anonymous, deleted accounts last year. But I had been non consensually drugged, and raped, and threatened, so I do forgive myself. You could tell me you hate me to my face. It wouldn't change anything. Family is rare and important and special. And anyways, my family is pretty freaking fantastic. The sacrifices they make/made for me, the lengths that they go to, to communicate with me, to keep me safe, I will always be grateful for it. I will never forget it and I try to reciprocate it as best I can, in the only ways I know how. 

One of my friend is laid off. Another had a relapse with drinking. It makes my heart sad for them. But everyone has sad and good times. I don't sweat it much. I don't insert myself into other people's lives. So all is well. I have my own burdens. I am looking for work again. I am trying to kick the self injury and purging habits. I am trying to heal from whatever the fuck happened last year. But I am, we all are, that's what I like about my positive thinking patterns, it consistently gives me positive results. 

I am enjoying my new self soothing tool. I explained it to my mom. She said she read that big trauma, heinous trauma, like what I went through as a child, she read that for some of us it freezes us in that moment in time, sometimes. And I agree. My innocent was ripped away from me, very unceremoniously, at the most impressionable and tender age possible. So my occasional involuntary age regressions, make a lot of sense. We all hate that this happened. It is not right or fucking fair, I agree with my parents, they did everything right. They vetted the daycare and still it wasn't enough to protect me from the abuse. Damn shame. I can't imagine being a child abuser and living with that. How humiliating, how pathetic. A reckoning is inevitable. But it's not my responsibility, as the victim, the much younger victim. 

Anyways. Now I am cozied up with some Netflix and some gingerale. My belly is full, my mind is empty and I am happy. I usually am. But no one can be happy all the time and being honest about your flaws and trauma, as I consistently try to be, is how you integrate your shadow in my opinion... and find peace. So I am grateful for the peace I found, in spite of everything. Soon I will watch The Secret Lives Of Mormon Wives for the first time. I feel excited. I love messy drama that has nothing to do with me or the people I love. HAHAHAHA, trashy reality TV is not for everyone but casual viewership is not the worst vice to have. 

I do think my family knows now that I was lying, bluffing that I am as loyal to them as they are to me. Good. I feel so grateful to have all of them in my life. They are all as smart, educated and hardworking as I am. And we all have our flaws but we all actively work on them and that's more than a lot of people in this world can honestly say. My family, I love you and I like you. We all meant what we said. We will try to get together again. Ideally, not at a wake this time. My scented candle is lit. Soon I will avail myself of my face masks to clear up an annoying period induced blemish. 

I very well might shower again too. I have been better at self care again. I need to pick up some acne stickers. But I will do that tomorrow I reckon. I feel excited about the big and small things in my life. And I feel closer to my goals. It has been a good day and a pleasant nice. Life can always be pleasant honestly, if you allow it to be. And I like how independent I am and how comfortable in my own skin I am and how I enjoy being alone as much as I enjoy being around other people. That's not something everyone can say. So I do feel rightfully proud of self. "

819,"I have been struggling with stress and anxiety for quite a while now. I realized how these 2 fuckers have been accompanying me for quite a long time now that I have let them overstay. Even when I was fairly stable there was some or the other thing to be a little anxious about. Lets keep them aside and befriend other folks too now, the ones who would make you emit positivity. Since a few days I have been getting some spiritual thoughts here and there.

Its time to be a little grateful to the God and count the blessings. I know at least 5 people around me who literally look up to me and would kill to be in my place right now. Its been a while since we have been in a happy and anxiety free mindset , it wont be easy to cut this off but lets take it one step at a time. 

I feel grateful that I have time to myself right now, I can go underground and discover myself. For a long time I always was in a position to water someone or the other. Always wanted to be there to support. Meanwhile overlooked how I needed to set boundaries and build my life alongside. How I should have probably also worked more on myself and discovered what interests me too.  

Now that I am absolutely alone, I kinda feel like this can be an opportunity too. To make the transformation I always wanted to make. 

I am scared of failing to be honest. It is there. I have succeeded a few times now It feels scary to fail. But today I thought that I am not just doing this for me, but this has also become like my devotion to God. The big guy has entrusted me with an opportunity to serve more people than I would know personally. So God I devote myself to you. What I am studying is like a devotion and my expression of gratitude for all the good things I have in my life. For one of the first times in my life, I feel like not worrying much about the output. I just want to become a better person in these coming 6 months. I wish to carry the knowledge . I want my brain to let me see the things I couldn't see. The output is not in my hands, All I can do is serve. Working on myself is my devotion to you. I hope you take care of the outcome thought. Treat me like your child along the way. Guide me and just support me along the way. I am trying to make my mindset different now. I know you are there as my well wisher when all others would turn their back onto me.

What will happen, will happen. But when I look back at this time I just want to remember how proud I will be, for the person I would become. How proud I would be to see me go through everything and still stay positive and happy. 

Lets try to keep this up. Keep working hard and enjoy the work I can put in.

821,"so I have been dancing since I was nine (4-5 years ago) and I got one solo ever. It was The Harlequin Doll in The Nutcracker. Don't remember that one? It's the first of (usually) three dolls that Drosselmeyer brings to the party. Anyways, that is a very minor role and I feel like no one really cares about the dolls. And my teachers have told me I have a gift for ballet, but now that I haven't gotten any solos in three years, it feels like they said that just so I don't get sad. well, I did get really sad and angry with myself. The other night I just felt like I wasn't good at the one thing I thought I was good at. So I picked up a jagged piece of rose quartz on my nightstand and started sawing at my wrist with it. and then I got a pair of sharp craft scissors and started doing the same thing. im just really upset about how im just not good enough. Ik that everyone around me probably thinks I'm amazing, but I feel like I am just a background character no one cares about. it doesn't help that my mom is a bit toxic. and my older sister keeps saying ""you barely have any trauma. I have a lot more trauma than you."" I just am not good enough."
822,"Today, like usual, I did a lower body workout in the morning. However, I wasn't feeling great, or maybe it was because the stepper I usually use for squats wasn't available, so I had to step on a higher platform. My squat record dropped drastically. I was really frustrated about the significant drop in my record, but I gave my all for the other exercises and broke all my personal records. Still, I must have overdone it because I felt weaker than usual afterward and ended up eating a bigger lunch.

There was some good news today as well. I got the results for the exchange program I applied to earlier, and I was accepted to the University of Colorado, my fourth choice out of ten. It's a bit disappointing that it's not in California, which I was hoping for, and it's a bit rural, but the fact that I got accepted is something to celebrate.

After checking the results, I continued with the personal project I started yesterday. I couldn't get much done because of many dinner appointments, but I managed to finish the interview promotional post and survey for the university community.

At 4 PM, I had a meeting with a senior who's running a startup at our university, and this meeting became a turning point for today. After some casual talk, the senior gave me some sharp advice.
""Doing too many things means you're not doing the important ones.""
This hit exactly what I've been worrying and feeling anxious about since yesterday. It's what I mentioned in my previous journal, 'habits I know of but don't fix.' I'm currently juggling two personal projects, one ongoing freelance project and two scheduled ones, preparing for a no-code society, and bits of study. This made me suddenly recall my intern days. It was similar back then. I had two projects where I only proposed ideas but never completed them. Although I successfully finished many projects, those two weeks spent on unfinished projects felt wasted. Thinking of how I learned Bubble in just two months, those two weeks could have been used more effectively.

With all these complex thoughts, I went to a meeting with the teahouse owner. I'm working on a no-pay freelance project, where I create a website in exchange for information and site usage rights. The senior’s advice kept echoing in my mind. The owner gave similar advice:
""Finishing things one by one is the way to go. If you can't finish, it's neither here nor there. You need to relax a little to make sure you complete what you're doing now.""

Based on these pieces of advice, I thought of specific improvement plans. I decided to apply the Kanban diagram from lean startups to my daily life. I plan to use the Kanban diagram to prioritize and track progress every morning during time block planning. I also decided to boldly decline two external projects that haven't started yet. Though they were paid projects, what I need now isn't just income, but the cycle of experimenting, validating, feedback, learning, and accumulating necessary knowledge."
823,"I know her. She's too old and too sweet to have done that intentionally. So it was one of you yeah? Her kids or grandkids? Listen! I do not blame you one bit. My aunt wasn't the best godmother in the world, not by a long shot. She takes after Joe a little too much, in my ever so humble opinion. But oh my god please. I need your family to be blended with my family. We share a last name, we share blood. I do not think that I am exactly like Mary, and I would never ever make light of any of that horrible, inexcusable (regarding the men) situation. I just think some of our similarities, they both concern me and make me curious. I want to be closer to you because every single time we hangout it's very pleasant for me. And I think you have the potential to be good influences on my life. 

And look. It's probably just a coincidence. I probably am ""too paranoid too often"". But quote me on this, if you dealt with what I dealt with, you'd be a bit on edge too. I don't want to only see you at wakes. I want to see you as often as time and circumstances allow. It's not your fault that I am lonely or that bad things happened to me or that I don't know how to act on or offline. It's not. But I just. I feel like Joe abandoned the family, in a way. And my aunt kind of emotionally abandoned her god children too, at least from what I saw. I just don't want to be like that. So that's why I tried to message you today. But this is my last attempt to form a connection. You all have your own burdens. I don't want to force myself on you or create more problems. I just love and miss you. And I admire all of you. That's all. "
824,"ARGGHH WHY CAN’T YOU JUST TALK TO ME?? i want you, i want you and only you, i LOVE you and it’s enough to have me going actually crazy and it hurts. i hate crying every. single. fucking. day. for you and because of you, i just want you to talk to me, and at least give me some attention.. or some love. “happiest time of the year” huh? i dont believe in it anymore, not since you’ve left.. i want nothing but to have you again, and god fucking damn i’ll admit i’m basically burning from the inside and i just want you back, and i dont care what it takes..id do anything you ask, anything you want if it meant you’d come back. im sorry i seem so crazy bc of it, but i hope you know id do anything for you..just like you did for me once too.

i’ll always cherish everything we once had until the day i die, and ill never forget you ever. i hope maybe you still have a soft spot for me..as i have for you. i love you, and i always will forever..

i hope to hear from you soon, as i know you have this app again"
825,"I’m truly feeling so alone. I have nobody to talk to. I’m fighting so many battles on my own. Everyone’s just passing by and sometimes I just want to scream. I feel so stuck right now and I don’t know where to go or who to turn to. I tried to open up to a friend today but feeling rejected reinforces why I don’t open up to anyone. It doesn’t matter because no one understands. I’m honestly just so lonely.

There’s some battles that we just have to fight on our own but man is it ever lonely. 

I had no where to go and nobody to turn to. It’s so cold outside. I drove aimlessly until I reached one of the only places that is open this late. Why is this city so fucking dead? 

Maybe I’ll buy some flowers from this grocery store. "
826,"In my case, the answer to that is generally “no.” I don’t feel like doing much of anything right now, unfortunately, but I don’t want to get up and finish up my chores, either. I don’t have any talents—not as a “smart person,” not as a reader, and certainly not as a writer, like everyone used to say—but I’m not especially bothered by that at the moment. Now, when I say that, do keep in mind that I mean “the moment” in the most literal, granular way possible. I only narrowly averted a complete mental breakdown tonight, being triggered as I was by my pathetic past, present, and (barring a sudden and miraculous change) future. I’m trying to be a better human being, but I’ve found that it is much harder to treat others well when you’re frustrated by how they treat you. Not that people don’t treat me well enough—they just don’t satiate my narcissistic desire for praise and recognition, to be recognized as someone who is of at least above average-intelligence and has some kind of talent that most others don’t. But how can they recognize something that isn’t there? It’d be like acknowledging Connor Cook’s stellar and historic NFL career with the Raiders, an obvious sham to anyone who has more than the least bit of background knowledge. So I’m stuck in this rut where I just can’t accept that I was dealt a bad hand but am forced to play it anyway. Unsurprisingly, I’m not winning much with a high card 7.

But despite not being a good writer, I’d still like to *be* a writer—which is too bad for me, since now’s not a good time to be going into the profession. Demand has already been falling off for decades, and it seems posed for another nose dive as AI improves and becomes more cost effective than its human counterparts. I don’t think that writing jobs are going to disappear altogether, since AI is being introduced to markets years before it’s ready, which will force companies to have human editors on hand to review whatever the AI put together. But it’s going to take away a lot of jobs in the writing market, and it may well take them all, in due time. Not that it matters, since the best I could ever hope for would be one of those lower-level positions that AI will take first. 

To focus on something more positive (if you can call it that,) the NFL playoff predictions that I made on this sub before the last week of the regular season are aging quite well. I said that the Eagles and Chiefs were going to meet in the Super Bowl, which does seem like the most likely outcome as of right now. I stand by my Eagles pick because I just think that they’re a better team than the Commanders; the fact that Washington has far less experience just bolsters my confidence. In the AFC, I stand by Kansas City for the exact same reason I stood by them in my last post: they are adept at using black magic and favorable officiating to beat teams that outplay them. The black magic is something that I can’t explain or even understand, but the favorable officiating is plain as day and even worse than I expected. **TEN** of their 23 points from last Satruday came on drives that should’ve ended long before they put points on the board, but were saved by phantom roughing the passer calls on the Texans; the Chiefs won by **NINE.** So, in the absence of two of the worst calls in NFL history (the latter of the two being *especially* egregious,) the Texans probably win without anything else changing. But of course, that wouldn’t be the end of it: the Texans were held to a different standard the entire afternoon, each little thing slowly aggregating until it limited what each team was capable of. How do you beat *that?* So, yeah, I still say the Chiefs win on Sunday, even against a very talented Bills team.

Well, that’s all I’ve got to say for now. குட் நைட், என் நண்பர்களே, and remember: be excellent. "
827,"We live in such a selfish, delusional generation. Obviously I was one to fall fault to delusion at what I thought was real.
There is someone close to me that has been screaming out for help. And I finally reached out and spoke real to her that she has needed. 
No one has ever heard my screams.
I cancelled my 9am appointment tomorrow morning 2 hours away. Because you know what; there is more important things in life that everyone takes for granted. 

I know fuck face and I don’t have much in common. At least I’m not dumb enough to go back to what hurt me. I learn lessons. He wants to re live them. 
Sad thing is, I feel bad knowing what is in his future. And he is too love bombed and blind, like I was to him. 
And I need to get far away from him so I can fully detach before that happens. 


Now, with what I know, I have to go sooner than planned. 
I’m a fast worker and need to go before I get destroyed. 
Life happens which force changes to happen. It’s pathetic how long I’ve been holding on to make that change. 


I really thought, even after the pain he has caused me, that he was my matching soul. And he got blinded and killed me instead.
I guess I’m not the only one to learn things the hard way more than once.


Everything I have loved and cared about the most, has left me suddenly. 
So now, it’s time I finally go to what actually loves and cares about me and adapt to change.
I tried.


At least I don’t have to live with the regret of not trying. Biggest gamble I’ve ever taken. 
It costed me everything. I gambled it all, while they knew I would lose. 


Lesson learned.
I’m all I got. 
"
828,"It's a love/hate relationship between me and nostalgia. 

Often times, the smell of freshly cut grass, or the rain smell that seeps through the sky makes my mind think of younger me.

I was so happy then. They weren't kidding ""enjoy being young while you still can"".

I love to cry thinking about the past. I love to reminisce on it too. I even get embarrassed or angry for things I did. But at the end of the day, I'll love it.

Cheers ! "
829,"Because I did think I saw you, L, but I can't be sure. You know how it is with me.... those men threw me for a loop and I started to lie about me not having facial recognition to try and stay safe from the actual organized criminals who had been stalking me at the time. Oh, but I didn't mean a word of it and consistently had to prove it after what I did. Which was fine and like I did. I am not quick to assume someone is who I think they are honestly. I have indeed been wrong before, like any of us. But I also, I am not blind nor naive nor stupid. I am pretty good at detecting patterns and remembering a name and face. 

I dont let myself forget a face. That's why my rapists be named and photographed and shamed in my diary. Which is fine. They're just four guys, DS, DL, BC, JC and then my ex daycare providers got honorable mentions too because that whole thing was so heinous and traumatic for me. As we've all seen, for my entire life so far, LOL. But like, I like most people. I say I am not a people person and there is some truth in that. I know how sardonic, shy and emotionally unavailable I often can be. But there's more nuance to me. That's just how life goes. Because I can be super platonically physically affectionate. It is one of my love languages. I love to giggle and usually am inclined to positivity. I am good at making the best of situations I am in. Maybe a little too good, which is how I found myself in denial about my rapes and attempted human trafficking debacle for longer than I would have preferred. LOL. Live and learn I guess, none of us are perfect but I do feel like I am leaning the right way, growing in the right direction. Thanks to my advisors. That is all I can do. 

I bought a new self soothing tool and it's been helpful. It's cute and easy and safe. I have it in my mouth right now. I am glad I am being gentler to self, and kinder. It's not easy when you have a history like mine. But it's so important because what people say about me is true too. I have enormous potential and I can live up to all of it, ***IF*** I let myself feel all my feelings, and ***IF*** I am honest about my needs, my boundaries, my trauma, my goals, my everything, to the people in my life who love me and want me kept safe and thriving. Do you think I am getting better at that? My parents do, my psychiatrist does, and they've known me for years, they had the misfortune of witnessing human trafficker gate, up close and personal, in person, through me. I think I am too. 

So yeah I'd love to catch up. You and your husband were positive influences on me in high school. And I know how you feel. I remember what you said. About your dad. With me, I am sure my memories are all true, regarding the daycare. So obviously, I related to you at the time and still do now. I have no idea how you feel or what you believe about me or yourself. It's none of my business. But I care about you. And I am guessing you guys care about me. Based on how often I see some of you around. But we all know my eyes play tricks on me sometimes. I am self aware. 

So yeah. Keep me in the loop girly. I am always wishing you and your family the best. I also am making this diary post to publicly say that the bracelet system is off. I am not using it anymore. I feel that too many people know about it. And I also feel that I keep forgetting to signal when I want to signal so it's just going to confuse everyone and also myself. So no. We will pivot. I have an emergency phrase that my family/closest friends know I will say if I need them to call 911 but feel unable to speak freely. Otherwise, all is well with me. There have been no attempts of any kind, my family is keeping a watchful eye and the system of making mom temporarily in charge of dispensing my medicines has worked beautifully. "
830,"Greetings! This is my first time using Reddit, and I’m from South Korea. You might wonder, “Why would someone in Asia who doesn’t even live in the USA come to Reddit to ask this question?” Well, here’s my story. (If you’re not interested, feel free to skip this paragraph.)

I served in my country’s mandatory military service as a member of KATUSA (Korean Augmentation to the U.S. Army), working alongside the U.S. Army. I’m not saying I was a stellar soldier—honestly, I whined a lot about why I should work hard when other KATUSAs seemed to be slacking off. During my service, I fell in love with a girl, confessed, and got rejected. It was my first love confession ever, and it failed. After that, I started hitting the gym to vent those painful feelings, and my Instagram algorithm led me to discover David Goggins. His grind, toughness, and “stay hard” mentality lit a spark in me.

Where I live, it’s unusual to see someone like David Goggins—an extreme example of positive masculinity. Most people here focus heavily on academics, and I rarely see that relentless, disciplined drive he demonstrates. Inspired by him, I’ve been trying new things to pursue my goals. Before my service, I had no real skills, but now I’ve done an internship at a startup and learned how to build software MVPs with a no-code tool called Bubble. I also started dabbling in finance and coding (HTML, CSS, JS). Still, I have no mentor or close friends who truly get what I’m trying to do.

So, here’s why I’m posting: I’ve never faced a true life-or-death crisis. I’m unsure if I can “stay hard” if something really severe happens. I want to prepare myself by gathering more resources and methods to cope. If you have time, please share your experience:

1. **What kinds of methods have you used to handle an ‘existential crisis’? How effective were they?**
2. **Do you talk about your problems with anyone? If so, who do you talk to and how did you meet them?**

"
831,"Today was one of those days filled with fresh ideas, prompting me to reflect on the work I've done so far. I started the morning with my usual workout. I worked on my back exercises with the club senior I mentioned yesterday, and it looks like we'll be working out together until next month. Today's performance was mixed; while I set a new record on my first exercise, I actually regressed on the second and third ones. While working out, I noticed that the gym had acquired a lot of fancy new equipment while I was away on my trip. I'm thinking of trying them out next time.  At the office, I was going to tackle some customer service tasks, but my team member had already taken care of everything. Even while I was on vacation, he managed to handle tasks in advance and continued to cover for me once I returned, allowing me to focus on other tasks.  When I checked the blog, I saw a new request for mutual neighbors. This gave me an idea. As I've been steadily writing these diaries, I've started to receive some attention. I thought it would be great to translate these into English and post them on international platforms to reach more people. So, I began working on a system to automatically translate and post on various platforms. I searched for popular blog platforms using Perplexity and started setting up automation. There were a lot of things to configure and accounts to create on these new platforms, but I think I can finish it by tomorrow.  During preparations for user interviews for my personal project MVP development, I encountered an unexpected problem. As soon as I posted, I got banned due to my low activity on the platform. This community seemed like the perfect fit for my goals, but I wasn’t aware of this hidden rule. I ended up spending the day engaging in this community. Though it sometimes felt like a waste of time, seeing others’ stories gave me fresh perspectives. It might be good to engage in such activities during my commuting time in the future.  In the evening, I met with my Nocotone team members. We had interesting conversations with people from various backgrounds, including founders and current professionals. I was particularly intrigued by the discussions about the pre-startup packages. More than the package itself, listening to the frequently mentioned items and their reasons made me think it would be a great experience to apply it as a side project. On my way back home, I posted an offer on Eta to develop an app for free.  As I wrapped up the day, I couldn’t help but wonder if I'm taking on too much at once. There was this anxiety that maybe there was more to learn from past projects that I deemed failures and halted. But for now, I’ve decided to stick with my current tasks for about a week, track any changes, and then evaluate. Although I couldn’t study financial statements much due to the late meeting, I managed to read through one sub-section."
832,"i had a math test today and was really freaked out about missing it so i got to school about an hour in advance.  i took the time to scope out the room where i'd be writing, since none of my classes or tests had ever been held on that floor.  finding and assessing the rooms took all of five minutes because the campus is quite small.  after confirming these rooms existed and were, indeed, on the second floor, i planned to sit somewhere quiet and do absolutely nothing until test time.  i've been so lonely and disconnected lately, though (uncharacteristic of me), that the cold comfort of sitting a doing nothing was less appealing to me than connecting with a living person.  i decided, instead of cloistering, to search the campus for a friendly face and familiar company.

most of my classmates are quite studious and i had expected to be able to glob onto someone at the library and just insert myself into their situation for a while.  lo and behold, two people i knew had gone the extra mile as students and booked a room in the library to study for the test.  i, of course, invited myself in and studied with them.

i'm glad i did, not only for the company, but because one of them had printed off some study materials i wasn't aware had been available.  i wish i had because they were incredibly useful exercises.  funny enough, each one of us had a different method in solving the problems.  i stuck with mostly dimensional analysis and the formula method.  this close to test time, i didn't even want to hear how the others were doing it because it would just muddy the brain waters.

test time came and we all made our way to class together (the solidarity was everything).  the test was what i had expected and i hope i didn't do something stupid.  barring a stupid mistake, i really think i passed.  a pass, by the way, for this test was 90% or higher so it's a razor's edge here.  i was a little concerned when i left because one of the smart people i know was still writing and they usually leave tests before i do.

because i had time and really need exercise, i used the gym at school for the first time (just the cardio room).  i jogged two miles and got really sweaty.  that room is warm.  i'm used to 'planet fitness' where there's an enormous fan over the treadmills to wick the sweat and muffle my heavy breathing.  after that, i got back into street clothes and went to catch the bus.

it was somewhere near -15 degrees here today and, still, i was sweating in my coat.  it's really something you don't want in this weather.  being dry is important when you're cold.  i mean, the walk home from the bus station (which i don't need to even make if i want to just connect to another bus) is like max ten minutes.  still, it's unpleasant and gross being sticky in the cold."
833,"Oh boy today sucked absolutely 1/10 the moment I woke this morning and a whole lot unfortunate situations, ALSO FUCK COCKROACHES anyways..nah FUCK WHOEVER DIDN'T PUT TEACHER WORK DAY IN THE SCHOOL CALENDAR TOO like damn it was cold as hell this morning bruh nearly took me out trying to walk home in this weather. thank God I took a ride there instead of walking, I would've have died honestly it was looking rough this morning. 

So besides today absolutely sucking, I come to realize maybe all this is a sign of something either that or I'm going crazy but yeah I'm a pretty mind fucked guy but I wanna keep giving myself a try.

I got pretty bad adhd like really bad, I should've been in therapy 5 years ago andan thank God I never got a caffeine or nicotine addiction cuz I would've been died by now fr. Idk why I'm saying all this maybe I just want to rant again my mind is kinda weird like that but I'm tired, tired of being me, tired of this life, I wanna change, so...

God. Amen "
834,"2025 January 21: Dear Diary,

After finishing Death Note with my mom I realized I have spent too much time consuming content and not enough time creating art. If I don’t hold myself to some standard this could be disastrous. Just now I have written on a piece of paper some rules I should follow. The rules are such:

\-Besides meditation (or music for writing), work breaks, and bed time I am only allowed two hours of entertainment from the internet (including television) a day. I should set a stopwatch to be sure. Google is not included if I am genuinely researching something or want an answer to a burning question.

\-Besides my diary entries I should spend at least one hour a day writing or editing.

\-At least one hour a day should be spent reading or editing.

\-One hour a day should be spent meditating collectively. This can be before bed time.

\-Detach from what my friends or dates are doing when I am away. They love me no matter what.

\-Create.

\-I should lift a dumbbell at least one hundred times or do at least fifty sit-ups a day.

\-I should learn in multiple ways. Use different mediums and not just videos.

I feel these rules are good guidelines to keep me in check. I only hope that I follow these guidelines as if they were biblical. Only time can tell, but my hope is sincere. I will not treat these rules as urgent as urgency might keep me from following them. It is better to think of them as moral guidelines than rules in all honesty.

Sincerely,

Torinico"
835,"Deeper and deeper towards the bottom I spiral, and I've hit the bottom of the well water a few times. It's disgusting down there. You keep getting halfway up the well and then scrape back down. But you know you're strong enough to claw out, you KNOW you can do it. I'm starting to think you kind of like hiding in that well. Everyone got sick of waiting for you to come out, so they're all gone. Now you're alone and afraid to leave the well. It's been so long since you've seen the grass and the trees. It stinks down here, don't you miss the fresh air? What's it going to take to love yourself enough to be free? Yes, its' going to be the hardest thing you've done in your life, but don't you want to see the sky in entirety rather than just through one hole?"

Ight so not much I had tution in the morning it was hard stuff but I'm doing ok It was a pretty chill they we had the sparkys over. Yeh I hit the gym in the Arvo that was fun yeh nothing to big"
838,"i miss you, and i hate having to grieve the shell of what you were, and experience who you are now. i feel like everything im trying to keep myself put together isn’t enough, that i might just sob and beg for you, in front of you again. i hate being in a psychotic-splitting mix of an episode because i feel like nothing and so helpless without you, and i cry for none but you. im hurting on the inside, and im watching myself but i can’t stop. and a part of me still tries to keep the idea of “us” alive, knowing you will throw me under the dirt again if you felt like it, but i love you. ill always love you, and i hope to be loved again. and 4 days right before christmas, that night i had caught and felt a glimpse of what it was like to be loved by you for the first time in a very, very long time. dare i say how much i missed it and its the reason why i had cried on ur shoulder? i love you, and i hope to live and see the day where maybe you might say it back to me again. i really wish to have nothing but to have you back, and im sorry that im hard to love. when will i ever achieve a sense of accomplishment or love?

as i’ve seen you yesterday, i can’t help but feel terrible. why do you yell at me? why do you try so hard to enforce such strong tones to me. i feel like maybe i just mean nothing to you, though i still always try to find a way to ignore it, and see the best in you. i’ll always be willing to try again with you, even if it means i text ur old unused number as a way of closure, even if it means im just telling a ghost-of-you how much i loved you."
839,"There was an instance today that made me second guess a personal truth that has defined my character. I love to serve and help people with in reason. Committing random acts of kindness with no conclusion of notoriety or reward didn’t bother me. People are born with a predisposition to have an aptitude for a skill. The discovery of this or its practicalness in application is questionable but I believe it’s there for everyone. 
My epiphany today was what if the reason I am so good at taking care of people is not because it’s in my ancestry but from trauma. Would I still have this character archetype if I wasn’t distrustful of people, paranoid, unmotivated, or loved the way I think I needed to be? I don’t know. 



Anyways, 



It seems as of late when I write these entries that the initial topic that warranted the writing gets pushed off for impromptu topics. This is purposeful sometimes because I don’t have anything worthwhile to write but I want to. The only change that would be better is to address what made me want to write first before going to yap fest.  

Written on 1/21/25 for me love you buddy "
840,"So I just keep them inside. Even though all I want to do is talk. But no one ever asks me how I’m doing. Or maybe they do sometimes but it’s not usually a good time to drop emotional baggage. Like no one wants to hear my bullshit. No one wants to hear I’m sad. No one wants to look at a victim who is lonely and bored and can’t make up his mind about what to do with his life cuz his parents died and he has no wife or girlfriend. FLIP BRO. So flipping sad. Boo hoo hoo, you’ll probably never be a dad. No one is going to love you. What’s the flipping point of life if not to share it loving and creating with a partner? Am I delusional? Like I know people are all like self love self love… I’m sorry but if I gotta go it alone without a you… idk if I can see life through to the end. Like make it make sense. "
841,"Don't get me wrong I love singing, I was in chorus for 2 years but with my worsting ADHD and depression uhh I kinda be singing to pass time and sometimes I feel crazy doing it.

I'm a pretty big Guy 6'0 of pure 300 pounds of mass but the problem is I'm slowly starting to age the fuck up like damn , I just turned 18 and I can't even do a stretch in the morning like damn I need to lose weight.  There's so many things I need to learn now and do and I won't lie I'm scared but I want to at least try and I know I'm the most biggest underachievers lol get it cuz I'm fat anyway...

My dream is to create something I'm proud of and that will inspire and will be loved, if I don't at least try how could I possibly even attempt to reach my goal.
Anyway today was a alright day same as yesterday tbh so 6/10

Oh yeah got a job interview scheduled today so 7/10"
842,"
The spiralling was real on Jan 1. It’s safe to say I indeed got my shit together. Am I caught up on my work though? Um.. no. Lol. But I made a massive dent in it. I was extremely behind. Plus, everything is on my laptop now. I hate that I’m saying this, but thank God for AI in the context of completing my work… 

I got some good momentum going in the holidays. I need to get back into the hyper focus of catch-up, but I lack balance that way. My focus in January has been to maintain balance. Bit by bit, one small step in the right direction in all  of the important facets of life. 

So things have been good in my habit setting, getting things done, my physical and mental health, my relationship, my friendships, my work, organization, my routine, discipline. My problems are still in existence but it helps a lot to know I’m working hard every day to make things better. That’s all we can lean back on sometimes, folks.

It’s Jan 20 though, and it’s supposed to be the first day of stopping my weed addiction. Yes, an addiction, I’ll call it exactly what it is and I will not pussyfoot around about it for once. I really got the itch at 1:45pm. I’m not being hard on myself when I say it’s pathetic! Why am I looking for old empty carts in my home? And secretly puffing them when my partner isn’t around. Lol.. I also took an edible. The joke’s on me, my tolerance is so out of control that it barely did shit to me. That’s really why it’s sitting there to begin with or I would’ve used it by now. 

Okay, tomorrows a new day. We stayed up so late last night, and I left the house for a medical appointment without my coffee this morning. It was all very chaotic, and I like my mornings to be peaceful. You know, to mentally prepare for my natural chaos. So let me try again tomorrow? I’ve got a plan to take a bag, throw all the carts out as I go to the gym in the morning. I have a few uneaten gummies, how can I just toss them out?! I don’t know, but I need to get this shit out of my house! Clearly I have no self control! 

Last little tidbit is that I did an ovulation test today. My luteinizing hormone is up, a week later than expected. My partner and I are having a weird day today, in fact, he’s honestly really pissing me off. maybe it’ll take this time, it definitely will be a memorable day. 

Let’s keep trying our hardest, y’all!!!!

843,"2025 January 20: Dear Diary,

I’ve been thinking about hypnotism. More than anything I want to stop procrastinating and being paranoid. Thinking everyone hates me because of my neurodivergence has led to me needing to battle my misanthropy. Usually I just escape by watching YouTube videos or Instagram reels which worsens my hatred for humanity. Sometimes I learn useful information from these videos however.  
  
I definitely do not want to hate anybody as I can genuinely empathize with people, but my emotions and lust for justice get in the way. I want to replace my bad habits of surfing the web and eating junk food with good habits such as reading, writing, meditating, and exercising. I want to believe these activities are more fun and stimulating.  
  
Hypnotism only works if it is something you truly want. If I can hypnotize myself into following these good habits that would be perfect. Letting go of things is not easy, but it is worth the struggle so I can find peace in my day to day life. I need to validate myself only and not look for validation outside of myself. Loving myself and the rest of the world is my only option.  
  
Sincerely,  
  
Torinico"
844,"I am 29 and scared. 

9 years ago I was excommunicated from Jehovah's Witnesses. And I have achieved nothing. I have been wild, reckless, hedonistic, partying the pain away but you can't run forever. 

Broke up with P (long term ex) nearly 15ish mo ago after 6/7y. I couldn't do it anymore, just didn't love her. 

Then a month later I met H (recent ex). Fucked over a friend for her. Thought we had something really special. We understood eachother like I've never experienced before. We lived eachother deeply. But I can't trust her impulses. 

Anyway, why I started the diary. 

As you can tell from my ramblings, I've been paid...

- bought a beer
- bought a bottle of whiskey 
- bought .5g

Predictable behaviour at this point. 

I am on my own in my room, wired as fuck watching TV. 

Why?

I'm not sure. I guess I hope by keeping this diary I'll figure out the answer. Initially, I wanted to blame my suspected ADHD. I get bored so quicky with the mundane and at the same time, my sober mind is too much to handle. 

I am; anxious, skittish, depressed, lethargic, but somehow, also mind numbingly bored. 

When I am chilling at home, watching TV, playing PS, I am very aware that all of this would be actually interesting, if I was Fucked Up.

When I'm broke, I nick my D (flat mates) alcohol. 

When I get paid, it's whiskey and packet. 

I don't know why. One the idea of ❄️ is in my mind, I can't shake it. It's akin to when you first realises that suicide is an option. Like a parasite, I takes root and burrows in. I become anxious into a near panic attack state, dry heaving, heart palpitations, until I pick up the bag. 

Today I watched a film with D and snuck off for a few lines. I don't think he knew but I feel he was disappointed with the whiskey I was drinking/completely abandoning dry Jan. 

Now I have done a full .5h by 02:30am. Before this would last me and S (friend) all night. Now, it's just me, by 2am. 

I have applied for lots of affordable therapy. Let's see what they come back with. Maybe like the NHS they just won't respond, or decide I am too far gone to be helped. I am afraid. Afraid that I do not have the energy to fight this on my own. 

Tired. 

Ashamed. 

Yet, I want to completely succumb to my vice's. "
845,"Both my parents passed away less than a day apart. My dad passed 6/4/23 in the afternoon at the hospital. My mom passed the following morning. I haven’t been the same since. I havnt done any counseling or group stuff. It’s been a year and a half now and I don’t know why I exist any more than I ever have. They left me enough money to retire, so I never went back to work. I have a 5 year old dog I inherited from my mom that I love more than anything. I also have a 20+ year old cockatiel I’ve had since middle school and he is still happy as ever but showing signs of age and having difficulty moving around his cage. I have family nearby. I have some close friends, but most of them live far away now so I don’t see them much. I feel like having a job would help me feel better, but I live alone and don’t want to leave the bird and dog alone for long hours so i don’t. My best girlfriend talks to me every day and sends me snaps. Our streak is 571 days and there’s a red heart on our chat that could turn pink soon. She broke up with her bf of 5 years over thanksgiving. She is very hurt from him ghosting and cheating on her. She is burying herself in work but also hates working. Sometimes she opens up about her feelings but it’s just a little here and there. I’ve loved her since the moment we met 6 years ago. We were coworkers tho and she met her ex shortly after us becoming friends. I let go and accepted it. I dated on my own and had some good experiences but nothing lasted. Now we havnt been coworkers in almost 2 years and she is single. All I want to do is rush in and sweep her off her feet. I’ve never been able to stop loving her. I could even support her financially and we could both not work. She is so fiercely independent though and distrustful of men and scared she’ll never want to be in a relationship again. I’ve told her I love her multiple times. She’s always said she’s happy just being friends. But then the other week I brought her coffee at work and she said she loves me. I’ve barely spent any time w her this month because she’s working so much and when she’s not she just wants to be alone w her dogs and trying to not get into drama w her family. I feel like she is flirty in general w me on snap and socials and I’ve been not hiding my love for her… sometimes I feel like I’m crazy for holding onto hope that we can be a couple. I think about her constantly. But I don’t know how to stop. I don’t want to move on. I don’t know what to do with my time day to day in general so I work out, go on hikes, watch tv, play w the dog. It gets repetitive tho and it’s depressing doing most things alone even if I’m outdoors enjoying nature. I feel trapped in some cycle where there is so much good and love I am thankful for, but there also so much in my head left unsaid for me to feel anxious and unable to sleep. I don’t know what I’m doing and why I am experiencing these things. I often don’t want to exist. But that’s not a real option. Lately I’ve been sleeping a lot, lacking motivation to go anywhere because what’s the point. I just work out to exhaustion and take care of my responsibilities. I hope I can find some kind of way forward soon.

So very bored at work. It’s supposed to be a busy week but I can’t help but look forward to my time off. The games I am playing right now are so good at eating up time the hours go by so quickly. 

My last few days off I got a loveseat for the apartment. Already took a nice little nap on it to christen the couch. Tried that egg roll place by my place too. Meh it wasn’t as good as I thought it would have been, they even made my food fresh. The rolls weren’t too bad but spending 7 for 2 is too steep for the quality I got. The Philly cheesesteak and chicken parm were decent. The fries were awful, how do you do fresh fries but they are cold and soggy when I get them. I like soggy too but these were just a little undercooked. It was a nice couple of days off relaxing. Hope the day goes by quick so I can be off for another couple again. "
848,"hmmm. 

I just can't do whatever I really want to do. 

But I dont even try doing?! why is it that I want to do something, yet I myself sabotage the effort in every step? 

I think, I feel tired, exhausted, in some cases bored, in somecases seek distraction actively thinking its to refresh myself. In my mind it seems like a solution at that moment, but its not. 

Break things down as small as possible, stay humble, accept the reality, take responsibility. 

Stop comparing myself with others, I am me, I need to figure out my way, do things my own way!!

1. Tried to get to work in morning, gave instructions to reportee (atleast did this). 

2. Had very low energy and exhausted. Took a long time eating breakfast. 

3. Even slept a bit in-between, could be the medication. 

4. What I was frustrated was that, I had issues (2 failures in regression), yet I had no energy to figure out what it is, I felt hopeless :(

5. This is sad. I should focus on the process, I have to break down to smaller actions, smaller thoughts, instead of comparing with others. Now why did the crash happen there? what does the assertion actually mean? what might have caused it? 

6. Its ok to not have answers, be humble, try to understand and figure out. "

Idk why I've been so slack about writing this sry. But yeh Saturday was generally a quiet day I didn't do much chilled around home watched more breaking bad and yeh that was pretty much my day drew a bit . Oh yeh and I went to dinner with some family and cousins "
851,"Doing this writing thing now for almost a month something I realized that I do too often is use the word “and” and over explain sentences. It seems so difficult to not include the word “and” when there is still more information that I’d like to say. The root of the problem I suspect is coming from my lack of understanding of when to use a comma, semi colon, and colon. Some rules I still remember from English class the first time. For example I know comma’s and colons are used for making lists. A semi colon is to express a complete thought and then some(maybe I don’t remember this one as well as I thought).

852,"Welp today I had a plan of fixing my diet and stopping my Roblox gambling addiction and I managed to fuck up both , one I have kinda no regrets because my mom made a absolute banger dinner chef's kiss. It's my fault for not getting up at all and at least attempting to workout or exercise.
I hate the feeling of being overly full of bloated but man did it happen to me way more than I can count throughout my life especially 2020, fuckin 2020, I hate 2020 worst year of my life anyway the today was not to overly stuff myself and to watch what I eat well needless to say my mom's cooking stopped this plan in it's track.

I'm not giving up yet, I'll try again tomorrow with even better plans and I won't stop till I succeed!!

854,"2025 January 19: Dear Diary,

Today I saw a post on Instagram about how leftist talking points are often ignored by the general public because they take too long to explain. The main issue is that the literacy rates in the United States are falling, leading to many Americans needing to read at a sixth grade level. Reflecting on this I am left embarrassed by how true this is. Education is something vital and because the right-wing can weaponize the dumbest people, the general population follows along in the bandwagon.  
  
I used to think I was terrible at reading. When I read it would take way too much focus for me to remember a paragraph I read. It is a skill I have been able to manage better, but knowing how many people can’t even read at my low skill level leaves me feeling sad for them. They will be stuck living miserable lives because they don’t have the education to realize the right-wing will always keep the wealthy oligarchs in power and leave them poor.  
  
There is certainly a responsibility on the left-wing to dumb down some of our talking points. It leaves me frustrated knowing this, but the general population genuinely cannot comprehend the talking points the left tries to make because the right will just lie about it in a simpler way to digest. Unity needs to prevail. Most people support left-wing ideals if they are not told they are left-wing. The opposition lies within fabrications of what the left actually stands for.  
  
Even as I write this I struggle to put what I am trying to say in the simplest terms. I genuinely care and want people to better their lives by supporting policies which will make that possible. As a writer I must learn to let go of my ego and convey my points in very simple terms for the general public. I also want to keep my regular writing for those with a higher reading level. At the end of the day, promoting education, creativity, and literacy are the most important things we can do as a society.  
  
Sincerely,  
  
Torinico"
855,"Soothing comes from everywhere.
I noticed my new piercing isn't so sore today.
I'm so proud of myself for going for it.
My friend left me a voice message just because.
I knew even just for those couple of moments, he was thinking of me.
I have a busy day with old and new faces.
This afternoon I'll spend time mothering.
Tomorrow I have a self care appointment.
I feel grateful."
856,"I don’t go to church services often, but I do every now and then. Growing up, my family never missed a Sunday. My brother hated it more than I did, but I actually appreciated the sense of community and tradition. 🕊️ Still, sitting through long Catholic Masses was *not* easy as a neurodivergent kid. Focusing for that long? Challenging to say the least.

Some of my happiest childhood memories happened at church, though. I made close friends there—one girl in particular became my closer friend during elementary and middle school. We’d spend socials in the church basement running around, playing tag, and jumping off stairs (to the absolute horror of adults). Those carefree moments were pure fun.

But things got harder during my teenage years. Being queer complicated my relationship with church, and a history of SAs made some of the purity culture in those settings, hard. I kept everything to myself, convincing myself it wasn’t worth mentioning. I’d tell myself, “It could’ve been worse,” or, “Just focus on liking guys since you like them too.” On top of that, I worried about gossip. Small communities—churches, towns, offices—can feel like breeding grounds for it. Maybe that’s just my paranoia, but the fear kept me silent.

Today, I wasn’t planning to attend a service, but I can be pretty impulsive. Seeing someone from church at a café brought back those mostly happy memories, so I decided to go. Life’s always a mix of good and bad, but I try to lean into  feelings of gratitude when I can.

Interestingly, I’ve realized I prefer megachurches over smaller congregations. There’s this line in *The Great Gatsby* about large parties being more intimate. That resonates with me. Smaller groups make me anxious, but in larger crowds, I can blend in if I want or find more options for socializing. It’s not for everyone, but it works for me.

The service today was nice. 😊 I even treated myself to a peppermint hot chocolate afterward, which felt like a little reward for, I don't know, leaving my house. Honestly, I think church can be a safer way to meet new friends—people who might share some of my guiding principles and understand certain struggles.

Lately, I’ve been taking small steps to improve my mental and physical health. I replaced my reusable water bottle (still pink, of course 🩷), started working out more, and I’m trying to keep my doors open—literally and metaphorically. For now, I’m focusing on myself before diving back into job hunting. I know I will soon, though. I’ve always been ambitious and driven when it comes to my financial goals, and I’m proud of that.

This week, I have a therapy session lined up and plan to schedule a psychiatric appointment soon. I try to remind myself to take life one step at a time. There’s always something to look forward to, and that’s what keeps me moving forward. I will probably book another spa appointment soon. And I need to get my hair done. But I was at the salon very recently, my favorite salon, so my hair looks better than ever, I just want to put one important finishing touch on it. I had to hack off a few inches because a certain beauty product damaged it. But live and learn, I'll never use it again and my hair tends to grow quickly because I take good care of it. I think I am good at taking care of myself and I agree with my family that I am much healthier, happier and safer than I used to be, which counts for a lot."
857,"I'd always wake up to you.
From the first moment of the first day of my week, you'd be there.
And it made me happy.
Now I wake up to nothing.
I am reminded that my life is so much poorer without you in it.
I am reminded that another week has passed without you in my life.
I function, I live, I enjoy myself.
All without you.
Mostly I'm absolutely fine.
But not today."
858,"was this the result you expected? for me to be miserable, and forever longing for you? i hope youre content with the outcome, for i will always regret everything i’ve ever said and done. i miss you, i always will. though we’ve had our wrongs, ill always forgive you. i don’t think i’ll ever recover from it. i miss you, why couldn’t you have just stayed? can you just pretend to love and care about me just a little bit.. i love you so much, did you know? but you don’t even deny it anymore when the words “i know you hate me” are said. i miss every single fiber of you, every goddamn second of this sick life i live. you treat me so different from everyone, and i’ve never felt more alienated in my life. i don’t why im like this either, i don’t know why i act and think the way i do, but i just wanted you to give me patience. i love you.. i’ll always keep my promise, and i’ll always love you, forever."
859,"2025 January 18: Dear Diary,

I finished reading Crime and Punishment yesterday and wrote a review of it today. I still need to read it over and then post it to my Goodreads account and maybe Reddit as well. The book left me pleasantly surprised in some aspects, but I ultimately did not like the messaging.  
  
Work was actually awesome today. I spoke with Jessica and another coworker who I’ll call Vanessa. The necklace I started wearing to work was actually a gift from Ed, which I mentioned.  
  
“Ed is cool,” Jessica said.  
  
“I feel like he’s a really chill person to talk to,” Vanessa said.  
  
“We always talk about spirituality,” I replied. “That’s why he got a crystal, although I don’t know which one it is. He doesn’t either. He got it at an antique store.”  
  
“That’s cool he got it for you though,” Vanessa responded.  
  
Then I started talking about how I needed a makeover to look more androgynous. Last year in January I wore nail polish, which is something I mentioned. The colour was in between black and red, kind of like a dark maroon.  
  
“I have that colour, but it’s just been sitting in my drawer. It was like one dollar. I can give it to you if you’d like,” Vanessa stated.  
  
“Sure, thank you so much!” I answered.  
  
We then spoke about our issues with insecurity. Letting go and not seeking validation from others is certainly something I need to do more of. I’m glad that I got to have such a conversation because I really just need to talk to more people. I really like being there for my friends too and just want to be someone people can come to if they need a person to talk to. I like having people to talk to as well.  
  
Sincerely,  
  
Torinico"
860,"I used to journal every day on a website that shut down years ago. I keep telling myself I’m going to get back into it. I even joined a few subreddits months ago but never actually posted anything. 

Today, however, I’m feeling really down and trapped. I’m visiting family after being unable to see them over the holidays thanks to the flu. 

I feel like I’m just too broken and anxious to ever find love again. I don’t think anyone will want me after all that I’ve been through. Why would they when they could find someone who doesn’t have the trauma I have? I’m so destroyed by what I went through last year, and even though it’s been 8 months of hard work, intensive therapies, joining new social groups, working on my business, and following my dreams, I just feel too vulnerable to ever be a worthwhile partner. 

I’ll be paranoid at the slightest sign of trouble. Or I’ll gaslight myself into thinking things aren’t really happening how I think they are because I *have* to be paranoid. There’s no way it’s my actual intuition and I’m right. The truth is, I doubt myself in everything I do. I am so hard on myself. I always think I could have done more in every aspect of my life because I strive to do my best. I know when I’ve done my best and I remind myself. I sit with the pain and sadness once I realize I did my best. I hold compassion for myself. I regroup, evaluate where I went wrong, plan ways to improve and grow. 

But I don’t get a break. It’s just one trial after another. I used to get breaks where I could come up for air and feel the warm of a beautiful day on my skin instead of peering up at it from a distance, submerged. Now I see the light out of arm’s reach, I float towards the surface thinking *finally, everything I have worked so hard for is coming to light* I feel my face as it emerges, but it’s only for a moment. Only long enough for me to take a shallow breath before I get shoved back into this dark, awful pool. Or worse, I’ll come up and take a full breath, feeling that familiar friend, Hope, as she lulls me out of my watery cage. Only for it to have been the absent calls of a siren. Not Hope at all. 

I really just want to love and be loved. I don’t know why it’s so hard. And now I’m at a point where I’ve tried dating people and opening myself back up. I feel like I’m cursed to never be truly loved. They just love for my looks, my talent, what I have to offer. My connections, my success. Not me. I have a handful of good friends, and I am grateful for them. So why not love? I’m tired of letting down my walls and getting closer to people only for them to not actually love me. I feel so tired. I’ve exhausted everything I can think of to get to a better place, but at the end of the day, I am tired of living my life alone with no one to share it with. I’m tired of giving people chances when they don’t respect or love me after all, but I don’t realize it until I’ve invested so much time and effort. And now that it’s happened several times, I feel like I’m too anxious to ever find love. I’m too scared. 

"
861,"I've been thinking a lot today mostly of the future and also of how to improve myself, but I also messed up today that kinda got my mind into shambles. I hone my art skill and learn animation and the best thing is, I have the materials for this but man I legit have been fighting my brain to get this shit done and it's mostly my fault because I can't help but play games first thing in the morning. I think that what throws me off and it's not even fun games just the repetitive kind but my brain is a dopamine fiend.

I need sleep because my brain is so fried rn I can't think. Today was a 4/10"
862,"What does it mean to feel lonely? Is it the absence of friends? Or maybe the lack of a partner?

I can’t quite put my finger on it, but I feel like something is missing in my life. I have family who care about me, and I have online friends to talk to, yet it still feels like there’s a void—like someone important isn’t there.

I crave the presence of someone I can physically be with, someone I can talk to face-to-face and share good times with. I’m not asking for a crowd of people or a million friends. I just want one truly good friend, someone I can feel completely at ease around.

Every day, I carry this heavy feeling in my stomach, like the anxiety I used to get as a kid when I knew I was about to get in trouble at school.

Maybe it’s more than loneliness. Maybe I feel stuck, like I’m treading water and not making progress, even though I have so much positivity and support around me.

I really hope this feeling passes soon.

"
863,"Yesterday I made it to my spa appointment. It was funny because the first time I tried to go to this spa I literally couldn't find it. It's smack in the middle of a creepy looking building with no signs. But this time, I was able to get a hold of the esthetician and she had to walk me into the building and into the spa. LOL. I get my lack of directional awareness from my mother but I don't mind it much. Everyone has flaws and this one is pretty much no harm no foul.

I really needed it to be honest. After attempting. After being let go again without explanation, from Amazon this time. After losing a family member to death, after a friendship fight, after a lot of things. But I got it and it did help. It was so soothing to have a full body exfoliating massage. I was butt naked on a heated massage bed.

She (the esthetician) was really nice, she told me she was on Zoloft like me, and she had a daughter diagnosed with ADHD like I am diagnosed with, and she herself had PTSD like me. So it felt good. And it did make me anxious... the concept of being touched while naked, after surviving my SAs. In fact I wanted to get my 50 mlg of hydroxyzine perscription but I was home alone before the appointment and mom and I decided it would be best to hide my meds after my attempt. For now. So I couldn't find it. But that was okay because I don't want to make a habit of relying on it and deep breathing and checking the facts and other skills work just as well.

It was a long appointment. I left around three and got home after eight pm. But that's to be expected when you book a full body massage and mani pedi, it's time consuming. The truth is I did have some intrusive flashbacks and paranoia while getting my massage. It's pretty understandable but nothing dramatic happened and I managed my anxiety well. I usually do after all. And it was fully safe and fully fun. So that makes me feel safe. That makes me feel more optimistic.

When it came out that I was abused at a daycare, a long time ago, my dad said to me ""we probably could have put more emphasis on good touch bad touch, I am sorry."" And that is probably true. I was not fully educated about consent or sex or that adults can be evil when I was a very young and vulnerable child. But live and learn, the early 00s were a different time. I have my therapy to process and heal from it. I really haven't thought about it in a while. Time's done its thing.

My hands are shaking lately. But they have ever sense I was a child and we think its a neurological tick that runs in my mom's side of the family. I don't mind it but I mind when someone else points it out and accuses me of being nervous because that is not always the case. I just have low blood pressure, often. And if it's a side effect of taking my medications as perscribed, so be it. I would never take matters into my own hands regarding my psychology, I have no qualifications or expertise for that so of course I am a good girl who always does self care and always documents her good behavior, so that killing me and framing it as a suicide would be impossible. Thank God. And if you read my history like my friends and family have, you would realize that, that fear of mine is entirely understandable.

My parents do not know about the reddit though. And they don't know about the letter to KR, as far as I know. But if I was asked about it on the Dr. Phil show I would confirm it. If I was asked about it in real life I would confirm it. I like being a honest person in real life. And if you ask my longterm friends and family, they will agree that I am a very direct, very honest girl. But my parents do know about every single one of my rapists. They know I was abused, they know about my weed seller, they know everything. I made sure they did. Because what happened in 2023 can never happen again and it never will.

But KR never wrote back so I think that's all fine and squared away LMFAO. And as far as the baiting goes, we all have our vices. And I don't really take risks. I don't go to bars alone. I don't solicit strangers for sex or weed and I never ever would even consider that. My ADHD presents more as restless energy and impulsivity then self destruction or endangering of the self. Although I did do that, in my past, but that's why I did my therapy programs. And everyone agrees I am much healthier and behaving much better. Live and learn. I was young. We all make mistakes.

I hope to go out this weekend. But I don't have to. I am refilling on weed today from my favorite local dispensary. I am excited because I got back in touch with an old friend too. I plan to go back to my workout routine in earnest. And leaving my bedroom door open and keeping my medicinals in my parent's room is definietly helping me make healthier choices and practice being accountable and refraining from self isolation in a safe, controlled environment. Mom is handling her broken arm well too. So, ultimately, all is well. Bible."

you were way beyond my standards, you were perfect. i loved you, there was never anything wrong with you, it was just me. i miss you everyday second, i wished to try again at least, and i really should've said sorry sooner."
866,"2025 January 17: Dear Diary,

Corporations are absolutely killing art and creativity. Looking at how YouTube looked back in 2007 and comparing it to how it looks now shows a drastic difference. Not only YouTube, but most things oozed with personality. Detail, which could be considered insignificant, was put into the designs of logos, commercials, and websites when I was young. I specifically remember the sense of wonder something as mundane as watching a commercial on television could spark.  
  
I don’t want to sound like a geezer or suggest everything was better back when I was a child, but creativity certainly was. Oligarchs rule over us and decide what gets popular and what doesn’t. Profit is the determining factor of what will be seen by the public, creativity be damned. Safety is prioritized over personality because that is what sells. Capitalism has taken the most divine essence of humanity and turned it into a commodity. General audiences gravitate more towards what is considered safe rather than what can spark wonder in a few.  
  
The oligarchs also want to pin the common person against one another. Division among sex, race, gender expression, and sexual orientation is specifically peddled by the rich. They know exactly who we all should be united against, but they can not allow that. Discouraging creativity is also something they want. How many times have you heard someone say being an artist is not a “real” job? If more people were creative, their system would crumble and they would not stand for that.  
  
We as a society need to band together with love, knowledge, and creativity. There are many stupid and lazy people in the world, but it’s not entirely their fault. They are preyed upon by having their primitive urges met so they will not strive to do better. They can be changed. I was once one of these stupid and lazy people myself, but I have been shown how the system operates. My hope is that more will see and unite in love. Stay creative, my friends.

869,"Day 3

\~Creep - Radiohead\~

Journaling to keep my thoughts in check. Another day of not being able to do anything much. You know just like those days you realized that just went without you knowing what you have actually done. Although I do know that my goals are pretty high I really tend to feel helpless and then anxious ending up wasting the day all over. I wish to reinstate the belief that I am going to take at least micro changes which would eventually end up into the direction where I should be going. Didn't really do much to break those patterns in my routine.

The good positive things that I did

* Meditated for 20 minutes
* Read 10 pages of a book
* Soaked Chia Seeds for my smoothie tomorrow

Yesterday night caught up with a friend ended up talking for 3 hours and sleeping at 3 am. Woke up at 10 and then was really drowsy most of the day and ended up sleeping 2 hours more. Ended up smoking 3 cigarettes here and there. I really don't know why must I not be able to get shit done throughout the day. 

Okay not a day to be very proud of. I want to believe that I will bounce back tomorrow. But the doubts they start to creep in during the night. I ought to fix myself soon now. Sending positive wishes and love to everyone"
870,"Day -2

So its not going as I thought it would. I thought I might be motivated to do something but I kind wasted my entire day yesterday. One thing I have realized is that probably my will power and discipline are a little messed up. I drank the Chia seeds pretty late yesterday and I didn't soak them again yesterday. 

But one positive thing that I can highlight is that I meditated for 40 mins yesterday and took out time to pray twice in the day. That felt good. I assured myself that if at all I am not studying or I feel like I am not able to do something productive then I will just promise myself to meditate atleast for the day. I used to meditate regularly but its on and off mostly now. I still feel confident that I can do it with ease and not struggle like someone who has never meditated at all. I really need spirituality and mindfulness in my life over the stimulation of mobile phones and social medial. I ended up studying a little for around 2 hours. So I think I should be a little happy that I tried to bounce back and not just sit and waste the entire day infront of me. 

Still most of the day I feel pretty fucked and tired. I feel lazy and I do feel like going for a smoke every now and then . I really dont know if I am making any substantial progress here and if I am making really small ones as compared to what I should be making.

Lets try to stay positive though right now and remember that its a long road , its a marathon!

Stay Safe

871,"I love my mom, through flame and frost,
Through every win and every loss.
I build her walls when they collapse,
Hold up her sky when it unmaps.

But still—
she does not choose me like I choose her.
Her love comes in pieces, sharp and slow,
wrapped in warmth but cold below.

She cuts me deep and calls it care,
says it’s best for me—but is it fair?
Soft words sink into my skin,
and bloom as doubt that grows within.

Yet I stay.
I stay when others turn away.
I pour myself into her cracks,
giving love she never asks.

When the world forgets her light,
I burn for her in darkest night.
But when I flicker, when I fall,
she does not see me there at all.

Still—
I hum the songs she used to sing,
patch the air with softer things.
Maybe one day, she’ll understand
this love I give was never planned.

It was built—
slow and steady, bone and breath,
a love that bends but fears no death."
872,I just want to appreciate you for being patient with me. I make myself upset many times and make you sad all because of my own assumptions and pushing too hard the things I want for myself not knowing your side too. I may have said things that may still be painful to remember.And Im sorry. I know I’m very expressive in words. Maybe I can be more of myself In words for the reason where I don’t feel the need to be conscious of how I say it… or more be pretentious of saying words that really don’t mean much. I know the things I have done before can’t be erased. But I hope every single time I’m trying can make it better. Thank you for being there. 
873,"2025 January 16: Dear Diary,

I went to the movie theatre with my dad tonight. It’s kind of unusual to go into a movie theatre with a pen and paper, but if I want to pay more attention to the media I consume, that is what I must do. We saw the new Nosferatu movie and I thought it was spectacular. My dad liked the special effects and I was paying more attention to the themes.  
  
I feel there were feminist themes in the movies. It seemed to me that the film was commenting on how poorly women are treated in society. I’m not sure if I pulled this interpretation out of nowhere or if that is what the filmmakers were genuinely trying to convey, but it is what I picked up on. I will probably write a review going over my interpretation of the movie in greater detail, but I am not certain if I will.  
  
Reviewing media is something I want to do more of. With each book I read this year, I intend to do a review of it no matter if I feel it is a valid interpretation or not. Certainly, I need to get over my paranoia of people reacting negatively to me and just express myself.

My mom and brother took me out to eat and then we got to explore this giant mall we rarely go to and it was really fun, I went to this soap store and got good smelling lemon based soap lol. Then we just explored a bunch of places bought a lil stuff and had fun! 

Wow I'm an adult now noice, lol who am I kidding gonna be some busy days coming my way aka a Job lmfao but I've come prepared. I'm so freaking ready for my driving license man jeez.
Anyway today was 10/10"
875,1/16/25 One of the most demoralizing feeling is knowing that you are attractive enough that you can get away with somethings some days but ugly enough on other days that people won’t even treat you like you’re there. It’s one of the things that truly does make me bitter the more I become stylish and fitter. It’s effected how I date because I can’t get out of my mind that the person I was before deserved the love that I get now and you are only sitting in front of me because of the changes. This is incredibly frustrating. 
876,"1/16/2025 (spent half of the day thinking it was the 15th)



So, first thing I did is rush a lot to get there, in the car drove over some potholes and I swear it's gonna break any day now. I dunno why tf they haven't filled them for like the whole damn week wth.  
1st period is normal, except I hate when by bestie's absent cause I always sit next to her and she's pretty much the person I talk to the most. 2nd was the same, except we got a new seating chart, and since 2nd counts absents she was marked absent for the day (she usually skips 1st period to get some sleep but can't afford any more absences since she gets sick really often and I honestly have no idea how many more she has left). 3rd, she finally arrived (we have a seating chart there too, so I was pretty much kept to myself and didn't notice she was there the first 5 minutes.) played some mid-term themed jeapordy, yeahhh, i hate math. 4th is physics, pop quiz, but he's chill so we can use our notes, etc. aced it pretty much, easily. 5th period's med term, my elective (yeah pe's also an elective but i didnt choose it cause we only get one this year, next year we'll get to choose between morning and afternoon electives, id prolly do afternoon to get more sleep..) it's honestly my favorite, we just grabbed some chromebooks (yeah we use paper pretty much, sucks to not be using chromebooks the rest of the time.) and worked on our projects, I'm doing FOP, halfway done so far. 7th period is lunch if you call it a period at all, fell down the fucking stairs, yowch. the janitor looked at me and i feel bad for him cause he was just so shocked when he asked if I was okay, I was, just got up and walked back to lunch (hurt my ass/tailbone and brused my leg and arm, ew pain!!), one of my friends saw me lmao it was so funny imo. 8th we didn't really do much. some sillies wanted some paper fsr, pretty much all the socializing i did then. talked to bestie the entire time, doodled, random shit. went by fast, we got some homework (EW!!!). then we have econ, did more jeapordy (my math teacher teaches our econ as well). last period is chem, honestly did the same thing as history and just chilled and doodled with my bestie. reason im not interacting and am still an ambivert?? social anxiety, my friend. touche."
877,"Graduated high school in 2015. Have absolutely zero desire unlike some people my age to be zapped back in time to relive those days. They weren’t super awful but life as an adult suits me better than the rigid schedule and rituals of being a teenager. That’s why it felt odd to have a dream about being in high school again today.

I’m in a class room and it’s filled with the actual people from my graduating class but they aren’t the people I usually talk to or the people I really disliked. These were the people who were just like there, the same way in a video game where characters get made to be in the background. I talked we talked but there wasn’t any sound just a lot of smiling and expressions. It felt really good to have these interactions even if it didn’t lead to anything. 

I wonder what this dream meant. 

Written on 1/16/25 for baybay xo lol"
878,"Things to do:
1. Start off with simple affirmations. 
2. Keep the mind positive. 
3. Listen to good songs, that inspire. 
4. No caffeine.
5. Workout. 
6. Do pending tasks like investment proof, mobility, insurance etc. All together should take max 1.5 hours. 
7. No fucking touching the mobile, I will cut your hands.

update--
1. it was a hard day, I couldn't do anything I thought, I was sick physically exhausted, had to get bike to mechanic, din't feel like doing anything. total failure, other than the fact that I din't drink caffeine or jerk off, or wasn't a jerk to wife. 

Sleeping late again. with my tasks still pending. 

Say what you want about distractions, social media, youtube, porn etc. Its does a good job of distracting, giving temporary peace, taking attention away from the bothering things. "
879,"1. Started off the day bad. I slept late day before yesterday, so wokeup late and grumpy and after dropping kid to school slept again. 
2. Till afternoon I dint want to work, was very grumpy. 
3. I fixed errors with feedthrough handling and ran experiments. It's just that I don't stay focused during compilation.
4. Lot of distractions inbetween. 
5. I also tried to look at other old crash and also realised the previous issue is still open, so tried some mast ditch effort before meeting. 
6. Well if I see another way, I started off my day very late then I did good I feel. 
7. I don't want to stay on my phone, it is not a solution, it makes me feel more burnt out, I would rather sit idle staring a wall, but I am not able to. 
8. I will change my sitting position from tomorrow. 
9. There is a lot of sexual feelings in head, could be ashwagandha. 
10. Then again tonight I stayed up late, watching shows. 
11. I don't seem to understand consequences of my actions. 
12. Am I that stupid."

881,"So I am a 13 yr old dancer and my knees have been hurting and my teacher told me to go to the doctor, but my mom said that my knees hurt because ""they are carrying extra weight"" so she said I shouldn't eat any carbs or sugar. like ok but ur not a doctor. so now I can't have anything like bread, small candies, muffins, and pretty much anything enjoyable. l know meat is delicious, but I don't always want that. and she told me I needed to lose weight and now I am just extremely self conscious about my weight how fat I look. and usually when I have a break in rehearsals for dance on Saturdays, my dad gets me Chick-Fil-A, but my mom won't let me have it now. I am super annoyed about this, especially because she has basically told me I am fat (not just this time, multiple times.) But I know I am not fat. like my sister said I look like a pencil. and there has been a lot I've been dealing with at the moment and putting myself on a diet I have to add on top? and most of the things on the diet that I eat before I go to dance do not fill me up and I need it to because I would be doing really strenuous excersise for like 4 hours. so am I stupid or should my mom not be putting me on a diet and just take me to a doctor?"
882,"When I read history before, I always felt that history was a compulsory course for everyone. Through war, we learned to be grateful, and be grateful for everything we can get now. Through gratitude, we harvest beauty, and countless kind people have created today's beautiful today.

Later, when I looked back at history, I found that history was often useless. Many times, I felt that the world might become better without history, at least everyone would not be trapped by history when moving forward.

Everyone likes to beautify themselves, beautify the present, and praise the future. But time always passes quickly, and many things are over once they start. Without free will, human existence seems meaningless.

After so many years, I finally understand. Where does history come from, and where does gratitude come from. Whoever has money and power writes history, and those who fail don't even have a name.

Now I have gradually forgotten history. It turns out that being alive is the most beautiful thing."
883,"Wowy I'm still alive, no cancer no diabetes and no social life but besides all that wow I'm still alive lol. 
Honestly I expected I'd be in a better place back when I was 15 but nah still depressed lil bro, but hey I like to think I matured a lot since then.
Too bad I wasted my highschool years, I'll probably regret that for the rest of my life but it's fine plus it was only like 2.5% of my life but I digress. With me being 18 I hope I can actually start turn my life around but first I gotta get some therapy because ngl I'm pretty fucked up mentally, honestly I don't know what going on around in my head.

Wow 18 huh , times like this I'm glad I never liked the idea of killing myself.. kinda weirds me out even typing it mostly gotta thank my mom for that, she is the best and jeez I don't deserve to have a mom like her. She supports me at everything I do and all she wants is the best for me but man Im a legit failure...

BUT I haven't given up I want to keep trying to be the son she can be proud of and once I make it, I promise she'll be the first person I'll ever retire 🙏🏻 I love you mom.

So 18 years old 2025, I'm going to do my best I promise!

884,"2025 January 15: Dear Diary,

I’ve noticeably become more paranoid recently. I get strange premonitions that people are talking behind my back and that people who I think love me actually hate me. Then the opposite happens where I get delusions of grandeur where I believe myself to be more intelligent than I actually am.  
  
What is strange is that I know both of these are delusions, but at the moment I am having them they feel real. Taking a step back to allow myself to breathe really helps me. Detaching and letting go are tools I need to utilize for my inner peace. It does not matter if everyone on Earth hates me or loves me, only if I love or hate myself. I am choosing to love myself as I am the only person I know for a fact can love me. Comparing myself will do no good. My friends really do love me and I am forever grateful for them. It can be very scary when the thought they actually hate me enters my mind, but I think it is the universe telling me I need to detach and it is ok if they really did hate me because I have myself.

Dear Diary,

Last night, I had the most intense dream. It started with me standing in a tropical rainforest, surrounded by waterfalls, lush greenery, and... a mysterious figure holding a giant bucket of water. Before I knew it, they dumped the entire bucket on me—soaking me head to toe! Apparently, my subconscious decided to turn my dream into a surprise waterpark adventure.

But it didn’t stop there. Suddenly, I was surfing on a wave that came out of nowhere (and trust me, I have no business being on a surfboard). Just when I thought I was about to wipe out, a dolphin popped up and gave me a high five with its fin. That’s when I woke up—drenched in sweat.

So, was it a dream or my body telling me to finally fix the AC? Either way, I think I’ll keep a towel by my bed tonight... just in case.

Yours,
The accidental aquatic adventurer

886,"I am not ready to die yet. I don’t want to die yet.

I am trying to manifest good news. News that there is an identifiable and operable reason for my body to be all out of whack.

No matter how much time I have left, things are better since I started being firm on my boundaries. Things that would have been asked of me are “nevermind” after the request gets half out.

It is not as restful and healing as I know it could or will be. I am going to focus on me, and healing, and accepting that someone is more than likely going to figure this out.

I want a good future living my best life with my kids. It is sad, but I need to live a peaceful and happy life. I need to show my kids what good is like. My daughter didn’t even see why I would be doing this, which tells me I DEFINITELY need to do this. She should know when someone else treats someone unacceptably. 

I told my daughter that I would probably not move in with anyone I haven’t already known for a minimum of 5-10 years. I cannot do this to my kids again. I’m so happy to have both of my kids, but I am so sad I have been sick and I just convinced myself that there was something wrong with me - depression, or needing to push through.

Whatever. I just saw a post about how when women get sick, sometimes men enhance their own life at the cost of women’s longevity. I am not letting that happen. I am scared to be alone, sure, but also I have a way to protect myself now and I am on my way to getting better (if possible)

Whether I have 60 years or less, what I can do is take steps to enjoy my life now. And I must begin to put myself first. Starting with cuddling the fuck out of this giant plushie until I fall asleep."

888,"Everything just is what it is. I’ve been so overwhelmed going through my abundance of crap to get rid of. And it’s only the beginning. 

Declutter and detachment. That is where I am putting my attention and what I am practicing.

At night I think about what I have to do, in order to detach. I need to stop reaching out. I need to stop thinking of him as a friend to me. I need to not go to him for advice or an ear to listen. I need to not care about how he is doing in his sports and hobbies. I need to keep my distance and give him the space he once requested from me. 

This is the hardest goodbye I’ve ever had to do. This is the end of an entire era of my life. I’m so scared but I know I have to do it, for me. 

I have to take this detachment seriously. Because if I don’t, when I say my last hello and my final goodbye, it will kill me even more. 

I’m considering getting a second job. So I can save up more money for my journey into my next chapter. And to keep myself occupied, to stop thinking about the pain I constantly endure about my current job/life. 

This all just sucks. Crazy to think in a year, everything will be completely new and different for me. I meant it when I said the only person/thing worth staying in this city for me, is him and only him. When I leave, I will thank him for giving the extra nudge to go. And I will thank him for showing me a stronger, healthier version of myself. I needed him to show me that, in order to be successful in my next chapter. Damn, it will actually be an entirely new book. He taught me many lessons. And I hope he can see the lessons I was sent into his life, to teach him. 

I love him and I will always have love for him. He will forever have a place in my heart. But that’s the only place. It’s better for the both of us that I go. I will embark on a new life. He won’t have to worry about me anymore and embark on his happily after.

889,"Hello Friends, 

These last few days have felt like a breath of fresh air. 🌸 I’ve been letting myself be a little indulgent lately—but honestly? I think I deserve it. Surviving my attempt and choosing to embrace radical authenticity has been *hard,* but it’s also been so worth it. And it's a sign of progress because historically I try to hide my problems and manage them independently, so asking for help genuinely was brave of me.  

I went on a mini arcade date with a new friend (okay, crush 😅). We spent hours chatting in the arcade restaurant, and I swear, I could listen to him talk forever. He’s so sweet, smart, funny, and just… interesting. We played games too, and I really got into the VR ones (they’re so immersive—have you tried them?!).

I did let myself get a little tipsy—like halfway to drunk—but I made sure I was in a safe environment, with no shady characters around, and I already planned to Uber home. No regrets there. For me, extremism doesn’t work. I’ve learned to practice harm reduction instead of trying to quit cold turkey and spiraling later. I only drink socially now (never alone), and I’m really mindful of how substances, like my use of legally purchased, pure dispensary weed, interact with my meds, thanks to the ongoing dialogue with my amazing, Ivy League-educated psychiatrist.

In other news, I got offered a part-time editor job! It’s an hour commute, so I’m not 100% sold yet, but it could be a great way to bring in some cash and structure—and maybe even network.

On the mental health front, I’m finally admitting to myself just how fragile I feel right now. Acknowledging that I’m dealing with severe CPTSD at 25 feels huge. It’s not easy, but it’s a step in the right direction. I’m looking for a local women-only PTSD-focused group therapy, and my therapist sent me so many resources to explore.

As for today, I tackled some chores and treated myself to extra snacks to dodge a hangover (it worked 🎉). I’ve got my Starbucks now, and I’m leaning into some intentional healing. I feel an urge to do some age regression (it’s so comforting for me), so I’m curling up with cozy movies for the rest of the day. Maybe I will throw on my cat ears headband, heehee. 

P.S. I kind of wanted to go home with my new friend last night, but he had work today, and honestly, it’s probably for the best that we didn’t. There will be other times. 😊

Thanks for reading, y’all. Life’s not perfect, but I feel like I’m moving in the right direction, slowly but surely. 💕"

Trying to break the negative patterns 

I have been feeling low most of the time . Now when I analyze what is going on during the day I find a lot of things that I wish I wouldn't do or probably do in regulation. I am no saint if you see my routine, to be fair my routing is fucked. Sleep timings are odd for no reason, I do give in to my cravings of Nicotine and alcohol, indulging in PMO more nowadays, Binge watching series, spending a lot of time on reddit, not working towards my goal. etc

Obviously I imagine that I can turn this exactly around one day. Although I know it can happen but that one day seems far off. Lets have a newer approach this time. Break this habits one by one.  From tomorrow I will try to break at least one of these habits. Even if I break a small or micro change I am going to be very happy and appreciative of myself.

Typing thoughts instead of writing them has actually been very helpful for me. Putting my thoughts into words is not something I  thought I would like. If I can make a change like this then I can do more changes. I am sure I will see the progress in myself.

892,"2025 January 14: Dear Diary,

Despite my mom claiming to not like dark art she is invested in TV shows with macabre elements. Recently she finished Dexter and as she was describing it to me I told her how similar it sounded to Death Note. We started watching it together; I need to explain certain things to her, but she seems to be enjoying it so far. She doesn’t like the character design of Ryuk the Shinigami, but other than that she has been going along fine. We have managed to watch ten episodes so far.  
  
Besides watching the show we also went to the craft store today. She spent about an hour and a half wandering around. By that time I had already circled the entire store three times and decided to go to the grocery store next door. I bought some baklava and ate it while waiting outside the store for my mom to finish shopping.  
  
It was kind of a lazy day, but I don’t feel too bad about it. I know I am getting myself pumped up to finish self-editing my novella and then send it to a real editor. I already have an idea for my next story lined up and this time I’m actually excited to write it. I need to start treating things that are urgent less seriously. If I treat getting my writing done as urgently as it is, it will either never be completed or I’d be stressed to the point of a heart attack doing it. These entries don’t feel as urgent to me, which is why I have no problem writing them. Hopefully they’ll be worth reading sometime soon.
