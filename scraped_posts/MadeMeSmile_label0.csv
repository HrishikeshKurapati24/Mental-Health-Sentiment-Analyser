After the BBQ I saw him sitting deflated by an unused desk looking sad so I wrote ""Feed me"" on a sheet of paper and put it in front of him. A few days later someone cut up a post it note and wrote grass on it, someone else took a blue post it and wrote water.

Now Billy has a whole array of food from a picture of a sock to a decorative fall basket. He's doing very well.

On September 19, 2000, during the men's 100m freestyle heats, both his competitors false-started, leaving him to swim alone. He finished with a time of 1:52.72-the slowest in Olympic history-but set a personal best and a national record!

Cheered on by over 17,000 spectators, his perseverance made him a symbol of the Olympic spirit and highlighted the challenges faced by athletes from developing nations. Since then, he has become head coach of Equatorial Guinea's national swim team, working to grow the sport in his country.

got a few heart emojis etc to my post, then an hour later got the message I attached from one of the guys who is overseas. i know it could just be a thank you and nothing more, but it still hit me.

it's not much i know, compared to other posts here, but even the smallest actions can bring happiness.

for context this was the message i put out to the team:


[üëãüèº] ¬†hey everyone, kind of a different message from me but one i did want to share. ¬† 
it's got a bit of a backstory/context and then my actual message. ¬† 
as some of you know, and some of you heard me allude to in a previous session, i said i'd had a lot of struggles outside of work the past few years. namely being caring for my dad who was struggling with mental and physical health for a number of years, up until he passed away this time last year. ¬†

i tried to shoulder a lot of the stress and mental effect it had on me, not wanting to burden others or feeling like talking about it wouldn't make a difference. ¬† it did, and still has an impact on my mental health, it has made me look at things differently. ¬†
my wife still asks at times now if i feel ok as shes concerned i might be holding things in rather than talking. ¬† 

so, to my point ¬† 9-15th of june is mens health week, and one often overlooked area is mens mental health. ¬†one of the statistics i saw is that 525,000 men a year commit suicide, that's 1400 every day. ¬†and the stigma around men showing emotion is still present today (albeit less than years ago). ¬† 
if you feel like you're struggling with anything, i think there are still the [internal team] within the business who are here to listen and point you in the right direction, but also look at help available outside of work. ¬†
dont feel ashamed, afraid or worried about being vulnerable, feeling weak, asking for help, or even crying. ¬† i know from experience that although people try their best not to bring their personal issues in to work, they're still on your mind, life still happens while you're at work.¬† 
i'm not going to say do this or try that, as it affects everyone differently but just hope that if you are feeling your mental health is struggling that this message will give you the gentle nudge to not ignore it. "
85,0,"A few months ago, I reached out to my old professor, thanking him for the compassion he showed me when I didn‚Äôt deserve anything from him. I was always a straight-A student, excelling in all my classes, but I was in an abusive relationship that had gotten to a point where I was too scared to leave my dorm room for days at a time. My grades slipped, and I no longer was able to attend my classes because my ex was stalking me. I was in the process of obtaining a restraining order against him, but I had been isolated from my friends and went through the process alone, leaving my mental health hanging on my a thread.

This was my favorite class, so I tried my best to get there, but when I showed up one day with red eyes and an apology ready for being missing for two weeks, my professor pulled me outside and gave me the first hug I‚Äôd had in weeks. I opened up to him about what I had been going through, and he listened when I felt like I had no one else. He sent me home and told me I was more important than my grades, to call him if I needed help, and that I could make up my work online.

I ended up dropping out of college because what I had endured there made it no longer a safe space for me. Feeling like a failure, I fully expected to fail this class, but he gave me an A. I didn‚Äôt even take the final. This professor who I barely knew was my lifeline that year.

His classmates consisted of 11 kids, all ranging from pre-k to 4th grade.

It‚Äôs been a really REALLY rough school year. More than half the high schoolers dropped out right before school started, which means they had to refund all the tuition money back to the parents. They had hired a new principal and had to let him go because they had no funds and had ONE teacher all year plus some volunteers. Like I said, it was rough.

But today, was a good day.

Today was graduation day, so all the pre-k and kindergartners did their walk and they gave out academic awards.

This is the one my son got.

His teacher stood there and explained he got this award for being kind and compassionate and caring all school year. And this was something his classmates voted on! This wasn‚Äôt his teacher picking this award for him, his classmates voted!

I am so so proud of him!! I was in tears. Because not only am I so proud of him for being a kind human being, but it was also validation that I am doing a good job so far in raising a kind human being.

A few months ago, I was in a rough place mentally, and my fiancee surprised me with this little guy. I didn‚Äôt think much of it at first, but he quickly became a part of everything I do.

He sits with me when I work, makes little noises when the room gets too quiet, and somehow always knows when I need a mood lift.

Now, I can‚Äôt imagine a day without him. He doesn‚Äôt talk much,but he‚Äôs said more to my heart than most people ever could.

Do any of you have a pet that ended up helping you more than you expected?"
99,0,"I (24f) live with my cousin (30m). I have three cats (one adult cat and two 12 week kittens), and whenever I am home he will be ‚Äúmean‚Äù to them in a very joking and lighthearted way. He‚Äôll call them names (fatss, dumbss, etc.) but it‚Äôs in that ‚Äúbullying as a love language‚Äù type way and I have never been afraid of him actually mistreating my cats, especially because they clearly adore him. He plays and rough houses with them, he pets them, but he never gets all lovey dovey the way I do with them‚Ä¶. Or so I thought.

I live in a two story townhouse with my bedroom being on the second floor and I always keep my door open so that the cats can go in and out. Yesterday morning I had woken up but not gotten out of bed yet and my two kittens were playing on the landing just outside my bedroom door.

I hear my cousin start to walk up the stairs and I stayed as quiet as possible. I knew he thought I wasn‚Äôt home because when I am home he always calls up to me to ask if he can come up (I have given him permission to go in my room when I‚Äôm not home to play with my cats).

My door was cracked open about a foot and I see his arm reach, he says ‚ÄúScoop!‚Äù And grabs a kitten. Then I hear about a minute straight of kissy sounds and baby talk.

I‚Äôm just quietly watching from my bed, trying not to let out a giggle, when he suddenly stops, slow turns, and makes stunned eye contact with me through the crack in my door. When he realized I saw/heard the whole thing he got embarrassed and said ‚Äúoh‚Ä¶ I uh.. I saw them running around up here and thought I‚Äôd come play with them.‚Äù

I laughed and said it was totally fine, but he retreated back downstairs to put his tough guy persona back on.

The photo above is one he just sent me having a cuddle session with baby George

Tl;dr: my male roommate pretends to be indifferent about my cats, but secretly baby talks and loves on them when I‚Äôm not around"

101,0,"When I was in high school, an ex had my childhood teddy bear (cleverly named ‚ÄúBear‚Äù as a peak example of toddler creativity) at their house when we broke up. Instead of returning him, they threw him in the trash. I was heartbroken to lose the teddy bear that I had slept with every night since toddlerhood. It‚Äôs been over 20 years since he was thrown out, and as silly as it seems, I never really could move past losing him. I have looked for a replacement over the years, but could never find him. After seeing people find replacement childhood toys and blankets on Reddit, I decided to look again recently. I finally figured out his brand, and found one on eBay! I know he‚Äôs not my original, but that face still makes me smile. Welcome home, Bear. üêª ‚ù§Ô∏è "

I assumed it was just for Christmas, but I've been getting them steadily, most recent was this week. 

At this point, I've gotten probably $1,000 in gift cards, all for groceries. 

Whoever is doing it does not want me to know it's them. 

I am really grateful - it has helped so much.

141,0,"Full article at Washington Post. Here's an excerpt:

Merryman‚Äôs quest began in 2008, he said, while on a lunch break at Lockheed Martin. He likes to get outside for lunch, so he walked along Deep Run, a creek behind his office in Hanover. Merryman had already started doing cleanups with the Patapsco Heritage Greenway, but this day, in particular, felt like an epiphany.

‚ÄúI saw a washing machine, then I saw a motorcycle chassis ‚Äî all kinds of stuff. It looked like people had been dumping there for decades,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI thought, ‚ÄòSomeone has to clean this stuff up.‚Äô‚Äù

The dump behind Merryman‚Äôs office nagged him, and the second time he visited, he saw more trash but also spotted a bald eagle, his first in Maryland. He‚Äôs not saying the bird spoke to him that day, but it felt like something did.

‚ÄúThat time I thought, ‚ÄòWell I‚Äôll be the one to clean it up then,‚Äô‚Äù he recalled.

Merryman had the trash bug before that epiphany, McMillion said. She saw how a submerged shopping cart, mired in muck in Catonsville‚Äôs Bull Run, became a white whale for him.

‚ÄúI had college kids trying to get this thing out, and they couldn‚Äôt do it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe spent a lot of time on it. He was obsessed.‚Äù

Merryman defeated the shopping cart, of course, she said, explaining there was one year when Merryman was responsible for 60 percent of her organization‚Äôs trash cleanup totals.

142,0,"My son made a map in the hospital. I decided to turn it into a short D&D adventure we could play during visiting hours.

He told me someone dammed a river and now this house was slowly flooding‚Äîso in the game I made a group of mischievous fish monsters responsible (they're trying to flood the house and take it as their own). He really liked it!

It‚Äôs a small thing, but being able to turn his imagination into something playable helped both of us feel a little more normal in a hard place."
143,0,"I was having a really tough day today, but then I opened a message from this incredibly kind person and it completely turned things around. The compliments they gave me were so thoughtful and uplifting; I‚Äôve honestly never received anything like that before. It gave my self-image such a huge boost.

We truly need more people like this in the world kindness like that can make such a difference. Even when it‚Äôs about something external, kind words can have a powerful impact.

I don‚Äôt base my worth on what others think of me, but right now, this made me smile in a way I haven‚Äôt all day. I‚Äôm not even feeling down anymore. Thank you so much, u/TutuBunBun. üíõ
