7,0,"So we had a plant barbecue the other day and someone brought in an inflatable goat they won as a prize at a bar. Everyone took pictures with him and named him Billy.

After the BBQ I saw him sitting deflated by an unused desk looking sad so I wrote ""Feed me"" on a sheet of paper and put it in front of him. A few days later someone cut up a post it note and wrote grass on it, someone else took a blue post it and wrote water.

Now Billy has a whole array of food from a picture of a sock to a decorative fall basket. He's doing very well.

There were times I didn’t feel safe being myself, times I felt like I had to water down who I was just to be tolerated. I’ve been hurt by people who were supposed to love me, made to feel like I was too much or not enough.

But this Pride… it felt different.
I felt seen. I felt like I belonged. For once, I didn’t feel like I had to explain myself. I could just exist, and that was more than enough.

I smiled so much my cheeks hurt. I danced. I connected with strangers who felt like family. I felt joy without guilt.

And that meant everything.

It reminded me I’ve come a long way. I’m still healing, still figuring it all out…but I’m here. I made it. And I’m proud of that.

34,0,"Eric Moussambani Malonga, known as ""Eric the Eel,"" became an Olympic sensation at the 2000 Sydney Games-not for speed, but for his determination. Representing Equatorial Guinea, he had never seen an Olympic-sized pool before and had trained alone in a small hotel pool for just eight months.

On September 19, 2000, during the men's 100m freestyle heats, both his competitors false-started, leaving him to swim alone. He finished with a time of 1:52.72-the slowest in Olympic history-but set a personal best and a national record!

Cheered on by over 17,000 spectators, his perseverance made him a symbol of the Olympic spirit and highlighted the challenges faced by athletes from developing nations. Since then, he has become head coach of Equatorial Guinea's national swim team, working to grow the sport in his country.

I stayed the night at her house last night, and she brought out this 18”x24” Lisa Frank sticker book for my kiddo to play with while we were chatting. I saw it and thought it was so cool, even said so. She says, “then take it home!” 

It was originally purchased for the two 5-year-old grandchildren, so I refused until she told me she had two more. Then I happily accepted and spent 2 hours when I got home covering my phone case, journal, and water tumbler in stickers.

At first, he started on the first page and felt uninspired. I told him to flip through and find an image that spoke to him. Next, he started sesrching online for pictures to inspire him. I told him don't worry about that, you do you. Pick the colours that speak to you, who cares if it's not natural, who cares if it's wonky. Just have fun with it.

For context. My son is 12 years old and was diagnosed with high functioning autism at around 3. He has always struggled with communication, conversation, and verbal comprehension and we were lead to believe that he would most likely never be able to read, do math, or live a basic standard life. 

He has always EXCELLED in building games like Minecraft (he’s crazy good at this). Well we swapped to homeschooling after public school failed him as they told us “he can catch a ball and he looks normal so we can’t give him a 1-1 aide and he must be in a normal classroom”.

Yes those motherf***s said HE LOOKS NORMAL and are lucky they left the room with teeth still in their mouths.

Anyways! My wife was finally able to teach him to read! He loves the logic of using exclamation marks and question marks 😊 and this new skill has caused him to want to venture into different puzzle games, such as Stray.

I get so caught up in being a perfectionist, that despite my grade I felt like I had failed myself to be honest. But you know what? My sister reminded me of something, four years ago after high school, I failed this same class, with a 27%-F, and my professor dropped me from the class herself out of pity because there was no way she saw me passing, she let me know that in an email. I changed my major to art, and got two AA’s in that because I didn’t think I had what it takes to be an engineering student. After a meaningful journey of learning about myself, I went back to being an engineering student, absolutely terrified. Now, I didn’t earn A, sure. I lost my 4.0 for one semester, sure. But now im still crying, but tears of joy, because I passed with a B, all on my own, using tutors, and never once cheating.

got a few heart emojis etc to my post, then an hour later got the message I attached from one of the guys who is overseas. i know it could just be a thank you and nothing more, but it still hit me.

it's not much i know, compared to other posts here, but even the smallest actions can bring happiness.

for context this was the message i put out to the team:


[👋🏼]  hey everyone, kind of a different message from me but one i did want to share.   
it's got a bit of a backstory/context and then my actual message.   
as some of you know, and some of you heard me allude to in a previous session, i said i'd had a lot of struggles outside of work the past few years. namely being caring for my dad who was struggling with mental and physical health for a number of years, up until he passed away this time last year.  

i tried to shoulder a lot of the stress and mental effect it had on me, not wanting to burden others or feeling like talking about it wouldn't make a difference.   it did, and still has an impact on my mental health, it has made me look at things differently.  
my wife still asks at times now if i feel ok as shes concerned i might be holding things in rather than talking.   

so, to my point   9-15th of june is mens health week, and one often overlooked area is mens mental health.  one of the statistics i saw is that 525,000 men a year commit suicide, that's 1400 every day.  and the stigma around men showing emotion is still present today (albeit less than years ago).   
if you feel like you're struggling with anything, i think there are still the [internal team] within the business who are here to listen and point you in the right direction, but also look at help available outside of work.  
dont feel ashamed, afraid or worried about being vulnerable, feeling weak, asking for help, or even crying.   i know from experience that although people try their best not to bring their personal issues in to work, they're still on your mind, life still happens while you're at work.  
i'm not going to say do this or try that, as it affects everyone differently but just hope that if you are feeling your mental health is struggling that this message will give you the gentle nudge to not ignore it. "
85,0,"A few months ago, I reached out to my old professor, thanking him for the compassion he showed me when I didn’t deserve anything from him. I was always a straight-A student, excelling in all my classes, but I was in an abusive relationship that had gotten to a point where I was too scared to leave my dorm room for days at a time. My grades slipped, and I no longer was able to attend my classes because my ex was stalking me. I was in the process of obtaining a restraining order against him, but I had been isolated from my friends and went through the process alone, leaving my mental health hanging on my a thread.

This was my favorite class, so I tried my best to get there, but when I showed up one day with red eyes and an apology ready for being missing for two weeks, my professor pulled me outside and gave me the first hug I’d had in weeks. I opened up to him about what I had been going through, and he listened when I felt like I had no one else. He sent me home and told me I was more important than my grades, to call him if I needed help, and that I could make up my work online.

I ended up dropping out of college because what I had endured there made it no longer a safe space for me. Feeling like a failure, I fully expected to fail this class, but he gave me an A. I didn’t even take the final. This professor who I barely knew was my lifeline that year.

My son goes to a tiny Christian school, like TINY.

His classmates consisted of 11 kids, all ranging from pre-k to 4th grade.

It’s been a really REALLY rough school year. More than half the high schoolers dropped out right before school started, which means they had to refund all the tuition money back to the parents. They had hired a new principal and had to let him go because they had no funds and had ONE teacher all year plus some volunteers. Like I said, it was rough.

But today, was a good day.

Today was graduation day, so all the pre-k and kindergartners did their walk and they gave out academic awards.

This is the one my son got.

His teacher stood there and explained he got this award for being kind and compassionate and caring all school year. And this was something his classmates voted on! This wasn’t his teacher picking this award for him, his classmates voted!

I am so so proud of him!! I was in tears. Because not only am I so proud of him for being a kind human being, but it was also validation that I am doing a good job so far in raising a kind human being.

Yes, he’s only 7, and has a lot to learn in life, but this is a great start. ❤️"

He’ll call them names (fatss, dumbss, etc.) but it’s in that “bullying as a love language” type way and I have never been afraid of him actually mistreating my cats, especially because they clearly adore him. He plays and rough houses with them, he pets them, but he never gets all lovey dovey the way I do with them…. Or so I thought.

I live in a two story townhouse with my bedroom being on the second floor and I always keep my door open so that the cats can go in and out. Yesterday morning I had woken up but not gotten out of bed yet and my two kittens were playing on the landing just outside my bedroom door.

I hear my cousin start to walk up the stairs and I stayed as quiet as possible. I knew he thought I wasn’t home because when I am home he always calls up to me to ask if he can come up (I have given him permission to go in my room when I’m not home to play with my cats).

My door was cracked open about a foot and I see his arm reach, he says “Scoop!” And grabs a kitten. Then I hear about a minute straight of kissy sounds and baby talk.

I’m just quietly watching from my bed, trying not to let out a giggle, when he suddenly stops, slow turns, and makes stunned eye contact with me through the crack in my door. When he realized I saw/heard the whole thing he got embarrassed and said “oh… I uh.. I saw them running around up here and thought I’d come play with them.”

I laughed and said it was totally fine, but he retreated back downstairs to put his tough guy persona back on.

The photo above is one he just sent me having a cuddle session with baby George

Tl;dr: my male roommate pretends to be indifferent about my cats, but secretly baby talks and loves on them when I’m not around"
100,0,It’s the little things. I really needed this today. 
101,0,"When I was in high school, an ex had my childhood teddy bear (cleverly named “Bear” as a peak example of toddler creativity) at their house when we broke up. Instead of returning him, they threw him in the trash. I was heartbroken to lose the teddy bear that I had slept with every night since toddlerhood. It’s been over 20 years since he was thrown out, and as silly as it seems, I never really could move past losing him. I have looked for a replacement over the years, but could never find him. After seeing people find replacement childhood toys and blankets on Reddit, I decided to look again recently. I finally figured out his brand, and found one on eBay! I know he’s not my original, but that face still makes me smile. Welcome home, Bear. 🐻 ❤️ "

My back wasn’t giving me too many problems today and I deep cleaned my bathroom. I feel so accomplished and I want to cry happy tears! I know it’s a really small thing to be so happy about, but I haven’t had many victories recently."

For those wondering, he's always allowed puppy to be near him for snuggling up but has not initiated any play at all since we got the new dog."
116,0,"This is my grandmother, Joan Alexander. She was denied the opportunity to graduate from the University of Maine in the 1950’s. She had done all the coursework, but was forbidden from student teaching because she was pregnant. This year, my aunt (her daughter) reached out to the university. They agreed subsequent life experiences counted for the student teaching, and she graduated in May! 💙

If you search on her name with the word “Maine”, you will find several news articles detailing her story!"

128,0,"I know, you’re thinking what could be funny. I recently was a part of my mommy’s funeral. I went up several times, one particular time there was a bang, something metal fell. My family were looking at me saying omg what did you do?   I’m walking around her casket, looking for anything that may have bent or moved and I found nothing. I turn around and my brother lets me know he put the first bell of mom’s collection in her casket, when I leaned in on it, the bell fell to the bottom of her casket.  Everyone started laughing! Share your funny"

She’s 71 and she broke a femur, an ankle, her pelvis, a patella, an elbow, her collarbone, fractured 3 vertebrae, fractured several ribs, and her right foot was essentially crushed. Her mobility will never be the same, but she’s finally starting to make some progress. I’m so happy to see her regaining some strength ♥️ "

139,0,"So this started just before Christmas. I came into work, and under my computer mouse was 2 gift cards. The next day, there were 2 more. These totalled $300. 

I assumed it was just for Christmas, but I've been getting them steadily, most recent was this week. 

At this point, I've gotten probably $1,000 in gift cards, all for groceries. 

Whoever is doing it does not want me to know it's them. 

I am really grateful - it has helped so much.

141,0,"Full article at Washington Post. Here's an excerpt:

Merryman’s quest began in 2008, he said, while on a lunch break at Lockheed Martin. He likes to get outside for lunch, so he walked along Deep Run, a creek behind his office in Hanover. Merryman had already started doing cleanups with the Patapsco Heritage Greenway, but this day, in particular, felt like an epiphany.

“I saw a washing machine, then I saw a motorcycle chassis — all kinds of stuff. It looked like people had been dumping there for decades,” he said. “I thought, ‘Someone has to clean this stuff up.’”

The dump behind Merryman’s office nagged him, and the second time he visited, he saw more trash but also spotted a bald eagle, his first in Maryland. He’s not saying the bird spoke to him that day, but it felt like something did.

“That time I thought, ‘Well I’ll be the one to clean it up then,’” he recalled.

Merryman had the trash bug before that epiphany, McMillion said. She saw how a submerged shopping cart, mired in muck in Catonsville’s Bull Run, became a white whale for him.

“I had college kids trying to get this thing out, and they couldn’t do it,” she said. “He spent a lot of time on it. He was obsessed.”

Merryman defeated the shopping cart, of course, she said, explaining there was one year when Merryman was responsible for 60 percent of her organization’s trash cleanup totals.

142,0,"My son made a map in the hospital. I decided to turn it into a short D&D adventure we could play during visiting hours.

He told me someone dammed a river and now this house was slowly flooding—so in the game I made a group of mischievous fish monsters responsible (they're trying to flood the house and take it as their own). He really liked it!

It’s a small thing, but being able to turn his imagination into something playable helped both of us feel a little more normal in a hard place."
143,0,"I was having a really tough day today, but then I opened a message from this incredibly kind person and it completely turned things around. The compliments they gave me were so thoughtful and uplifting; I’ve honestly never received anything like that before. It gave my self-image such a huge boost.

We truly need more people like this in the world kindness like that can make such a difference. Even when it’s about something external, kind words can have a powerful impact.

I don’t base my worth on what others think of me, but right now, this made me smile in a way I haven’t all day. I’m not even feeling down anymore. Thank you so much, u/TutuBunBun. 💛
